 This controlled dose titration study with randomized block arrangement
of treatments utilized 64 six-week old crossbred pigs (33 barrows, 31
gilts) which were allotted four per pen on the basis of weight and gender to
16 pens. Infection was accomplished by administering a growth culture
of <i>Serpulina&#160;</i>(formerly <i>Treponema) hyodysenteriae</i>&#160;(strain B 204)
via stomach tube to all pigs. When clinical signs of dysentery (diarrhea,
blood feces) subsequently appeared, medication was begun. Average weight at
the start of test medication was 39.6 pounds.<P>
 The test treatments were tiamulin hydrogen fumarate in feed at 100, 200 and 300 g/ton. 
Control pigs were not medicated. Medication continued for 14 days and was followed by a 21-day 
post-medication observation period.<p>
 The major criteria of effectiveness are listed in Table 4. 1 which presents 
treatment mean values over the 35-day test.<p>

 Eighty crossbred pigs (48 barrows, 32 gilts) were used in this controlled dose
titration study of randomized block design. The pigs were infected by
administering via stomach tube a homogenate of cecal and colon tissues taken
from donor pigs with clinical signs of the disease. When clinical signs
appeared among test pigs, they were allotted to pens on the basis of disease
severity, weight and gender. There were 16 pens of five pigs each with the
overall average weight at the start of medication 50.7 pounds.<p>
 The test treatments were tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at 0 (nonmedicated control), 
100, 200 and 300 g/ton for 14 days followed by a 3-week post-medication observation 
period. Major criteria of effectiveness are listed in Table 4.2 which shows treatment 
mean values for the total 35-day test period.<p>

 <B>c. Analysis of Dose Determination Studies</B><p>
 The Colorado and Nebraska studies were combined and an analysis of variance was
done on the percent pig days with diarrhea by pens for test Days 1 to 14 using
an arcsin square root transformation. For Days 1 to 14 all three dose
levels were significantly different from the control (p&lt;.01). Linear plateau
modeling was done for Days 1 to 14. Two models appeared to be almost equal with
both having significant coefficients and high sq R (.98). The F-value
for residuals were not significant. Thus, the model with fewer parameters was
chosen. This was the linear plateau model III(2) having a plateau at 200
g/ton.<p>
 It was concluded that 200 g/ton is an acceptable dose level of tiamulin
hydrogen fumarate in feed for the treatment of swine dysentery based on the
parameter pig days with diarrhea.<p>

 Sixty crossbred pigs, 30 gilts and 30 barrows, were allotted to replicate pen
groups of five on the basis of gender and weight. Barrows and gilts were penned
separately in this test of randomized block design. Six pens were infected
nonmedicated controls and six pens were treated with tiamulin hydrogen fumarate
at 220 ppm (200 g/ton) in feed for 14 days beginning when clinical signs of swine 
dysentery appeared subsequent to deliberate infection by feeding colon tissues 
from donor pigs from a herd with a natural outbreak of the disease. Average 
initial weight at the start of test feeding was 47.1 pounds (21.4 kg).<p>

Major criteria of effectiveness are listed in Table 4.3 which presents treatment average
values determined over the 14-day test medication period plus a 14-day
post-medication observation period.<p>

Mortality was 20&#37; in the controls and 3.3&#37; in the treated group. This mortality was
moderate for swine dysentery. When mortality was combined across pens by
treatment, a Fisher's Exact test showed that the death rate between the two
groups was significant (p&#61;.05). Percent pig days diarrhea for test Days 8-14
showed that the treatments were significantly different (p&#60;.01) with treatment
means of 13.0&#37; for treated and 94.3&#37; for controls. Bloody feces for the same
period also showed significant treatment differences (p&lt;.01) with means 0.0&#37;
for treated and 47.1&#37; for controls.<p>

No signs of toxicity or adverse reactions to tiamulin were observed in this trial.<P>

It was concluded that feeding tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at 200 g/ton was
effective for treatment of swine dysentery based on the parameters of
mortality, pig days with diarrhea, and pig days with bloody feces.<p>

Eighty crossbred pigs (32 barrows, 48 gilts) from a herd experiencing a natural
outbreak of swine dysentery were used. Swine dysentery associated with
<i>Serpulina&#160;</i>(formerly <i>Treponema) hyodysenteriae&#160;</i>was confirmed
present on the basis of clinical signs and on the basis of gross lesions and
the presence of <i>Serpulina&#160;</i>in colon tissues at necropsy of four
contemporary pigs.<p>

The pigs were allotted five per pen to 16 pens on the basis of clinical signs,
weight and gender. There were two test treatments, tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at 
0 (nonmedicated controls) and 200 g/ton for 14 days followed by a 21-day 
post-medication observation period, in this controlled test of randomized block
design. Average initial weight was 65.2 pounds.<p>

Major criteria of effectiveness are listed in Table 4.4 together with treatment
mean values over the total 35-day test period. Data were evaluated by analyses
of variance with the pen as the experimental unit.<p>

Clinical trial: Forty-eight crossbred pigs, 25 barrows and 23 gilts, were
allotted 6 per pen based on weight and gender. Following a 24-hour fast the
pigs were fed ground colon tissue and contents taken from pigs with clinical
signs of the disease in commercial herds with histories of recent confirmed
outbreaks of swine dysentery. When the majority of pigs subsequently exhibited
clinical signs they were weighed and the test was initiated.  There were four
pens of six pigs as nonmedicated controls and four pens of six pigs fed
tiamulin hydrogen fumarate in feed at 220 ppm (200 g/ton) for 14 days followed
by an additional 14 days post-medication observation period. Average
weight at the start of the test period was 30.8 pounds (14 kg).<p>

The major criteria of effectiveness are listed in Table 4.5. Treatment average
values shown in Table 4.5 are for the total 28-day test period. Data were
analyzed by analyses of variance for a completely random test using the

Mortality was 58.3&#37; in the controls and 4.2&#37; in the treated group. 
This mortality was severe for swine dysentery. When mortality
was combined across pens by treatment, a Fisher's Exact Test showed that
the death rate between the two groups was significant (p&lt;.01).<p>

This study supports the effectiveness of tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at
200 g/ton in treating pigs with swine dysentery based on the parameter of
mortality.<p>

No signs of toxicity or adverse reactions to tiamulin were observed in this
trial.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY</B><p>

<B>a. Pivotal Safety Study for Target Species (1X, 3X, 5X)</B><p>

A subacute toxicity study was conducted at the Fermenta Animal Health 
Company Research Center, 1512 Webster Court, Fort Collins, CO 80524 by S.
Rogers and S. L. Stroh, D.V.M. The purpose of the study was to investigate 
the margin of safety of feeding tiamulin at 200 g/ton to pigs for 14 days.
The study was conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP,
21 CFR Part 58).<p>

Thirty-six male and female crossbred pigs averaging
96.5 lb were used in the trial. Four males and four female pigs were fed
tiamulin at 200 g/ton (1X), 600 g/ton (3X) and 1000 g/ton (5X) for 42 days
or 3 times the recommended duration. Twelve nonmedicated control pigs (7
males, 5 females) were included in the trial.<p>

Clinical observations for signs of toxicity and rectal temperature 
determinations were made twice daily from test Days -2 to 41. Blood, 
urine and fecal samples were collected for examination from each pig 
on test Days 0, 14, 28 and 42.<p>

Hematology examinations included red blood cell count, total white blood cell
count and differential white cell count, platelet count, packed cell volume,
mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin concentration and partial prothrombin time.
Blood serum chemistry examinations included the determination of calcium,
phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chlorine, blood urea nitrogen, total protein,
total and direct bilirubin, albumin, globulin, glucose, amylase, aspartate
amino transferase and creatinine concentrations.<p>

Urinalysis included determination of pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose,
ketone, bilirubin and urobilinogen and examination for sediment and an
evaluation of color and consistency. Fecal analyses included evaluation of
color and consistency, test for occult blood and microscopic examination.<p>

After 42 days on test the pigs were killed and thoroughly examined for gross
lesions. The spleen, heart, liver, kidneys, thyroid and adrenals were weighed.
A total of 36 tissues were collected and placed in fixative for possible
microscopic examination.<p>

Tissues from all pigs fed tiamulin at 1000 g/ton and their corresponding nonmedicated
controls were examined microscopically.<p>

During the 42 day feeding period pigs fed tiamulin at 200, 600 and 
1000 g/ton gained 33&#37;, 25&#37; and 22&#37; more weight; ate 19&#37;, 13&#37; and 
35&#37; more feed daily; and were 10&#37;, 7&#37; and 10&#37; more efficient, 
respectively, than nontreatment control groups. No signs of toxicity or 
adverse reaction to the drug were observed clinically. <p>

Overall group mean values for hematology and for blood serum chemistry values
were generally well within published normal values or not significantly
different from control pig values. No distinct trends with dose level or with
time were found. Urinalysis and fecal analysis found a small number of pigs in
both the nonmedicated and the medicated groups with blood in urine or in feces
periodically. Differences in organ weights between treatments were not large
and no test article-related findings were observed in gross examination of
tissues of all pigs at necropsy or in microscopic examination of the tissues of
pigs fed tiamulin at 1000 g/ton (5X level).<p>

It was concluded that feeding tiamulin at 200 g/ton to pigs for 14 days is
safe.<p>

<B>b. Corroborative Safety Studies</B><p>

1) Additional results of the studies of the safety of administering tiamulin
hydrogen fumarate orally to pigs at various dose levels and for varied
durations are described in FOI summaries to NADA 134-644 and to NADA 139-472
incorporated by reference. In particular, the FOI summary to NADA 139-472
describes the results of a safety trial in which pigs were fed tiamulin at
levels to 200 g/ton for 99 days with no adverse drug related effects
detected.<p>

2)A preliminary (pilot) subacute study was conducted by S. Rogers at the
Fermenta Animal Health Company Research Center, 1512 Webster Court, Fort
Collins, Colorado 80524 to determine if pigs would consume 
feed containing tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at levels up to 1000 
g/ton and if any signs of toxicity would appear within four weeks.<p>

Twelve crossbred pigs averaging 92.6 pounds were allotted to three pens of four on
the basis of weight and gender. Treatments, randomly assigned to pens, were
(1) nonmedicated control, (2) tiamulin at 600 g/ton and (3) tiamulin at
1000 g/ton. The pigs were observed daily for signs of toxicity, adverse
reactions and illness. Individual body weights and the feed consumption of
pen groups were determined weekly for four weeks when the test ended.<p>

Pigs fed tiamulin at 600 g/ton and at 1000 g/ton gained 32&#37; and 21&#37; 
more weight, consumed 26&#37; and 15&#37; more feed and were 4&#37; and 5&#37; more efficient,
respectively, than nonmedicated control pigs over the total 28-day test. No
signs of toxicity or adverse reactions were observed.<p> 

It was concluded that feeding tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at levels up to 1000
g/ton for 28 days did not depress feed consumption and did not result in any
signs of toxicity.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</B><p>

<B>a. Toxicity Tests</B><p>

Short-term toxicity studies in mice, rats, dogs, pigs, chickens and
turkeys as well as a one-year feeding study in dogs, a lifetime feeding
study in mice, a lifetime feeding study in rats, a three-generation
reproduction and teratology study in rats, fertility studies in male and
female rats and a teratology study in rabbits are discussed in detail in
the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644 <p>

<B>b. Safe Concentration of Total Residues</B><p>

The safe concentration of total residues of tiamulin is established at 3.6
ppm in muscle, 10.8 ppm in liver and 14.4 ppm in kidney and fat as 
published in 21 CFR 556.738. The FOI Summary for NADA 134-644 includes a
discussion of the calculations of these values.<p>

<B>c. Total Residue Depletion and Metabolism Studies</B><p>

Results of metabolism studies of tiamulin in rats and the target species
(swine) are found in the FOI summary for NADA 134-644 as well as a
discussion of the major metabolites, selection of the marker residue
(8-alpha-hydroxymutilin) and regulatory (GC) and confirmatory
(GC-MS) methods for the detection of the marker substance in
the target tissue, swine liver.<p>

<B>d. Tolerance for the Marker Residue</B><p>

The established tolerance for the marker residue, 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin,
is 0.4 ppm in swine liver. The basis for selecting this marker and the
tolerance in liver is discussed in the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644.<p>

<B>e. Study Establishing the Withdrawal Period</B><p>

A study was conducted by S. Rogers and S. Stroh, D.V.M., at Fermenta Animal
Health Company Research Center, 1512 Webster Court, Fort Collins, Colorado
80524. The purpose of the study was to determine the depletion of tiamulin in
swine following administration of the antibiotic in feed at 200 g/ton for 14
days to establish a withdrawal time.<p>

Twenty-four crossbred pigs averaging 47 lb were used. Ten males and 10
females were self-fed feed containing tiamulin hydrogen fumarate at 200 g/ton
for  14  days. Four pigs were fed nonmedicated feed. After 
14 days of test drug feeding the medicated feed was withdrawn and
replaced with nonmedicated control feed. At 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours
after the end of medication two males and two females were killed and their
livers excised for analyses of the marker residue, 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin, using
Fermenta's alternate determinative method. Both the original and alternate 
methods are gas chromatography procedures, and the alternate method differs 
from the original in only minor aspects (e.g. a megabore GC column was 
substituted for a packed column, using the same silicone liquid phase, and 
toluene was substituted for benzene). The alternate method was reviewed and 
accepted by FDA. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table 6.1.<p>

PERIOD,</i>&#160; September, 1986. Using a statistical tolerance limit for the 99th
percentile of the population with 95&#37; confidence, a withdrawal time of
7 days was assigned for swine fed 200 g tiamulin hydrogen fumarate/ton for 14
days.<p>

<B>f. Regulatory Method</B><p>

The regulatory assay method for determining 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin, the
tiamulin marker in swine liver involves extraction, derivatization and then
quantitation by gas chromatography (GC). A confirmatory method involves gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In method validation conducted prior
to test sample analyses in this residue depletion study, an overall recovery of
91&#177;4&#37; was obtained from control tissues spiked with 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin at
200, 400 and 800 ppb. The limit of quantitation was 50 ppb.<p>

The regulatory analytical methods for determining 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin in
swine liver are on file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug
Administration, HFV-199, 7500 Standish Place, RockviIIe, Maryland 20855.<p>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and 21 CFR
Part 514 of the implementing regulations. The data demonstrate that tiamulin
Type A medicated article is effective for the treatment of swine dysentery
associated with <i>Serpulina&#160;</i>(formerly <i>Treponema) hyodysenteriae
</i>&#160;when administered in feed for 14 days at a level of 200 grams tiamulin per
ton.<p>

A tolerance for the tiamulin marker residue, 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin, is
established in swine at 0.4 ppm in liver, the target tissue (21 CFR 556.738) to
ensure safe concentrations of total residues of tiamulin of 3.6, 10.8, 14.4 and
14.4 ppm in muscle, liver, kidney, and fat. For a discussion of the tolerance
calculation see the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644.<p>

A withdrawal period of 7 days was calculated from a rate depletion study of
tiamulin residues in swine, following the administration of DENAGARD&#174; Type A
medicated article at a level of 200 g/ton for 14 consecutive days. <p>

Labeling directions are adequate to enable laypersons to appropriately 
diagnose and subsequently use this product to treat swine dysentery associated
with <i>Serpulina&#160;</i>(formerly <i>Treponerna) hyodysenteriae.&#160;</i>DENAGARD&#174;
Type A medicated article is currently approved for over-the-counter (OTC) use in
swine as described in 21 CFR 558.600.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(iii, iv,
v and x)), this is a Category II change. The approval of this change is not
expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new
animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the
safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>

Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Act, this approval for food-producing
animals qualifies for THREE (3) years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because the supplemental application contains reports of new
clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant. The THREE years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the claim
for the treatment of swine dysentery, for which the supplemental application
was approved.<p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>

The basis for the original approval of this NADA was published in 57 FR 19085,
May 4, 1992.<P>

<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>

<b>Tolerance</b> <P>

The tolerance for neomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle,
swine, sheep, and goats was originally established at 0.25 ppm (21 CFR
556.430).  The tolerance is being revised using the new food consumption
factors as described in the FDA/CVM July 1994 publication entitled, "General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing
Animals" (59 FR 37499).  A tolerance of 7.2 ppm is established for residues of
parent neomycin (marker residue) in the kidney (target tissue) of cattle
(except veal calves), swine, sheep, and goats.  A tolerance of 0.15 ppm is
established for neomycin in milk.<P>

<b>Studies Establishing the Withdrawal Period</b><P>

Four separate residue depletion studies were conducted by Colorado Animal
Research Enterprises Inc. (CARE), Fort Collins, Colorado under VMF 5154.  The
purpose of the studies was to determine the depletion of neomycin in swine,
cattle, sheep, or goats following administration of 10 mg neomycin
sulfate/pound body weight/day through drinking water for 14 days.<P>

1.  Ten male and ten female swine weighing approximately 100 lbs each were
administered neomycin sulfate at 10 mg/lb/day for 14 days through the drinking
water.  One male and one female swine served as controls.  The swine were
sacrificed in groups of four (2M, 2F) at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after the last
dose.  Samples of kidney, liver, muscle, and fat were taken and assayed for
residues.  Only kidney had detectable amounts of residues.<P>

on ML estimates of dispersion.  This accommodates values below the limit of
quantitation and above the limit of detection.  Using a statistical tolerance
limit for the 99th percentile of the population with 95% confidence, the
following withdrawal times were calculated for animals treated with 10

<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><P>

The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>&#160;suspension.  The
method is published  by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols",
revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974. <P>

<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>

Neomycin sulfate, codified in 21 CFR Parts 520.1484(c)(3) and 556.430, is
approved for marketing as a soluble powder for the treatment and control of
colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>&#160;
susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle (excluding veal calves), swine,
sheep, and goats.<P>

The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA requesting an increase
in the tolerance satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrate that neomycin sulfate (Neomycin 325 Soluble Powder) at a dose of 10
mg/lb/day for 14 days orally in the drinking water, will produce concentrations
of residues in the kidneys (target tissue) in cattle, swine, sheep, and goats
which are below the accepted tolerance (7.2 ppm) by the following revised
withdrawal periods.  The withdrawal period for cattle is 1 day, sheep is 2
days, and swine and goats is 3 days. <P>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy, this is a Category II change
[21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(x) and (xi)]. The approval of this change, a
recalculation of the tolerance, is not expected to have any adverse effect on
the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.  The change in tolerance
allows for a decrease in the withdrawal period.  Accordingly, this approval
did not require a reevaluation of the safety or effectiveness data in the
parent application.<P>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food , Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the application does not contain reports of new clinical or
field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) or new
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

4. 	EFFECTIVENESS:  The drug was the subject of National Academy of	Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11647).  The Academy evaluated these products as  probably effective for growth promotion and feed efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline.<p>

The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the
preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6) effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage. <p>

The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues.,  July 21, 1970).  FDA proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 46-699 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness.
That review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated April 20, 1992, in which
the agency stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness
only for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to
chlortetracycline pre-mixes in chickens, turkeys, cattle, sheep and swine.<p>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<p>

1. Appropriate oral doses for all the allowable species and claims based on
milligrams per unit of body weight or grams per ton are on the current
labels.<p>

2. Claims pertaining to egg production and hatchablilty have been deleted from the labels.<p>
	
3. Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
approriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride.  Disease claims which were not so qualified have been
deleted.<p>

4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<p>

5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease signs.<p>

6.	Claims for growth promotion or stimulation have been removed.  Allowable
claims are for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed effieciency.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B> <p>
 No further safety data are required.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B> <p>
 The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.  FDA's
approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.  The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at 21 CFR 556.150.<p>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the
Act and demonstrates that CTC Type A Medicated Article when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications.
The approval provides for use of CTC Type A Medicated Article for the control
and treatment of specific diseases in swine, cattle, chickens,turkeys, and
sheep.<p>

The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlotetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER </b>of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the paragraphs above.  The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<p>

When NADA 46-699 was reviewed under NAS/NRC/DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.  Other
Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Articles for use in food-producing animals
are also currently on the market as over-the-counter products.  Therefore, the
Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-the-counter marketing status.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category ll change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<p>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><P> 
(This supplemental NADA (130-736) provides for a
change in treatment regimen
from a ten-week feeding period to a continuous feeding for growing
turkeys.)<P>
<b>Supplement Approved:</b> March 23, 1990<P>
 <b>II. Indications for Use:</b><P>
For the prevention of coccidiosis in growing turkeys caused by <i>Eimeria

* One turkey died prior to start of study.

</pre>

    A turkey ration with these monensin treatments was provided <i>ad libitum</i>&#160;
during the four-week treatment period.<P>
    Birds were observed twice daily for any changes in general physical condition
or behavior during the study. Body weight, feed consumption, and feed
conversion data were collected and analyzed. Daily mortality was recorded.  A
gross post-mortem examination was conducted on all birds that died or were
killed <i>in extremis</i>&#160; during the study, as well as five/sex/dose
randomly-preselected birds from each replicate killed for necropsy at study
termination. Findings were recorded and tabulated.<P>
    There was a dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of physical
signs of toxicity at the 180 and 450 g/ton monensin treatment levels.
Recumbency and dyspnea were the most consistent clinical signs observed.
Anorexia was evident from the decreased food consumption values from the 180
and 450 g/ton dose groups. Body weight gain and feed efficiency were
depressed at these levels. Mortality increased in  a dose-related manner.
The average mortality rates for the 0, 90, 180, and 450 g/ton treatment groups
were 0, 0.5, 23, and 65%, respectively. One turkey in the 90 g/ton group
showed dyspnea and recumbency during the second week of the study, but
subsequently was apparently normal and had no gross lesions on necropsy at the
end of the  study. Gross post-mortem lesions were nonspecific. The incidence
of pallor in cardiac and skeletal muscles was present at all monensin levels
and appeared to increase with increasing doses of monensin levels and appeared
to  increase with increasing doses of monensin in the feed.<P>
    In conclusion, mature turkeys continuously fed a complete ration containing
180 and 450 g monensin/ton of feed for one month had increased mortality.
Clinical signs of anorexia, dyspnea, and recumbency, together with  pallor of
cardiac and skeletal muscles, also increased in incidence and severity.
Dose-related decreases in body weight gain, feed consumption, and feed
consumption, and feed efficiency occurred. These compound-related effects
were restricted to the exaggerated dose levels of 180 and 450 g/ton, equivalent
to 198 and 495 ppm monensin, respectively. The data from this study, coupled
with that shown in the referenced FOI Summary, show that monensin at 90 g/ton
can be safely fed to growing turkeys with the restriction of "do not feed to
mature turkeys," as provided by product labeling.<P>

<b>B. Corroborative Study</b><P>
    Dr. Malcolm Reid, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, in a
noncontrolled study, dosed monensin-naive turkeys of various ages above ten
weeks with the range of monensin dosages approved for coccidiosis prevention
in turkeys up to ten weeks of age.<P>
    
    To ensure consumption, these monensin-naive turkeys were starved for 24
hours, fed the appropriate monensin concentration for two or three weeks,
starved 36 hours, and again fed monensin for another two to three weeks.<P>
    In this series of three experiments with turkeys from 14 to 70 weeks of age
fed either 54 or 90 grams monensin per ton of feed, no mortality or morbidity
occurred. Data are shown in Table 1.<P>

<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><P>
Human safety data may be found in the FOI Summary made available following
initial approval of NADA 130-736 on April 24, 1987, as published in the
<i>Federal Register</i>&#160; (Vol. 52, No. 83, pg. 15718) April 30, 1987.<P>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the act and demonstrate that COBAN (monensin),
when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective.<P>
Coban (monensin), was previously approved in chickens and turkeys with a
ten-week feeding period (21CFR558.355).  This supplemental provides for a
change in the dosing regimen from the 10 week feeding period to growing
turkeys.  In support of the safe use of Coban in growing turkeys, the firm
submitted a pivotal study and a corroborative study which demonstrated the drug
is safe for use in growing turkeys.  No additional efficacy are necessary.
Data generated in turkeys up to 10 weeks of age are sufficient to approve Coban
in growing turkeys.<P>
Proper use by non-veterinarians can be expected because poultry producers
routinely use medicated feed containing an animal drug for the prevention of
coccidiosis in growing turkeys.  Directions are clearly written and there is
reasonable certainty that the conditions for use, including mixing directions,
on the label can and will be followed by the producer.  The Agency has
concluded that this product can be approved for over-the-counter use.<P>
Approval of this supplemental NADA will not significantly increase human
exposure to residues of the drug in edible tissues because the product is
already regulated for use in turkeys under 21CFR558.355.  Because total
monensin residues will not exceed the safe concentration at zero withdrawal,
establishing a tolerance for a marker residue in a target tissue is not
necessary.<P>

   is double scored for accurate dosing. 

</pre>
The 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) dose administered twice daily should be continued
for 2-3 days beyond the cessation of clinical signs to a maximum of 10 days. If
no improvement is seen within five days, the diagnosis should be re-evaluated
and a different course of therapy considered. <p>

<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><p>
Well-controlled studies which demonstrated the effectiveness of Baytril&#174;
(enrofloxacin) Antibacterial Tablets are discussed in detail in the FOI Summary

<b>V. Animal Safety:</b><p>
The safety of Baytril&#174; (enrofloxacin) Antibacterial Tablets was demonstrated
in a series of well-controlled studies which are described in detail in the FOI
for the original NADA, 54 FR 3444:  January 24, 1989.<p>
A seventh pivotal study has been conducted which demonstrates the safety of
Baytril Antibacterial Tablets in breeding female dogs.<p>
   <B> Study in Female Breeding Dogs (Safety Evaluation for Bay Vp 2674 in Female
Breeding Dogs).</b><p>
    A. Stuke and J. Magerkurth of Topeka, Kansas conducted a reproductive safety
study in 15 adult female Beagle     breed dogs with the 22.7 mg enrofloxacin
tablet.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate libido and safety in     female
breeding dogs following multiple treatments with the approved market tablet
formulation.  Before    treatment the dogs were randomly assigned to one of 3
groups.  Four dogs served as the non-treated controls, 5    received treatments
orally of 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) twice daily for a total of 5 mg/kg (2.27
mg/lb) per day and  6 were treated orally with 7.5 mg/kg (3.40 mg/lb) twice
daily for a total of 15 mg/kg (6.80 mg/lb) per day.     Each female received
treatments for 10 consecutive days at each of 4 stages of reproduction (prior
to breeding,    early pregnancy, late pregnancy and lactation).  Parameters
monitored included number of pups born alive,   average number of pups born
alive per female, number of dead pups at birth, average number of dead pups per
female, verage body weight (birth, 2 and 4 weeks of age), average daily body
weight gain, number of pups alive   at 2 and 4 weeks and average number of pups
alive at 4 weeks of age per female.  Blinding was not necessary     since the
monitored parameters could be measured by objective means.  Results of this
study (Groups 1,2,3) and    the 1987 historical control data for the kennel are
presented in Table I.<p>

*  Data not available 
** Parameter evaluated at 6 Weeks for Historical Controls 

As shown in the table all the parameters measured were within normal
anticipated ranges and are comparable to the historical control results.

</pre>
An indepth statistical analysis was not essential.  The study results
were stated as simple averages to allow accurate comparison to the historical
control data.<p>
The study concluded that no adverse effects occurred upon reproductive
parameters nor were there any clinical signs of toxicosis when female breeding
dogs are treated with enrofloxacin tablets at doses as high as 3 times the
labeled rate for 10 consecutive days at 4 critical stages of
reproduction:  30 to 0 days prior to breeding, early pregnancy (between the
10th and 30th days), late pregnancy (between the 40th and 60th days) and during
lactation (the first 28 days).  This conclusion is further verified when the
historical control reproductive data from the colony are used as comparison.<p>
This study was conducted per Good Laboratory Practice Regulations.<p>
 
 
<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>A. Human Food Safety</b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is labeled for use in dogs,
which are nonsfood animals.<p>
<b>B. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><p>The
labeling contains an adequate warning statement:<p> "WARNING:  Keep out of
reach of children."<p>

<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514111 of the implementing regulation. It
demonstrates that enrofloxacin is safe and effective when used in accordance
with labeling directions for treatment of the following bacterial infections in
dogs.<p>
    Dermal infections (wounds and abscesses) caused by susceptible strains of
<i>Escherichia coli </i>, <i>Klebsiella  pneumoniae </i>, <i>Proteus
mirabilis</i>&#160; and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>.<p>
    Respiratory infections (pneumonia, tonsilitis, rhinitis) caused by susceptible
strains of <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i>&#160; and   <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>.<p>
    Urinary tract infections (cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of
<i>Escherichia coli </i>, <i>Proteus</i> <i>mirabilis</i>&#160; and    <i>Staphylococcus
aureus </i>. <p>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is a
Category II change. This supplement provides for the contraindication against
use in breeding female dogs.  The approval of the supplemental application has
no adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug, for
previously approved use.  Accordingly, this approval did not required a
re-evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent  application.
<p>
A differential diagnosis and monitoring of a patient's progress require the
professional expertise of a veterinarian in breeding females as well as other
dogs.  Therefore, the labeling for this product should contain the veterinary
prescription legend.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this Supplemental New Animal Drug Application
qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity, because a new study was
required for its approval. <p>

caution statement as follows: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by
or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.<p>

<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
This supplemental application provides for a change in the approved
dosage of 0.5 mg/lb body weight to a range of 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg ceftiofur
sodium/lb of body weight.<p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> April 5, 1990<p>
<b>II. INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b><p>
Naxcel Sterile Powder is indicated for treatment of bovine respiratory disease
(shipping fever, pneumonia).<p>
<b>III. DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</b> <p>
Naxcel Sterile Powder is available in two package sizes:  1 gram
and 4 gram vials.<p>
Reconstituted product should be used within 12 hours if stored at
controlled room temperature 15&#176;-30&#176;C
(59&#176;-86&#176;F) or within 5
days if stored in a refrigerator.<p>
<b>1 gram vial</b><p> Reconstitute with 20 ml Sterile Water for Injection
or with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection.  Each ml of the
resulting solution contains ceftiofur sodium equivalent to 50 mg
ceftiofur.<p>
<b>4 gram vial</b><p> Reconstitute with 80 ml Sterile Water for Injection
or with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection.  Each ml of the
resulting solution contains ceftiofur sodium equivalent to 50 mg
ceftiofur.<p>
Naxcel Sterile Solution should be administered by intramuscular
injection to cattle at the dosage of 0.5 mg ceftiofur per pound of
body weight (1 ml reconstituted sterile solution per 100 lb body
weight).  Treatment should be repeated every 24 hours for a total
of three treatments.  Additional treatments may be given on days
four and five for animals which do not show a satisfactory
response (not recovered) after the first three treatments.<p>
<b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS:<p>
A. Pivotal Study</b><p>
A seven location clinical trial was conducted.  This included 629 cattle with
spontaneously occurring disease and three treatment groups.  These were 1) non-medicated 
control, 2) ceftiofur at 0.5 mg/lb and 3) ceftiofur at 1.0 mg/lb body
weight.  Placebo and ceftiofur treatments were administered by intramuscular
injection once per day for three or five days.  Results indicated that each of
the two ceftiofur doses (0.5 and 1.0 mg/lb) was significantly better than
placebo.  The two ceftiofur dosed groups provided similar responses.<p>

<b>(c) General Design</b><ul><p>
<li>Purpose of this multi-location study was to determine the efficacy of ceftiofur
sodium at 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg/lb body weight given intramuscularly for three to
five days for the treatment of BRD under typical feedlot conditions.<p>
<li>Animals:<p>
-629 head of feedlot cattle ranging in weight from 281 to 562 lbs.<br>
-calves ranged from six to 10 mos. in age<br>
-typical feedlot animals, mixed steers and bulls<br>
-209 head per treatment group<p>
<li>Control was a non-drug sterile diluent administered intramuscularly at 8
ml/animal for three consecutive days.<p>
<li>Diagnosis:  BRD was diagnosed by an elevated body temperature (104.5&#176;F or

<li>Dosage Form:  Dosage form was an aqueous solution containing 50 mg ceftiofur
equivalents per ml.<p>
<li>Route of Administration:  Intramuscular.<p>
<li>Dose:  Control was the sterile vehicle (Bacteriostatic Water for Injection)

intramuscularly either at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/lb body weight three or five
consecutive days.  On day four of the trials, the investigators evaluated the
condition of all surviving animals and determined whether or not they were
recovered.  If they were deemed "recovered", no further medication was given.
If they were judged "not recovered" two more daily treatments were administered
on days four and five.  This procedure also included placebos.<p>

<b>V.ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Summary</b><p>
Three specifically designed Target Animal (cattle) Safety Studies were
conducted to address the tolerance to and safety of ceftiofur. Additionally, a
clinical efficacy trial was conducted wherein target animal safety was also
determined.  Based on results of these seven trials, ceftiofur is safe when
administered intramuscularly at doses up to 1.0 mg ceftiofur per lb body weight
daily for five days.  Local pain reaction to the injection is deemed transient
and not detrimental to safety of an already sick animal.<p>
<b>A. Pivotal Studies</b><p>
<b>1. Safety/Toxicity Study</b><p>
<b>(a) Type of Study</b><p>
This was a five day study in cattle where drug was administered at daily doses
of 0, 1 mg lb, 3 mg/lb, or 5 mg/lb body weight to determine the pharmacologic
and toxicologic effects of ceftiofur following the intramuscular injection.<p>

<b>(c) General Design</b><ul><p>
<li>Purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacologic and toxicologic
effects of ceftiofur following the intramuscular injection in the bovine.
Potential target organs and tissues were to be identified through clinical
observations, histologic examination, hematology and serum chemistries.  Red
blood cell counts, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, serum creatinine and blood
urea nitrogen values were<br>
also parameters of interest.  Finally, injection site irritation was evaluated
by use of histopathology and serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).<p>
<li>Animals<p>
-crossbred beef type steers<br>
-body weight range 370-450 lb<br>
-20 animals for four treatment groups<p>
<li>Control was a non drug containing sterile diluent administered intramuscularly
daily at 5 ml/100 lb body weight.<p>
<li>Dosage Form - sterile aqueous solution containing 100 mg drug/ml.<p>
<li>Dosage Used - 0, 1, 3 or 5 mg/lb body (e.g., 1, 3, or 5 ml sterile solution containing 100
mg/ml per 100 lbs.  Controls received 5 ml per 100 lb body weight.<p>
<li>Route of Administration - intramuscular<p>
<li>Test Duration - 7 days<p>
<li>Pertinent Parameters Measured<p>
Clinical observations, hematologic and serum chemistry measurements, body
weight changes, organ weights and gross and microscopic evaluations were used
to assess the potential toxicity in the steers.</ul><p>
<b>(d) Results</b><ul><p>
<li>Clinical Observations<p>  No clinical signs of toxicity or illness were observed
during this study.  Occasionally a steer would react to the injection of the
compound by vocalizing and/or exhibiting a limp on the injected rear leg for
the first few strides out of the squeeze chute.  The limp was always transient
and was no longer noticeable by the time the steer returned to its pen.<p>
<li>Hematology<p>  Statistical analysis of the data identified a slight but
significant decrease in hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (HGT) values when the
high dose animals were compared to controls. However, the pretest hematology
data contained a comparable statistically significant difference In hematocrit
values between the control and high dose group.  It should also be noted that
the hematocrit and hemoglobin values decreased similarly in all groups,
including the untreated controls, over the duration of the study. All mean
hematologic values were within the normal biologic range for the bovine, and
since there was no significant decrease in red blood cell numbers, the
hematologic differences noted were not attributed to treatment.<p>
<li>Serum Chemistries<p>  Significantly elevated CPK values (P &#190; .05) were
observed in the high dose animals when compared to the controls. The CPK values
also increased in the 3 mg/lb group but were not statistically different from
the control value.  In contrast, the untreated control and 1 mg/lb group CPK
values were similar.  The elevated CPK values correlated with the muscle damage
at the injection site which was observed histopathologically.<p>
There were no other treatment related differences between treated and controls
regarding clinical chemistry measurements.<p>
<li>Body Weights<p>  The five day treatment regimen with U 64,279 had no significant
effect on body weight in any of the groups.<p>
<li>Organ Weights<p>  There were no significant differences between control and any
of the dose groups for any of the five organs weighed.<p>
<li>Gross and Histologic Observations<p>
The only gross change associated with the use of this drug was the focal areas
of hemorrhage and/or muscle discoloration at the injection sites.  Occasional,
focal lung lesions were observed, but the incidence was uniformly distributed
among the treatment groups.<p>
Drug-related histopathologic changes were confined to the skeletal muscle at
the injection sites.  There appeared to be greater muscle fiber degeneration
and localized inflammation at the highest dose. Localized edema, hemorrhage,
mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration and myofibril degeneration and
mineralization were observed at the injection sites, leading to the morphologic
diagnosis of mild to severe subacute necrotizing myositis.  However, this study
was not designed to correlate sequential histopathologic changes in the
intramuscular injection sites with time.<p>
Two steers in the 5 mg/lb group had evidence of a mild abomasitis. One lesion
was composed of a mild infiltrate of eosinophils, plasma cells and lymphocytes
and may have been a response to a parasite or a piece of plant material that
might have become lodged in that area of the abomasum.  The other lesion was a
focal lymphoid reaction that was probably triggered by a local irritation.  The
findings of abomasitis appeared to be unrelated tissue changes with no evidence
of being an effect of treatment.<p>
Other histopathologic findings were seen with similar frequencies in all dose
groups and were not attributable to treatment.</ul><p>

The hypothesis of no treatment effect associated with the measurements of most
interest, RBC count, Hgb, PCV, BUN and serum creatinine, was tested at the .10
level of significance.  Planned contrasts of dose groups with control were one-sided 
tests at the .10 level of significance, since only increases in BUN and
serum creatinine and decreases In RBC count, Hgb, and PCV were of concern.  The
hypothesis of no treatment effect associated with the remainder of the
variables was tested at the .05 level.  Planned contrasts of dose groups with
control were two sided at the .05 level.<p>
Organ weights were also analyzed using least squares analysis of variance.<p>
The histopathologic data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test at the .10
level of significance.<p>
<b>(f) Conclusions</b><p>
No systemic drug related effects were detected following Intramuscular
administration of aqueous U 64,279 at dosages of 1, 3 and 5 mg/lb of body
weight for 5 days, as was evidenced by the various parameters that were
monitored during this study.<p>
Gross and microscopic tissue changes were confined to localized areas of muscle
damage at the injection site.  This lesion was most pronounced at the highest
dose tested (5 mg/lb) which correlated well with the only significantly
elevated (P &#190; .05) CPK value.<p>

<b>2.   Five Day Tolerance Study in Feeder Calves<p>

<b>(c) General Design</b><ul><p>
<li>Purpose of this tolerance study was to determine the pharmacotoxic effects of
formulated freeze-dried ceftiofur following intramuscular injection at an
exaggerated daily dosage of 25X the highest labeled dose (1.0 mg/lb body
weight) for five consecutive days.<p>
<li>Animals<p>
-crossbred beef type animals (steers).<br>
-starting weight ranged from 182-316 kg and age ranged from 6-10 months<br> 
-eight animals total, four used as
controls and four given 25X drug treatment<p>
<li>Control was bacteriostatic water for injection (vehicle used as diluent for
making sterile solution from the ceftiofur sterile powder) 50 ml per 100 lb
body weight.<p>
<li>Control and treatment each administered intramuscularly.<p>
<li>Dose of 25 mg/lb body weight given in a 50 mg/ml formulation or 50 ml per 100

<li>Test period was 15 days, first five as daily treatments of either 25 mg/lb or
vehicle.<p>
<li>Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>
Toxicological evaluation was predicated on clinical signs including body weight
changes, 6 hematological and 17 clinical chemistry measurements, and gross
pathologic observations.  Tests of statistical significance were made at the P
&lt; 0.05 level.</ul><p>
<b>(d) Results</b><p>
All of the calves survived.  Formulated ceftiofur did not cause any overt signs
of toxicity during the five day dosing period or during the 10 day post
treatment observation interval.  The only changes were the significant
elevations in aspartate transaminase (AST) and in creatinine phosphokinase
(CPK) in both vehicle and drug treated animals on study day five relative to
pretreatment baseline values. These AST and CPK values returned to baseline by
day 15 of the study.  These transient elevations depict local muscle irritation
associated with the formulated drug and the vehicle <i>per se </i>.<p>
<b>(e) Statistical Analyses</b><p>
The hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters were analyzed by the BMDP
repeated measure routine to test the hypothesis that there is no difference
between the means of dose groups.  The adjustments were made for the initial
values of the parameters (covariate). Tests of statistical significance were
made at the 0.05 level.<p>
A time by treatment t-test supported general findings of the repeated measures
analysis.<p>
<b>(f) Conclusions</b><p>
In conclusion, formulated ceftiofur diluted in Bacteriostatic Water for
Injection, USP with Benzyl Alcohol 0.945&#37; w/v was well tolerated in feeder
calves at 25 times the highest recommended dosage of 1.0 mg/lb/day (25
mg/lb/day) for 5 consecutive days.  Results showed that formulated ceftiofur
administered intramuscularly had no systemic toxic effects.  Local effects of
muscle irritation were detected after the last dose (5 consecutive daily
doses) as evidenced by significant elevated AST and CPK values.  However, these
transient elevated values returned to baseline values nine days post
treatment.<p>

<b>(e) Statistical Evaluation</b><p>
Data for each sex were analyzed separately.  The body weight was analyzed by
BMDP repeated measures routine to test the following null hypothesis:  (i)
there is no difference between the means of dose groups, (ii) the dose groups
behave the same over time.  The organ weight, ratio organ weight to body
weight, blood chemistry and hematology variables were analyzed by one way
analysis of variance. Whenever the analysis indicated a dose difference, a
Dunnett's t-test was used to compare each active group to the control group.
All tests of statistical significance were made at P&#60;0.05 level.<p>
<b>(f) Conclusions</b><p>
Formulated ceftiofur is safe when injected intramuscularly into cattle.  The
formulation is deemed to be a slight muscle irritant.<p>

<li>Statistical Analysis<p>
The following parameters were examined for significant differences between
treated and control groups:<ul><p>
<li>Body Weight             
<li>Urine Measurements 
<li>Hemogram Measurements     
<li>Organ Weights <p>

Data for each sex were analyzed separately.  Treatment group differences were
analyzed using analysis of variance on raw data in conjunction with analysis of
variance on ranks of data. For statistically significant variables, treatment
groups were compared to the vehicle control using the Least Significant
Difference method.  Tests of statistical significance were made at the 0.05
level.<p>
Statistical analysis was conducted on the histopathological findings using the
following method:<p>
Data for each sex were analyzed separately.  The program used contains methods
for the analysis of unadjusted proportions as well as the life table related
techniques of Tarone (1975), Cox (1972) and Breslow (1970) for analysis of
lesion incidence.<p>
For the unadjusted analysis, an exact test for trend was used to test for an
increase (or decrease) in lesion incidence as the dosage administered
increased.  Additionally, Fisher's exact test was used to compare the
proportion exhibiting a particular lesion in each treated group to the
proportion exhibiting that same lesion in the vehicle control group. Both tests
were two-tailed, using the P value obtained by doubling the one-tailed
probability.<p>
Similarly, for the adjusted analysis, tests for trend and treatment groups to
vehicle control group comparisons were conducted on the time adjusted
proportions.</ul><p>
<li>Conclusions<p> Ceftiofur sodium, administered orally to rats for 30 days, was
markedly toxic at 6,000 mg/kg, moderately toxic at 3,000 mg/kg and minimally
toxic at 1,500 mg/kg. The target organ was the gastrointestinal tract as
evidenced by the clinical signs of diarrhea, distended abdomen, and hardened
stomach contents, and grossly by the formation of stomach concretions of the
drug food mixture at 3,000 mg/kg or greater.</ul><p>

<b>3. 90 Day Oral Toxicity Study in Rats</b><ul><p>

<li>Termination Date:  March 20, 1985<p>
<li>Study Director:  T. J. Kakuk<p>
<li>Location of Study:  The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo MI<p>
<li>Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:  ceftiofur sodium oral solution<p>
<li>Species and Strain:  Sprague-Dawley Rats<p>
<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group:  20 M and 20 F<p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:   0, 30, 100, 300, 1,000 and 3,000
mg/kg body weight for 90 or 91 days.<p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration:  oral intragastric intubation<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<p> Parameters utilized to assess toxicity included clinical
signs, weekly body weight and food consumption, body weight gains, hematologic,
clinical chemistry and urinalysis measurements, selected organ weights, and
gross and microscopic evaluation.  Tests of statistical significance on the
parameters denoting toxicity per sex per group were made at the .05 level.<p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> The target organ was the gastrointestinal tract
as evidenced by the clinical signs of diarrhea and hardened stomach contents
and grossly by a dose-related increase in stomach content weights at 300
mg/kg/day or greater.  In males and females at 3,000 mg/kg/day, the incidence
of diarrhea was - 5 to 83&#37; and the incidence of hardened stomach contents
 was 86 to 100&#37;. At 1,000 mg/kg/day diarrhea occurred at an 
 incidence of 6 to 42&#37; in males and females
and there was a 5&#37; incidence of hardened stomach contents for the males. Only
transient diarrhea (incidence of 5 to 11&#37;) occurred in males at 300 mg/kg/day
and in females at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day.  This transient diarrhea did not occur
in females at 300 mg/kg/day.<p>
At 3,000 mg/kg/day there was formation of gastric concretions of the drug-food
mixture at an incidence of 83&#37;.  These concretions in the stomach could not
pass through the pylorus ("mechanical toxicity"), which led to poor or impaired
nutritional status and secondary effects of suppressed body weight gain (-36&#37;)
in the males only, gastric erosions and/or ulcers, thickening of the gastric
ridge (males only), and death of 10&#37; (4/40) of the rats after 9 to 91 days of
treatment.  The impaired or poor nutritional condition at 3,000 mg/kg/day was
also associated with decreased serum glucose values, electrolyte imbalance,
sparseness of fat deposition in the abdominal cavity, and, microscopically, by
the lack of hepatocellular glycogen deposition and atrophy of the germinal
centers of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus.  The impaired nutrition and
lowered glucose values at 3,000 mg/kg/day, along with a significant increase in
food consumption and significant changes in urinary ketones (increase) and pH
(decrease) at both 1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg/day, suggest a deficiency in
carbohydrate metabolism at 1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg/day. In addition, the lowered
urinary pH at 100 mg/kg/day or greater probably reflected the excretion of the
compound or its metabolites, including furoic acid.  Hence, the lowered pH at
100 mg/kg/day, without any other significant changes, suggested that the
compound was being metabolized and excreted as acidic metabolites.<p>
Additionally, based on microscopic findings, the compound caused colitis at an
incidence of 25&#37; for males at 1,000 mg/kg/day or greater and in females at an
incidence of 10&#37;, 30&#37; and 15&#37; at 300, 1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg/day, respectively.
Also, cecitis and/or ileitis occurred at an incidence of 10&#37; (females) to 20&#37;
(males) at 3,000 mg/kg/day.  Colitis, cecitis, and ileitis were probably
associated with the changes in bacterial flora in the gut produced by the
antibiotic properties of ceftiofur sodium.  Males at 300 mg/kg/day or greater
had an inflammatory response (mononuclear cells) located in the renal
corticomedullary junction.  This change may have been related to the compound
favoring the formation of a possible enterotoxin In the gut of these animals.
The acid urine (lowered pH) associated with the metabolism of ceftiofur
apparently resulted in a significant increase in nephrocalcinosis for females
only given ceftiofur sodium at 3,000 mg/kg/day.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level: 30 mg/kg<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<p>
<li>Statistical Evaluation: The following parameters were examined for significant
differences between treated and control groups:<ul><p>
<li>Body Weight                     
<li>Urine Measurements 
<li>Food Consumption                
<li>Organ Weights 
<li>Hemogram Measurements 
<li>Histopathologic Findings 
<li>Clinical Chemistry Measurements<p>
<li>Statistical Method: <P> Data for each sex were analyzed separately. 
Treatment group differences were analyzed using analysis of variance on raw
data in conjunction with analysis of variance on ranks of data (Conover and
Iman, 1981).  For statistically significant variables, treatment groups were
compared to the vehicle control using the Least Significant Difference method.
Tests of statistical significance were made at the 0.05 level.<p>
Statistical analysis was conducted on the histopathological findings using the
following method:<p>
The computer program of Thomas, Breslow and Gart (1977) was used to analyze the
data.  This program contains methods for the analysis of unadjusted proportions
as well as the life table related techniques of Tarone (1975), Cox (1972), and
Breslow (1970) for analysis of lesion incidence.<p>
For the unadjusted analysis, an exact test for trend was used to test for an
increase in lesion incidence as the dosage administered increased.
Additionally, Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion exhibiting
a particular lesion in each treated group to the proportion exhibiting that
same lesion in the vehicle control group.<p>
Similarly, for the adjusted analysis, tests for trend and treatment groups to
vehicle control group comparisons were conducted on the time adjusted
proportions.</ul><p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Based on the results, the NOEL was 30 mg ceftiofur sodium per kg of
body weight for 90 days.  Also, the results indicated that ceftiofur
administered orally to the rats for 90 days was markedly toxic at 3,000
mg/kg/day, moderately toxic at 1,000 mg/kg/day and minimally toxic at 300
mg/kg/day.</ul></UL><p>

<li>Species and Strain: Sprague-Dawley Rats<p>
<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group: - 0 M and - 0 F per group<p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:  0, 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg/day.  Males
dosed 70 days and females 14 days prior to the breeding stage.<p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration: via gavage<p>
<li>Parameters Tested <P>Males (4-47 days of age) were dosed daily via gavage
for 70 days and females (5-59 days of age) were dosed daily via gavage
for 14 days prior to the cohabitation of FO breeding pairs (1 male and 1
female per cage); daily dosing of males and females was continued throughout
the study.  Females were singly housed on the day sperm were found in the
vaginal lavage or at the end of the 21-day cohabitation period. On the day a
litter was cast (pnd 0), the following reproductive parameters were recorded:
(1) day of delivery and length of gestation for each dam, (2) the number of
live or dead pups in each litter, and (3) the sex and clinical condition of
each live pup. The body weight of each live pup was recorded on pnd 0, 4, and
21.  On pnd 4, live litters were randomly culled to a maximum size of 10 pups
per litter. Postnatal viability of Fl pups was evaluated on pnd 0, during the
perinatal period (days 0-4) and during the remainder of lactation (days 4-21).
On pnd 21 (day of weaning), 30 male and 30 female pups per group were randomly
selected, orally dosed at the prescribed levels and designated for subsequent
use of Fl breeders. All remaining Fl pups were sacrificed and necropsied and
observations were recorded. Following weaning of F1 litters, F0 rats were
sacrificed (79th day of exposure for females; 136th day of exposure for males);
each F0 rat was evaluated at necropsy and reproductive organs, gross lesions
and/or masses from the control and high-dose
groups were evaluated histopathologically.  In addition, histopathologic
evaluation was performed on reproductive organs, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys,
adrenals or gross lesions and/or masses of animals that died or were moribund
during the course of the study.<p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Body weight gain (g) for males was significantly
suppressed in a dose-related manner throughout the study (weeks 0-2,
2-6, 6-10, 10-14, 14-18 and 18-necropsy).
 The effect of ceftiofur upon male body weight gain varied in severity during
different phases of the study, suggesting a possible interaction of treatment
with length of exposure and/or growth rate during development.  Weight gain
during the first 2 weeks of exposure was suppressed in the mid and high dose
groups.  All ceftiofur treated groups were below controls for body weight gain
(g) and percent body weight gain for the treatment period as a whole (weeks
0-necropsy).  Thus, potential effects of ceftiofur on male reproductive
capacity were evaluated within a dose range which produced a statistically
significant suppression in male body weight gain.<p>

Female body weight gain was not affected during the first 2 weeks of exposure
to ceftiofur (i.e., prior to cohabitation). For confirmed-mated females with
litters, body weight gain was significantly suppressed for all ceftiofur-exposed 
groups during gestational days (gd) 16-20,
and weight gain during gestation (days 0-20) was significantly suppressed
at the high dose.  Body weight gain for females with litters was significantly
increased during the first 2 weeks of lactation at the mid and high doses,
but was not affected during the third and final week of lactation or for the
lactation period as a whole.  Thus, female body weight gain was not affected
prior to breeding, but dose-related
changes in body weight gain were observed during gestation and lactation.<p>
No dose-dependent adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance were
associated with exposure to ceftiofur.  Ceftiofur-treated groups were similar
to controls for the following endpoints: (1) the proportion of cohabited
females with confirmed mating, (2) the proportion of mated females with
confirmed pregnancies, (3) the proportion of confirmed pregnancies producing
live litters, (4) the length of gestation in confirmed pregnant females, (5)
the number of live pups per litter on pnd 0, 4 or 21, and (6) the proportion of
live male pups on pnd 0 or 4.  Postnatal viability of pups in ceftiofur-treated
groups was equivalent to controls on pnd 0, and for pnd 4-21.
 During the perinatal period (pnd 0-4),
100&#37; of pups in the high-dose group survived, thus contributing to a
statistically significant trend toward increased survival; this statistical
effect appears to lack biological relevance since survival in all groups was
high (avg. &#37; viable pups per litter ranging from 97.57-100&#37;),
and since the relevant statistical tests are not optimized when zero variance
is observed In any dose group.  Live pup body weight per litter was not
affected by ceftiofur exposure on pnd 0 or 4; on pnd 21, the low dose group
exhibited a significant suppression in body weight relative to the control
group (-7.3&#37;),
but the absence of an effect at higher exposure levels suggests that this was
not a treatment related effect.<p>
Grossly, enlargement of the cecum occurred at an incidence of 59 to 97&#37; in the
treated groups compared to 0&#37; in the control.  In survivors, no compound
related microscopic lesions were observed in the reproductive organs of either
sex at the high-dose (1000 mg/kg/day) compared to the controls.  Moreover,
there were no compound-related changes in the reproductive organs, heart,
lungs, spleen, kidneys or adrenals of animals that died during the course of
the study. Documented histopathological findings were considered to be
secondary to gavage accidents, unspecified etiologies or background lesions
common to rats of this strain and age.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level: 1000 mg/kg for reproductive performance.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> Endpoints were statistically evaluated using SAS&#174;
software.  ANOVA including linear trend analysis and Dunnett's tests for
comparison of treatments with controls was used for most variables.  Where
appropriate non parametric procedures such as Chi Square and Fishers exact test
were used.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Daily oral administration of ceftiofur sodium at dosages of 0, 100,
300 and 1000 mg/kg/day in Sprague-Dawley rats failed to produce any adverse
effects upon fertility or reproductive performance, or any histopathological
alterations in the reproductive organs of either sex in the FO generation.
Hence, the no observable effect level (NOEL) for reproductive performance and
fertility of the FO generation in rats was 1000 mg ceftiofur sodium per kg of
body weight.</ul><p>

<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing<P>  0, 100, 300 or 1,000 mg/kg/day.
Animals (Fl) were dosed once daily beginning on the day of weaning (postnatal
21) and continuing until the day before scheduled sacrifice (females for an
average of 153 days and males an average of 152 days).  At 12 to 15 weeks of
age the Fl males and females were cohabited for 21 days.  Resulting F2 pups
were sacrificed at time of weaning (day 21 of age).<p>
<li>Route of Administration:  via gavage<p>
<li>Variables Tested<P> In this study, Fl males and females from each respective group
were dosed daily via gavage beginning on pnd 21 (weaning) and continuing until
the day before scheduled sacrifice. At 12 to 15 weeks of age, the Fl males and
females were cohabited in nonsibling breeding pairs for a maximum of 21 days.
On the day sperm were found in the vaginal lavage or at the end of the 21-day
cohabitation period, females were singly housed and checked at least twice
daily thereafter for the presence of pups in the cage. On the day a litter was
found (pnd 0), the following reproductive parameters were recorded:  (1) day of
delivery and length of gestation for each dam, (2) the number of live and dead
pups in each litter, and (3) the sex and clinical condition of each live pup.
The number of live pups of each sex and the average pup body weight for live
pups of each sex per litter were recorded on pnd 0, 4, and 21. On pnd 4, live
litters were randomly culled to a maximum size of 10 pups per litter. Postnatal
viability of F2 pups was evaluated on pnd 0, during the perinatal period (days 0-4)
and during the remainder of lactation (days 4-21).
 On pnd 21 (day of weaning), all F2 pups were sacrificed, necropsied, and
observations were recorded. Following sacrifice of F2 litters, Fl adult animals
were sacrificed (146th-160th
day of exposure for females; 145th-159th
day of exposure for males). Each Fl animal was evaluated at scheduled sacrifice
and the gastrointestinal tract, gross lesions and masses from all dose groups
were evaluated histopathologically.  The reproductive organs of both sexes were
evaluated histopathologically for all control and high dose animals.  In the
absence of any compound related changes in the reproductive organs at the high
dose relative to the controls, comparable tissues from the low and mid dose
groups were not microscopically examined, as per study protocol.  For animals
that died or were moribund during the course of the study histopathologic
evaluation was performed on reproductive organs, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys,
adrenals, or gross lesions and masses.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Except for mechanical effects due to dosing,
clinical signs were not related to treatment.  Males and females in all
ceftiofur sodium groups had an increased tendency to struggle during dosing.
Thirty-three (33) rats (18 males and 15 females) died or were moribund over the
course of the study.  When these data from males and females were combined, the
incidence of dead or moribund animals increased in a dose related manner (0/60,
1/60, 11/60, and 21/60 at 0, 100, 300, and 1,000 mg/kg/day, respectively).
Ninety-four percent (17/18) of these occurrences in males and 87&#37; (13/15) in
females were associated with evidence of accidental causes.  For the remaining
three (3) (e.g., one male at and 1,000 mg/kg/day, one female at 300 mg/kg/day,
and one female at 1,000 mg/kg/day), the cause of death could not be
determined.<p>
The potential effects of ceftiofur sodium on Fl male reproductive capacity were
evaluated within a dose range which produced a statistically significant
increase in male body weight gain (weaning-necropsy) at the low and mid doses,
but did not affect weight gain at the high dose.  Body weight gain for females
was not affected during the first twelve weeks of exposure to ceftiofur sodium
(i.e., prior to cohabitation) or during gestation, but was significantly
increased at the high dose throughout lactation.<p>
Fertility and reproductive performance of the Fl generation and development of
F2 litters through weaning (pnd 21) were not adversely affected by daily
ceftiofur sodium exposure. Nor were there any treatment-related gross lesions
observed in the F2 pups at scheduled sacrifice.  Thus, ceftiofur sodium had no
adverse effects on fertility and reproductive performance of the Fl adults or
the resulting F2 pups.<p>
Evaluation of F2 animals at scheduled sacrifice revealed an increased incidence
of enlargement of the cecum at 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day, but not at 100
mg/kg/day when compared to the controls.  In addition, males in the 300 and
1,000 mg/kg/day groups and females in all ceftiofur sodium dose groups
exhibited increased weight of the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., with or without
stomach contents) relative to the vehicle control group.  At 300 and 1,000
mg/kg/day, there was a greater incidence of degenerative changes in the
nonglandular stomach (6 and 92&#37;, respectively) and hypersecretion of mucus in
the neck cells of the glandular stomach (12 and 79&#37;, respectively) as compared
to the control and 100 mg/kg/day groups.<p>
For F1 animals which survived to scheduled sacrifice, no compound related
microscopic findings were observed in the reproductive organs of either sex at
the high dose (1,000 ng/kg/day) compared to the vehicle controls.  Microscopic
changes in the reproductive organs, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, or adrenals
of animals that died or were moribund during the course of the study were not
compound related.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level:  1,000 mg/kg for reproductive performance and
fertility.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> Endpoints were statistically evaluated using SAS&#174;
software.  ANOVA including linear trend analysis and Dunnett's tests for
comparison of treatments with controls was used for most variables.  Where
appropriate non parametric procedures such as Chi Square and Fishers exact test
were used.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Daily oral administration of ceftiofur sodium at dosages of 0, 100,
300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day to Sprague-Dawley rats produced gross enlargement of
the cecum and microscopic changes in the stomach at 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day as
compared to the controls. These effects were not observed at 100 mg/kg/day.
Ceftiofur sodium failed to produce any adverse effects upon fertility or
reproductive performance of the F1 generation.<p>
Likewise, no adverse effects were observed with regard to the growth and
viability of F2 litters through weaning (pnd 21). Hence, the no observable
effect level (NOEL) for reproductive performance and fertility of the F1
generation in rats was 1,000 mg ceftiofur sodium per kg of body weight.</UL><p>

<li>Starting Date:  February 12, 1985<p>
<li>Termination Date:  March 14, 1985<p>
<li>Study Director:  T. A. Marks<p>
<li>Location of Study: The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo MI<p>
<li>Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:  ceftiofur sodium powder formulated
with sterile filtered deionized water to form a solution.<p>
<li>Species and Strain:  Sprague-Dawley Rats<p>
<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group: 24 bred rats per group<p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:   0, 800, 1,600 and 3,200 mg/kg/day on
days 6-15 of gestation<p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration: oral by gastric intubation<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> All dams were weighed on the day of insemination (day 0 of
gestation), throughout the dosing period, and on day 20, the day cesarean
sections were performed.  Sex, weight, number and location of each dead and
resorbed fetus.  Live fetuses were evaluated for gross, visceral and skeletal
anomalies.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Ceftiofur administration led to dose related
maternal toxicity (soft stools, porphyrin staining of the eye and nares)
especially in the high dose group (diarrhea, blood in stools).  However, in
spite of administration at such high dosages, this cephalosporin did not appear
to adversely affect the reproductive capacity of the dams.  Although there was
a statistically significant (P &#60;0.01) decrease in the proportion of dams in the
high dose group that conceived, the fact that the drug was not given until day
6 of gestation, as well as the lack of significant effects on early embryo
development (early implant sites and resorptions), suggested that this effect
occurred by chance.<p>
The only statistically significant adverse effect on the embryos was a dose-related 
decrease in mean fetal body weights.  However, the actual decreases did
not exceed 7&#37; and no other indication of toxicity toward the offspring was
found.  Thus, it was concluded that ceftiofur was not embryotoxic.  Since there
were no biologically significant increases in the incidences of variations or
malformations, it was also concluded that this drug was not teratogenic to the
rat.<p>
<li>No observed Effect Level:  3,200 mg/kg body weight for teratogenic effects.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P>  Several different  procedures were used, depending on the
end point, ranging from non parametric procedures to Analysis of Variance with
LSD Method for pairwise comparisons.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Ceftiofur sodium is not teratogenic in the rat at doses up to and
including 3,200 mg/kg body weight.</uL><p>

<li>Route of Drug Administration: oral intragastric intubation<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> Dogs were evaluated prior to study initiation by physical
examination which included ophthalmologic examination and analysis of clinical
pathology data.  During the study, food consumption data were collected 5
days per week and clinical observations were made daily; body weights were
documented on a weekly basis.  Blood chemistry and urinalysis data were
collected during week 4 and at study termination; ophthalmologic
examinations were done at the same period.  Hematology data was collected from

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Administration of ceftiofur to dogs at levels of
300 mg/kg/day, 1,000 mg/kg/day, or 3,000 mg/kg/day for a period of up to 51
consecutive days resulted in anemia and thrombocytopenia in both male and
female beagles.  The two higher dose levels were also associated with the
development of elevated neutrophil counts and depression.  Two females given
1,000 mg/kg/day and 2 males and 2 females given 3,000 mg/kg/day died prior

<li>Parameters Tested<P> Dogs were evaluated prior to study initiation by physical
examination.  During the study, food consumption data were collected 7 days
per week and clinical observations were made daily; body weights were
documented on a weekly basis.  Blood chemistry and urinalysis data were
collected prior to study initiation, during week 6, and before study
termination; ophthalmologic examinations were done prior to study initiation and
at termination of the study.  Hematology data were collected from all dogs
prior to study initiation and 6 times during the study (including
termination) at approximately 2-week intervals.  Coombs' tests were performed
on blood from all dogs given 300 mg/kg/day and 3 dogs per sex given vehicle
only at day 41; at day 83 blood from all dogs was tested.  Examinations of
blood smears and differential leukocyte counts were done for all dogs prior to
study initiation, at the 6-week bleeding, and at the last bleeding; smears
were analyzed from every bleeding for dogs which became anemic and/or Coomb's
test positive.  A complete necropsy was done on all dogs; selected organs were
weighed and protocol tissues were fixed in formalin, processed, and evaluated
histopathologically.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P>  Administration of 100 mg/kg/day or more of
ceftiofur was associated with a non-progressive thrombocytopenia in at least
4 dogs.  Multiple dogs treated with 300 mg/kg/day became positive for the
Coombs' test indicating the presence of immunoglobulin on the surface of
erythrocytes.  Two dogs treated at this level became severely anemic and there
was no apparent regenerative response by bone marrow until administration of
compound ceased (one dog).  Major clinical signs were associated with anemia
and included pale mucous membranes and depression.<p>
Necropsy observations and major histopathologic findings were related to the
process of anemia.  A minor inflammatory lesion was noted in the pelvis of
kidneys from dogs given 100 mg/kg/day or more of compound; its significance is
unknown.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level: 30 mg/kg<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> Body weights, food consumption, organ weights, hematology,

<li>Conclusions<P> Ceftiofur has obvious effects on the hematopoietic system, causing
thrombocytopenia in dogs given 100 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/kg/day and severe anemia
in dogs given 300 mg/kg/day.  The no observed effect level (NOEL) for ceftiofur
in dogs was 30 mg/kg/day in this study.</ul><p>

<li>Route of Drug Administration: not applicable <i>in vitro</i>&#160; test<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> The mammalian cell mutagenesis assay is an accepted <i>in vitro</i>&#160;
short term testing procedure for detecting potential mutagens and carcinogens.
This assay uses V79 (Chinese hamster) cells and measures the production of
mutants resistant to 6-thioguanine (TG) as a result of exposure to the test
compound.  Mutant cells without HGPRT activity cannot metabolize TG, and thus
escape its lethal effect.<p>
Some compounds are negative in this assay unless they are metabolized to
reactive forms.  Because the V79 cell is incapable of such metabolic
activation, an exogenous activation system is required. The rat liver S9 system
is a widely used activation system for bacterial and mammalian cell
mutagenesis.  Thus, ceftiofur was tested with and without an S9 activation
system.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> There were no significant differences between the
mutation frequencies of cultures treated with ceftiofur and control cultures.
All the treatment/control ratios were very close to 1.0, and there was no
significant linear dose response. Thus, ceftiofur with or without S9
activation, was not mutagenic in this study.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level: not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> The raw data was entered into a computer program which
calculated the mutant frequencies and generated summary tables and a
statistical analysis.  The mutation frequencies of the cultures were
transformed to (1 &#43; mutants/10e6)(raised to 0.15 power).  The mean response
 at each dose was
compared to the mean control (no treatment) response using the one-sided t-test.  
The mean square error from a two-way analysis of variance (AOV) was used
for a variance estimate. In addition, a one-sided t-test was used to test for
an increasing linear relationship between log dose and the transformed
response. The mean square error from a covariance model with assays as the
grouping variable was used for the variance estimate.  To increase the
sensitivity of the latter test, the control vehicle responses were incorporated
into the analysis by assigning them dose values equal to R times the smallest
dose where R is the ratio of two successive doses.<p>
The alpha levels of the statistical tests were adjusted so that the
experimental alpha level was not greater than .1.  Thus, the alpha levels were
set at .025 for the four-dose assays.<p>
<li>Conclusions: Ceftiofur was not mutagenic in this study.</ul><p>

<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group:  not applicable<p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing<P>  0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg ceftiofur/ml
with a solvent control and UV light as a positive control.<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> Genotoxins are agents that can damage DNA or alter chromosome
structure and with very few exceptions are generally mutagenic or carcinogenic.
As a class of compounds, genotoxins have wide structural diversity.  Some are
active <i>per se</i>&#160; but most require metabolic activation before they are capable of
exerting their biological effects.  Not all types of DNA damage lead to
mutagenic or carcinogenic endpoints.  Some types of DNA damage are repaired by
the cellular repair system before the deleterious consequences are manifest.
DNA repair, therefore, implies DNA damage and as such can be used as an
endpoint for assaying genotoxic action.  Cells vary greatly in their ability to
repair genotoxic lesions and depending on the type of lesion formed can be
repaired in a variety of ways.  A brief description of DNA excision repair
serves to illustrate the repair process.  Briefly, a genotoxic lesion is
recognized and excised from the DNA strand by repair endonucleases, along with
several nucleotides on either side of the lesion.  The resulting gap is patched
with nucleotides, using the opposite strand as a template.  This repair is
known as unscheduled DNA synthesis or UDS and can be measured by a variety of
methods. The most common method used to monitor unscheduled DNA synthesis is by
observing increased incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine into the repair
patches by autoradiography.<p>
Primary rat hepatocytes have three characteristics that make them useful for
detecting UDS.  First, hepatocytes are nondividing, therefore, a UDS response
is not confused with cells undergoing semi-conservative replication (scheduled
DNA synthesis).  Second, hepatocytes have good capabilities for metabolic
activation of genotoxins.  Third, hepatocytes have excellent DNA repair
capabilities.<p>
For this test an increased frequency of nuclear grains indicates DNA repair and
implies that the agent responsible for the increase may be carcinogenic and
mutagenic.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> UV light (1.5 joules/sq m) was used as a positive
control and resulted in a 4-fold increase of nuclear grains as compared to
controls.<p>
Ceftiofur did not cause a dose-related increase of UDS nor did it cause a
doubling of UDS relative to untreated control cultures that received equivalent
volumes of vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide).<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level:  not applicable<p>
<li>Conclusions:  Under the conditions employed for this study, ceftiofur did not act
as a DNA damaging agent.</ul><p>

<li>Species and Strain:  Male Sprague-Dawley Rats<p>
<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group:  10 M per group<p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing<P> Ceftiofur at 250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg
body weight given in two equal doses 24h apart intraperitoneally (ip), water
controls and cyclophosphamide as a positive control at 1 ml/kg.<p>
<li>Route of Administration: intraperitoneal<p>
<li>Parameters Tested <P>The micronucleus test is an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; procedure used for the
detection of compounds that cause chromosome damage or nondisjunction of
chromosomes (as induced by spindle poisons).<p>
Micronuclei are chromosome fragments (as a result of clastogenic events) or
whole chromosomes (a result of nondisjunctional events) that are left behind
after expulsion of the nucleus during maturation of erythroblasts to
erythrocytes in the bone marrow of mammals. 
For this test an increased frequency of micronucleated polychromatophilic
erythrocytes indicates chromosome damage, nondisjunction, or chromosomal
deletions from the genome.<p>
At 30 and 48 hours after the first dose (i.e., 6 and 24 hours after the
second dose), the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The long bones
of the hind quarters were exposed and the epiphyseal ends were snipped off to
expose the marrow.  A 20 gauge needle, on a 1-ml syringe containing 0.2-0.3
ml fetal calf serum, was inserted into the marrow cavity while simultaneously
providing aspiration with the syringe plunger.  The marrow plugs of the long
bones of the hind quarters were dispersed in a disposable test tube, after
which the cell suspension was placed on a microscope slip and spun at maximum
speed for 10 seconds in a Perkin-Elmer slide spinner. The slides were air
dried overnight at room temperature.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Cyclophosphamide, a mutagen that requires
metabolic activation, was used as a positive control and significantly
increased the incidence of micronucleated PCEs.  None of the ceftiofur
treatment groups exhibited a statistically significant increase in the rate of
micronucleated PCEs over that of the control group, nor was the test for a
positive dose response relationship statistically significant.  These results
indicate that ceftiofur did not have clastogenic or nondisjunctional effects on
the chromosomes of rat bone marrow cells.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level:  not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> Summary statistics were calculated for each treatment
group.  Each ceftiofur treatment group was compared with the vehicle control
group using the rank transformation of the one sided t-test.  The existence of
a positive dose response relationship was tested using the rank transformation
of the one-sided t-test for a positive slope.<p>
<li>Conclusions:  Under conditions of this study, ceftiofur did not act as a
clastogen or chromosomal mutagen.</ul><p>

Criteria for judging an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay The criteria for
judging any <i>in vitro</i>&#160; assay fall into two categories, namely, those which affect
the acceptability of the assay and those which affect the interpretation of the
result of the assay.  The data presented here relate only to the criteria for
the acceptability of the test as valid.<p>
<li>Criteria for judging an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay<p>
 The
criteria for judging any <i>in vitro</i>&#160; assay fall into two categories,
namely, those which affect the acceptability of the assay and those
which affect the interpretation of the result of the assay.  The
data presented here relate only to the criteria for the
acceptability of the test as valid.<p>
<li>Criteria for the acceptability of an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/ microsome
assay <p>   The following conditions define an acceptable Ames
<i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay -  <ul> <p>
<li>1. Negative control frequencies should fall within the acceptable
range for each strain and the negative control plates should
display normal growth (as shown by the presence of a background
lawn of microcolonies).  The mean spontaneous frequency of
revertants is typically higher in the presence than in the absence
of S-9.  Individual strains outside the acceptable range should be
excluded from data interpretation.<p>
<li>2. Positive control frequencies should fall within the acceptable
ranges or within the expectations established with range finding
experiments if other positive controls are used.  Failure of a
positive control to perform as expected is interpreted to indicate
any of several problems and data for that particular
strain/activation combination should not be the subject of further
interpretation. <p>
Experiments in which the negative controls and positive controls
are acceptable may be further interpreted.</ul><p>  
<li>Criteria for a positive
or negative response in an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay - <p>
The following conditions define a positive response in the Ames
<i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay - <uL><p>
<li>1. A reproducible dose response, i.e. systematic increase in
revertants per plate as a function of dose or<p>
<li>2. A reproducible elevation of mutant colonies per plate at a
single dose which amount to a tripling of the spontaneous frequency
of revertants in any strain. </ul> <p>
The following conditions will define a negative response in the
Ames test - <ul><p>
<li>1. No evidence of systematic reproducible elevation of mutation
frequencies is observed in any strain/activation group and,<p>
<li>2. No dose level produces a reproducible doubling of the background
frequency of revertants in any strain.</ul><p>
Cases which do not clearly fit into the positive or negative
category, i.e.  between a doubling and a tripling of the background
frequency of revertants, may be judged equivocal.  These cases will
require further testing in other test systems to resolve the
question of potential mutagenicity of the test agent. <p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed <P>At no dose level was an appreciable increase in
colonies per plate observed, while the strain specific positive controls worked
properly in all cases.  The concentrations used in the study were chosen on the
basis of preliminary range-finding experiments.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level: not applicable.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis:  none.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> The Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay is a qualitative assay for
mutagenicity and as such has gained considerable standing (Haworth et al, 1984,
Dunkel et al, 1985) in the evaluation of a variety of agents for mutagenic
potential.  The simplicity of conduct and ease of performance have led to the
adoption of its use by government, industry and academic laboratories as a tool
in investigation of mechanisms, discovering hazardous materials and regulatory
decision making.  The results of the study of 2-furoic acid failed to
demonstrate any tendency to cause mutations in bacteria.  Therefore, 2-furoic
acid is judged to be non-mutagenic under the conditions of this test.  These
results confirm the previously obtained negative results with furoic acid.</ul><p>

&#181;g/ml plus two positive controls (DMN and 2-AAF) and a negative (solvent)
control<p>
<li>Route of Administration:   not applicable<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> This DNA repair assay, as developed by G. M. Williams
measures unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes
treated with the test compound <i>in vitro </i>.  This assay is useful as a
genotoxicity screen because it measures the repair of DNA damage induced by
many classes of mutagens and carcinogens.  Genotoxic compounds or their
metabolites react with DNA to form adducts which are repaired by an enzymatic
process in which the adduct is excised, and the DNA strand is polymerized and
ligated.  This process, referred to as unscheduled DNA synthesis, can be
quantitated by measuring the incorporation of labeled thymidene into the
nuclear DNA of cells not in S phase.  Thus, compounds that induce repairable
DNA damage without inhibiting that repair can be detected by measuring UDS.<p>
Primary hepatocytes are particularly useful for this assay because of their
high capacity to metabolize procarcinogens to a genotoxic form.  In addition,
the cultures are essentially non-dividing, so that normal replicative DNA
synthesis is too low to interfere with UDS detection.<p>
A test compound is considered a positive if the UDS net grain count of any
tested concentration is &gt; &#61; 5 NG in both the preliminary and replicate
assays and if the percentage of cells in repaid (&#37; IR) Is &gt; &#61; 10.  The
results are considered as either inconclusive or a potentially weak positive
response if the highest UDS net grain count for any tested concentration is
between 0 and 5 NG.  The results are considered negative if all tested
concentrations of the test article have a UDS need grain count of &lt; &#61; 0 NG,
and if testing was performed to the limits of solubility or cytotoxicity, or at
3.0 mg/ml.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Cytotoxicity was observed at 1,000 &#181;g/ml.  The
net grain counts were negative for each concentration of furoic acid, and for
the negative controls.  There was no significant difference in net grain counts
between furoic acid and the negative controls.  DMN and 2-AAF each induced a
strong positive response.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level:   not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> The mean and cell to cell standard deviation (SD) for the
nuclear, cytoplasmic and net grain counts were calculated for each slide.  The
NG mean, slide to slide standard error (SE), and frequency distribution were
calculated for each dose.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Furoic acid did not induce a significant increase in UDS over the
negative controls.  Therefore, furoic acid was not a genotoxic agent under the
conditions of this <i>in vitro</i>&#160; rat hepatocyte DNA repair assay.</ul><p>

<li>Parameters Tested<P> The V79/HGPRT Mammalian Cell Mutation Assay is one component
of a battery of tests used at The Upjohn Company to evaluate chemicals for
their ability to cause genotoxic effects. The V79 assay is widely used and
accepted in the field of genetic toxicology as a valid means of estimating the
potential of chemicals to cause gene mutations in mammalian cells in culture.
We report here the results of furoic acid in the V79/HGPRT Mammalian Cell
Mutation Assay.<p>
The V79/HGPRT assay measures the ability of a test compound to induce point
mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus
in Chinese hamster V79 cells.  Cells which are unable to synthesize the enzyme
HGPRT (presumptive mutants) cannot metabolize the purine analog 6-thioguanine
(6-TG) to its toxic form and are therefore resistant to it.  The V79/HGPRT
Assay has been described and reviewed in the literature, and is a widely
accepted means of estimating the ability of chemicals to induce forward point
mutations in mammalian cells.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> According to criteria for positive response
(either a dose related or statistically significant increase in mutation
frequency compared to vehicle controls), furoic acid was nonmutagenic in the
V79/HGPRT Mammalian Cell Mutation Assay either with or without metabolic
activation.  Positive controls (DMBA or MNU) induced mutation frequencies
similar to expected values.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level:    not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<P> Raw data (plate counts) were used to generate mean
mutation counts per treatment group and each furoic acid group compared with
controls.<p>
<li>Conclusions:    Furoic acid was not mutagenic in this test system.</ul><p>

were based on anticipated maximum human exposure level

were usually given in 10-fold increments. Routinely, oral
challenges were at levels 10X greater than those given IV:<ul><p>

<LI>Parameters Tested<p> Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis (PCA) following IV
and/or oral challenge.  Briefly, skin sites on guinea pigs were
passively sensitized with antibody of desired specificity and five
days later the sensitized animals were given Evans blue dye and
challenged by either the IV or oral route with appropriate test
material.  Sensitized skin sites were subsequently examined for
evidence of PCA reactions as indicated by the leakage of Evans blue
dye from the vascular system into the skin.<p>
<LI>Significant Findings<p> Regardless of dose, there were no positive
reactions of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) when guinea pigs
sensitized with penicillin antibody were challenged by either route
with any form of ceftiofur.<p>
Guinea pigs sensitized with ceftiofur antibody did not respond to
challenges with parent compound by either route.  However, positive
PCA reactions occurred following challenge with protein conjugate
by both routes.  While an IV challenge of 0.01 mg/kg produced
positive reactions, oral exposure resulted in PCA activity only at
a challenge level of 10 mg/kg.<p>
Metabolite II caused PCA reactions over a wide range of dose levels
when given by either the IV or oral route to guinea pigs sensitized
with ceftiofur antibody.  While as little as 0.076 &#181;g/kg produced
positive responses following IV challenge, levels of at least 76
&#181;g/kg were required to induce positive PCA activity as a sequel to
oral exposure.<p>
Guinea pigs sensitized with ceftiofur antibody then challenged IV
with conjugates of Compound A or Compound B responded to the
challenge.  These positive responses confirm that the model is able
to recognize all metabolites in the extract of kidney or muscle.<p>
Guinea pigs sensitized with ceftiofur antibody and challenged
orally at a level of 0.83 mg/kg with acetic acid extract of drug
(ceftiofur) residue from kidney and injection-site muscle were
uniformly negative.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  0.83 mg/kg. The relevant NOEL is for oral
challenge of sensitized animals with the acetic acid extract of
ceftiofur residue from kidney and injection site muscle.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  Not applicable.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Antibody to benzylpenicillin G did not react with any
form of ceftiofur tested, regardless of route or dose.  Data from
the IV challenges indicate that ceftiofur antibody used for this
study was capable of detecting the drug as a conjugated hapten in
challenge material given at a level as low as .01 mg/kg body weight
(lowest level tested).  Positive PCA reactions also occurred with
IV challenges of Metabolite II at levels as low as .076 &#181;g/kg body
weight (lowest level tested).  The route was of considerable
importance for both the protein conjugate and Metabolite II because
of the differences in the level of challenge necessary to elicit a
positive PCA reaction.  With both materials, the oral challenge
level necessary to produce a positive response was approximately
1,000X the minimum level required for a PCA reaction following IV
challenge.  This suggests that the gastrointestinal tract may play
an important role in modulating the effect of potential
hypersensitive reactions with ceftiofur. <p>
Further, the data suggest that ceftiofur does not exist in residue
from injection site muscle or kidney in a form or concentration
such that PCA reactions occur following oral exposure of animals
sensitized with ceftiofur antibody and challenged with extract of
the residue.  Levels of extract tested were at least 10X the
maximum anticipated human exposure level, based on consumption of
injection site muscle at the time of maximum residue concentration.</ul><p>


<b>2. Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) Inhibition with Human Serum</b><UL><p>

<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group -  Not applicable <p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing -  Not applicable <p>
<li>Route of Administration -  Not applicable<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> The procedures for the RAST assay are the ones
routinely used.  Briefly, subjects were skin tested with a full
battery of penicillin determinants and serum from positive reactors
were subsequently studied using a penicilloyl RAST system.  Serum
samples from individuals with negative reactions were used as
controls.<p>

PENICILLOYL RAST: Benzylpenicillin G was conjugated to human serum
albumin in the penicilloyl configuration by the pH method.  This
material was then conjugated to cyanogen bromide activated
cellulose disks for use in RAST assays.  Studies with positive and
negative sera validated the assay. Serum giving apparently positive
tests were further evaluated by preincubating the serum in the
presence of 100 &#181;g/ml of penicilloylbenzylamine (BPO-BA) as a
positive inhibition control.  Buffer alone served as a negative
control.  These preparations were then studied for their ability to
bind in the standard RAST assay.<p>

CEFTIOFUR INHIBITION: ceftiofur was conjugated to bovine gamma
globulin (BGG) using the pH method, resulting in a binding ratio of
16 ceftiofur determinants per BGG molecule.  The resultant BGG-ceftiofur 
molecule was then used as a potential inhibitor, as was
done with BPO-BA.<p>
<li>Significant Results<P> The BPO-BA molecule was able to significantly
inhibit the binding of serum antibody from 17 patients to the
penicilloyl molecule.  However, in no case was the preincubation of
BGG-ceftiofur with serum from any of the patients able to
significantly inhibit the binding of antibody to the penicilloyl
molecule.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level - Not applicable<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Ceftiofur-derived determinants do not react with IgE
to penicillin in the RAST system and therefore, individuals
allergic to penicillin are not at risk if exposed to ceftiofur.</ul><p>

2. This compound is a Category A compound as derived from the
Threshold Assessment considerations.  Based on Structural Activity
Assessment it was assigned to Category C (non carcinogen). 
Subsequent to this the 90 day feeding studies allowed it to be
classified as Category A.  Because of the therapeutic use on
specific animals it is considered a Low Use Drug.  Accordingly,
Chronic studies were not required, and based on 90 day studies, a
Safety Factor (SF) of 1000 is used in the Safe Concentration (SC)
calculations.<p>

<b>E. Comparative Metabolism Study Results</b><ul><p>
Including the parent compound, ceftiofur, there are eight known
metabolites of ceftiofur.  These are identified as I (ceftiofur),
II, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX and furoic acid.  A polar
metabolite U-3 also occurs in small amounts in some rats and in
cattle.<p>
Rats were orally dosed 14-C labeled ceftiofur sodium at 800 mg/kg
body weight for five consecutive days then sacrificed 8 h post last
feeding.  The dose approximates the highest NOEL (1,000 mg/kg)
observed in any of the oral rat feeding studies.  Cattle were
intramuscularly administered 14-C labeled formulated ceftiofur
sodium at 1 mg/lb for five consecutive days at a 24 h interval then
sacrificed eight hours post last treatment.  Metabolic profiles
were compared between the rat and cattle in urine, kidney and liver
tissues.  Kidney is the limiting tissue because observed
concentrations of total residues are highest in this tissue
relative to the calculated safe concentration.<p>

<li>Urinary Metabolites<p>
In both species, the initial metabolite is II.  Further metabolism
of II in rats from oral treatment gave rise to IX which was not
present in any significant amounts from IM treatment of cattle with
ceftiofur.<p>
The major metabolite V in the urine of cattle was also present
in the rat urine from oral treatment.  Most of the metabolite V
may not be a true metabolite but is an artifact which forms from
II.<p>
A similar situation applies to the metabolite VII.  When fresh
samples of urine were analyzed from treatment of rats with 14-C
ceftiofur, very high concentrations of II were found and very small
amounts of VII or the U-3 polar metabolites were present.  It
appears that when II is not analyzed within a few hours, VII and
U-3 are present in higher amounts.  This finding supports the view
that these compounds are formed from II.<p>
Metabolite IV is a product of II and its formation has been
observed in rats and in cattle.  Similarly VIII is formed from
VII and is present in both rats and cattle.<p>
Metabolite IX was present in the rat urine but not present in
bovine urine.  There were no major metabolites present in bovine
urine but absent from rat urine.<p>

<li>Kidney and Liver Metabolites<p>
Free metabolites in kidney and liver of rats and cattle are
similar.  Polar metabolite U-3 was present in both tissues of both
species.  Metabolites VII/VIII are major metabolites in both
tissues of both species while metabolites II/IV are present in
lesser amounts in both tissues of both species.  The majority of
the metabolites present in both rat and bovine liver and kidney
tissues could be converted to a common derivative (compound X). 
This shows that liver and kidney tissues in rats and cattle all had
related structures.  Bound residue was metabolite II linked to
macromolecules in both tissues of both species.  There are no major
metabolites present in either tissue of cattle but absent from
rats.  Likewise, there are no major metabolites present in the rat
but not present in corresponding bovine tissues.<p>
These data support the contention that the rat was autoexposed to
metabolites to which humans would be exposed from consuming edible
tissues of ceftiofur-treated cattle.  Therefore, the toxicology
studies in the rat accurately reflect the toxicity of these
metabolites to which man would be exposed.</ul><p>
<b>F. Tolerance for the Marker Residue</b><p>
Total residues at zero day withdrawal are substantially lower than
corresponding calculated safe concentrations for edible tissues,
therefore neither a marker compound nor a tolerance for a marker
compound is required.  The permitted safe concentration for total
residues in edible tissues is as follows:<p>
muscle    3.0 ppm<br>
kidney    9.0 ppm<br>
liver          6.0 ppm<br>
fat      12.0 ppm<p>
<b>G. Study Establishing Withdrawal Period</b><p>
Based on the toxicology data, and using the lowest No-Observed-Effect-Level 
of 30 mg/kg, a permitted Safe Concentration (SC) of 3
ppm in muscle and 9 ppm in kidney was established (Part C. of this
section).  Since the hypersensitivity studies demonstrated
the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction due to ingestion of
ceftiofur residues to be insignificant, the SC based on the
toxicology data is applied.<p>
Data presented in Part D. of this section  showed that the
mean concentrations of total ceftiofur residues at zero day
withdrawal following the administration of 1.0 mg/lb (2X label
dosage) were well below the permitted Safe Concentration. 
Therefore, a zero day pre-slaughter drug withdrawal has been
established and no residue decline studies were required.<p>

<b>H. Regulatory Method</b><p>
A regulatory method is not required; the residue and toxicology
data support a zero withdrawal period (see Part G. of this
Section).<p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> During the first hour of exposure,
most of the rats exhibited salivation and/or nasal discharge.  By
the end of the 4-hour exposure all the rats exhibited slight
dyspnea.  However, when the rats were removed from the chamber
approximately 1 hour post exposure, all but 1 of the rats
appeared normal.  Following exposure, diarrhea was observed in 6
rats for 1 to 2 days between days 2 and 5 post exposure. 
By day 6 post inhalation exposure no significant compound related
pharmacotoxic signs were observed except for 1 male appearing
unkempt between post exposure days 4 and 10, and 1 female
showing a red material encrusted around the nares from days 10 to
12 post exposure.  Gross necropsy examination of the rats, which
were sacrificed at the end of the 14 day study period, revealed no
compound related gross lesions.  Histopathological examination of
the lungs, liver, kidney, trachea and nasal turbinates revealed no
significant changes.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  No effect at 8 mg/l<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  Not applicable to data generated from this

<li>Conclusions<p> The acute 4-hour median lethal concentration (LC50)
for rats is greater than 8.3 mg/l. Thus, ceftiofur sodium dust is
unlikely to cause any harmful effects to humans at concentrations
which may be encountered during therapeutic or industrial handling
of the bulk drug.</ul><p>

<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing - 100 mg instilled       
once into the conjunctival sac of the right eye of each rabbit;
left eye used as control.<p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration -  Ocular exposure<p>
<li>Parameters Tested <p>
Clinical - treated and non treated eyes were examined and compared at
1, 24, 48 and 72 h and at 4, 7 and 14 days after
treatment.  Grading and scoring of irritation were performed in
accordance with Draize's procedure.<p>
Pathology - complete gross necropsy was performed on all rabbits that
died during the study.<p>
Histopathology - tissues and organs obtained from dead animals of the
first 6 tested rabbits included lungs, kidney, heart, urinary
bladder, liver, cecum, eyes, adrenal, pancreas, mesenteric lymph
node, duodenum, rectum, thymus and from the second 6 tested
rabbits included eyes, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum,
colon, rectum, lung, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal and spleen.<p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed <P> In the first experiment, a single
100 mg dose of ceftiofur sodium bulk drug powder was instilled into
the conjunctival sac of the right eyes of 3 male and 3
female albino rabbits.  The left eyes were untreated and served as
controls.  At one hour post dosing all the treated eyes exhibited
slight conjunctival redness and/or swelling.  In addition the
treated eyes of 2 male and 3 female rabbits also exhibited
slight to moderate discharge.  By 24 hours post treatment, the
treated eyes of all 6 rabbits appeared normal.  However, on day
3 post instillation, 2 of the 6 rabbits were found dead. 
One had died from severe pulmonary edema, and the other from severe
necrotizing cecitis.  The remaining 4 rabbits appeared normal
for the remainder of the 14 day study period.<p>
Because of the unexpected deaths, the eye irritation experiment was
repeated on another group of 3 male and 3 female rabbits. 
Added to the experimental procedure were daily observations for
pharmacotoxic signs and terminal necropsy and histopathologic
examination on all animals.  The results indicated that the eye
irritation was minimal, as it was in the first experiment. 
However, 5 of the 6 rabbits exhibited diarrhea and body weight
loss beginning 2 to 3 days post treatment and 2 of the 5
affected rabbits were found dead in 5 and 13 days post
treatment, respectively.  The cause of death was apparently
enteritis in one rabbit and mucoid enteropathy in the other.  It
was concluded that the cause of death in the Experiment 1 rabbit
with cecitis and the Experiment 2 rabbit with enteritis may have
been enterotoxemia, which may have been related to ceftiofur.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  Not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  None<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> The experimental results indicated that ceftiofur
sodium powder is minimally irritating to rabbit eyes.  However, the
drug was apparently absorbable via the ocular route and caused
detrimental systemic effects in some rabbits.<p>
For industrial hygiene purposes, avoid gross eye exposure to the
bulk drug powder.  Should eye exposure occur, promptly rinse the
contaminated eye(s) with water and obtain medical attention.</ul><p>


<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
Under the Agency's proposed supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367, December
23, 1977), this is a Category II change.<p>
This supplemental application for Naxcel Sterile Powder provides for a change
in dosage from 0.5 mg/kg BW to a range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/lb BW.  All other
aspects of the original NADA approval remain unchanged.<p>
Human food safety, target animal safety and environmental safety data in the
original NADA were generated using a dose of 1.0 mg/lb, therefore, no new data
were necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this product at the 1.0
mg/lb dose level.<p>
A reevaluation of the original data supports the conclusion that in certain
outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease or "shipping fever" the use of 1.0
mg/lb is advantageous.<p>
The clinical condition due to bovine respiratory disease (shipping fever)
varies considerably depending on the organism (species and number of bacteria,
resistance), the nutritional condition of the cattle, the weather, age of
animals, and husbandry practices.<p>
The dose range allows the veterinarian to treat according to his or her
professional judgment as to the clinical severity of the outbreak. The range
also provides for the safe and efficacious use of Naxcel within an acceptable
window for target animal and human safety and within FDA approved labeling.<p>
The product remains a prescription drug.  No preslaughter withdrawal time is
needed because tissue residue levels are below the safe concentration in all
edible tissues 8 hrs after administration of the product at 1 mg/lb body
weight.  Naxcel causes an immediate and transient local pain at the
intramuscular injection site which is not significantly more severe at the 1
mg/lb level.  The environmental assessment in the original NADA was conducted
at both dose levels and a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) was
prepared.<p>
The Agency concludes that Naxcel Sterile Powder is safe and effective when used
for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease in beef and non-lactating dairy
cattle at the dosage range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/lb of body weight.<p>

<B>4. EFFECTIVENESS:</B> <p>

 The drug was the subject of National Academy of	Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11647).  The Academy evaluated these products as  probably effective for growth promotion and feed efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline.<p>

The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the
preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6) effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage. <p>

The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues.,  July 21, 1970).  FDA proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 92-287 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness.
That review resulted in a letter to the sponsor in which the agency stated that
it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only for the control
and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to chlortetracycline
pre-mixes in calves.<p>

Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<p>

1.	Appropriate oral doses for all the allowable species and claims based on
milligrams per unit of body weight or grams per ton are on the current
labels.<p>

2. Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
approriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride.  Disease claims which were not so qualified have been
deleted.<p>

3. Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<p>

4. Claims for growth promotion or stimulation have been removed.  Allowable
claims are for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed effieciency.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B> <p>
 No further safety data are required.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><p>

The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.  FDA's approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.  The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at 21 CFR 556.150.<p>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the
Act and demonstrates that Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Article Milk
Replacer when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective
for the labeled indications.  The approval provides for use of
ChlortetracyclineType A Medicated Article Milk Replaccer for the control and
treatment of specific diseases in calves.<p>

The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlotetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER </b>of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the paragraphs aabove.  The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<p>

When NADA 92-287 was reviewed under NAS/NRC/DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.  Other
Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Articles (milk replacer) for use in
food-producing animals (calves) are also currently on the market as
over-the-counter products.  Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has
concluded that this product should retain over-the-counter marketing status.<p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<p>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

 <B> f. Test Duration:</B>  21 days.<p>

 <B> g. Parameters Measured:</B><p>

    <B>1.  Clinical Observations:</b><p> 
       
       a. Observations for pharmacologic and toxicologic effects were performed 
          twice daily (AM and PM) during the week and once daily on weekends and 
          holidays during the animal phase of the study. All birds were monitored 
          daily for signs of loose stools (pasted vents).<p>

       b. Body Weights:<p>  Body weights were recorded weekly on a per pen basis 
          except at study initiation and study termination when the males and 
          females within a pen were weighed separately.<p>

       c. Water Consumption:  Water consumption (medicated or unmedicated) was
          recorded daily for each pen.<p>

       d. Food Consumption:<p>  Food consumption was done on a per pen basis. For 
          the first week of study, determinations were done every two or three 
          days, then daily for the remaining 14 days.<p>
    
    <B>2.  Clinical Pathology<p></b> 
       
       a. Hematology:  Red blood cell count (Coulter ZBI) and hematocrit (manual 
          method).<p>

       b. Serum Chemistry:<p>  Blood samples were also taken for determination of 
          the following serum chemistry parameters: Calcium, inorganic 
          phosphorus, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, total protein, 
          albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST).<p>

    <B>3.  Necropsy<p></b> 
       
       a. A total of 477 birds were necropsied in a predetermined order over a 
          six day period at study termination.  Five birds (25%) of the 20 birds
          in each pen were randomly selected prior to study initiation for 
          tissue preservation for histopathologic examination.<p>

       b. Organ weights: <p> The following organs were weighed at necropsy: liver,
          spleen, paired ceca (the intestine was ligated immediately above and
          below the ceca before they were removed for weighing).<p>

    <B>4.  Histopathology</b><p> The following tissues were collected for histopathologic
        evaluation:  liver, lung, kidney, spleen, heart, thymus, skeletal 
        muscle (pectoral), proventriculus, small intestine, cecum, colon, Bursa
        of Fabricius, bone marrow (femur), any gross lesion.<p>

<B>4. Results:</B> <p>

  a. Clinical observations:<p>  During the course of this study, no observations of
     drug related problems were noted.<p>

  b. Body weight:</B><p>  The body weight data were used to calculate average daily gain
     (ADG) on a per bird basis.  A  significant linear trend was detected with
     the average daily gain increasing as the dosage levels increased.<p>

  c. Food consumption:</B> <p> Food consumption on a per bird basis increased relatively
     uniformly across treatment groups as the birds increased in age.<p>
d. Water consumption:</B><p>  Daily water consumption on a per bird basis also
     increased relatively uniformly across treatment groups as the birds increased in age.<p>

  e. Hematologic observations:</B><p>  The statistical analysis of the hematologic
     parameters (RBC and HCT) revealed no drug related changes in any of the 
     dose groups.<p>

 f. Serum chemistries:</B><p>  No significant drug related changes were produced among
     the serum chemistries after 21 days of oral dosing.<p>

  g. Gross lesions:</B><p>  The most frequent lesion noted at necropsy was the presence
     of scattered petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages along the mucosal surface 
     in the middle of the small intestine. Curled toes, slipped tendons, and 
     pasted vents were occasionally observed and were uniformly distributed among 
     control and each of the treatment groups.  Enlarged ceca was an infrequent
     observation in treated birds.<p>

  h. Histologic lesions:</B><p>  A variety of incidental findings was observed
     histologically in the birds from which  tissues were saved.  Liver sections
     contained the presence of small multifocal accumulations of lymphocytes
     scattered throughout the parenchyma. Occasionally, granulocytic cells, 
     possibly eosinophils, were present in small numbers within the portal was 
     seen in approximately 25% of the birds in all four groups.  A focal acute 
     exudative myocarditis was observed with relative frequency and probably was
     a sequela of the intracardial bleeding that each bird underwent several 
     hours prior to euthanasia.  The gross lesion of scattered petechiae and
     ecchymoses along the mucosa of the jejunum was observed histologically as a
     pooling of red blood cells within the lamina propria at the tips of several
     adjacent villi.  No immediate reason for this pooling was detected.  No 
     treatment related effects of this drug were observed.<p>

<b>5.  Statistical Analysis:</b><p> The analyses of hematology, serum chemistry and
    average daily gain data were done using weighted least squares analysis of
    variance (weighted by number of observation in mean) on the sex pen means
    according to the following table:<p>

  1. This was the first test conducted.  Significance (two sided 0.05) in this
     test provided evidence of a linear change due to increasing level of
     lincomycin.  The test for lack of fit was then conducted (see [2]).  If a
     significant linear trend was not obtained, then the overall test for a
     treatment effect was computed (see [3]).<p>

  2. Significance in this test (two sided 0.05) provided evidence that there 
     are significant deviations from linearity.  Inferences would not be made
     to a linear trend in this case and the overall test for a treatment effect 
     was computed (see [3]).  If significant lack of fit is not obtained and 
     there is a significant linear trend, then inferences will be made to 
     linear trend.<p>

  3. Significance in this test (alpha = 0.05) was required before proceeding 
     with the contrasts described in [4].<p>

  4. Significance in this test (two-sided 0.05) indicated a significant change 
     for that dose group when compared to control.<p>

  5. Significance in this test (two-sided 0.05) provides evidence that there 
     are significant differences between males and females.<p>

  6. Significance in this test provided evidence that the response of a bird 
     to a dose of lincomycin depends on the sex of the bird.  In this case, all
     inferences were made to sex treatment means and comparisons of each dose   
     group to control within each sex were made.  If this interaction test was
     significant, then inferences were made to the sex and treatment means.<p>
</pre>

<B>6.  Conclusions:</B><p>

No adverse clinical signs were observed relative to the presence of lincomycin
in the drinking water.  There were no statistically significant differences
noted between treated and control birds for hematologic or serum chemistry
parameters nor average daily gain.  The incidence of the observed gross and
histologic lesions could not be correlated with treatment, since these lesions
were evenly distributed across all dose groups.  Likewise, the occurrence of
soft stools or pasted vents was observed equally in all groups and never
exceeded four birds per pen.<p>

Based upon the results of this study, the recommended therapeutic dose of 64 mg
of lincomycin soluble powder per gallon of drinking water for the control of
necrotic enteritis in growing broiler chickens appears to be non-toxic when
administered for up to 21 consecutive days.<p>

    g. Identity of substance and dosage form tested:  Lincomycin HCl premix 
       grade, U-10,149A, Lot # 025EU.  Dosage form: oral gavage.

    h. Species and strain of animal used:  Rat, Upj:TUC (SD) spf.

    i. Number of animals of each sex in each group:  96 females, 24 per 
       treatment group.

    j. Levels and duration of dosing:  Dosage levels (mg/kg) 0.0, 10.0, 30.0 
       and 100.0.  Duration of dosing: Ten days (days 6 through 15 of
       gestation).

    k. Route of drug administration:  Oral by gastric gavage.

    l. Parameters studies:  Dam conception rates and body weights were 
       evaluated.  Fetuses were weighted, sexed and evaluated for gross, 
       visceral and skeletal anomalies.

    m. Significant toxicities observed: The litter proportion of resorption
       increased significantly (P&lt;.05) and the litter proportions of          
       implants resulting in live fetuses decreased significantly (P&lt;.05) at
       the 100.0 mg/kg dose level.  However, the incidence (8.0%) of resorption
       in the 100.0 mg/kg group is similar to the overall incidence (5.3%) of
       resorption found in historical controls.

    n. No-observed-effect-level:  30 mg/kg body weight.

    o. Statistical analysis: The modified Cochran and Armitage Chi Square 
       Statistic (Thomas, Breslow and Gart, 1977) was used to test whether or 
       not there was a significant dose response with respect to the proportion
       of dams that conceived.  Dam body weight gains were analyzed using a 
       one-way analysis of variance (Snedecor and Cochran, 1971).

       Fetal body weights were analyzed using a weighted analysis of variance 
       with the litter as the experimental unit (Healy, 1972). Proportions per
       litter of live fetuses, resorption and alterations in development were
       analyzed using Alternatives Test (Lin and Haseman, 1976) to test for a
       significant dose response.

    p. Conclusions drawn from study:  It is concluded from the results that
       Lincomycin HCl premix was not teratogenic at 100 mg/kg, and was not
       embryotoxic at the 30 mg/kg dose level.

       effect, sex effect, and the treatment by sex interaction.

    p. Conclusion(s) drawn from the study: No real differences attributable 
       to lincomycin treatment were found for survival percentage, clinical and ophthalmological
       examinations, food consumption, organ weights, hematology, serum 
       chemistry determinations other than cholesterol and urinalysis.  
       Histopathologic examination revealed no real differences in tumor 
       incidence attributable to treatment. Complete histopathological 
       observation of the thyroids (report number 768-9610-81-002) indicated no
       treatment related effects of lincomycin on the thyroid. Incidence of 
       acute prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis was increased (P&lt;.05)
       in males treated with 1.50 mg/kg (premix grade) and 100 mg/kg (USP
       grade).  These lesions may be associated with the antibiotic properties 
       of lincomycin.  Lincomycin premix grade appeared to be growth promoting 
       in that the .750 mg/kg/day dose group increased body weight faster from
       initiation of the study through 574 days.

       Lot # 647AF and reference standard issue D.

    h. Species and strain of test animal used:  Not applicable.
 
    i. Number of animals of each sex in each group:  Not applicable.

    j. Levels and duration of dosing:  0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1,000 
       and 3,000 &#181;g U-10,149A/ml and solvent controls (DMSO in the negative
       control and 2-AAF in the positive control).

    k. Route of drug administration:  Treated culture.

    l. Parameters studied: This DNA repair assay measures unscheduled DNA 
       synthesis (UDS) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes treated with the 
       test compound in vitro.  This assay is useful as a genotoxicity screen       
       because it measures the repair of DNA damage induced by many classes of
       mutagens and carcinogens. Genotoxic compounds or their metabolites
       react with DNA to form adducts which are repaired by an enzymatic 
       process in which the adduct is excised, and the DNA strand is
       polymerized and ligated.  This process, referred to as unscheduled DNA
       synthesis, can be quantitated by measuring the incorporation of labeled
       thymidine into the nuclear DNA of cells not in S phase.  Thus, compounds
       that induce repairable DNA damage without inhibiting that repair can be 
       detected by measuring UDS.

       Primary hepatocytes are particularly useful for this assay because of 
       their high capacity to metabolize procarcinogens to a genotoxic form.  
       In addition, the cultures are essentially non-dividing, so that normal
       replicative DNA synthesis is too low to interfere with UDS detection.

    m. Significant toxicities observed: For Lot # 647AF, the grains/nucleus 
       (NG) counts were slightly increased (0-5 NG) at 1000 and 3000 &#181;g/ml
       in the second experiment.  For the Control Reference Standard U-10,149A,
       NG counts were also slightly increased at 1000 ug/ml.  NG increases at 
       300, 1000 and 3000 &#181;g/ml in the first experiment, and at 1000 
       &#181;g/ml in the second experiment were statistically significant, as
       were the dose responses for the NG and the percent of cells in repair.  
       These high doses showed a dose related cytotoxicity as indicated by a 
       granular appearance of the cells, which probably accounts for the NG 
       increases.  All of the NG values met our criteria for a non-positive or 
       inconclusive UDS response.

    n. No-observed-effect-level:  Not applicable.

    o. Statistical analysis, where appropriate:  Regression analysis of the NG 
       means was used to test for a significant dose response.

    p. Conclusion(s) drawn from this study:  The results with both lots of 
       U-10,149A were considered non-positive or inconclusive under the 
       conditions of this in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA repair assay.  The 
       results of this study are evaluated in the context of all genetic 
       toxicology data available on lincomycin.

       negative and positive controls, respectively.

    k. Route of drug administration:  Treated culture.

    l. Parameters studied: This DNA repair assay measures unscheduled DNA 
       synthesis (UDS) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes treated with the 
       test compound in vitro.  This assay is useful as a genotoxicity screen

       In addition, the cultures are essentially non dividing, so that normal
       replicative DNA synthesis is too low to interfere with UDS detection.

    m. Significant toxicities observed:   Due to unexplained toxicity, doses 
       above 16.7 &#181;g/ml could not be scored.  This toxic phenomenon was also 
       observed in a repeat assay.  The doses scored were 0.167, 0.50, 1.67, 
       5.0 and 16.7 &#181;g/ml.

       In both the initial and repeat assays on this lot (Lot # 647AF) of 
       lincomycin, the compound produced a positive response.  In the initial 
       experiment, a clear dose related increase in net nuclear grains was in 
       evidence from 1.67 to 16.7 &#181;g/ml, whereas only 5.0 and 16.7 mg/ml 
       produced a positive response in the replicated assay.  Nevertheless, the
       number of cells in repair increased significantly in both experiments 
       (maximum of about 80% of cells in repair at 16.7 &#181;g/ml).  The positive 
       (2-Acetylaminofluorene, 1x10 7 M) and negative (H20) controls performed as
       expected.

    n. No-observed-effect-level:  Not applicable.

    o. Statistical analysis, where appropriate:  None conducted.

    p. Conclusions drawn from this study:   The result of this assay of 
       lincomycin (U-10,140=9A, Lot #647AF) is positive in the rat primary 
       hepatocyte UDS assay under the conditions of the test.  However, an 
       in-depth analysis of all UDS data determined these results to be 
       artifactitious, and not indicative of lincomycin-related genotoxic 
       activity.  (See "Summary of UDS Assays" p.21)

    o. Statistical analysis, where appropriate:  None conducted.

    p. Conclusion(s) drawn from this study:   In the assay on this lot (control 
       reference standard issue D) of lincomycin, the compound produced a 
       negative response under the conditions of the test.  The positive and 
       negative controls performed as expected.  Thus, the result of this assay
       of lincomycin (U-10,149A, control reference standard D) is negative in 
       the rat primary hepatocyte UDS assay under the conditions of the test.

<b>Summary of UDS Assays:</B> <p>
Supplemental UDS data and documentation, including photomicrographs, presented to
the Agency indicated that the suspect UDS activity of lincomycin was: a)
artifactitious in the case of the studies conducted by Pharmakon (Report No.
7268-87-035), and; b) biologically meaningless in the case of studies conducted
by the Upjohn Co. (Report No. 7268-87-038).  Therefore, any UDS activity observed
was not considered indicative of lincomycin related genotoxic activity.  The
Agency has determined that the mutagenicity prerequisites of the Threshold
Assessment of lincomycin have been satisfied.<p>

  <b>Summary of Toxicity Tests:</b><p> The data presented in this section support the
  conclusion that lincomycin is not genotoxic or mutagenic.  Additionally, a no-observed-effect-level has been established as 30 mg/kg on the basis of
  embryotoxicity in the rat.<p>

<B>2. Safe Concentration of Total Residue</B><p>

  a. On the basis of the toxicology studies, the no-observed-effect-level from
     the most sensitive study in the most sensitive species was 30 mg/kg for
     embryotoxicity in segment II teratology study in rats.  A 1000X safety
     factor was used in calculating the safe concentration of total residue in
     edible tissue since the NOEL was established on the basis of subchronic 
     data.<p>

     liver had the highest level of total residues, 1.58 ppm at 0 hours, and is
     therefore the limiting tissue relative to the calculated safe 
     concentration. The major metabolites found in the liver at 0 hours in this
     study were lincomycin (20%), lincomycin sulfoxide (40%), 
     N-demethyllincomycin (5%), and N-demethyllincomycin sulfoxide (10%).<p>

     Rats were orally dosed at 300 mg/kg body weight with C-14 labeled 
     lincomycin for seven consecutive days, then sacrificed while on treatment.
     A comparison of the lincomycin metabolites in the chicken to the 
     lincomycin metabolites in the rat reveals that the rat can serve as the 
     suitable test animal for determination of the toxicological profile of the
     antibiotic since each metabolite present in the chicken is also present in
     the rat.  These data support the contention that the rat was autoexposed 
     to metabolites which humans would be exposed to from consuming edible 
     tissues of chickens treated with lincomycin.<p>

<B>4. Tolerance for the Marker Residue </B><p>
   Based on the toxicology data, and using the lowest No-Observed-Effect-Level
   of 30 mg/kg, a permitted Safe Concentration (SC) of 3 ppm in muscle, 6 ppm 
   in skin/fat and 9 ppm in liver was established (Part 2 of this section).<p>

   Total residues at zero day withdrawal are substantially lower than
   corresponding calculated safe concentrations for edible tissues, therefore,
   neither a marker compound nor a tolerance for a marker compound is required.
   The permitted safe concentration for total residues in edible tissues and
   the actual residues found are as follows:<p>

<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><p>

<pre>
                                  <b>Mean Lincomycin

   skin/fat            6.0              0.132 
   liver               9.0              1.580


</pre>   

<B>5. Study Establishing Withdrawal Period</B><p>

   Data presented in Parts 3 and 4 of this section showed that the mean
   concentrations of total lincomycin residues at zero day withdrawal
   following the administration of 128 mg/gallon (2X label dosage) were well 
   below the permitted Safe Concentration. Therefore, a zero day pre-slaughter 
   drug withdrawal has been established and no residue decline studies were 
   required.<p>

<B>6. Regulatory Method</B><p>

   A regulatory method is not required since the residue and toxicology data
   support a zero withdrawal period (see Part 5 of this section).<p>

<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>

The data submitted in support of the supplemental new animal drug application
satisfy the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that the
lincomycin hydrochloride when used under its proposed conditions of use, is
safe and effective for the control of necrotic enteritis caused by
<i>Clostridium perfringens</i>&#160; in broiler chickens.  Because the supplement
provided for a new indication for use of the drug product, this is a Category
II change under the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367).<p>

Human food safety data submitted in the application to establish a safe
concentration for lincomycin in the edible tissues of chickens show that the
total residue at zero day withdrawal are substantially lower than corresponding
calculated safe concentrations for edible tissues, i.e., 3 ppm in muscle, 6 ppm
in skin/fat, and 9 ppm in liver.  Under the Center's supplemental approval
policy ( 42 FR 64367</B>), this is a Category III change.  The existing tolerance of
0.1 ppm ( 21CFR556.360</B>) for negligible residues in the edible tissues of
chickens is deleted.<p>

Proper use by non-veterinarians can be expected because the conditions of
necrotic enteritis can be easily recognized by non-veterinarians.  Directions
are clearly written and there is reasonable certainty that the conditions of
use, including mixing directions, on the label can and will be followed by the
producer. For these reasons, the agency has concluded that the directions are
adequate for lay use, and the product is therefore approved for over-the-counter use.<p>

<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><P>
Studies were conducted to determine the dosage and formulation of praziquantel
which produced the most reliable results when used for the removal of tapeworms
from dogs and cats.<P>
Acceptable efficacy was established as 100% elimination of the tapeworm
parasites in all animals dosed.  Initial oral studies were done with a range of
dosages, some as low as 0.5 mg/kg body weight.  The results were not always
reproducible.  One study conducted by Dr. S.M. Kruckenberg, Manhattan, KS, also
determined that small dogs (less than 25 lbs) required a larger mg/kg dosage.
Dr. Kruckenberg than related the minimum effective dosage to the surface area
of the animal utilizing a formula in which the body weight is raised to the
three-quarter power and then multiplied by a constant.  Utilizing this formula
as a basis, the dosage schedule was then achieved.  The schedule was produced
in order to eliminate the need for the practicing veterinarian to use a fairly
complicated mathematical formula to calculate the minimum effective dose for
dogs which are at the lower end of the weight range, however, the safety
evaluations, as discussed below, allow for this higher dosage.<P>
Twenty-five separate well-controlled critical anthelmintic studies (which
involves the sacrificing of animals and examination to determine the number of
parasites in the intestinal tract) were conducted with the final tablet
formulation.  Investigators for these studies were Dr. M.L. Sharp, Vernon
Texas; Dr. S.M. Kruckenberg, Manhattan, KS; Dr. A.C. Todd, Madison, WI; and
Drs. D.D. Cox and R.G. Arther, Mobay Corporation, Animal Health Division,
Shawnee, KS.<P>
A summary table of the investigators' results appears below.  Two hundred and
ninety-two animals were studied; 157 (100 dogs and 57 cats) were treated with
praziquantel tablets orally or in food and 135 (80 dogs and 55 cats) served as
untreated controls.  Both natural and experimental infections were studied with
some animals being infected with two species of tapeworms.  All dogs and cats
treated according to the recommended dosage schedule, and some treated at less
than the recommended dosage schedule, were cleared of their tapeworm
infections.  At the same time, the untreated control animals, confirmed as
positive before treatment, maintained their tapeworm infections, with the
exception of four dogs and one cat that lost their infections spontaneously.
In these studies, praziquantel tablets were 100% effective in the treatment of
tapeworm infections of dogs and cats due to <i>Taenia pisiformis</i> ,
<i>Taenia taeniaeformis</i>&#160; and <i>Dipylidium caninum</i>.  Additionally
praziquantel effectively (100%) eliminated experimental <i>T. taeniaeformis</i>&#160;
infections as young as seven (7) days from cats.<P>

The field trials were well-controlled using bunamidine hydrochloride as the
positive control drug.  Overall, 279 dogs and 173 cats were studied, including
a wide range of ages, breeds, and weights of both sexes.  Praziquantel Tablets
were administered to 218 dogs and 135 cats while 61 dogs and 38 cats were dosed
with bunamidine hydrochloride.  Dosing was administered according to label
directions.  The animals were observed for the presence of tapeworms
proglottids 10-14 days post-treatment; any proglottid found was identified.
Investigators were asked to evaluate praziquantel for ease of administration,
efficacy and safety on a scale of excellent, good, fair and poor.
Investigators rated efficacy in dogs as excellent to good in 97% of the cases
in dogs and cats.  These trials confirmed preclinical efficacy results and
demonstrated that praziquantel tablets, when used according to label
directions, did have the effect it purports in its labeling.<P>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b><P>
<b>a. Preclinical Safety Evaluation</b><P>
The preclinical safety evaluations for this praziquantel tablet formulation
were conducted in the United States by or under the direction of Mobay
Corporation, Animal Health Division.<P>
<b>Dogs</b><P>
Dr. J.A. Shmidl of Shawnee, Kansas conducted a study consisting of treating six
dogs orally with tablet doses of 12.5 mg/kg with no effect on pregnancy,
lactation or 41-day old puppies.<P>
Two <i>Dirofilaria immitis</i>&#160;-infected dogs received 26-27 mg/kg oral
tablet treatment by Dr. R. Christie at Jackson, Mississippi with no effect on
microfilariae or adult heartworms.<P>
Dr. Shmidl concluded no clinical signs of toxicity following treatment of
two dogs at 25 and 50 mg/kg with tablets.<P>
Dr. Shmidl administered ten tablet treatments to one male dog at 12.5 mg/kg
with no effects on reproduction. He sired four normal litters in four
breeding attempts.<P>
Dr. Shmidl administered two tablet treatments at 14-day intervals to
eight dogs with either 100 or 200 mg/kg doses.  Vomition was the only sign of
toxicity.  Body weights, clinical pathology and histopathology were also
evaluated.<P>
Nine dogs (male and female) received tablet treatments up to 26.8 mg/kg
during critical stages of reproduction  by Dr. M. Barth of Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin.  No
effects occurred on fertility, conception, fetal development or pregnancy.<P>
Dr. Shmidl concluded that tablet treatment of five dogs with 2X labeled
doses had no effect on cholinesterase and was compatible with the simultaneous
use of carbamate compounds.<P>
Four puppies (4 1/2 to 5 weeks of age) received two 5X tablet treatment at
14 day intervals by Dr. Shmidl.  No effects were observed as to clinical
signs, body weights, gross- or histopathology.<P>
Dr. Shmidl treated eight dogs twice at 14 day intervals with 5X or 10X the
labeled tablet dose.  Their weight  range was five to 95 lb and the dosage rate
was up to 147.8 mg/kg.  Vomiting and diarrhea were the only clinical signs
with no significant effects on body temperature, cholinesterase values, body
weights, clinical pathology or histopathology.<P>
The tablet formulation has been administered to more than 4,480 dogs in
foreign countries at doses of 10 mg/kg and up to the label dose at monthly
intervals with no reported adverse reactions (Australia, South America and 
New Zealand).<P>
<b>Cats</b><P>
Dr. J.A. Shmidl in Shawnee, Kansas treated two cats orally with doses of 25 and
50 mg/kg.  There were no signs of clinical toxicity or evidence of gross
lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.<P>
Three cats received two oral 100 mg/kg treatments at 14 day intervals i a
study by Dr. Shmidl.  Only nausea and vomiting occurred in two animals with no
additional clinical signs observed.  No significant clinical pathology or
histopathology changes occurred.<P>
Dr. S.M. Kruckenberg reports on the oral treatment of seven cats (6 females
and 1 male) with a 5 mg/kg dose during all critical periods of reproduction.
Two groups of seven cats (6 females and 1 male) each were also treated
subcutaneously and intramuscularly with a praziquantel injectable solution with
a 5 mg/kg dose during all critical periods of reproduction.  Dr. Kruckenberg
further evaluated the oral use of praziquantel in one male  and three female
cats in a controlled study.  Two groups of 4 cats (1 male and 3 females) each
were also treated subcutaneously and intramuscularly with the praziquantel
injectable solution.  All treated cats received 3X the label rate.  Four
females and 1 male served as untreated controls.  The treated males received 7
treatments at 2-week intervals throughout the breeding season.  Each treated
female received a treatment prior to breeding, during the embryogenic period
of pregnancy, during late pregnancy and again during lactation.  The study
confirmed the lack of effects on fertility, conception, fetal development or
pregnancy when praziquantel was administered at 3X dosage levels.<P>
Eight cats received three oral doses by Dr. Shmidl at 14-day intervals of
either 5X or 10X the labeled rate.  No significant clinical signs of toxicity
were observed, nor did changes occur for hematology, clinical chemistry and
histopathology.<P>
Dr. Shmidl further treated two kittens (4 1/2 to 7 1/2 weeks old) twice at a
14-day interval.  The dosage rate was 5X the label dose.  Slight depression
was observed in one kitten.  No significant clinical toxicity signs or
clinical pathology and histopathology changes were attributed to this dosage
rate.<P>
<b>b. Clinical Field Trial Safety</b><P>
The tablet formulation was administered to 218 dogs (eight weeks to 16 years
of age and 1.5 to 122 lb) in clinical field trials.  Seven instances (3.2%) of
either vomiting, anorexia, lethargy or diarrhea were reported and were rated
as non-significant.<P>
The tablet formulation was further administered to 135 cats (eight weeks to
13 years of age and two to 19 lb) in clinical field trials.  One instance of 
diarrhea and one of salivation
(total = 2, 1.5%) were reported and were rated as non-significant.<P>
Five of 61 dogs (8.2%) receiving the positive control drug hydrochloride
were observed with side effects of diarrhea and vomiting following the
administration of clinically recommended dose.<P>
<b>c. Safety Summary</b><P>
In summary, the safety index for the use of praziquantel tablets in dogs has
been derived using the final tablet formulation (vomition was the pertinent
effect with dual treatments of up to 145.8 mg/kg at a 14-day interval).
Vomition at high doses is the typical side reaction which prevents serious
clinical toxicity signs from occurring. The safety factor is at least 5X the
label rate when the product is administered at 14 day intervals to puppies four
weeks of age and older.<P>
In summary, the safety index for the use of praziquantel tablets in cats has
been derived from controlled studies using the final tablet formulation
(vomition was the only effect with dual treatments of 100 mg/kg at a 14-day 
interval).  Vomition at high dosage rates is the typical reaction which
prevents significant clinical toxicity signs from occurring.  The safety factor 
is at least 5X the label rate when the
product is administered at 14 day intervals to kittens 5 1/2 weeks of age and 
older.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:<P>
A. Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><P>
Data on human safety pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food were
not required for approval of this NADA.  This product is labeled for use in
dogs and cats only, which are non-food animals.<P>
<b>B. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling, and Administration:</b><P>
The following warning statement pertaining to the safety of this drug
product in humans has been included in the labeling for this product:<P>
WARNING:  Keep out of reach of children.  Not for human use.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
Data submitted satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrate that praziquantel tablets, when used under the proposed conditions
of use, are safe and effective for the removal of <i>Dipylidium caninum</i>&#160; and
<i>Taenia pisiformis </i>&#160;in dogs and removal of <i>D. caninum</i>&#160; and <i>Taenia
taeniaeformis</i>&#160; from cats.<P>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR64367), this is a
Category II change.  The supplemental provides for OTC status (as Cutter
Tape-Tabs) for the claims mentioned above.<P>
The approval of this supplemental application has no adverse effect on the
safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug.  Accordingly, this approval
did not require a re-evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the
parent application.<P>
Since <i>D. caninum</i>&#160; and <i>Taenia </i>&#160;spp. have many proglottids which may
be shed and found in the environment, the general public can adequately
diagnose infection with these parasites.  The drug has been shown to be safe
for use in pregnant and breeding animals.  Praziquantel has been on the
market for several years and DER summaries do not provide a basis for refusal
of approval of OTC status.  For these reasons, Cutter Tape-Tabs is given OTC
status for the specific indications mentioned above.<P>

<b>Marketing Status:</b> Rx<P>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><P>
This Supplemental Application amends the NADA to provide for the use 
of Droncit Tablets against <i>Echinococcus multilocularis </i>&#160;in dogs. 
Droncit Tablets (NADA #111-798, 46 FR 60570 [December 11, 1981]) are 
currently approved for use in dogs and cats.<P>
<b>Approval date:</b> July, 16, 1993<P>
<b>II. Indications for Use:</b><P>
DOGS: For the removal of <i>Dipylidium caninum, Taenia pisiformis, Echinococcus
granulosus </i>&#160;and for the removal and control of <i>Echinococcus

<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><P>
<b>A. Pivotal Studies</b><P>
<b>1. Cross-reference to the existing FOI Summary for Droncit Cestocide Tablets
(NADA 111-798, 46 FR 60570 [December 11, 1981]).</b><P>
The original FOI summary contain the details of the dose titration, dose
confirmation and clinical field studies which established the dose and
effectiveness of those products in dogs (and cats). The laboratory studies
demonstrated at the recommended dose a complete (100%) elimination of the
various common cestode species claimed on the label. Clinical field studies
likewise established the effectiveness of praziquantel against the cestodes.<P>
<b>B. Pivotal - Well-Controlled Laboratory Effectiveness Studies</b><P>
<b>1. Efficacy of Praziquantel (Droncit) Against <i>Echinococcus multilocularis
</i>&#160;in Dogs - K.R. Kazacos, West Lafayette, IN</b><P>
A controlled anthelmintic trial was conducted on 24 dogs according to CVM's
Canine/Feline Anthelmintic Guidelines. All were adults of various mixed breeds,
equal sex, ranging from 29 to 50 lbs. (13.2 to 22.7 kg) body weight. The dogs
were randomly divided into 3 groups of 12. Twelve dogs were dosed according to
the approved label (range = 4.8-7.0 mg/kg body weight) with the marketed 34 mg
tablets, given orally directly by mouth. The remaining 12 dogs were untreated
controls. Blinding of those doing the evaluations was used to minimize any
potential bias.<P>
The test animals, prior to treatment evaluation, were each experimentally
infected with <i>Echinococcus multilocularis. </i>This was done by feeding each
dog an estimated minimum of 100,000 protoscolices harvested from infected
gerbils. Because of the risk of a potentially fatal infection to those
conducting the study, dosing was accomplished at 21 days after administering
the protoscolices and necropsy was at 28 days. Diagnosis was by postmortem
counting of <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;parasites. Also, each dog was observed at
least twice daily from infection through necropsy for any indication of
abnormal reactions or side effects.<P>
All 12 control dogs were infected with an average of 41,492 adult <i>E.
multilocularis. </i>&#160;By comparison, all treated dogs, 12 with tablets, were
completely negative for <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;(and as well for other
cestodes), i.e. 100% elimination. No adverse clinical signs or reactions
related to either the experimental infection or praziquantel treatment were
observed.<P>
Praziquantel was effective and safe in treating <i>E. multilocularis
</i>&#160;infections in dogs.<P>
<b>2. Efficacy of Praziquantel (Droncit) Against Immature <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis </i>Infections in Dogs - K.R. Kazacos, West Lafayette, IN</b><P>
This was an 8-dog controlled anthelmintic trial conducted according to CVM's
Canine/Feline Anthelmintic Guidelines. All were adults of various mixed breeds,
equal sex, ranging from 34 to 52 lbs. (15.4 to 23.6 kg). The dogs were randomly
divided into 4 groups of 2 dogs. Groups 1 through 3 were evaluated at 1, 7 and
14 days after experimental inoculation with a minimum of 100,000 protoscolices
per dog. Group 4, infected the same, was evaluated following parasite
maturation, for egg shedding in the feces. Blinding of those doing the
evaluations was used to minimize any potential bias.<P>
Treated dogs received the label recommended dose (range 5.0 - 5.8 mg/kg body
weight) of the currently marketed Droncit formulation. They received an oral
dose of the 34 mg canine tablets. The treated dogs were all compared with the
same number of untreated controls. There was one exception in Group 4. The 2
control dogs were held, by design, after necropsy of the treated dogs. At the
conclusion of the egg monitoring interval, following all egg count comparisons,
those dogs were also treated. The purpose was to observe the impact of
praziquantel on more mature infections.<P>
Evaluations in this study included the impact of praziquantel on immature and
mature <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160; infections. Groups 1 through 3 were compared
with untreated controls for actual parasite counts. No parasite count
comparisons were possible in Group 4, as all of these dogs were eventually
treated with praziquantel after evaluation of patent infections and egg
shedding patterns. All animals were observed at least twice daily from
infection through necropsy for evidence of adverse effects or reactions.<P>
The untreated controls averaged 46,317 <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;per dog; all
were infected. All treated dogs had no <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;at necropsy,
i.e. 100% elimination. Treatment of mature infections produced a spike in egg
counts that lasted for up to 60 hours depending on the dog's fecal habits. The
peak counts in the treated dogs were many times less than the dog allowed to
continue shedding without treatment. No adverse effects or reactions were
observed.<P>
Praziquantel was effective and safe for the treatment of immature <i>E.
multilocularis </i>&#160;infections in dogs.<P>
<b>C. Clinical Efficacy Trial<P>
1. A Program to Reduce the Risk of Infection by <i>Echinococcus multilocularis: </i>&#160;
The Use of Praziquantel to Control the Cestode in a
Village in the Hyperendemic Region of Alaska - R.L. Rausch, J.F. Wilson and
P.M. Schantz - Anchorage, AK</b><P>
St. Lawrence Island in Alaska was the site of a 10-year clinical anthelmintic
evaluation of the marketed tablet formulation of praziquantel. No treatments
were given for the first 3 years during which the population of the larval
stage of <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;was monitored in voles captured from the town
of Savoonga. An estimated 80-90 dogs from Savoonga were dosed on a monthly
basis for 7 consecutive years following the initial monitoring. The dogs were
Huskies and other miscellaneous breeds of both sexes including a wide range of
ages and weights. All dogs were dosed orally according to the established label
recommendations.<P>
This island is part of a hyperendemic region for <i>E. muItiIocularis.
</i>&#160;The complete life cycle of the parasite occurs on the island. <i>E.
multilocularis </i>&#160;is passed between the Northern Voles and both wild (e.g.
foxes) and domestic (e.g. dogs) canids. Humans, through contact with the canid
hosts, occasionally contract the disease. The purpose of the study was to
monitor the infection rate of the parasite in the voles once yearly. Humans are
an accidental host, taking the place of the vole.<P>
Monitoring the impact of praziquantel through the vole infection rate was
considered by the investigators as a good measure of the exposure rate
encountered by humans. Voles from the town were considered as being exposed to
praziquantel-treated canids. Those captured outside the town were controls as
they were exposed, primarily, to feces from untreated canids. This was a
practical method for evaluating clinical response in a natural clinical
setting. Diagnosis, therefore, was based on positive identification of the
parasite in voles.<P>
Over the first 3 years with no treatment, 29% of the voles in Savoonga were
identified with <i>E. multilocularis</i>.&#160;By the third year of praziquantel
dosing, the vole infection rate in Savoonga had dropped to 1%. Over the 7-year
period of dosing, the average reduction in the vole infection rate was 83%.
This translates to a similar reduction in the risk of a human infection. There
were no reported adverse effects identified by the investigators following
praziquantel dosing.<P>
Praziquantel was safe for repeat administration over an extended period of
multiple dosing. The beneficial impact of treatment was clear. The drug was
safe and effective in the treatment and control of natural <i>E. multilocularis
</i>&#160; infections in a clinical setting.<P>
<b>D. Corroborative Studies (Published Articles/Abstracts)<P>
1. Cross-reference to the existing FOI Summary for Vercom (febantel/praziquantel) 
Paste (NADA 133-953, 50 FR 19167 [May 7, 1985]).</b><P>
Laboratory and clinical data gathered by the sponsor confirms the activity of
praziquantel against cestode parasites, i.e. 100% elimination.<P>
<b>2. Efficacy of Praziquantel Against Immature <i>Echinococcus multilocularis </i>&#160;in 
Dogs and Cats - F.L. Andersen, J.R. Crellin and D.D. Cox, Provo, UT</b><P>
This was a controlled anthelmintic study involving experimentally induced <i>E.
multilocularis </i>&#160;infections derived from cystic material in cotton rats. The
eighteen dogs were each equally divided between an unmedicated control group
and a treated group, given an intramuscular dose of the injectable solution.
The dogs consisted of purebred and mixed breeds of both sexes and different
ages, ranging from 7 to 50 lbs. (3.2 to 22.7 kg) body weight.<P>
Diagnosis was based on the identification of the parasite during necropsy.
Treatments were given 21 days after infection and necropsy of all animals was
28 days after infection.<P>
At necropsy, all 9 control dogs were infected. All dogs treated with
praziquantel were negative for <i>E. multilocularis, </i>&#160;i.e. 100% elimination.
Signs of toxicosis were not observed in any animals.<P>
The injectable formulation of praziquantel was effective and safe for the
elimination of <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;in dogs.<P>
<b>3. Efficacy of a Combined Paste Formulation of Praziquantel/Febantel 
Against Immature <i>Echinococcus granulosus </i>&#160;and immature <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis </i>&#160;- F.L. Andersen, J.A. Short and H.D. McCurdy, Provo, UT</b><P>
A controlled anthelmintic study was conducted on 12 dogs using experimentally
induced infections of <i>E. multilocularis</i>.&#160;The dogs were of multiple
breeds and ages, of both sexes, ranging from 19 to 62 lbs. (8.4 to 28.2 kg)
body weight. The dogs were given 25,000 <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;protoscolices
from cotton rats. The dogs were divided into two groups of six. All treated
dogs were dosed orally for three consecutive days beginning on day 21 
after infection according to the label recommended dosages using the
formulation intended for market. All were necropsied 28 days after infection.
Diagnosis was based on the identification of the <i>Echinococcus </i>&#160;spp.
collected from the intestinal tract.<P>
All <i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;infected controls were positive at necropsy for
their respective parasite. All treated dogs with both <i>Echinococcus</i>&#160; parasites
were negative, i.e. 100% elimination. No adverse side effects were reported
from any of the treated animals. Praziquantel, combined with febantel in a
paste formulation, was effective and safe when used for the elimination of
<i>E. multilocularis </i>&#160;in dogs.<P>
<b>V. Animal Safety:<P>
A. Pivotal Confirmation of Safety<P>
1. Cross reference to the existing FOI Summary for Droncit Cestocide Tablets
(NADA 111-798, 46 FR 60570 [December 11, 1981]).</b><P>
The original FOI summary details the safety evaluation conducted in support of
the approval for this product. The safety data include both laboratory and
clinical evaluations conducted in accordance with existing FDA guidelines and a
wide margin of safety was demonstrated for the praziquantel formulation.<P>
The two laboratory effectiveness trials referenced above (IVB1 &#38; 2), the 10
year clinical efficacy study, as summarized above, and the 11 years of
marketing the products to date have confirmed the safety of this drug.<P>
<b>2. A Programme to Reduce the Risk of Infection by <i>Echinococcus 
multilocularis</i>:&#160;The Use of Praziquantel to Control the Cestode in a Village
in the Hyperendemic Region of Alaska - R.L. Rausch, J.F. Wilson and P.M. 
Schantz, Anchorage, AK.</b><P>
This was a seven year study in which 80-90 dogs were dosed at the label
recommended rate at 30 day intervals continuously. No adverse effects were
reported by the investigators. Multiple dosing with praziquantel tablets over
an extended time was safe for the treated animals.<P>
<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><P>
<b>A. Human Food Safety</b><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for the approval of this supplemental NADA. The drug is labeled
for use in dogs which are non-food animals.<P>
<b>B. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration</b><P>
The labeling contains an adequate warning statement: "Warning: Keep Out of
Reach of Children".<P>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. The
data demonstrate that Droncit&#174; (praziquantel) 34 mg tablets, when used under
the labeled conditions of use, are safe and effective.<P>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106), this
is a Category II change. This supplement provides for the additional claim to
include the removal and control of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis </i>&#160; The 
approval of this change has no adverse effect on the safety and
effectiveness of the new animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not
require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent
application.<P>
For this supplement, the drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian because professional expertise and proper diagnosis are
required to determine when removal or control of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis
</i>&#160; infection is indicated.<P>
For new animal drugs for use in non food-producing animals, Section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of
1988, provides for a three year period of exclusivity for a supplemental
application which contains reports of new clinical or field investigations
(other than bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of the supplement
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This supplemental NADA qualifies
for such an exclusivity period (new claim only), which will expire three years
from the date of this approval.<P>

<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b><P>
EQVALAN liquid is formulated for administration by stomach tube or
as an oral drench. The recommended dosage is 200 micrograms of ivermectin per kilogram of body weight
(0.2 mg/kg or 91 mcg/lb). Each ml of EQVALAN liquid contains 10 mg of 
ivermectin, sufficient to treat 110 lb (50 kg) of horse body weight; 
10 ml will treat an 1100 lb (500 kg) horse.<P>
<b>4. Effectiveness</b>:<P>
The New Animal Drug Application for ivermectin liquid for horses contains data
demonstrating that the product is the therapeutic equivalent of EQVALAN paste.
Therefore, the full spectrum of indications for use of EQVALAN paste (NADA
134-314) is applicable to EQVALAN liquid. The therapeutic equivalence demonstrated
in the controlled efficacy confirmation trial and the five field trials is supported
by the data from a bioavailability trial where the liquid and paste formulation
were compared.<P>
<b>Pivotal Studies</b><P>
<b>Controlled Efficacy Trial</b><P> 
One controlled efficacy confirmation trial was conducted by Dr. Joseph A. DiPietro 
at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, using 15 horses that were given
induced ascarid infections. When the infections were 11 days old, horses were
randomly allocated to an unmedicated control group, or to treatment with ivermectin
liquid as an oral drench or with EQVALAN paste (5 horses per group). No <i>Parascaris
equorum </i>&#160;were found at necropsy, 14 days after treatment, in any ivermectin
liquid- or ivermectin paste-treated horse, while all 5 controls were infected with
an average of 1136 <i>P. equorum.</i> While the immature (migrating) ascarid is not
currently included as a claim in the indications for use of ivermectin, it is
known to be difficult to control.<P>
<b>Field Trials</b><P>
Five field trials with 471 horses were conducted in the United States and
Canada, one each in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Texas and Saskatchewan.  The
investigators are listed below:<P>

All
471 horses (from 15 days old to 24 years old) in these 5 field trials
received ivermectin at use level:  250 horses received ivermectin liquid as a
drench, 117 horses received the liquid by stomach tube, and 104 horses got
EQVALAN Paste.  These numbers include the horses used as concurrent untreated
controls and subsequently treated with ivermectin.<P>
These trials were run under practical field conditions with the market
formulation of EQVALAN liquid to assess the acceptability of the product in
horses when administered as an oral drench or by nasogastric intubation, and to
confirm its efficacy (by fecal egg counts) when given at 1 ml per 50 kg of body
weight (i.e., at 200 mcg/kg).<P>
All of the trials were conducted similarly.  Horses had natural infections of
internal parasites and no anthelmintics were used on trial animals for at least
six weeks before the trial start date. An acclimation period of at least 7
days was provided at each site.  Feed, water and housing were given according
to the usual practices at each property.<P>
At each U.S. trial location, replicates of four horses were formed based on order
of presentation or based on pretreatment fecal egg count.  All horses in a
replicate were housed, managed, and handled similarly.  Within each replicate,
1 horse was assigned to be an unmedicated control, 1 horse was assigned to
receive ivermectin liquid by nasogastric tube, and 2 horses were assigned to
receive ivermectin liquid as a drench.  The Canadian field trial differed from
the 4 U.S. trials in that one each of the 4 horses in a replicate was randomly
assigned to an unmedicated control group or to treatment with ivermectin liquid
as a drench or by stomach tube, or to treatment with EQVALAN paste.<P>
The assigned ivermectin liquid treatments were administered on Day 0, at the
rate of 1 ml per 50 kg of horse body weight (200 mcg of ivermectin/kg).  Horses
were weighed, or had their weights estimated (by girth tape), within a few days
prior to Day 0. Ivermectin liquid was administered undiluted.  For each
horse in the tubing group, at least 200 ml of clean water was flushed through
the tubing equipment <i>in situ</i>&#160; immediately after the administration of ivermectin
liquid.<P>
Fecal samples were collected from 471 horses, and examined for parasite eggs on
or before Day 0, and most horses were sampled again on Day 13 or 14.  At the
time of the second sampling, control horses were treated with ivermectin liquid
as a drench or with EQVALAN paste.  Almost all of these horses had fecal
samples taken one more time, usually 2 weeks later, except for the 29
controls in the Canadian field trial.<P>
Fecal samples were generally examined by a modified McMaster procedure.  Most
samples with a count of 100 or fewer eggs per gram of feces (EPG count) were
examined again with a direct flotation technique.  Eggs were classified and
recorded by type as <i>Parascaris equorum, Strongyloides westeri </i>, or
strongylids.<P>
For each trial, total EPG counts (i.e., total counts of all types of nematode
eggs per horse) were analyzed for differences among treatment groups on Day 13
or 14 using Friedman's test, a nonparametric chi-square test for randomized
block designs.  Two treatment contrasts were of interest:  control vs.
ivermectin liquid by stomach tube, and control vs. ivermectin liquid as a
drench.  In each trial both contrasts were significant at P&#60;.01.<P>
Natural parasitic infections were confirmed for 441 of the animals on or before
the trial start day.  On Day 13 or 14, eggs of parasitic nematodes were found
in the feces of 107 of 114 sampled untreated controls, while only 14 of 301
sampled horses that received ivermectin liquid had strongyle type eggs in their
feces, and none of 29 horses given EQVALAN paste had parasite eggs.  Of the 14
ivermectin liquid-treated horses with positive counts two weeks after
treatment, only 2 had counts detectable by the modified McMaster procedure
(50 and 300 epg); the others had eggs observed only on the more sensitive
direct flotation.  Fourteen or 16 days after the controls were treated with
ivermectin, strongyle-type eggs were found in the feces of 4 of 41 horses
that received ivermectin liquid as a drench, and on 4 of 40 horses that got
EQVALAN paste.  Included in these trials were 58 horses positive for ascarid
eggs prior to treatment with ivermectin liquid (29 tubed, 29 drenched) but
negative 14 days after treatment, and 26 horses with <i>Strongyloides westeri</i>&#160; eggs
prior to treatment (8 tubed, 18 drenched) but with none 14 days after
treatment).<P>
All horses treated with ivermectin liquid were closely monitored immediately
after treatment and observed daily for 13 or 14 days. Also, the oral cavities
of all horses receiving ivermectin liquid as an oral drench were examined for
abnormalities.<P>
No adverse reactions attributed to ivermectin treatment were reported for any
horse.  One mare had colic 11 days after treatment and 1 gelding was
euthanized on Day 14 suffering from an acute central nervous system disorder;
necropsy revealed severe multifocal encephalomalacia consistent with
septicemia.  No abnormalities were found in the oral cavity of any horse given
ivermectin liquid as a drench.<P>
<b>Supporting Data<P>
Bioavailability</b><P>
A bioavailability trial was conducted by Dr. Richard L. Asquith at the
University of Florida, Ocala, Florida, utilizing 13 healthy pregnant mares.  One
horse was randomly selected to be an unmedicated control whose plasma was used
to verify the absence of ivermectin.  Pairs of horses were formed based on
breed, body condition and weight.  Within pairs, one horse received EQVALAN
paste orally at 200 mcg/kg and the other received ivermectin liquid by
nasogastric intubation at 200 mcg/kg.  Blood samples were collected from each
mare prior to treatment and at appropriate intervals following treatment.<P>
Plasma samples were assayed for ivermectin.  Area under the plasma time curve
(AUC) was computed for each animal.  The natural logarithm transformation was
found to help homogeneity of variance for AUC; plasma concentration data and
time-to-peak were not transformed.  Peak plasma value, log (AUC), and
time-to-peak were analyzed, with and without a rank transformation, using
analysis of variance for a repeated measures design, to investigate whether the
treatment profiles were similar.  The conclusions were the same whether or not
the rank transformation was used.<P>
All plasma samples for the control horse and all pretreatment samples were free
of ivermectin.  Ivermectin liquid had a higher and earlier peak plasma
ivermectin concentration than EQVALAN paste.  The differences between
formulations were confined to the first 24 hours after dosing (see Figure 1).
After that time, the profiles of the two formulations were almost identical and
the difference in area under the plasma time curves was only 12%. Ivermectin
liquid provides equivalent parasite exposure to ivermectin and, therefore,
equivalent efficacy against the same spectrum of equine parasites as the
paste.<P>
<IMG SRC="140439.gif" ALT="MEAN PLASMA CONCENTRATION (NG/ML) OVER TIME, IVERMECTIN LIQUID VS PASTE, AT 200 MCG/KG"><P>
<b>Conclusion</b><P>
The therapeutic equivalence of ivermectin liquid to EQVALAN paste was confirmed
in one controlled efficacy confirmation comparison trial and in 5 field trials.
The efficacy was demonstrated as a drench or by nasogastric tube.<P>
EQVALAN liquid has the same indications for treatment and control of parasites
and parasitic conditions as has EQVALAN paste.<P>
<b>5. Safety in the Target Animal</b><P>
<b>Pivotal Studies</b><P>
<b>NADA 134-314 and 127-443</b><P>
The safety of ivermectin in horses has been established in trials included in
previous submissions (EQVALAN paste; NADA 134-314 and EQVALAN injection; NADA
127-443).  Information on these studies is included in the Freedom of
Information Summaries for these previously approved products.<P>

<b>Breeding Animal Safety - Horses</b><P>
Two teratology trials were conducted in which mares were given ivermectin paste
at 600 mcg/kg six times at two-week intervals during the period of
organogenesis.  Two additional trials were conducted where mares were treated
six or seven times with ivermectin injection at 600 mcg/kg at two months of
pregnancy.  A stallion breeding safety trial was also conducted in which
stallions received a single treatment of ivermectin injection at 600 mcg/kg.
No adverse effects on reproduction were seen in these trials and it was
concluded that ivermectin may be used safely in breeding stallions and in
pregnant mares.  These trials are more fully described in the Freedom of
Information Summary for EQVALAN paste.<P>
<b>Supporting Data</b><P>
Ivermectin liquid for horses has been tested in a tolerance trial conducted
using repeated administrations at 3 and 5 times use level.  The clinical
field trials discussed in the previous section also demonstrated safety and
acceptability of ivermectin liquid under commonly experienced field
conditions.<P>
<b>Tolerance</b><P>
The tolerance trial was conducted by Dr. Joseph A. DiPietro, University of
Illinois, Urbana, IL, in young foals because they are considered to be the most
sensitive age of horse based on studies with EQVALAN paste.  Young foals were
given repeated doses of ivermectin liquid at 0, 3 or 5 times use
level, i.e., at 0, 600 or 1000 mcg/kg.  This trial was conducted using 18
standardbred foals that were from 24 to 92 days old on Day 0.<P>
The foals were kept on pasture and received a dietary supplement. Well water
was available.  Replicates of 3 foals were formed based on sex and
pretreatment weight.  Within replicates, foals were randomly allocated to
receive a water treatment (placebo control), or ivermectin liquid as a drench
at 600 or at 1000 mcg/kg.  Assigned treatments were administered on Days 0,
14 and 28 to each foal.  The dose for each foal was calculated based on the
weight obtained 2 days prior to each of the 3 treatment administrations.
Procedures were followed during dosing to ensure that the drug was retained.<P>
Thorough physical examinations were made of each foal before treatment and on
Day 35; clinical observations were made daily. The foals were closely monitored
and examined for toxic signs for several days following each treatment.  If any
one of the observations in the examination for primary toxic signs was other
than "normal", a more detailed examination for secondary toxic signs was
conducted.<P>
None of the 6 foals given 3 exposures to 5 times the use level of
ivermectin liquid had adverse reactions or toxic signs.<P>
Those reactions which were considered not related to ivermectin treatment at 3
times use level included respiratory infections, a submandibular lymph node
enlargement and diarrhea. Reactions similar to these were observed in the control
foals.<P>
Two of the foals given ivermectin liquid at 3 times use level had front
limb lameness after their third exposure to the drug. The cause of this
lameness could not be determined.  In both foals, all signs resolved
completely.<P>
<b>Laboratory Animals - Teratology</b><P>
Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, rabbits, and mice at or
near maternotoxic dose levels.  At these high doses, evidence of a teratogenic
effect is limited to cleft palate that occurs at a low frequency in all three
species and clubbing of the forepaws which occurs only in rabbit fetuses.  Mice
are the most sensitive species to the effects of ivermectin with
maternotoxicity at a dose of 200 mcg/kg/day and teratogenicity at 400
mcg/kg/day.  In rabbits 6000 mcg/kg/day was maternotoxic and teratogenic, and
teratogenicity was also evident at a dose of 3000 mcg/kg/day.  The threshold for
both maternotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats was 10,000 mcg/kg/day.<P>
<b>Breeding Animal Safety - Other Domestic Animals</b><P>
The Freedom of Information Summaries for IVOMEC injection for cattle, IVOMEC
injection for swine, IVOMEC paste for cattle and HEARTGARD 30 Tablets for dogs
describe various breeding safety studies in the respective target animals.  In
each of these species ivermectin has been found safe for use in breeding
animals.<P>
<b>Conclusions</b><P>
There are insufficient data to determine safety of ivermectin liquid in foals
less than 4 months old.<P>
Demonstration of the safety and acceptability of ivermectin liquid in horses
was found in the 5 field trials conducted using 471 horses.  Ivermectin
liquid was given once, at use level, to 367 of these horses (250 were drenched,
117 were tubed).  No adverse reactions attributable to ivermectin liquid were
observed.  Both routes of administration were satisfactory.<P>
The safety seen in these trials was expected, based on the previously reported
safety trials where high levels of ivermectin, up to 12 mg/kg (12,000 mcg/kg),
were administered to horses by intramuscular injection or orally.  These
studies demonstrate that EQVALAN liquid is safe for use in horses, including
breeding animals.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety</b><P>
As labeled the drug poses no hazard to human safety pertaining to drug
residues, because it is labeled "not for use in horses intended for food".  The
labeling contains adequate caution statements and instructions for the safe use
of EQVALAN liquid by experts (veterinarians).<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  It
demonstrates EQVALAN (ivermectin) liquid when used under its labeled conditions
of use is safe and effective.<P>
Because the route and techniques for administration (nasogastric intubation and
drenching) require the expertise of a veterinarian, EQVALAN (ivermectin) liquid
is labeled for prescription use even though the efficacy of the product covers
all the economically important parasites of the horse.<P>

<b>B. Route of Administration:</b> Intramuscular injection<p>
<b>C. Recommended Dosage</b><p>
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Solution should be administered to swine at a dosage
of 1.36 to 2.27 mg ceftiofur per pound of body weight (3.0 mg to 5 mg
ceftiofur per kilogram of body weight). This translates to 1 mL
reconstituted sterile solution per 37 to 22 pounds of body weight (17
to 10 kilograms of body weight).<p>

<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>
<b>A. Pivotal Studies</b><p>
<b>(1) Dose-Finding Study</b><p>
<b>(a) Type of Study </b>- Experimental Challenge:<p>
This study is described as a dose-finding study to provide efficacy
data at various doses of ceftiofur compared with that of the
nontreated groups. Growing pigs were challenged intranasally with <i>A.
pleuropneumoniae</i>&#160; organisms and were treated with either no drug or
ceftiofur at 1, 3, or 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (.45, 1.36, or
2.27 mg/pound) as their rectal temperature reached 1.04&#176;F after 
challenge. Drug and placebo treatments were administered at 24 hr
intervals for 3 consecutive days.<p>
<b>(b) Investigator:</b><p>
E. K. Uhlenhopp, D.V.M., M.S.<br>
Section Head, Veterinary Field Services<br>
Iowa State University<br>
Ames, Iowa 50011<p>
<b>(c) General Design:</b> The purpose of this study was to provide
information about the effectiveness of ceftiofur at various doses in
an attempt to describe an optimal dose for bacterial swine pneumonia.<p>
<b>(d) Animals:</b><ul><p>
<li>30 to 60 pound feeder pigs<p>
<li>free of <i>H.pp</i>&#160; antibodies<p>
<li>crossbred barrows and gilts<p>
<li>30 pigs in each of 4 treatment groups for a total of 120 animals</ul><p>
<b>(e) Control:</b><p>
The control or placebo was sterile saline which was injected
intramuscularly at 1 mL per 5 kg of body weight (1 mL/11 pounds of
body weight) as pigs' temperature reached 104&#176;F and at 24 hour
intervals until 3 doses were given.<p>
<b>(f) Diagnosis:</b><p>
After intranasal challenge with a serotype   5 strain of <i>A.
pleuropneumoniae </i>, the pigs were observed for signs of pneumonia and
their rectal temperatures were checked at 3-hour intervals. A sudden
rise in body temperature was determined to be a good indication of
the peracute nature of the disease. As the temperature of each pig
reached 1.04&#176;F after challenge, the first treatment was administered. <p>
<b>(g) Dosage Form:</b><p>
The dosage form of ceftiofur was a sterile powder reconstituted with
sterile water for injection. This dosage is the marketed form of
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder.<p>
<b>(h) Route of Administration:</b><p>
Route of administration was intramuscular injection into the neck
region of each pig.<p>
<b>(i) Dosages:</b><p>
Dosages used were placebo (0), 1, 3 or 5 mg of ceftiofur equivalents
per kilogram of body weight (0, .45, 1.36 or 2.27 mg per pound of
body weight).<p>
<b>(j) Test Duration:</b><p>
The drug treatments and placebo were administered for 3 consecutive
days. Fourteen days after challenge lung lesion scores and mortality
were calculated.<p>
<b>(k) Parameters of Measure:</b><UL><p>
<LI>mortality<br>
<LI>lung lesion scores<br>
<LI>live pig days<br>
<LI>clinical signs of pneumonia</ul><p>
<b>(l) Results:</b><p>
Compared with the negative controls, mortality was significantly
reduced as a result of the 3 and the 5 mg ceftiofur (1.36 and the
2.27 mg/pound) dose but not the 1 mg (.45 mg/pound) dose. All three
ceftiofur treatments significantly reduced lung lesion scores when
compared with the scores of the nontreated pigs. Live pig days and
clinical signs of pneumonia improved in a linear relationship with
dose, but differences between doses of ceftiofur were not
significant.<p>

</pre>
<b>(n) Conclusions:</b><p>
Based on the analysis of the data from the primary measures 
       (mortality, lung lesion scores, and live pig days) there is a linear 
       relationship with dose and effectiveness of the drug. The optimal 
       effective dose of ceftiofur for the treatment of experimentally 
       induced bacterial pneumonia caused by <i>A. pleuropneumoniae</i>&#160; was nearly 
       reached at the 5 mg/kg dose administered daily for 3 consecutive days 
       (2.27 mg/pound dose administered daily for 3 days).<p>
<b>(o) Adverse Reactions:</b><p>
Some animals showed signs of local transient pain as a result of the 
intramuscular injection, but no evidence of any adverse effects of 
ceftiofur was noted.<p>
<b>(2) Clinical or Field Study<p>
(a) Type of Study -</b> Natural Outbreaks:<p>
This field study was an 11-location (10 in the USA and one in Canada)

<b>(c) General Design of the Investigation:</b><p>
This study was a randomized complete block design at each location.<p>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 mg  
and 5 mg ceftiofur equivalents per kg of body weight (1.36 mg and  
2.27 mg/pound) when administered intramuscularly for three  
consecutive days to pigs experiencing natural occurrences of  
bacterial respiratory disease (bacterial pneumonia).<p>
<b>(d) Animals:</b><p>
A total of 1,762 feeder pigs were used in this clinical trial. Most  
of the pigs were crossbreds and ranged in weight from 32 pounds to  
148 pounds at the time of the first treatment. Within a location,  
pigs were of similar age and weight.<p>
<b>(e) Control:</b><p>
The control of placebo was sterile saline for injection and was  
administered to the control pigs at the same volume as the NAXCEL&#174;  
was administered. At each location separate controls within each pen  
were used for comparison to the 3 mg and 5 mg ceftiofur treated  
groups.<p>
<b>(f) Diagnosis:</b><p>
The investigator at each location (a veterinarian) made a clinical  
diagnosis prior to treatment. After treatment was initiated, the  
diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory diagnostic identification of  
the causative agent(s) recovered from lung tissue and adjacent lymph  
nodes from necropsied pigs.<p>
<b>(g) Dosage Form:</b><p>
The dosage form of ceftiofur was a sterile powder reconstituted with  
sterile water for injection. This dosage is the marketed form of  
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder.<p>
<b>(h) Route of Administration:</b><p>
Route of administration was intramuscular injection into the neck  
region of each pig.<p>
<b>(i) Dosage:</b><p>
Dosages tested were 3 mg and 5 mg ceftiofur equivalents per kg of  
body weight administered for 3 days. This equals 1.36 mg and 2.27 mg  
of ceftiofur equivalents per pound of body weight for 3 days.<p>
<b>(j) Test Duration:</b><p>
The drug treatments and placebo were administered for 3 consecutive  
days. On day 7 after first treatment two randomly selected pigs from  
each treatment group at each location were necropsied to evaluate  
lung lesions. On day 14 after first treatment the trials ended and  
all survivors were weighed to determine the number of pigs that had  
gained weight. An additional 14 day non-experimental observation  
period followed the 14 days of the trial.<p>
<b>(k) Parameters of Measure:</b><ul><p>
<LI>mortality<br>
<LI>lung lesion scores<br>
<LI>gainers' (pigs that survived and gained 5 pounds in 14 days)</ul><p>
<b>(l) Results:</b><p>
Based on the above parameters, both the 1.36 mg and the 2.27 mg  
ceftiofur per pound of body weight doses (3 and 5 mg/kg of body  
weight) were determined to be effective. The 1.36 mg/pound dose (3  
mg/kg) significantly reduced mortality, lung lesion scores and  
improved gainers when compared with the pigs that received the  
placebo. The 2.27 mg/pound dose (5 mg/kg) produced non-significant  
reductions in mortality and lesion scores and significant improvement  
in gainers when compared with the non-antibiotic treated pigs.<p>

<b>(n) Conclusions:</b><p>
Based on the analysis of the data from this 11 location field trial,                            
it was concluded that ceftiofur administered as ceftiofur sodium                            
(NAXCEL&#174;) is an effective treatment for bacterial pneumonia of swine.                            
Both the 1.36 mg/pound (3.0 mg/kg) and the 2.27 mg/pound (5.0 mg/kg)                            
doses of ceftiofur were determined to be effective.<p>

</pre>
Pigs which died on days one through seven were necropsied and lungs,                             
tracheae and adjacent lymph nodes were cultured. Recovered pathogens                             
were classified by genus and species. As listed above all four                             
bacterial agents commonly associated with swine respiratory disease                             
were isolated in a well controlled laboratory identification                             
procedure. The pathogens were isolated in swine known to be infected                             
in various stages and etiologies of the disease. The data illustrates                             
that a well designed and controlled study verified the incidence and                             
presence of bacterial swine respiratory disease in all the herds and                             
locations tested.<p>
<b>(p) Mean Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Data</b><p>
MIC data was collected from pathogens isolated from the lungs of                             
control group pigs in the 11 location natural field infection trial.                             
These pigs were sacrificed on day seven of the clinical field trial.                             
Ceftiofur and twelve other antimicrobial compounds were tested                             
against 31 clinical isolates, representing three genera and six                             
species. Ceftiofur sodium was equally or more active than some of the                             
other compounds tested against the common pathogens found to cause                             
swine bacterial respiratory disease. This study provided well                             
controlled <i>in vitro</i>&#160; information about the effectiveness of NAXCEL&#174;                             
for the treatment and control of swine bacterial respiratory caused                             
by <i>Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, Salmonella cholerasuis</i>&#160; and                             
<i>Streptococcus suis</i>&#160; Type 2.<p>
<b>(3) Drug Efficacy Summary:</b><p>
Throughout the dose determination and field confirmation trials, all                             
the pathogens claimed by labeling were evaluated at various stages of                             
swine respiratory disease.<p>
<i>Pasteurella multocida</i>&#160; was the most common opportunistic pathogen                             
encountered in these trials and caused atrophic rhinitis and                             
pneumonia <i>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</i>&#160; (artificial and natural                             
infections) and <i>Salmonella chloeraesuis</i>&#160; were recognized as causing                             
acute epizootic and chronic pneumonia. <i>Streptococcus suis</i>&#160; Type 2 was                             
isolated from the respiratory tracts of pigs infected with the                             
peracute and acute forms of the disease.<p>
Investigators encountered the diseases in various stages of morbidity                             
and mortality. Different rates of the spread of the disease was                             
observed under standard swine management practices. Rapidly                             
progressing, more advanced cases were treated successfully with the                             
highest recommended dose of 5 mg/kg body weight repeated three times                             
while cases detected early were treated successfully with the lower                             
dose of 3 mg/kg body weight.<p>
Pigs with chronic respiratory disease were also evaluated in these                             
studies. Although mortality due to chronic pneumonia was usually low                             
in the trials. It was considered important to evaluate the dose range                             
in the presence of high herd morbidity. Control of the spread of the                             
disease in all field trial herds was accomplished by the prophylactic                             
treatment of all the swine in the infected pen with either the 3 or 5                             
mg/kg body weight repeated three times, depending on the severity and                             
etiology and clinical presentation of the disease.<p>
To conclude, the three major swine respiratory syndromes with                             
specific bacterial etiologies were evaluated by their response to                             
Cefitofur in a dose determination and a confirmation trial. These                             
syndromes (athopic rhinitis, enzootic pneumonia, and pleuropneumonia)                             
were treated and controlled successfully with a 3 to 5 mg/kg body                             
weight repeated three times. Because of these well designed trials,                             
the dose in the field use will be determined by an accurate clinical                             
diagnosis of swine respiratory disease in the affected herd. Severity                             
of the disease syndrome was documented by voluminous clinical                             
observations and necropsies.<p>
From this adequate and well controlled drug efficacy study it can be                             
concluded Ceftiofur Sodium is indicated for the treatment and control                             
of swine bacterial respiratory disease (swine bacterial pneumonia)                             
associated with <i>Actinobacillus  ( Haemophilus )
 pleuropneumoniae ,                             
 Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella choleraesuis </i>&#160;  and
<i>Streptococcus                           
 suis,</i>&#160; Type 2.<p>


<b>5. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>
Two studies were designed and conducted to specifically address                             
target animal safety when ceftiofur was administered intramuscularly                             
to swine. These included a tolerance study in which exaggerated doses                             
of ceftiofur were administered to swine, and a safety/toxicity study                             
in which multiples of the anticipated labeled use dose and regimen                             
were administered. Additionally, an 11 location field trial was                             
conducted in which 881 swine were administered ceftiofur at either 3                             
or 5 mg per kg of body weight (1.36 or 2.27 mg/pound of body weight)                             
for three consecutive days.<p>
Based on the results of these studies, it is concluded that ceftiofur                             
has a wide margin of safety when administered intramuscularly to                             
swine at doses up to 5 mg per kg of body weight (2.27 mg/pound) for                             
three consecutive days. Local pain reactions were the observed                             
effect, and this was transient and deemed not detrimental to the                             
safety of the sick animals to which the drug was administered in the                             
field trials.<p>
<b>(1) Pivotal Study #1 (acute toxicity study)</b><p>
<b>(a) Purpose:</b><p>

<li>(i) Test Animals:<p>
Four crossbred swine (2 barrows and 2 gilts) served as treated                             
animals and four crossbred swine (2 barrows and 2 gilts) served as                             
controls (received sterile water for injection). The pig weights                             
ranged from 28.5 kg (62.7 pounds) to 53 kg (116.6 pounds). These pigs                             
were about 4 months of age.<p>
<li>(ii) Dosage Form and Route of Administration<p>
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder for injection following reconstitution, the                             
same product that will be marketed for this claim was administered                             
intramuscularly.<p>
<li>(iii) Dosage:<p>
The dosage was 125 mg ceftiofur equivalents/kg of body weight (56.8                             
mg ceftiofur equivalents/pound of body weight) for 5 consecutive                             
days. This dose is greater than 25 times the highest recommended use                             
level.<p>
<li>(iv) Test Duration:<p>
The pigs were treated with either NAXCEL&#174; or sterile water for                             
injection for 5 consecutive days. All pigs were necropsied and gross                             
evaluations made 24 hours post last injection.<p>
<li>(v) Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>
Measures used to identify target organ and tissue toxicity were:                             
clinical observations, blood and clinical chemistry parameters, body

<li>(vi) Results:<ul><p>
<li>Clinical observations: No overt clinical signs of toxicity were                             
noted. Lameness and limping were noted in two pigs on Days 3 and 4 of                             
treatment, but were no longer evident by the end of the study.                             
Bleeding from the injection site occurred in two pigs on Day 3 of the                             
study but did not cause complications.<p>
<li>Hematology and clinical chemistry values were obtained pretrial and                             
on Day 6 of the study. One drug treated pig developed a marked anemia                             
as shown by a 3-fold decrease in terminal red blood cell count,                             
hemoglobin and hematocrit values in comparison to the other animals.                             
This pig also had the lowest terminal leukocyte and platelet counts                             
and, when calculated on an absolute basis, had the lowest neutrophil                             
count of all of the pigs in the study. A control pig exhibited                             
markedly elevated terminal leukocyte and neutrophil counts compared                             
to the other nontreated pigs. The clinical chemistry and hematology                             
values of the other three ceftiofur treated animals were within                             
ranges considered to be normal.<p>
<li>Organ weights: There were no appreciable differences in organ                             
weights from the treated versus nontreated pigs.<p>
<li>Gross and microscopic observations: The only gross changes were                             
coloration changes and some hemorrhage at the injection site.                             
Microscopically, the drug-treated animals exhibited more severe areas                             
of muscle necrosis at the injection site than did the control animals                             
(see Table 5). Under the conditions of this exaggerated dosage of                             
ceftiofur and/or placebo, both groups showed evidence of resolution                             
and muscle regeneration at the earlier injection sites when                             
necropsied 24 hours after the last 5 daily injections. No other                             
organs were affected as a result of the elevated dose of ceftiofur                             
tested in this study. </ul><p>

<b>(c) General Design of the Study:</b><ul><p>
<li>(i) Test Animals:<p>
Five barrows and five female pigs were tested in each treatment 
group. All pigs were crossbreds of Yorkshire, Hampshire and Duroc. 
The males weighed in a range of from 49.5 pounds (22.5 kg) to 104.5 
pounds (47.5 kg) and the females ranged from 42.9 pounds (19.5 kg) to 
92.4 pounds (42.0 kg).<p>
<li>(ii) Dosage From and Route of Administration:<p>
NAXCEL<sup>&#174;</sup> Sterile Powder for injection following reconstitution,
the 
same product that will be marketed for this claim was administered 
intramuscularly.<p>
<li>(iii) Dosage:<p>
Three dosages of ceftiofur sodium; 5, 15 and 25 mg free acid 
equivalents per kilogram of body weight (2.27, 6.82 and 11.36 
mg/pound of body weight) were compared to a placebo (sterile water 
for injection) treated group.<p>
<li>(iv) Route of Administration: 
Intramuscular injections.<p>
<li>(v) Test Duration:<p>
Treatments were administered once daily for 15 consecutive days. All 
pigs were necropsied and evaluations made 24 hours after the last 
injection.<p>
<li>(vi) Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>
Clinical observations, body weight changes, blood and clinical 
chemistry, weights of selected organs, gross and microscopic 
observations of selected issues.<p>
<li>(vii) Results:<ul><p>
<li>Throughout the course of this study, all pigs survived and gained 
weight. There were no systemic effects attributable to formulated 
ceftiofur sodium based on the parameters measured.<p>
<li>Gross necropsy examination revealed only incidental changes in most 
tissues with some red to reddish-tan streaks at the injection site in 
all groups including the controls. The more prominent streaks were 
noted in the group of animals that received the two higher doses.<p>
<li>Microscopic evaluations of the injection sites revealed some degree 
of necrosis with frequently accompanying hemorrhages. This 
observation was made in some animals in all treated groups as well as 
the placebo treated controls. There was also evidence that tissue 
regeneration was taking place in animals from all groups which had 
experienced injections at 24 hours and longer prior to necropsy.</ul><p>

A two-way analysis of variance was used to test treatment, sex,        
treatment by sex interaction and effects for sexes combined. In the        
case of a significant treatment effect, the Least Significant        
Difference Method was used to make comparisons of the treated group        
with the control group. In the case of significant interaction,        
treatment to control comparisons were performed for each sex        
separately. Tests of statistical significance were made at the 0.05        
level of probability.<p>
<li>(x) Conclusions:<p>
Formulated ceftiofur sodium (NAXCEL&#174;) is safe when injected        
intramuscularly into swine. This formulation is deemed to be a slight        
muscle irritant.</ul><p>


<b>6. HUMAN SAFETY<p>
A. Toxicity Tests</b><p>
All issues concerning toxicity testing of ceftiofur are addressed in        
the previous Freedom of Information Summary for New Animal Drug        
Application 140-338, the approval notice for which appeared in the        
FEDERAL REGISTER Vol. 55, No. 71, 12 April 1990, page 13768: Freedom        
of Information Summary for NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium)        
for Bovine Respiratory Disease. This Summary was updated in June        
1992.<p>
<b>B. Safe Concentration of Total Residues</b><ul><p>
<li>(1) No Observed Effect Level (NOEL)<p>
As referenced in the above-mentioned FOI Summary for NADA 140-338,        
the lowest no observed effect level from the 90-day oral feeding        
studies in both dogs and rats is 30 mg/kg of body weight.<p>
<li>(2) Safe Concentrations (SC) Calculations<p>
<pre>
                         ADI X Human Weight         
SC in Muscle =          --------------------
                     Daily Consumption of Meat         

where:         
                                     Lowest NOEL         
Allowable Daily Intake (ADI) =      ------------      
                                    Safety Factor         
and         

- a safety factor (SF) of 1000 is used because the ADI is based on         
  90-day feeding study data.         

- Daily Consumption of Meat is approximated as 500 g.         

- Average Human Weight is approximated as 60 kg.         
         
                                               30 mg/kg 
The lowest NOEL is 30 mg/kg, so ADI       =   ----------     
                                                 1000         
         
                                          = 0.03 mg/kg; 

therefore                                       
                 0.03 mg/kg x 60 kg         
SC in Muscle =  -------------------       = 3.6 mg/kg or 3.6 ppm
                      0.5 kg 
        

</pre>
Present FDA policy limits the safe concentration in muscle to no more          
than 3.0 ppm unless chronic toxicity data were used for the SC          
calculations.<p>
Using the consumption factors listed below and a SC of 3.0 ppm in          
muscle, the permitted safe concentrations for total residues in other          
edible tissues are as follows:<p>

<li>(3) Threshold Assessment<p>
This compound is a Category A compound as derived from the Threshold               
Assessment considerations. Based on a Structural Activity Assessment               
it was assigned to Category C (non-carcinogen). Subsequent to this               
the 90-day feeding studies allowed it to be classified as Category A.               
Because the drug is intended for therapeutic use on specific animals               
it is considered a Low Use Drug. Accordingly, chronic studies were               
not required and, based on 90-day studies, a Safety Factor of 1000 is               
used in the Safe Concentration Calculations.</ul><p>
<b>C. Total Residue Depletion and Metabolism Study</b><p>
<b>Investigator:</b> F.S. Yein, Ph.D., Upjohn Residue Scientist and Study               
Director.<p>
<b>Test Animals:</b>  twelve (12) Yorkshire x Hampshire crossbred swine (6               
male, 6 female), 34-47 kg, 3 to 4 months of age.<p>
<b>Treatment Regimen:</b>  intramuscular injection of 5 mg ceftiofur free               
acid equivalent per kg of body weight (2.27 mg ceftiofur free acid               
equivalents per pound of body weight), once daily for three               
consecutive days.<p>
<b>Radioisotope used:</b> 14-C ceftiofur sodium labeled in the 2 position of               
the thiazole ring.<p>
<b>Withdrawal Schedule:</b> all 12 animals were sacrificed 12 hours after               
the last dose ("zero-day withdrawal").<p>
Blood samples were taken periodically throughout the dosing period               
and up to the time of slaughter. Blood and plasma levels of 14-C were               
found consistently to be highest at two hours after injection in all               
12 pigs. The mean values for blood levels at two hours after each               
daily injection indicate that the drug does not accumulate in the               
pigs' system. Blood levels of 14-C 2 hours after Day 1, 2 and 3               
injections were 11.9 ppm, 14.5 ppm and 15.4 ppm, respectively. Plasma               
levels of 14-C two hours after day 1, 2 and 3 injections were 19.2               
ppm, 23.4 ppm and 23.1 ppm, respectively.<p>
Total 14-C residues excreted in the urine and feces of all 12 animals               
ranged from 65.8&#37; to 90.8&#37; of the doses administered. The mean value               
for urine for all 12 pigs was 61.8&#37; while feces mean value was               
10.75&#37;. Therefore about 73&#37; of the total 14-C-labeled ceftiofur dose               
was excreted by 12 hours after the last injection.<p>
Samples of muscle, liver, kidney and fat from each animal were               
radioassayed by combustion of the sample, trapping the resulting               
14-CO2, and liquid scintillation counting. Mean residues from the 12               
animals are shown in the table on the following page. Kidney is the               
tissue with the highest concentration of total residues followed by               
the injection site, liver, fat and non-injection site muscle.<p>

Swine kidneys from the above described residue study were subjected       
to wet chemistry procedures to establish the profile of 14-C-ceftiofur       
metabolites. The approach involved protein precipitation and solvent       
extractions, followed high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)       
of the free metabolites.<p>
About 65&#37; of the residue in kidney was bound to macrmolecules       
(protein) and about 35&#37; was freely extractable. The extraction and       
fractionism of kidney tissue demonstrated that there were four       
primary components of the residue. Desfuroylceftiofur cysteine       
disulfide (DCD) was the major metabolite, comprising approximately       
12&#37; of the total residue. An unidentified polar metabolite C,       
representing 11.3&#37; of the total residue, was also found in the kidney       
extract. Two other unknown polar metabolites, A and B, were also       
present in amounts of less than 10&#37; of the total residue.<p>

<b>D. Comparative Metabolism Study</b><p>
The metabolic profiles of ceftiofur in the urine and kidney extracts       
of rats treated orally with high doses of (about 700 mg/kg body       
weight) 14-C labeled ceftiofur were compared to the urine and kidney       
extracts of pigs dosed intramuscularly for 3 days with 5 mg/kg body       
weight 14-C ceftiofur (2.27 mg/pound). This rat dose approximates the       
highest NOEL (1000 mg/kg) observed in any of the oral rat feeding       
studies. Kidney is the limiting tissue because observed       
concentrations of total residues are highest in the tissue relative       
to the calculated safe concentration.<p>
<b>Kidney Metabolites:</b> The bound and free metabolite profiles in the rat       
were compared to those found in the total residue study described in       
Part C. About 65&#37; of the residue was bound and 35&#37; was free in the       
kidneys of both species. Of the free residues, all four metabolites       
found in swine were also found in the rat kidney extracts, as shown       
in the table on the following page.<p>

<b>Urinary Metabolites:</b> The metabolite profiles in the urine of rats and 
pigs showed unmetabolized ceftiofur, 3,3'-desfuroylceftiofur 
disulfide and unknown Polar A as significant metabolites. 
Desfuroylceftiofur cysteine disulfide (DCD), small amounts of unknown 
Polar B, and desfuroyl ceftiofur were present in both rats and pigs. 
Ceftiofur sulfoxide cysteine thioester was the major metabolite in 
urine from rats but only minor in urine from pigs. There is a very 
close qualitative match (89&#37;) in urinary metabolite profiles of rats 
and pigs.<p>
These data support the contention that the rat was autoexposed to 
metabolites to which humans would be exposed as a result of eating 
pork from ceftiofur treated pigs.  Therefore, the toxicology 
studies in the rat accurately 
reflect the toxicity of the metabolites to which man would be 
exposed. <p>
<b>E. Withdrawal Time</b><p>
The total residue data showed that the mean concentrations of total 
ceftiofur residues at 12 hours after the last injection ("zero-day 
withdrawal") were well below the permitted safe concentration in the 
edible tissues of swine treated with the maximum dose (intramuscular 
injection of 5 mg/kg of body weight once daily for three days). 
Therefore, a withdrawal period will not be required for this use of 
the drug in swine, and a target tissue, marker residue and tolerance 
have not been assigned.<p>
<b>F. Regulatory Method</b><p>
An official regulatory method is not required, because the residue 
and toxicology data support a zero-day withdrawal. The analytical 
method used by Upjohn to analyze for non-radiolabeled ceftiofur 
residues in their drug development work is described in Upjohn 
Technical Report 788-9760-88-010, titled "HPLC Method for the 
Analysis of Bound Desfuroylceftiofur Residues in Bovine Kidney Using 
Precolumn Derivatization and UV Detection," 1988. Upjohn used the 
same method for analysis of bovine and porcine kidney.<p>
<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>
The data in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section 
512 of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of the 
implementing regulations. The data demonstrate that ceftiofur sodium 
(NAXCEL&#174;), when administered to swine by a single intramuscular 
injection at a dose range of 3 to 5 mg/kg is safe and effective for 
the treatment of swine respiratory disease associated with the major 
porcine pathogens.<p>
Total residues in the edible tissues at 12 hours post-treatment (0 
day withdrawal), were less than half of the permitted safe 
concentration in each tissue. Therefore neither a marker compound nor 
a tolerance for a marker compound is required.<p>
Labeling restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed 
veterinarian. This decision was based on the following factors: (a) 
adequate directions can not be written to enable laypersons to 
appropriately diagnose and subsequently use this product to treat 
swine respiratory disease caused by a variety of porcine pathogens, 
and (b) a dose range is indicated and therefore requires a veterinary 
clinician to calculate a proper dose depending on the etiology of 
the disease.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), this approval qualifies 
for 3 years of marketing exclusivity because it contains reports of 
new clinical or field investigations and human food safety studies, 
other than bioequivalence or residue studies, essential to the 
approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. NAXCEL&#174; is 
under patent number U.S.446437 expiring August 7, 2001.<p>

This supplement does not affect the existing indications for these combinations
which are: <p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate and lasalocid in combination is indicated
for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and suppression of
estrus (heat) in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. <p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination is
indicated for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency,
suppression of estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in
heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. <p>
<b>III.	Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b><p>
	<b>Dosage Form: </b>                       Feed <p>
<b>Route of Administration: </b>               Oral <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>	<b>Melengestrol acetate </b> 	0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
<b>Lasalocid (as lasalocid sodium) </b> 	100 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton 		air
dried complete feed).<br>	<b>Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate) </b> 	90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried

Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 100 to 360 mg lasalocid per head per day either
with or without 90 mg tylosin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate
of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head. <p>
<b>IV.    Effectiveness </b><p>
This supplement does not affect the efficacy of these combinations. <p>
<b>V.    Animal Safety</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the target animal safety of these
combinations. <p>
<b>VI.    Human Safety </b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b> <p>
<b>Melengestrol acetate</b><br>
 
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period. <p>

<b>Lasalocid</b><br>
 
In cattle parent lasalocid has been established as the marker residue for total
lasalocid sodium residues, liver was selected as the target tissue and 0.7 ppm
for parent lasalocid in liver was established as the tolerance (21 CFR
556.347). No pre-slaughter withdrawal period is required for cattle fed
lasalocid (21 CFR 558.311). <p>

<b>Tylosin</b><br>
 
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625). <p>

<b>2.	Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin.</b> <p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's
138-904 and 138-992, dated 30 April 1990; and NADA's 139-876 and 140-288, dated
16 December 1987; demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in
fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of the
supplemental application for MGA (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402) and that the
concentration of lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination,
each at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
drug withdrawal. This study is summarized below: <p>
Groups of heifers were fed for 90 days either no additive (control, n=14) or
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination at 1X (n=7), 3X
(n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive (lX = 0.5 mg
melengestrol acetate, 30 g lasalocid/ton air dried feed and 10 g tylosin/ton
air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero withdrawal. <p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the official AOAC method (JAOAC
59:507-515:1976). This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from the control heifers and 5 of 7 heifers in the 1X treatment group
had concentration of melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. Fat samples from the
remaining two heifers in the 1X group contained melengestrol acetate at 12.7
and 13.7 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat samples
from the 3X and 5X dose groups were 37.6 ppb (range 30.9 to 46.3 ppb) and 49.4
ppb (range 36.6 to 57.0 ppb), respectively. <p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of lasalocid and tylosin
residues. No residues of tylosin were detected in any of the samples. The limit
of detection for the assay utilized was 0.1 ppm. <p>
No lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from the control heifers.
Lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from each of the 7 heifers in the
1X group with a mean and standard deviation of 0.09 +/- 0.11 ppm. The highest
individual value was 0.26 ppm. All concentrations of lasalocid were well below
the tolerance limit of 0.7 ppm in liver. <p>
<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
These data demonstrate that following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin
and lasalocid in combination, the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat
is below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and residues of
lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances when
heifers are slaughtered without a pre-slaughter withdrawal. <p>
<b>3.	Assay noninterference </b><p>
Data included in previous Freedom of Information Summaries for these NADA's
have demonstrated; <p>
1)	the presence of lasalocid and tylosin does not interfere with 	the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<br>2)	presence of lasalocid and
melengestrol acetate does not 	interfere with the tissue residue assay for
tylosin; and  <p>
It has also been demonstrated that the presence of melengestrol acetate does
not interfere with the tissue residue assay for lasalocid (NADA 96-298; J.Agri.
Food Chem. 31:75-78:1983). <p>
<b>4.    Regulatory methods</b> <p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, Room 12A30). <p>
<b>5.	Conclusions </b><p>
This supplement provides for deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
pre-slaughter drug withdrawal period when melengestrol acetate and lasalocid are
fed in combination either with or without tylosin. No changes are made in
either the approved dosages of any of these drugs, the approved indications of
use or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the
conclusion that residues of melengestrol acetate in fat are below the
established tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered
without a pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin. Accordingly, approval of this
change in pre-slaughter withdrawal period from 48 hours to no withdrawal is not
expected to have adverse effects on public health or food safety. <p>
<b>VII.	Agency Conclusions</b> <p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with
lasalocid and tylosin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity
data for MGA contained in NADA's 034-254 and 039-402. <p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations. <p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<B>Effect of Supplement:</B><P> 

This Supplemental Application amends the NADA to
provide for the use of Droncit Injectable Solution
against <i>Echinococcus multilocularis </i>in dogs.
Droncit Injectable Solution (NADA #111-607, <B>46 FR 
10464, February 3, 1982</B>) is currently approved for
use in dogs and cats.<P>


<b>II. Indications for Use:</b><P>

DOGS: For the removal of <i>Dipylidium caninum, Taenia pisiformis, Echinococcus
granulosus</i> and for the removal and control of <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis</i>.<P>

<b>III. Dosage Forms, Route(s) of Administration and Recommended Dosage(s):</b><P>

Droncit (praziquantel) Injectable Cestocide may be administered by either the
subcutaneous or intramuscular route to dogs and cats. The recommended dosage of
praziquantel varies according to body weight. Smaller animals require a
relatively larger dosage because of their higher metabolic rate. The optimum
dosage for each individual animal will be achieved by using the following
dosage schedule:<P>

<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><P>
<b>A. Pivotal Studies</b><P>
1.  Cross-reference to the existing FOI Summary for Droncit Injectable
Cestocide (NADA 111-607, <B>46 FR 10464</B>, February 3,  1981).<P>

The original FOI summaries contain the details of the dose titration, dose
confirmation and clinical field studies which established the dose and
effectiveness of those products in dogs (and cats). The laboratory studies
demonstrated at the recommended dose a complete (100%) elimination of the
various common cestode species claimed on the label. Clinical field studies
likewise established the effectiveness of praziquantel against the cestodes.<P>

<b>B. Pivotal - Well-Controlled Laboratory Efficacy Studies</b><P>

1. Efficacy of Praziquantel (Droncit) Against <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis</i> in Dogs<p>
K.R. Kazacos<br>
West Lafayette, IN<P>

A controlled anthelmintic trial was conducted on 24 dogs according to CVM's
Canine/Feline Anthelmintic Guidelines. All were adults of various mixed breeds,
equal sex, ranging from 29 to 50 lbs. (13.2 to 22.7 kg) body weight. The dogs
were randomly divided into 3 groups of 12. Twelve dogs were dosed according to
the approved label (range = 4.8-7.0 mg/kg body weight) with the marketed 5.68%
injectable solution, given intramuscularly. The remaining 12 dogs were
untreated controls. Blinding of those doing the evaluations was used to
minimize any potential bias.<P>

The test animals, prior to treatment evaluation, were each experimentally
infected with <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i>. This was done by feeding each
dog an estimated minimum of 100,000 protoscolices harvested from infected
gerbils. Because of the risk of a potentially fatal infection to those
conducting the study, dosing was accomplished at 21 days after administering
the protoscolices and necropsy was at 28 days. Diagnosis was by postmortem
counting of <i>E. multilocularis</i> parasites. Also, each dog was observed at
least twice daily from infection through necropsy for any indication of
abnormal reactions or side effects.<P>

All 12 control dogs were infected with an average of 41,492 adult <i>E.
multilocularis</i>. By comparison, all treated dogs (12 with the injectable
solution), were completely negative for <i>E. multilocularis</i> (and as well
for other cestodes), i.e. 100% elimination. No adverse clinical signs or
reactions related to either the experimental infection or praziquantel
treatment were observed.<P>

Praziquantel was effective and safe in treating <i>E. multilocularis</i>
infections in dogs.<P>

2. Efficacy of Praziquantel (Droncit) Against Immature <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis</i> Infections in Dogs<p>
K.R. Kazacos<br>
West Lafayette, IN<P>

This was an 8-dog controlled anthelmintic trial conducted according to CVM's
Canine/Feline Anthelmintic Guidelines. All were adults of various mixed breeds,
equal sex, ranging from 34 to 52 lbs. (15.4 to 23.6 kg). The dogs were randomly
divided into 4 groups of 2 dogs. Groups 1 through 3 were evaluated at<i> </i>1,
7 and 14 days after experimental inoculation with a minimum of 100,000
protoscolices per dog. Group 4, infected the same, was evaluated following
parasite maturation, for egg shedding in the feces. Blinding of those doing the
evaluations was used to minimize any potential bias.<P>

Treated dogs received the label recommended dose (range 5.0 - 5.8 mg/kg body
weight) of the currently marketed Droncit formulation. They received
intramuscular doses of the injectable solution. The treated dogs were all
compared with the same number of untreated controls. There was one exception in
Group 4. The 2 control dogs were held, by design, after necropsy of the treated
dogs. At the conclusion of the egg monitoring interval, following all egg count
comparisons, those dogs were also treated. The purpose was to observe the
impact of praziquantel on more mature infections.<P>

Evaluations in this study included the impact of praziquantel on immature and
mature <i>E. multilocularis</i> infections. Groups 1 through 3 were compared
with untreated controls for actual parasite counts. No parasite count
comparisons were possible in Group 4, as all these dogs were eventually treated
with praziquantel after evaluation of patent infections and egg shedding
patterns. All animals were observed at least twice daily from infection through
necropsy for evidence of adverse effects or reactions.<P>

The untreated controls averaged 46,317 <i>E. multilocularis</i> per dog; all
were infected. All treated dogs had no <i>E. multilocularis</i> at necropsy,
i.e. 100% elimination. Treatment of mature infections produced a spike in egg
counts that lasted for up to 60 hours depending on the dog's fecal habits. The
peak counts in the treated dogs were many times less than the dog allowed to
continue shedding without treatment. No adverse effects or reactions were
observed.<P>

Praziquantel was effective and safe for the treatment of immature <i>E.
multilocularis</i> infections in dogs.<P>

<b>C. Pivotal Clinical Field Trial</b><P>
NOTE: It is not necessary to conduct a clinical field trial utilizing the 5.68%
Injectable Solution, as the 10 year clinical field trial (referenced below)
with the 34 mg tablet formulation exceeds CVM's normal requirements. This field
trial was of 10 years duration and provided adequate safety and effectiveness
information on the drug when used monthly on a repeated basis. For this reason
and because of the difficulty in definitive diagnosis of <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis</i> and the zoonotic health implications, another clinical field
trial utilizing the injectable formulation is not necessary.<P>

A Program to Reduce the Risk of Infection by <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis</i>: The Use of Praziquantel to Control the Cestode in a Village
in the Hyperendemic Region of Alaska<p>
R.L. Rausch, J.F. Wilson and P.M. Schantz<br>
Anchorage, AK<P>

St. Lawrence Island in Alaska was the site of a 10-year clinical
anthelmintic evaluation of the marketed tablet formulation of praziquantel. No
treatments were given for the first 3 years during which the population of the
larval stage of <i>E. multilocularis</i> was monitored in voles captured from
the town of Savoonga. An estimated 80-90 dogs from Savoonga were dosed on a
monthly basis for 7 consecutive years following the initial monitoring. The
dogs were Huskies and other miscellaneous breeds of both sexes including a wide
range of ages and weights. All dogs were dosed orally according to the
established label recommendations.<P>

This island is part of a hyperendemic region for <i>E. multilocularis</i>. The
complete life cycle of the parasite occurs on the island. <i>E.
multilocularis</i> is passed between the Northern Voles and both wild (e.g.
foxes) and domestic (e.g. dogs) canids. Humans, through contact with the canid
hosts, occasionally contract the disease. The purpose of the study was to
monitor the infection rate of the parasite in the voles once yearly. Humans are
an accidental host, taking the place of the vole.<P>

Monitoring the impact of praziquantel through the vole infection rate was
considered by the investigators as a good measure of the exposure rate
encountered by humans. Voles from the town were considered as being exposed to
praziquantel-treated canids. Those captured outside the town were controls as
they were exposed, primarily, to feces from untreated canids. This was a
practical method for evaluating clinical response in a natural clinical
setting. Diagnosis, therefore, was based on positive identification of the
parasite in voles.<P>

Over the first 3 years with no treatment, 29% of the voles in Savoonga were
identified with <i>E. multilocularis</i>. By the third year of praziquantel
dosing, the vole infection rate in Savoonga had dropped to 1%. Over the 7-year
period of dosing, the average reduction in the vole infection rate was 83%.
This translates to a similar reduction in the risk of a human infection. There
were no reported adverse effects identified by the investigators following
praziquantel dosing.<P>

Praziquantel was safe for repeat administration over an extended period of
multiple dosing. The beneficial impact of treatment was clear. The drug was
safe and effective in the treatment and control of natural <i>E.
multilocularis</i> infections in a clinical setting.<P>

<b>D. Corroborative Studies (Published Articles/Abstracts)</b><P>

1. Cross-reference to the existing FOI Summary for Vercom
(febantel/praziquantel) Paste (NADA 133-953, <B>50 FR 19167, May 7,1985</B>).</b><P>
Laboratory and clinical data gathered by the sponsor confirms the activity of
praziquantel against cestode parasites, i.e. 100% elimination.<P>

2. Efficacy of Praziquantel Against Immature <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i> in
Dogs and Cats<p>

Provo, UT<P>

This was a controlled anthelmintic study involving experimentally induced <i>E.
multilocularis</i> infections derived from cystic material in cotton rats. The
eighteen dogs were each equally divided between an unmedicated control group
and a treated group, given an intramuscular dose of the injectable solution.
This study, originally included with NADA 111-607, was to demonstrate the
effect of a 5 mg/kg dose of praziquantel, in the injectable form intended for
market, against <i>E. multilocularis</i>. The dogs consisted of purebred and
mixed breeds of both sexes and different ages, ranging from 7 to 50 lbs. (3.2
to 22.7 kg) body weight.<P>

Diagnosis was based on the identification of the parasite during necropsy.
Treatments were given 21 days after infection and necropsy of all animals was
28 days after infection.<P>

At necropsy, all 9 control dogs were infected. All dogs treated with
praziquantel were negative for <i>E. multilocularis</i>, i.e. 100% elimination.
Signs of toxicosis were not observed in any animals.<P>

The injectable formulation of praziquantel was effective and safe for the
elimination of <i>E. multilocularis</i> in dogs.<P>

3. Efficacy of a Combined Paste Formulation of Praziquantel/Febantel
Against Immature <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i> and Immature <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis </i><p>    
F.L. Andersen, J.A. Short and H.D. McCurdy<br>
Provo, UT</b><P>

A controlled anthelmintic study was conducted on 12 dogs using experimentally
induced infections of <i>E. multilocularis</i>. The dogs were of multiple
breeds and ages, of both sexes, ranging from 19 to 62 lbs. (8.4 to 28.2 kg)
body weight. The dogs were given 25,000 <i>E. multilocularis</i> protoscolices
from cotton rats. The dogs were divided into two groups of six. All treated
dogs were dosed orally for three consecutive days beginning on day
21 after infection according to the label recommended dosages using the
formulation intended for market. All were necropsied 28 days after infection.
Diagnosis was based on the identification of the <i>Echinococcus spp.</i>
collected from the intestinal tract.<P>

All <i>E. multilocularis</i> infected controls were positive at necropsy for
their respective parasite. All treated dogs with both <i>Echinococcus
</i>parasites were negative, i.e. 100% elimination. No adverse side effects
were reported from any of the treated animals. Praziquantel, combined with
febantel in a paste formulation, was effective and safe when used for the
elimination of <i>E. multilocularis</i> in dogs.<P>

<b>V. Animal Safety:</b><P>

<b>A. Pivotal Confirmation of Safety</b><P>

1. Cross reference to the existing FOI Summary for Droncit
Injectable Cestocide (NADA 111-607, <B>46 FR 10464, February 3, 1981</B>).<P>

The original FOI summary details the safety evaluation conducted in support of
the approval for this product. The safety data include both laboratory and
clinical evaluations conducted in accordance with existing FDA guidelines and a
wide margin of safety was demonstrated for the praziquantel formulation.
Laboratory effectiveness trials (referenced under IVB1 &amp; 2 above), the 10
year clinical field trial, and 11 years of marketing the product to date have
confirmed the safety of this drug.<P>

2. A Program to Reduce the Risk of Infection by <i>Echinococcus</i>
<i>multilocularis</i>: The Use of Praziquantel to Control the Cestode in a
Village in  the Hyperendemic Region of Alaska<p>
R.L. Rausch, J.F. Wilson and P.M. Schantz<br>
Anchorage, AK.<P>

This was a seven year study in which 80-90 dogs were dosed at the label
recommended rate at 30 day intervals continuously. No adverse effects were
reported by the investigators. Multiple dosing with praziquantel tablets over
an extended time was safe for the treated animals.<P>

<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><P>

<b>A. Human Food Safety</b><P>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for the approval of this supplemental NADA. The drug is labeled
for use in dogs which are non-food animals.<P>

<b>B. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration</b><P>

The labeling contains an adequate warning statement: "Warning: Keep Out of
Reach of Children".<P>

<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>

The data in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. The
data demonstrate that Droncit&#174;(praziquantel) 5.68% injectable solution, when
used under the labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective.<P>

According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 51 4.106), this
is a Category II change. This supplement provides for the additional claim to
include the removal and control of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis.</i>The
approval of this change has no adverse effect on the safety and
effectiveness of the new animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not
require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent
application.<P>

For this supplement, the drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian because professional expertise and proper diagnosis are
required to determine when removal or control of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis
</i>infection is indicated.<P>
For new animal drugs for use in non food-producing animals, Section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of
1988, provides for a three year period of exclusivity for a supplemental
application which contains reports of new clinical or field investigations
(other than bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of the supplement
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This supplemental NADA qualifies
for such an exclusivity period (new claim only), which will expire three years
from the date of this approval.<P>

<b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS</b> <p>
This information is addressed in the original FOI for halofuginone hydrobromide
for growing turkeys (FR 28051; July 5, 1989). <p>
<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY </b><p>
This information is addressed in the original FOI for halofuginone for growing
turkeys (FR 28051; July 5, 1989). <p>
<b>Vl. HUMAN FOOD SAFTY </b><p>
<b>A. Toxicity Tests</b> <p>
The toxicity studies summarized in the FOI from NADA 130-951 (halofuginone
hydrobromide for broiler chickens - 50 FR 33718; August 21, 1985) have met the
Agency's requirement for Human Food Safety. The toxicity studies in NADA
130-951 demonstrated that halofuginone hydrobromide is an eye and skin irritant
and the following statement has been added to the labels. <p>
<b>Human  Exposure</b> <p>
Halofuginone hydrobromide has been found to be an eye and skin irritant. Avoid
contact with skin, eyes or clothing. Avoid inhalation of dust. In case of
contact remove contaminated clothing and immediately flush eyes or skin with
plenty of water for 15 minutes. Get medical attention if irritation
persists. <p>
<b>B. Safe Concentration of Total Residues and Tolerance for the Marker
Substance.</b> <p>
The most sensitive species shown in the toxicity studies contained in NADA
130-951 (halofuginone hydrobromide for broiler chickens) was the mouse for
which a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 0.07 mg/kg/day was found. For
chronic toxicity a 100 fold safety factor is applied for calculating a safe
concentration. The safe concentrations for total residues of halofuginone
hydrobromide in the uncooked edible tissues of turkeys are 0.1 ppm in muscle,
0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat. <p>
Prior to the review conducted for this supplement, it had been concluded that a
level of 0.1 ppm unchanged halofuginone hydrobromide (the marker substance)
corresponded to a level of 0.3 ppm in turkey liver (the target tissue). A
review of the residue study newly submitted with this supplement was conducted,
and in that review it was concluded that 0.13 ppm is a more accurate level of
unchanged halofuginone hydrobromide in turkey liver when total residues are at
the safe concentration of 0.3 ppm. Accordingly, the tolerance for unchanged
halofuginone hydrobromide in liver tissue is changed to 0.13 ppm with the
approval of this supplement to NADA 140-824. The safe concentrations for total
residues of halofuginone hydrobromide in the edible tissues of turkeys remain
unchanged as listed above. <p>
The residue studies and tolerance calculations that support the change in
tolerance are described in Parts C and D that follow. <p>
<b>C. Residue Depletion and Metabolism</b> <p>
Total residues of 14C-halofuginone hydrobromide in tissues of turkeys were
determined in a study, using halofuginone hydrobromide radiolabeled in the
quinazolinone ring. The results of the study show that the measurement of 
radioactivity in tissues followed the pattern seen in previous studies with
14C-halofuginone hydrobromide in chickens (NADA 130-951). The investigator for
this study was: <p>
Dr. D. R. Hawkins, Huntingdon Research Centre Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire
England. <p>
The study was conducted as follows: <p>
Twenty turkeys were given daily oral doses of 14C-halofuginone hydrobromide on
14 consecutive days. Each daily dose was 0.3 mg 14C-halofuginone hydrobromide
which corresponds to a dietary incorporation of 3 ppm. Four turkeys (2 of each
sex) were sacrificed at each time point. The average total residue levels (in
ppm) observed at each sacrifice interval and the corresponding standard
deviation are shown below. <p>

Liver and pooled kidney tissues from the above total residue study were also
assayed for parent halofuginone hydrobromide by an HPLC assay. The results of
those assays indicate that parent halofuginone hydrobromide represents a
significant portion of the total residue in both liver and kidney, but of the
two tissues, liver has the overall depletion characteristics most favorable for
the target tissue. The residue levels in liver tissue are shown below. <p>

A comparative metabolism study, conducted by Dr. Leon LeVan, Hazleton
Laboratories America Inc., 3301 Kinsman Blvd., Madison, WI 53707, was completed
in which eight (4 males and 4 females) turkeys were given six (6) 
consecutive oral doses of 0.3 mg 14C-labeled halofuginone hydrobromide/kg/day.
The oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg corresponds to a dietary incorporation of 3 ppm
halofuginone hydrobromide. <p>
In a separate study, conducted by Dr. D. R. Hawkins, Huntingdon Research
Centre, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England, thirty-six (18 males and 18
females) 
mice were given a single 0.24 mg/kg body weight oral dose of 14C-labeled
halofuginone hydrobromide. <p>
 
The dose corresponds to the high dose level in chronic toxicity studies. The
turkeys were sacrificed 12 hours after the last dose and the mice were
sacrificed 24 and 48 hours after dosing. <p>
Extracts of turkey liver contained one major component by thin layer
chromatography which corresponded to unchanged halofuginone hydrobromide (over
90%). Female mouse liver extract was shown to contain predominantely (85%) a
component which corresponded to unchanged halofuginone hydrobromide plus 15% of
a more polar component. Male mouse liver extract contained as the major (51%)
component, a metabolite which was less polar than halofuginone hydrobromide and
which was not present in the extracts of female mouse liver. In addition, 30%
of a component corresponding to parent halofuginone hydrobromide was present in
male mouse liver extract. On a qualitative basis, the radioactive components
detected by chromatography of turkey liver extracts were also present in
extracts of mouse liver. Thus, it was concluded that a test species (the mouse)
and the turkey were each qualitatively exposed to the same residues of
halofuginone hydrobromide. <p>
<b>D. Determination of the Tolerance for the Marker Residue</b> <p>
The tolerance for unchanged halofuginone hydrobromide (the marker residue) in
liver tissue was determined from data in a final total residue study (RSL
826/941335). That investigation was conducted with (14C-quinazolinone)
halofuginone hydrobromide, and parallel assays were performed for total
radioactivity and for the marker residue as measured by the regulatory
assay. <p>
Twenty-four turkeys (twelve of each sex) were given daily doses of 14C-halofuginone 
hydrobromide by gavage for six consecutive days. Each daily dose
was 0.3 mg/kg body weight which corresponds to a dietary incorporation of 3 ppm
halofuginone hydrobromide. The birds were killed in groups of six, three males
and three females, at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the final dose. The livers
were removed from the birds, pooled according to sex and sacrifice time, and
homogenized. Potions of the homogenates were assayed for total radioactivity
and for unchanged drug by the regulatory assay for halofuginone hydrobromide.
The results of those assays are shown below <p>

The residue depletion curves representing the above data show that, when the
average total residue in liver (the target tissue) is at the consumption
adjusted safe concentration of 0.3 ppm, the level of parent halofuginone
hydrobromide (the marker residue) is 0.13 ppm. The Rm or tolerance was thus
determined to be 0.13 ppm halofuginone hydrobromide in turkey liver. <p>
<b>E. Withdrawal time</b> <p>
The withdrawal time for this drug use was determined from a residue study in
which turkeys were treated with unlabeled halofuginone hydrobromide. The
investigators for this study were: <p>
Drs. P. Griminger and H. Fisher<br>
Dept. of Nutrition<br>
Cook College<br>
Rutgers, The State University<br>
New Brunswick, NJ 08903 <p>
The birds in this study were treated continuously from 1 day of age to 12 weeks
of age with halofuginone hydrobromide at 3 ppm (2.72 g/ton) in the feed. Six
birds (3 males and 3 females) were sacrificed at 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days of
withdrawal, and the livers were assayed for halofuginone hydrobromide (the
marker residue) by the HPLC regulatory assay. The average residue levels and
the standard deviation are presented in the table below. <p>

The statistical analysis of the liver residue depletion data at days 2, 3, 4
and 5 using the upper limit containing 99 percentlie of the population with 95%
confidence showed that residues of halofuginone hydrobromide deplete to below
0.13 ppm after six days of withdrawal. However, because a request to reduce the
withdrawal time was not part of this supplement to NADA 140-824, the withdrawal
time for halofuginone hydrobromide in turkeys remains at seven days. <p>
<b>F. Regulatory Methods</b> <p>
The determinative method for measuring quantitatively residues of halofuginone
hydrobromide in poultry (turkey and chicken) liver has been validated and is
based on high pressure liquid chromatography. The validated confirmatory assay
is a mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry procedure. The regulatory methods are
filed in the Food Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857). <p>
 
<b>VII.  
AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b> <p>
Halofuginone hydrobromide, codified in 21 CFR 558.265 and CFR 556.308, is
approved for marketing as a Type A Medicated Article for use to prevent
coccidiosis in broiler chickens and growing turkeys. <p>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA requesting an increase
in the tolerance, satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act. The
metabolism data demonstrate that when total drug residues of halofuginone in
turkey liver (the target tissue) have depleted to the safe concentration of 0.3
ppm, the level of unchanged halofuginone (the marker residue) is approximately
0.13 ppm rather than 0.1 ppm. The safe concentrations for total residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of turkeys remain 0.1 ppm in muscle, 0.3 ppm in liver
and 0.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat. The withdrawal time remains at seven (7)
days. <p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy [21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)], this is
a Category II change. The change in tolerance for residues of the halofuginone
marker residue in turkey liver was based on a review of newly submitted
metabolism data and our a re-review of the residue and metabolism data
contained in the original NADA. The newly submitted data demonstrate that 0.13
ppm is a more accurate level of unchanged halofuginone (the marker residue) in
turkey liver (the target tissue) when total residues in that tissue are at the
safe concentration of 0.3 ppm. <p>
The change in tolerance was based solely on the review of the metabolism data,
and a re-evaluation of the toxicity data supporting the safe concentration of
total drug related residues of halofuginone was not required. Approval of this
change in tolerance is not expected to pose an increased risk to human food
safety because the safe concentration of residues of halofuginone and the
withdrawal time for the drug were not changed. <p>
In implementing the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Restoration Act, the
Center's Third Policy Letter published August 28, 1989 (54 FR 35534) discusses
"Exclusivity for Human Food Safety Data Submitted in a Supplemental 
Application." The policy states that the provision of exclusivity does not
apply to human food safety studies submitted to obtain a different tolerance,
because the tolerance for a drug substance applies to all products containing
the same drug substance. In this case, the newly established tolerance will
apply immediately to any generic products as well as the pioneer drug product.
Therefore, this approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under
section 512 (c)(2)(F) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). <p>

<A NAME="RTFToC1">UPDATE
ON FLUOROQUINOLONES 
</A></B><P>
On August 18, 1995, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new
fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug, sarafloxacin hydrochloride, for use in
chickens and turkeys.  Sarafloxacin was the first fluoroquinolone approved for
use in food-producing animals.  It is a prescription drug distributed under the
trade name Saraflox&#174; WSP by Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois.
Saraflox&#174; WSP is administered in drinking water to control mortality in
broiler chickens and growing turkeys infected with <I>Escherichia coli</I>
organisms susceptible to sarafloxacin.  On October 12, 1995, FDA approved
Saraflox&#174; Injection, also manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, for control
of early chick mortality associated with bacterial infection by <I>E.Coli.</I>
<P>
    These approvals of fluoroquinolone products for food animal use followed
lengthy consideration by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) about
possible microbial resistance to these drugs.  Fluoroquinolones are the newest
class of antimicrobial drugs developed for treating infections in people and
animals.  CVM approved enrofloxacin (another fluoroquinolone product) for use
in companion animals in January 1989.  Since then, some members of the human
health community expressed concerns about the possible approval of
fluoroquinolones in food animals.  FDA held a joint meeting of the Agency's
Veterinary Medicine and Anti-Infective Drugs advisory committees on May 11-12,
1994, to discuss this issue.  Members of both committees concluded that FDA
could approve fluoroquinolones found to be safe and effective for animal use.
<P>
    CVM is interested in preserving the usefulness of these valuable new drugs and
other fluoroquinolones by minimizing the potential for development of resistant
pathogens.  Part of the strategy to achieve this objective is to control
unnecessary treatment of animals with fluoroquinolones.  To facilitate
accomplishment of this important objective, CVM is initiating an educational
program to inform veterinarians and producers about the appropriate use of
fluoroquinolones and is revising the Compliance Policy Guide 7125.06,
Extra-label Use of Animal Drugs in Food-Producing Animals, to include
regulatory guidance for these drugs.  <P>
    To control the extra-label use of this class of drugs, FDA will assign a
regulatory priority based on their actual use.  The highest priority for
regulatory action will be for extra-label use of fluoroquinolone products in
major food-producing animal species (cattle, swine, chickens, and turkeys) that
are not included in the approved labeling.  For example, the highest priority
for regulatory action would be assigned when a fluoroquinolone product only
approved for use in chickens were used in a different major food-producing
species such as cattle.<P>
    FDA is collaborating with the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a surveillance
system to monitor antimicrobial susceptibility in enteric pathogens.  Under the
program, USDA will test <I>Salmonella</I> samples from animals for
susceptibility to antimicrobial drug products.  The CDC will conduct similar
testing on <I>Salmonella</I> and <I>E. coli.</I> isolated from humans.  The
manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories, will test <I>E. coli</I>  obtained from
chickens and turkeys to monitor their susceptibility to sarafloxacin.  The
manufacturer will also provide geographically-based drug distribution
information to CVM as part of their annual Drug Experience Reports.  The
information from the monitoring programs will be used to assess the development
of fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms and make any adjustments in the
extra-label drug use regulatory program.<P>
    Additional information on the approval of Saraflox WSP&#174; is contained in the
<B>Federal Register</B> of September 28, 1995.  Questions regarding CVM's
position on the extra-label drug use of fluoroquinolones may be directed to
CVM's Office of Surveillance and Compliance at 7500 Standish Place, HFV-200,
Rockville, MD 20855, or by calling (301) 594-1761.<P><B>
<A NAME="RTFToC2">UPDATE
ON BST
</A></B><P>
FDA approved  Monsanto Company's recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) product
in November 1993 after a comprehensive review of the product's safety and
efficacy, including human food safety.  Monsanto's product, known as
Posilac&#174;, is the only rbST product approved for increasing milk production
in dairy cattle.  The product has been commercially available since February 4,
1994.  <P>
    In a March 14, 1995 FDA TALK PAPER, the Agency stated that during the first
year of commercial use a total of 806 adverse effects to the drug were reported
to Monsanto and submitted to FDA.  The following is an update on the adverse
experiences to Posilac&#174; reported to FDA during the next seven months of
commercial use; from February 1, 1995 through August 25, 1995.  During this
period, FDA received 509 adverse experience reports (See table below.)  It is
important to note that a report of an adverse effect in relation to a drug does
not itself establish that the effect was caused by the drug.  FDA believes that
392 of the 509 reports were <B>possibly</B> associated with the use of
Posilac&#174;,  and that the other 117 reports were not  related to treatment
with Posilac&#174;.  Also, <B>all of the reported clinical manifestations are
known to occur in dairy cattle not supplemented with Posilac&#174;</B>.  <P>
    Of the 392 reports possibly related to the use of Posilac&#174;, 100 included
reproductive disorders, 77 involved digestive disorders, 69 included mastitis,
62 included injection site reactions, 54 included swelling of the udder or
abnormal milk, 53 included foot or leg problems, and 44 involved increased
somatic cell counts.  In some cases, one report contained more than one
condition.<P>
    The number and severity of the reported conditions raise no new animal health
concerns about the safety of Posilac&#174;.  The numbers and types of reactions
are similar to those found during clinical trials and indicated on the label.
Also, there is no indication that the drug is any less effective than labeled.
In addition, FDA and the States have found no indication of a change in the
incidence of violative drug residues in milk since Posilac&#174; has been in
commercial use.<P>
    Based on the these reports of adverse reactions to Posilac&#174;, FDA does not
find any cause for concern.  However, it is important for dairy farmers to
continue to report all adverse reactions associated with the use of rbST.  They
may report such reactions to Monsanto, to FDA through their veterinarian, or
directly to FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.  CVM accepts collect calls
during working hours, and an answering machine is available to record
after-hours calls.  The telephone numbers are (301) 594-1751 for collect calls
during working hours, and (301) 594-0797 to leave a message on evenings and
weekends.<P><B>

This issue of the <B>FDA Veterinarian </B>contains a pull-out section of the
second half of the 1994 Veterinary Adverse Drug Experience Summary.  The first
portion was included in the September/October issue.  <P>
<B>[Editor's note:  this electronic version of the FDA Veterinarian does not include the
ADE summary.  ADE information is available as a section 
in the <A HREF="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/fda/infores/inforestoc.html">
Information and Resources</A>
Library elsewhere on this site. (Be warned that there is no link back to here)]
</B>
    This summary includes all domestic adverse drug experience reports submitted
to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for calendar year 1994 which the
Center has determined to be at least possibly drug related.  It is organized
alphabetically by <B>generic</B> drug, and within each drug by species, and
within each species by the general route of administration.  The percentages
represent the number of reports containing a sign divided by the total number
of reports.  Also, reported signs are truncated at twenty-two characters<P>
    The Center's adverse drug reaction review process takes into consideration
confounding factors such as dosage, concomitant drug use, the medical and
physical condition of the animals at the time of treatment, environmental and
management information, product defects, etc.  These complex factors, however,
cannot be fully addressed in this summary.  <B>This summary is intended only as
a general reference to the type of reactions that veterinarians, animal owners,
and others have voluntarily reported to FDA or the manufacturer after drug use;
therefore, it is not by itself a basis for:</B><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Determining drug association for a particular sign
<LI>Determining the safety and efficacy of a given drug
<LI>Determining the frequency of occurrence of an adverse reaction
<LI>Comparing one drug with another drug.
</UL>   Nevertheless, the information in the summary can alert readers to
suspected drug effects being reported by their colleagues and sensitize them to
potential problems.  The report may also serve to stimulate readers to share
their own experiences for the benefit of their colleagues and ultimately the
improvement of veterinary products.<P>
    This summary does not include product failure or adverse experience reports
for biologics and topically applied, externally acting parasiticides.  Such
reports received by CVM are forwarded to the government agency that regulates
the product in question.  In addition, it does not include reports of drug
product defect reports unless the report also contains adverse reaction

<A NAME="RTFToC7">CVM
PUBLISHES GUIDE ON MASTER FILES
</A></B><P>
On July 26, 1995, CVM issued a Policy Letter announcing the Center's informal
guidance document entitled "MASTER FILES -- Guidance for Industry for the
Preparation and Submission of Veterinary Master Files."  A master file (MF) is
a voluntary submission to FDA that may be used to provide confidential,
detailed information about the facilities, processes, or articles used in the
manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more veterinary
drugs.  Master files on file with CVM are generally referred to as veterinary
master files (VMFs).  This is to distinguish these files from those submitted
to FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which are referred to as drug
master files (DMFs).  The information in a VMF may be used to support an
investigational new animal drug application (INADA), a new animal drug
application (NADA), an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA), another
VMF, an Export Application, or amendments or supplements to any of these.<P>
    A master file is <B>not</B> a substitute for an INADA, NADA, ANADA, or Export
Application.  It is not approved or disapproved.  Instead, the submission is
found acceptable or deficient in support of an INADA, NADA, ANADA, Export
Application, or other master file.<P>
    The submission of a master file is not required by law or FDA regulation.
Master files are generally created to allow a party other than the holder of
the master file to reference material without disclosing to that party the
contents of the file.  When an applicant references its own material, the
applicant should reference the material contained in its own INADA, NADA, or
ANADA directly, rather than establishing a master file.<P>
    A master file is submitted solely at the discretion of the holder.  All
information submitted in a master file is considered confidential, and is
reviewed only when the master file holder provides appropriate authorization
permitting the FDA to refer to it on behalf of an applicant or sponsor.<P>
    This guidance document recognizes five distinct types of Veterinary Master
Files (Types I - V) as well as public master files.  It states that Type I VMFs
are being eliminated, and that the Center will no longer accept new Type I VMFs
or correspondence updating existing Type I VMFs.  Also, the information in Type
I VMFs currently on file can no longer be incorporated by reference into new
applications, amendments, or supplements.  Further definitions of the content
of Type I -V VMFs and the mechanism by which Type I master files will be
eliminated or recategorized are also included in the informal guidance
document.<P>
    The informal guidance document also announces that a VMF will only be reviewed
in conjunction with an application.  Previously, CVM routinely reviewed
submissions that were not necessarily linked to an application.  The Center has
concluded that the routine review and evaluation of VMFs not specifically
referenced in applications may be a waste of resources, and will discontinue
this practice.<P>

<A NAME="RTFToC8">QUESTIONS
AND ANSWERS ON ADES
</A></B><P>
This issue of the <B>FDA Veterinarian</B> contains the first in a series of
questions and answers that are frequently asked about CVM's Veterinary Adverse
Drug Experience (ADE) program.  Readers who have additional questions on our
ADE program or any other Center issue are encouraged to submit them to the
following address:  FDA/Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Place,
HFV-12, Rockville, MD 20855 or telephone Linda Grassie at (301) 594-5909.<P>
<B>Q.   What is an ADE?</B><P>
<B>A.   </B>An adverse drug experience (ADE) is either an undesired side effect,
or the lack of a desired effect.  CVM's official definition of an ADE is "any
side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity reaction (or failure to perform
as expected) associated with the use of an animal drug, <B>whether or not
determined to be attributable to the drug</B>."<P>
<B>Q.   What are CVM's specific areas of interest?</B><P>
<B>A.   </B>The primary purpose of CVM's ADE monitoring system is to detect
problems or "side effects" associated with the use of FDA approved animal
drugs.  During the research studies that lead to drug approval, only limited
numbers of animals are treated.  Because of this, effects or problems that only
occur rarely may not be discovered until after the drug has been more widely
marketed and used in a clinical setting. <P>
    Lack of effectiveness is an adverse experience.  The majority of reports of
this nature involve anthelmintics.  These reports can be difficult to evaluate,
but a group of similar reports will prompt further investigation.<P>
    CVM gives careful consideration to any reports of adverse experiences
occurring in humans as a direct result of using or administering an animal drug
or in other situations involving accidental human exposure.<P><B>

<A NAME="RTFToC15">CONSENT
DECREE SIGNED IN DRUG RESIDUE CASE
</A></B><P>
On July 5, 1995, a Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction was signed by David
L. Hogan, owner of Hogan's Misty Meadow Dairy, Tillamook, Oregon.  This dairy
is primarily a producer of fluid milk, with a producing herd of 700 cows.  In
addition, the farm produces bull calves which are sold for slaughter or for
further raising and then slaughter for human food.  <P>
    The injunction action against Mr. Hogan was based on 16 residue incidents in
veal during the period from March 1990 through June 1994.  The illegal drug
residues involved included streptomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, and
oxytetracycline.  The Consent Decree permanently restrained and enjoined Mr.
Hogan from introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce
any cattle intended to be slaughtered for use as food or any edible tissues of
cattle unless and until medicated cows and bulls are identified, medicated in
accordance with approved labeling, and held for the proper withdrawal period.
The Consent Decree also requires that calves intended for sale be segregated
into a separate pen, medicated calves or calves fed colostrum or milk from a
medicated cow be marked, medication be used in accordance with its approved
labeling, withdrawal periods be followed, and written records be kept.<P><B>

Primary objective of the study was to evaluate levels of (1, 75, 225, 375, and
750 mg apramycin per gallon of drinking water for 7 days in weanling pigs with
naturally occurring colibacillosis.  These dosages are equivalent to
approximately 0, 2.5, 7.5, 12.5 and 25 mg apramycin/kg/bodyweight/day.<p>
A total of 120 pigs, 12 lbs average bodyweight, were used in the study. Pigs
were pooled in a common pen for 2-3 days to allow colibacillosis to develop and
were then allotted to treatment groups on the basis of weight and litter of
origin.  Treatments were randomly assigned to pens.<P>
The trial extended over a 21-day period and parameters observed were growth
performance, feed efficiency, and scour scores (scale of l-10 with l normal and
10 the most severe).  Diagnosis was confirmed by the isolation of hemolytic
<i>E. coli</i>&#160; from intestinal contents and rectal swabs.<p>
A representative pig taken from the trial pigs was necropsied immediately prior
to initiation of the trial.  The intestinal tract contents yielded hemolytic
<i>E. coli</i>&#160; organisms at liters of 1.7 x 10e6/ml in the duodenum
and 6.0 x 10e8/ml in the ileum.<P>

 <b>WEIGHT GAIN: </b><P>
The means for the data for weight gain (in kilograms) for one week is
presented with their standard error in Table l above.  These were used to
investigate the dose response and to compare the responses at the 375 and 
750 mg/gal levels.  A best fitting model from the class of polynomial and
linear plateau models was found to be the VI-l3 linear plateau model with
R-squared equal to 0.9924.  The R-squared values is interpreted to mean that
99.24&#37; of the variability among the means is explained by the indicated model.
The VI-13 linear plateau model is described as increasing line from 0 to the
first non-zero level (75 mg/gal), intersecting an increasing line from the
first non-zero level to the third non-zero level (375 mg/gal), intersecting a
horizontal line (plateau) over the interval 375 to 750 mg/gal.  This model
implies that no statistically significant increase in weight gain occurs beyond
the 375 mg/gal level.  A t test on the mean for the 0 and 75 mg/gal levels was
significant with t (8) &#61; 3.10 and p approximately 0.0073 for a one-sided test.
Hence, 75 mg/gal is the statistically effective minimum level.  However, the
difference in the means for the 375 and 750 levels (0.041 kilograms) was not
significant and the pooled studies were only sensitive enough to detect an
increase of 0.273 kilograms with an 80&#37; chance when conducting a one-sided test
in the 0.05 level of significance.  These results are summarized in Table 2
above.<p>
The means for the data for weight gain for three weeks are reproduced in Table
1 along with their standard error.  Using the same methodology implied in the
previous paragraph, it was found that a best fitting model is the III-3 linear
plateau model and that the minimum effective level is 75 mg/gal.  The III-3
linear plateau model is described as an increasing line from 0 to the third
non-zero level (375 mg/gal), intersecting a horizontal line (plateau) over the
interval 375 to 750 mg/gal.  No statistically significant increase in weight
gain was detected between the 375 and 750 mg/gal levels.  However, the combined
studies were only sensitive enough to detect an increase of 0.587 kilograms
over the mean for the 375 mg/gal level (an approx. increase of 12.9&#37;) with an
80&#37; chance when conducting a one-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance.
These results are summarized in Table 2.<P>
<b>FEED EFFICIENCY: </b><P>
The means for the data for gain/feed for one week are also presented with their
standard errors in Table l and were used to investigate the dose response and
to compare the responses at the two highest levels appearing in the studies.
The statistical results are similar to those for weight gain for one week and
are summarized in table 2.<P>
The means for the data for gain/feed for three weeks, were evaluated.  A best
fitting model of these means was found to be the V-l linear plateau model. 
This model is described as an increasing line from 0 to the first non-zero
level (75 mg/gal), intersecting another increasing line over the interval 75 to
750 mg/gal.  Since this model increases over the entire range tested in these
studies, the maximum statistically effective level is the maximum level tested,
750 mg/gal.  At test on the means for the 0 and 75 mg/gal levels was
significant at the 0.10 level of significance with t (44) &#61; l.39 and p
approximately 0.0853 for the on-sided test.  At test on the means for the 0 and
225 mg/gal levels was significant at a smaller level of significance with t(44)
&#61; 2.08 and p approximately 0.0218 for the one-sided test.  Since the V-1 model
indicates increasing efficacy over the interval 375 to 750 mg/gal, the
detectable difference for inclusion in Table 2 does not need to be
calculated.<P>
 <b>SCOUR SCORES for 7th and l4th Days </b><P>
An analysis similar to that conducted for the previous measures was conducted
for the scour scores on the seventh day.  The drug level means and their
standard error are displayed in Table 1 and the statistical results are
summarized in Table 2.<P>
There was no model that adequately fit the drug level means for the scour
scores the fourteenth day, which are given in Table 1 with their standard
error. The scour score means numerically, but not statistically, increased for
the drug level change of 375 to 750 mg/gal.   The statistical analysis results
are summarized in Table 2.<P>
To further evaluate effectiveness of the 375 and 750 mg/gallon doses of
Apramycin on the scour scores in the trials statistical analysis of the average
daily scour scores for the-first seven days of the trial (period of drug
administration) was conducted.<P>

The means were used to investigate the dose response and to compare responses
at 375 and 750 mg/gal levels.  From the class of polynomial and linear plateau
models it was found that the data statistically supported two different linear
plateau models:  the III-l and V-2 models.<P>
The III-I linear plateau model is a decreasing straight line over the
interval  0 to 75 mg/gal intersecting a horizontal line over the interval 225 to 375 to 750 mg/gal. 
 The horizontal line over the interval 75 to 750 mg/gal indicates
that there are no statistically significant differences in the means for the 
75, 225, 375, and 750 mg/gal levels.  A t test on the mean for the control
group was statistically significant with p approximately 0.0014 for the
one-sided test.  This information statistically supports an effective level of
75 mg/gal for increased efficacy over untreated controls measured by the means
of the seven-days average scour scores.<P>
The V-2 linear plateau model, is a decreasing straight line over the
interval 0 to 75 to 225 mg/gal intersecting an increasing straight line over the
interval 225 to 375 to 750 mg/gal.  The increasing straight line over the
interval 225 to 750 mg/gal indicates that the means for 375 and 750 mg/gal
levels are progressively larger than the mean for the 225 mg/gal level.  The
decreasing straight line over the interval 0 to 225 mg/gal indicates that the
means for this measure of efficacy significantly decrease from 0 to 75 to 225
mg/gal. This information together with the t test mentioned in the previous
paragraph supports an effective range of 75 to 225 mg/gal for increased
efficacy over untreated controls measured by the means of the seven-day average
scour scores.<P>
The two models obviously give different results.  But they can both be
supported statistically and cannot be said to be statistically different.
Model III-I fits the beginning of the tested range of levels better than the
end, while the V-2 model does the opposite.
      <P>
 <b>Conclusions for the Studies </b><P>
Scour scores for the evaluation of weanling pig colibacillosis is a
subjective parameter that can be expected to show some inconsistencies between
evaluators. However, it is an important parameter that gives an indication of
disease presence and intensity.  Evaluation of the scour scores in the studies
indicated that apramycin administered at 75 to 225 mg/gallon water was
effective against this parameter as measured by the means of the seven-day
average scour scores. The scour scores on day 7 showed no difference between
the 225, 375 and 750 mg/gallon levels and on day 14 there was no statistical
improvement in the 750 over the 375 mg/gallon level.
     <P>
Weight gain and feed efficiency are objective parameters that are directly
affected by colibacillosis in weanling pigs and hence become at, least of equal
importance to scour scores in evaluation of drug effectiveness.<P>
Evaluation of these parameters resulted in the conclusion that there was no
advantage in administering apramycin at 750 mg/gallon over 375 mg/gallon for
the control of weanling pig colibacillosis and that, 375 mg/gallon is the best
dose for the indication for use.<p>
<b>Animal Safety: </b><p>
This is a Category II supplement.  No reevaluation of data in the parent NADA was
required because no adverse effect on animal safety would result from approval
of this supplement because less total drug would be used.  No new data were
required for animal safety.<P> 
<b>Human Safety:</b><ul><p> 
<li><b>A.  Safe Concentrations of Residues</b><P>
The tolerances for total residues of apramycin in uncooked edible swine tissues
were established, based upon toxicology studies previously submitted under this
NADA, as 0.1 ppm for muscle, 0.3 ppm for liver, and 0.4 ppm for kidney and
fat.<P>
<li><b>B.  Metabolism Studies</b><P>
Under the original NADA, metabolism studies in swine were conducted to select a
marker substance and target tissue for apramycin.  Swine kidney is the target
tissue with parent apramycin being the marker residue.  A marker residue
concentration of 0.l part per million in kidney corresponds to 0.4 part per
million total residue in this target tissue determined by the regulatory
method.<P>
<li><b>C.  Regulatory Method</b><P>
Under the original NADA, a method was developed for the determination of parent
apramycin at the tolerance of 0.1 ppm and above in swine kidney.<P>
<li><b>D.  Withdrawal Time</b><P>
Under the original NADA, it was determined that a withdrawal time of 
28 days was necessary for residues of apramycin to deplete to safe
concentrations in all tissues after treatment with a dosage of 25 mg/kg BW.
Because this supplemental NADA provides for use of apramycin in swine for 7
days at a dosage of 12.5 mg/kg BW with no change in withdrawal time, no
additional residue studies were required.</ul><P>
<b>Agency Conclusions</b><P>
Under the agency's proposed supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367) this is
a Category II change.  This supplement provides for a dosage of apramycin of
12.5 mg/kg BW to swine for the control of porcine colibacillosis   The firm
also requested withdrawal of the approved 25 mg/kg BW dosage for the treatment of
porcine colibacillosis.  No change in withdrawal time was requested and the use of the word "control"
will not result in more animals receiving the
drug.  Because such a change will not increase the exposure of humans to
residues of apramycin, this Category II supplement did not require a re-review
of the human food safety data contained in the original NADA.<P> The data
submitted in support of this application comply with the requirements of
section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Apralan Soluble powder when used
under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the control of
porcine colibacillosis caused by strains of <i>E. coli</i>&#160; sensitive to
apramycin.<P> In addition, the tissues of animals receiving Apralan Soluble Powder
are safe for human consumption, provided the label-recommended 28-day
withdrawal period is observed.<P>

PARATECT FLEX(TM) SUSTAINED RELEASE DIFFUSER CATTLE ANTHELMINTIC</b><P>








<b>1. General Information</b><P>
<b>NADA:</b> 134-779<P>
<b>Sponsor:</b><P>
Pfizer, Inc. (No. 000069)<br>
235 East 42nd Street<br>
New York, New York 10017<P>
<b>Generic Name:</b> Morantel tartrate<P>
<b>Trade Name:</b> Paratect Flex(TM)<P>
<b>Market Status:</b> Over-The-Counter<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  March 25, 1991<P>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><P>
This supplemental application provides an additional dosage form for the
Morantel tartrate cartridge (Paratect Cartridge) which has been approved since 1984
under this same NADA.<P>
<b>2. Indications for Use</b><P>
The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is indicated for control of the adult stage of
the
following gastrointestinal nematode infections in weaned calves and yearling
cattle: <i>Ostertagia</i>&#160; spp, <i>Trichostrongylus axei</i>, <i>Cooperia </i>&#160;
spp, and
<i>Oesophagostomum
radiatum </i>. Efficacy of the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is dependent upon
continuous
control of the gastrointestinal parasites for approximately 90 days
following
administration.<P>

<b>3. Dosage Form</b><P>

The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is another dosage form of the Paratect Cartridge,
a
sustained release solid oral dosage form approved under NADA 134-779 on
December 7, 1984. Physically, the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is a resilient
laminated sheet with a copolymer core which contains 11.8 grams of morantel
(base) activity. A series of holes is punched through the sheet and the
sustained
release of morantel is through the unsealed sheet edges and exposed core at
the
holes. The sheet is rolled into a cylindrical shape approximately 1.0" in
diameter
and 3.75" in length, taped to retain the coiled configuration and the ends
sealed
with plugs. The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser, like the Paratect Cartridge, is
administered orally using a special dosing gun, is retained intraruminally,
and
morantel is released for approximately 90 consecutive days.<P>

<b>Dosage:</b><P>

The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is to be administered when cattle are turned
out
onto pasture. Administer orally one Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser to each weaned
calf
and yearling weighing at least 200 pounds. The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is to
be
administered with a special dosing gun.<P>

<b>4. Efficacy</b><P>
The anthelmintic activity of morantel tartrate against mature
gastrointestinal
nematode infections of cattle has been demonstrated in NADA's 92-444 and 93-
903 for the Rumatel(TM) premix and conventional bolus formulations,
respectively.
The utility of a sustained release formulation containing morantel against
gastrointestinal nematodes was first demonstrated with the Paratect
Cartridge,
NADA 134-779.<P>

Two pivotal morantel dose determination titration studies were conducted
using
experimental infections of <i>Ostertagia ostertagi</i>, <i>Cooperia oncophora</i>, and, in
one
study, <i>Trichostrongylus axei </i>. The effective sustained dosage level of morantel
was
projected to be approximately 90 mg morantel (base)/head/day. The results of
these and six controlled-dose confirmation studies with the Paratect Cartridge
are
contained in the Freedom of Information Summary for Paratect (NADA 134-779,
49 FR 47831, December 7, 1984) on file in the Dockets Management Branch,
Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.<P>

Based on the field evaluations, efficacy, claimed as the control of the adult
stage
of <i>Ostertagia </i>&#160;spp, <i>Trichostrongylus axei </i>, <i>Cooperia </i>&#160;
spp and <i>Oesophagostomum
radiatum </i>, is dependent on the continuous control of the claimed parasites
for
approximately 90 days following product administration. The principle of
Paratect
Cartridge efficacy is the release of anthelmintically active quantities of
morantel
during the first 60 to 90 days of grazing in order to reduce pasture larvae
contamination and subsequent generations of parasites <i>in vivo </i> .<P>

The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is another dosage form of the Paratect
Cartridge
and efficacy is a function of the rate of morantel release from the
formulation. As
demonstrated with the Paratect Cartridge, the pioneer product, the targeted
sustained dosage rate is approximately 90 mg morantel base/day for at least
90
days. <i>In vivo</i>&#160; rate-of-release was evaluated for three Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser
lots
in three separate studies which utilized the following common protocol in
which
rates of release were determined at 30, 60, and 90 days post administration:<P>

One Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser from each lot was administered to each of 30
Holstein calves. Calves were all approximately 10 months of age and mean
individual body weights ranged from 196 to 256 kg among trials. For each
Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser lot, ten calves were sacrificed at 30, 60, and 90
days
following treatment. Recovery of each Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser and assay for
residual morantel was performed at the time of sacrifice. Calculation of the
rate of
morantel release over time was based on the difference between initial lot
assays
and residual morantel for each sacrifice point. All studies were conducted at
the
Pfizer Animal Health Research Center, Terre Haute, Indiana.<P>

Efficacy was confirmed by monitoring individual animal body weights and
fecal
oval counts at 14 day intervals throughout the trial as well as through
parasite-free
tracer calves used to monitor pasture larvae contamination levels.<P>

<b>Study 1230C-60-85-005</b><P>

Conducted by Dr. L. L. Smith of Viroqua, Wisconsin 60 Holstein heifers with
a
mean initial body weight of 131 kg were allocated to make two equivalent
treatment groups. At turnout to pasture one Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser was
administered to each animal in one group selected at random. Each group was
maintained for a total trial duration of 168 days on its own pasture area.
Ten
animals from each group were selected at random at trial termination and
evaluated for speciated adult gastrointestinal worm burdens. Efficacy was
80%
against <i>O.</i>&#160; spp, 97% against <i>Cooperia </i>&#160;spp, and 86% against <i>O. radiatum </i>.<P>

Efficacy was confirmed by monitoring individual animal body weights and
fecal
ova counts at 14 day intervals throughout the trial as well as through
parasite-free
tracer calves used to monitor pasture larvae contamination levels.<P>

The pooled results of these three clinical field trials are shown below.<P>
<pre>
<b>PARASITE                     MEAN (RANGE) % EFFICACY</b>

<i>Ostertagia </i>spp                         70   (63-80)

<i>Trichostrongylus axei</i>                  96   (96-97)

<i>Cooperia </i>spp                           93   (88-97)

<i>Oesophagostomum radiatum</i>               96   (86-100)

</pre>
<b>5. Animal Safety</b><P>

The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser has the same exterior dimensions as the
Paratect
Cartridge and is administered in the same way with a special dosing gun. The
indications for use and the conditions of use for the two products are also
identical including the minimum body weight restriction for administration of
200
pounds.<P>

The safety of administration of the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser was confirmed
in
Study 5431C-03-87-022 conducted by D. J. Shanks of Pfizer Central Research
at
the Pfizer Breach Farm in Barham, Kent, U.K. One hundred Hereford-Friesian
cross calves in a weight range of 85 to 95 kg (187 to 209 lb) were each
administered one Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser without incident. No adverse
reactions
were observed in any of the calves at the time of dosing or on examination
30
minutes and 24 hours after treatment.<P>

The safety of Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser administration and long-term
toleration
were evaluated in Study 543 IE-03-85-001 conducted by Dr. W. T. R. Grimshaw
of Pfizer Central Research at the Pfizer Sandwich Kent, U.K. facility. One
Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser was administered to each of 45 Hereford-Friesian
cross
calves with individual body weights between 110 and 130 kg. No adverse
effects
were observed at the time of treatment. Ten calves were sacrificed 90 days
post-
treatment and 32 calves at 12 months post-treatment. Three calves died during
the
study from non-treatment related disorders. No animal evidenced any
observable
adverse effect or lesion related to treatment. Intact Paratect Flex(TM)
Diffusers
were recovered from all animals sacrificed at 90 days and from three animals
after
12 months. The Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser drug-depleted matrix apparently
gradually disintegrated between 90 days and 12 months as either no Paratect
Flex(TM) Diffuser or only fragments were found in the other animals.<P>

The long-term toleration and fate of the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser were
evaluated
in Study 5431E-03-86-019 conducted by Dr. A. J. Weatherley of Pfizer Central
Research at Pfizer's Breach Farm test facility at Barham, Kent, U.K. One
Paratect
Flex(TM) Diffuser was administered without incident to each of 200 Friesian,
Hereford or Hereford-Friesian cross calves weighing between 135 and 170 kg
body weight. One hundred of these calves were sacrificed between 181 and 185
days following treatment with the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser matrix recovered
intact from 96. There was no indication of any irritation or other adverse
effect
related to the use of the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser. The remaining animals
were
held for future evaluation.<P>

The originally approved Paratect Cartridge (containing 13.5 g morantel base)
has
the same exterior dimensions as the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser (11 g base).
Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser was tested at the recommended therapeutic dosage in
the above studies. No additional studies with elevated dosages were
conducted
because the safety of morantel tartrate was adequately demonstrated in the
original
application by using Paratect Cartridges at 5x the therapeutic dose.<P>

<b>6. Human Food Safety</b><P>

<b> A.  </b>  No new or additional toxicology data were generated or submitted in
support
of this application. Data from reproductive and genetic toxicology studies as
well
as acute, subacute, and chronic conventional toxicology studies were
summarized
in the Freedom of Information Summary for the Paratect Cartridge, NADA 134-779; 
on file in the Dockets Management Branch (49 FR 47831, December 7,
1984).<P>

Subsequent to this approval, additional data were filed in support of higher
morantel tissue residue safe concentrations for the morantel tartrate bolus,
NADA
93-903, and premix, NADA 92-444, formulations (51 FR 9005, March 17, 1986).<P>

The safe concentrations of morantel tartrate residues and the marker tolerances
as
codified in 21 CFR 556.425 are based on a No-Observed-Effect-Level of 10
mg/kg/day in a rat teratology study.<P>

 <b>B. Safe Concentration of Residues</b> <P>

The morantel tartrate safe residue concentrations and marker tolerances for
all
morantel formulations are codified in 21 CFR 556.425. Residue concentrations
are
determined by measuring morantel residues convertible to MAPA. The tolerance
for MAPA, expressed as morantel base, is established in cattle at 0.70 parts
per
million (ppm) in liver, the target tissue. A marker residue concentration of
0.70
ppm in liver corresponds to a concentration of total residues of morantel
tartrate
of 2.40 ppm in liver. Tolerance refers to a concentration of a marker
residue
selected to monitor for total residues of the drug in the target species.
Safe
concentrations refer to the concentrations of total residues considered safe
in
edible tissues and milk. (Reference: 51 FR 9005, March 17, 1986).<P>

<b>C. Total Residue Depletion and Metabolism Studies, and<P>

D. Tolerance for the Marker Residue</b><P>

The approved residue safe concentrations and the marker tolerances which
apply
to all morantel tartrate formulations are codified in 21 CFR 556.425.<p>

Total residue and marker depletion kinetics as well as appropriate
comparative
metabolism data have been the subject of approvals for the conventional
morantel
tartrate formulations published in 51 FR 9005, March 17, 1986 and, originally,
in
46 FR 50949, October 16, 1981. The initial approval of a morantel sustained
release formulation was for the Paratect Cartridge in 49 FR 47831, December
7,
1984. The withdrawal period for Paratect was decreased from 160 to 106 days
subsequent to a review using contemporary standards of all morantel
toxicology
and metabolism data with amendment of 21 CFR 520.1450b (the Paratect
Cartridge) cited in 51 FR 41081, November 13, 1986.<P>

<b>E. Study Establishing the Withdrawal Period</b><P>

Residue depletion Study 1531 N-60-87-018, conducted by E. F. Illyes at the
Pfizer
Animal Health Research Center at Terre Haute, Indiana, evaluated the
depletion
characteristics of morantel related residues following treatment with the
Paratect
Flex(TM) Diffuser. Test conditions were patterned after a similar study which
was
the basis for approval of the Paratect Cartridge. One Paratect Flex(TM)
Diffuser
was administered to each of 12 heifer and 12 steer calves. The test animals
were
of Hereford beef stock, between 14 and 17 months of age with a mean group
body weight of approximately 350 kg. Two additional, nonmedicated control
animals were maintained concurrently to provide blank tissues for analytical
use.
Six Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser treated animals, three of each sex, were
sacrificed at
102, 106, 110, and 114 days following treatment and one control animal at
102
days. From each animal, a 250 g sample of liver, the target tissue for
morantel,
was harvested and submitted to the Drug Metabolism Research and Development
Department at Groton, Connecticut for assay of morantel related residues via
the
marker, MAPA. Throughout the study, no evidence of adverse effect related
either
to the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser formulation or morantel was observed. Mean
liver residues expressed as morantel (base) via MAPA were as follows:<P>
Mean morantel released at the 30, 60 and 90 day monitoring points across the
three trials was 3.5 g, 6.9 g, and 9.8 g, respectively. The overall mean
daily morantel release rate over 90 days was 109 mg. For each lot the release rate
coefficient of variation over 90 days was less than or equal to 7%.<P>

To confirm anthelmintic activity against patent infections, a controlled study
using
experimental infections of <i>Ostertagia ostertagi </i> &#160;and <i>Cooperia 
oncophora </i>&#160;was
conducted by Dr. W. T. R. Grimshaw at Pfizer's Animal Health Research
facility,
Sandwich, Kent, U.K. Two groups of 15 parasite naive calves were
experimentally
infected and one group treated with one Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser/calf 23
days
later. One week following treatment, adult parasite burdens were reduced by
95
and 96%, respectively, for the two genera.<P>

The above study, in conjunction with the following three dose confirmation
studies, serve as pivotal trials and were conducted to confirm efficacy of
the
Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser under actual use conditions. For each study and
claimed
parasite species, efficacy was calculated using the formula:<P>
<pre>
(Mean Control Worm Burden) - (Mean Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser Worm Burden)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- x 100
                        (Mean Control Worm Burden)
                        
</pre>

<b>Study 1230C-60-85-002</b><P>
Conducted by E. F. Illyes at the Pfizer Animal Health Research Center in
Terre
Haute, Indiana, 60 yearling Hereford steers with a mean body weight of 210
kg
were allocated to two equivalent treatment groups. At turnout to pasture one
Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser was administered to each animal in one group
selected
at random. Each group was maintained on its own pasture areas. Ten animals
from each group were sacrificed after 168 days on pasture with determination
of
speciated adult gastrointestinal worm burdens. Efficacy was 63% against
<i>Ostertagia </i>&#160;spp. (O. spp.), 97% against <i>Trichostrongylus axei </i>&#160;
(<i>T. axei </i>), 88%
against <i>Cooperia </i>&#160;spp. (C. spp.), and 100% against <i>Oesophagostomum 
radiatum</i>&#160;
(<i>O. radiatum </i>).<P>

Efficacy was confirmed by monitoring individual animal body weights and
fecal
ova counts at 14 day intervals throughout the trial as well as through
parasite-free
tracer calves used to monitor pasture larvae contamination levels.<P>

<b>Study 1230C-60-85-004</b><P>

Conducted by Dr. G. L. Zimmerman at the Oregon State University Beef Ranch
in
Corvallis, Oregon 60 Hereford-Angus type steers with a mean initial body
weight
of 206 kg were allocated to make two equivalent treatment groups. At turnout
to
pasture one Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser was administered to each animal in one
group selected at random. Each group was maintained for a total trial duration
of
168 days following treatment on its own pasture areas. Ten animals from each
group were selected at random after 168 days on pasture with subsequent
determination of speciated adult gastrointestinal worm burdens. Efficacy was
68%
against <i>O.</i>&#160; spp. 96% against <i>T. axei </i>, 93% against <i>Cooperia </i>&#160;spp, and 100%
against
<i>O. radiatum </i>.<P>

The
tolerance for morantel (base) via MAPA in cattle liver is 0.70 ppm. The
residues at all time points monitored are well below, less than one-half,
the
tolerance. Also, the statistical distribution according to the tolerance limit
model
designed to project the upper 99% of the population with 95% confidence was
below tolerance. This study documents a gradual depletion rate but at very
low
residue concentrations. Application of a 102 day withdrawal period assures
levels
of residues below safe concentrations.<P>

The validated regulatory analytical method for detection of the morantel
marker,
MAPA, is filed in the Food Additives Analytical Manual on display in the
Food
and Drug Administration's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857).<P>

<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>

The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Paratect Flex(TM)
Sustained Release Diffuser Cattle Anthelmintic when used under its proposed
conditions of use is safe and effective.<P>

Additional data regarding manufacturing, residue depletion, target animal
safety
(regarding the Trilaminate dispenser) and efficacy were submitted in support
of
this supplemental application. The data submitted was adequate to support
approval including the same as those currently approved for the Paratect
Cartridge&#174;. These claims are for the control of the adult stage of the
following
parasites: <i>Ostertagia </i>&#160;spp., <i>Trichostrongylus axei </i>, 
<i>Cooperia </i>&#160;spp., and
<i>Oesophagostomum radiatum </i>.<P>

The Paratect Flex(TM) diffuser for cattle is an alternate sustained release
dosage
form of the approved Paratect Cartridge&#174;. Under the agency's policy for
supplements to approved NADAs, the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser represents a
change in drug formulation and is a Category 11 change. See 55 FR 46045,
46048, 46052; November 1, 1990 (adding 21 CFR 514.106 (b)(2)). The supplement
does not involve a change in the route of administration, however, the agency
has
concluded that the qualitative composition of the residue remaining in
edible
tissue will not be altered. In order to limit the quantitative exposure to
residues
from this new dosage form of morantel tartrate, a withdrawal period of 102
days
is established for the product. The 102 day withdrawal period was determined
from a residue depletion study and will ensure that there is no increased
human
risk from exposure to residues of morantel tartrate. The supplement,
accordingly,
is approved without reevaluation of the underlying human safety and
effectiveness
data contained in the parent application.<P>

While the Paratect Flex(TM) Diffuser is a new system for the long-term
sustained
release of morantel tartrate, other types of sustained release systems are
currently
on the market for use in food animals. Accurate diagnosis can be made with a
reasonable degree of certainty by the layman. Adequate directions for use
have
been written for the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on labeling
are
likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine
has concluded that this product remain under over-the-counter marketing
status.<P>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this supplemental approval qualifies for three (3)
years
of marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of the approval letter before
new
clinical or field studies were required for the approval.<P>

<b>2. Target Animal Safety And Drug Effectiveness:</b><P>
Target  animal  safety  data  from  the  FOI  summary  for PMF 5020,  54  FR
11569. March  21,  1989,  demonstrated  that  administration  of  salinomycin
sodium  in feed at 2 times the recommended dose for 28 consecutive days is safe
and nontoxic to quail.<P>
Efficacy data from the FOI summary for PMF 5020, 54 FR 11569, March 21, 1989,
demonstrated  that  a  level  of  50  g/ton  (0.0055%)  salinomycin  sodium  in
complete feed  was efficacious based on weight gain and  reduction  of parasite
numbers  for  the  prevention  of coccidiosis  caused  by  <i>Eimeria  lettyae  </i>&#160;  and 
<i>E. dispersa  </i>&#160;  in quail.<P>
<b>3. Human Food Safety:</b><P>
Toxicity Testing:<P> These have been adequately addressed  in the FOI  summary
for PMF 5020.<P>
Safe  Concentration:<P>   The safe concentrations  for total  salinomycin
residues  in uncooked  edible  tissues  of broiler  chickens  were  established
at  0.6  ppm  in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat (48 FR
30616, July 5, 1983). An  upper limit of unchanged  salinomycin in  skin/fat is
established  at  200 ppb.<P>
Withdrawal  Time:<P>   Residue depletion  data submitted  under PMF  5020, 54 FR
11569,  March  21,  1989, support  a zero day  withdrawal  period  for
daily  feeding of 50 g/ton (0.0055%) salinomycin sodium to quail.<P>
<b>4. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The  data  submitted  in  support  of this  supplemental  NADA  comply  with
the requirements  of  section  512  of  the  Act  and  demonstrate  that
salinomycin sodium, when  used under the proposed conditions of use, is safe
and effective for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria  lettyae  </i>&#160;
  and <i>E.  dispersa  </i>&#160;  in quail.<P>
Based on tissue residue studies, a zero day slaughter period is assigned for
quail treated  with  salinomycin sodium  at the recommended dosage.<P>
The original  approval  of salinomycin  sodium  was  as  an over-the-counter
drug. Accurate diagnosis of coccidiosis in quail, which is the new species to
be added to the  label,  can  be made with  reasonable degree of certainty by
the layman.<P>
Adequate    directions  for  use  have  been  written  for  the  layman,  and
the conditions   for  use  prescribed  on  the  labeling  are  likely  to  be
followed  in practice.   Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)
has concluded that  this product  shall  have  over-the-counter marketing
status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy 21 CFR 514.106(b)(2), this is a
Category  II  change.   The approval  of  this  change  did  not  require  a
reevaluation of the safety or effectiveness data in the parent application.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval  for  food  producing  animals  does  not  qualify   for
marketing exclusivity  because  the  supplemental  application  does  not
contain reports  of new  clinical  or  field  investigations  (other  than
bioequivalence  or  residue studies)  and  new  human  food safety  studies (other than
bioequivalence or residue  studies)  essential  to the  approval  and   conducted

<b>F.O.I. SUMMARY</b><p>
<b>SAFE-GUARD&#174; (FENBENDAZOLE) 20&#37; NATURAL PROTEIN DEWORMING BLOCK 
 FOR BEEF CATTLE</b><p>
<b>1.   General Information</b><p>
<b>NADA:  </b>                  NADA &#35;139-189<p>
<b>Name and Address of the Sponsor:</b><p>  Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company  <br>
    Route 202-206 North    <br>    Somerville, New Jersey
08876<p>
<b>Generic Name:</b>          Fenbendazole<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b>           SAFE-GUARD&#174;<p>
 <b>Marketing Status:</b>       Over-the-counter (OTC) <p>
The original approval provided for a  25 lb.  medicated  molasses
 block containing 750 milligrams of fenbendazole per pound as a beef cattle
anthelmintic. The molasses block requires an 11-day withdrawal. This
supplemental approval provides for a  33-1/2   pound cold press medicated
 20&#37; protein  feedblock containing  750 milligrams of fenbendazole
per pound as a beef cattle anthelmintic. The cold press 20&#37; protein block
requires a 16-day withdrawal period.<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>May 15, 1989<P>
<b>2.   Indications for use:</b><p>   Cattle dewormer for the removal and 
control of:<ul><p>
<Li>Lungworm: (<i>Dictyocaulus viviparus </i>).<p>     
<Li>Stomach worms: Barberpole worm
(<i>Haemonchus  contortus</i>), Brown stomach worm (<i>Ostertagia ostertagi </i>),  
Small stomach worm (<i>Trichostrongylus axei </i>).<p>
<li>Intestinal worms: Hookworm  (<i>Bunostomum  
  phlebotomum </i>), Threadnecked intestinal worm 
(<i>Nematodirus helvetianus </i>), Small intestinal worms 
(<i>Cooperia oncophora</i>&#160; and <i>C. punctata </i>), Bankrupt worm 
(<i>Trichostrongylus colubriformis </i>), Nodular worm 
(<i>Oesophagostomum radiatum </i>).</ul><p>
<b>3.  Dosage form:</b><p>    20&#37; Natural Protein deworming supplement
(cold press)             feedblock for beef cattle. This cold press feedblock is 
manufactured by V.M.S., Inc. Montgomery, AL. Each            feedblock weighs 33.5
pounds and contains 730 mg           fenbendazole per pound.<p>
    <b>Dosage:</b><p>  1.67 mg fenbendazole per kg of body weight per day ,     for
three (3) days. Total dose for the 3 day period of 5         mg/enbendazole per kg
of body weight (2.27 mg      fenbendazole per pound). The/eedblock label
contains         complete directions for administration.<p>
<b>4.  Effectiveness:</b><p>
This NADA relies on adequate well controlled studies showing the anthelmintic
efficacy of fenbendazole in cattle included in the approved NADA 128-620
(Fenbendazole Suspension 10&#37;, 48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983). The original
NADA (128-620) provided for a dose of 3 mg fenbendazole/kg of body weight
administered in a one (1) day treatment. This NADA demonstrates that the 5 mg
dose given over a three (3) day period is equally as efficacious.<p>
One study was conducted in cattle to demonstrate that the efficacy of
fenbendazole in the feedblock formulation is equal to the suspension
formulation when used at the same dose of 5 mg fenbendazole/kg body weight. It
is appropriate to conclude that the feedblock formulation is equally
efficacious.<p>
Efficacy and consumption was demonstrated in these studies:<p>
<b>Efficacy Evaluation of Feedblocks Medicated with Fenbendazole</b><p>
<b>M. Blagburn, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama</b><p>
Twenty cattle naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes were
identified and assigned to two groups of ten cattle each. One group remained
unmedicated and one group was given fenbendazole via the natural protein cold
press feedblock at a dose of 5 mg fenbendazole per kg of body weight over a 3
day period. Adequate numbers of parasites were recovered from the control
animals  at  postmortem to evaluate and compare the effect of the
feedblock formulation on the following species:<p>

</pre>

                     
<b>Consumption rate by cattle of feedblocks containing Fenbendazole</b><p>
Four feedblock consumption studies were conducted. The total number of mature
cattle utilized for these studies was 195 head tested using the cold press
feedblock. The studies were conducted in Alabama, Louisiana and Wyoming. To
achieve the desired level of fenbendazole medicated block consumption, cattle
require a period of time for adaptation to feedblocks. This adaptation period
varied depending upon current and previous herd 
  feeding and husbandry practices in addition to weather conditions. From these
studies, it was determined that specific medicated block treatment can be
administered after 12-19 days adaptation period with non-medicated
feedblocks.<p>
The medicated feedblocks were given for a 3 day treatment period with the
total fenbendazole consumption for the 3 day period calculated to be 5 mg
fenbendazole/kg of body weight. The actual average consumption rate for
fenbendazole averaged across the 3 locations was 4.55 (&#177;  0.88) mg
fenbendazole/kg body weight for the cold press blocks (see the following
table).<p>

The consumption and efficacy studies confirm that the feedblock formulation is
efficacious when the total dose of 5 mg fenbendazole per kg 
body weight is given over a 3 day period.<p>
The recommended treatment was found to be both safe and practical under field
conditions.<p>
<b>5.   Target Animal Safety</b><p>
This NADA relies on safety studies included in the approved NADA 128-620
(Fenbendazole Suspension 10&#37;, 48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983), that indicated
the maximum tolerance dose is greater than 2000 mg fenbendazole/kg body
weight.<p>
Therefore, as predicted, no visible adverse reactions were observed in any of
the laboratory efficacy or clinical field trials conducted in cattle with cold
press feedblocks containing fenbendazole.<p>
<b>6.  Human Safety</b><ul><p>
<b><li>a.    Safe Concentration of Residues </b><p>
 The safe concentration for total fenbendazole residues in the uncooked
edible tissues of cattle were established, based upon toxicology studies
submitted under NADA 128-620 (48 FR 42809-9/20/83) as 5 ppm in muscle, 10 ppm
in liver, 15 ppm in kidney and 20 ppm in fat.<p>
<b><li>b.    Metabolism Studies </b><p>
Under NADA 128-620 metabolism studies in cattle were conducted to select a
marker substance and target tissue for fenbendazole. Cattle liver is the target
tissue with parent fenbendazole being the marker substance. The tolerance (Rm)
is 0.8 ppm parent fenbendazole for cattle receiving a single oral dose of 10 mg
fenbendazole/kg BW, i.e. when total fenbendazole residues are 10 ppm in liver,
there is 0.8 ppm parent fenbendazole as determined  by  the regulatory
method. Acceptable comparative metabolism studies were described under NADA
128-620.<p>
<b><li>c.  Regulatory Method </b><p>
 Under NADA 128-620, the method was developed for the
determination of parent fenbendazole at the tolerance of 0.8 ppm concentration
in cattle liver.<p>
<b><li>d.    Withdrawal Time </b><p>
 Under NADA 128-620 (suspension 10&#37;) it was determined that a
withdrawal time of 8 days is necessary for the residues of fenbendazole to
deplete to sale concentrations in all tissues.<p>
Under this NADA a residue depletion study using the approved analytical method
was conducted to determine when residues of the feedblock formulation deplete
to or below the established safe concentration.<p>
Twenty eight cattle were treated orally over a 3 day period with the feedblock
formulation to provide a total dose of 10 mg fenbendazole/kg of body weight.<p>
A statistical analysis using CVM's 99&#37; tolerance limit with a 95&#37; confidence
interval on the data in the following table determined that fenbendazole
residues were below the tolerance of 0.8 ppm 16 days after the end of the
treatment period. The projected residue level at the end of a sixteen (16) day
withdrawal period was 0.74 ppm. The Agency has reviewed the residue data and
has concluded that this supplement will not alter the concentration and
qualitative composition of the residue.<p>

Therefore, it has been established that 16 days after treatment with a three
day oral dose of 10 mg fenbendazole/kg b.w. in the cold press feedblock
formulation is sufficient to confirm that no residues are present that may be
harmful to human health.<p>
<LI><B>e.   Safety to Handler</b> <p>
Under NADA 128-620, studies were conducted which demonstrated that the drug
would have no ill effects on persons handling it if the drug is used according
to label recommendations.</ul><p>
<b>7.   Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
 This is a supplemental approval. NADA  139-189  provides for a
 25  pound molasses block having  750  mg fenbendazole/pound. The
supplement is for a cold press protein block of 33-1/2 pounds having  750
 mg fenbendazole/pound. The data submitted in support of this NADA comply
with the requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrates that
fenbendazole (Safe-Guard) in a 20&#37; natural protein deworming (cold press)
feedblock when used under its proposed condition of use is safe and effective
for the removal and control of lungworms, stomach worms and intestinal worms in
cattle.<p>
The Agency concludes that adequate directions for use have been written 
for the proposed over-the-counter use of this broad spectrum anthelmintic which is
indicated for the removal and control of parasites commonly occuring in cattle.
Fenbendazole premixes in swine and fenbendazole suspension, paste, and
feedblock (containing molasses) in cattle are presently marketed
over-the-counter as broad spectrum anthelmintic drug products. Fenbendazole
medicated feedblock is currently codified in section 21 CFR  520.905e  for
use in cattle providing for the same concentration  (750  mg/lb) and
conditions of use with the exception of the drug withdrawal requirements (11
days  for  the molasses-containing block and  16  days for the cold
press block). The Agency has reviewed the residue data and has concluded that
this supplement will not alter the concentration and qualitative composition of
the residue. Therefore, this supplement will pose no increased human risk from
exposure to the drug.<p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is a
Category II change which provides for an additional feed block formulation.
This change is not expected to adversely affect the safety and effectiveness of
the drug. Therefore, this action did not require a reevaluation of the
underlying safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>

<b>Date of Summary:</b>  June 29, 1994<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with lasalocid and
tylosin. Previous approvals have required a 48 hour  pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with
these drugs.<p>
<b>II.    Indications for Use</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for these combinations
which are:<p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate and lasalocid in combination is indicated
for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and suppression of
estrus (heat) in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter.<p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination is
indicated for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency,
suppression of estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in
heifers fed in confinement for slaughter.<p>
<b>III.	Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b> <p>
	<b>Dosage Form:</b>                        Feed<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>                Oral<p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>	Melengestrol acetate:  0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
Lasalocid (as lasalocid sodium):  100 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton 	air
dried complete feed).<br>	Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate):	90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
	complete feed)<p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 100 to 360 mg lasalocid per head per day either
with or without 90 mg tylosin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate
of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head.<p>
<b>IV.    Effectiveness</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the efficacy of these combinations.<p>
<b>V.    Animal Safety</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the target animal safety of these
combinations.<p>
<b>VI.    Human Safety</b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b><p>
<b>Melengestrol acetate</b><p>
 
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period.<p>
<b>Lasalocid</b><p>
 
In cattle parent lasalocid has been established as the marker residue for total
lasalocid sodium residues, liver was selected as the target tissue and 0.7 ppm
for parent lasalocid in liver was established as the tolerance (21 CFR
556.347). No pre-slaughter withdrawal period is required for cattle fed
lasalocid (21 CFR 558.311).<p>
<b>Tylosin</b><p>
 
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No  pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625).<p>
<b>2.	Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin.</b><p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's
138-904 and 138-992, dated 30 April 1990; and NADA's 139-876 and 140-288, dated
16 December 1987; demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in
fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of the
supplemental application for MGA (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402) and that the
concentration of lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination,
each at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
drug withdrawal. This study is summarized below:<p>
Groups of heifers were fed for 90 days either no additive (control, n=14) or
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination at 1X (n=7), 3X
(n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive (lX = 0.5 mg
melengestrol acetate, 30 g lasalocid/ton air dried feed and 10 g tylosin/ton
air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero withdrawal.<p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the official AOAC method (JAOAC
59:507-515:1976). This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from the control heifers and 5 of 7 heifers in the 1X treatment group
had concentration of melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. Fat samples from the
remaining two heifers in the 1X group contained melengestrol acetate at 12.7
and 13.7 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat samples
from the 3X and 5X dose groups were 37.6 ppb (range 30.9 to 46.3 ppb) and 49.4
ppb (range 36.6 to 57.0 ppb), respectively.<p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of lasalocid and tylosin
residues. No residues of tylosin were detected in any of the samples. The limit
of detection for the assay utilized was 0.1 ppm.<p>
No lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from the control heifers.
Lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from each of the 7 heifers in the
1X group with a mean and standard deviation of 0.09 +/- 0.11 ppm. The highest
individual value was 0.26 ppm. All concentrations of lasalocid were well below
the tolerance limit of 0.7 ppm in liver.<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
These data demonstrate that following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin
and lasalocid in combination, the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat
is below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and residues of
lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances when
heifers are slaughtered without a pre-slaughter withdrawal.<p>
<b>3.	Assay noninterference</b><p>
Data included in previous Freedom of Information Summaries for these NADA's
have demonstrated;<p>
1)	the presence of lasalocid and tylosin does not interfere with 	the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<p>2)	presence of lasalocid and
melengestrol acetate does not 	interfere with the tissue residue assay for
tylosin; and<p>
It has also been demonstrated that the presence of melengestrol acetate does
not interfere with the tissue residue assay for lasalocid (NADA 96-298;<i> J.Agri.
 Food Chem.</i>&#160; 31:75-78:1983).<p>
<b>4.    Regulatory methods</b><p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, Room 12A30).<p>
<b>5.	Conclusions</b><p>
This supplement provides for deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
 pre-slaughter drug withdrawal period when melengestrol acetate and lasalocid are
fed in combination either with or without tylosin. No changes are made in
either the approved dosages of any of these drugs, the approved indications of
use or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the
conclusion that residues of melengestrol acetate in fat are below the
established tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered
without a pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin. Accordingly, approval of this
change in pre-slaughter withdrawal period from 48 hours to no withdrawal is not
expected to have adverse effects on public health or food safety.<p>
<b>VII.	Agency Conclusions</b><p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with
lasalocid and tylosin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity
data for MGA contained in NADA's  34-254 and  39-402.<p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b> I.GENERAL INFORMATION</b><p>

<I>NADA Number</I>: Supplement to NADA 101-862<p>

<I>Sponsor</I>:<p>
 
Schering-Plough Animal Health<br>
Schering-Plough Corporation<br>
PO Box 529<br>
Kenilworth, New Jersey  07033<p>

<I>Trade Name</I>: GARASOL&#174; Injection<p>

<I>Accepted Name</I>: gentamicin sulfate veterinary<p>

<I>Marketing Status</I>: Over-the-counter (OTC)<p>

<b> II. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENT</b><p>

This supplement provides for adding the previously approved turkey
claims under NADA 47-486 to the labeling of NADA 101-862.  The excipients
in the formulations are identical, although the quantities are slightly
different.<p>

<b> III. INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><p>

For day-old chicks, GARASOL&#174; Injection is indicated for
the prevention of early mortality associated with <i>Escherichia coli,
Salmonella typhimurium, </i>and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>infections
susceptible to gentamicin sulfate.<p>

For 1- to 3-day-old turkeys GARASOL&#174; Injection is indicated as
an aid in the prevention of early mortality associated with
<i>Arizona paracolon</i> susceptible to gentamicin sulfate.<p>

<b> IV. DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</b><p>

<i>Day-old chickens -</i> Each chicken should be injected subcutaneously with
GARASOL&#174; Injection diluted with sterile, physiological saline
solution to provide 0.2 mg gentamicin in a 0.2-mL dose.<p>

<i>One- to 3-day-old turkeys</i> - Each 1- to 3-day-old turkey should be
injected subcutaneously with GARASOL&#174; Injection diluted with
sterile, physiological saline solution to provide 1.0 mg gentamicin in a
0.2-mL dose.<p>

<b> V. EFFECTIVENESS AND ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>

For effectiveness and animal safety information  relative to turkeys,
refer to the FOI for GARASOL&#174; Injection (NADA 47-486).
The data, summaries and conclusions which support this approval are now filed
in NADA 101-862.<p>

For effectiveness and animal safety information relative to chickens, refer to
the FOI for GARASOL&#174; Injection<b> </b>(NADA 101-862).<p>

<b> VI. HUMAN SAFETY</b><p>

  When GARASOL&#174; Injection (50 or 100 mg/mL) is
diluted as described in labeling, the concentration of gentamicin is not
different, while the concentration of the excipients (non-therapeutic
ingredients) are much lower than those concentrations in the 5-mg/mL
formulation, as dosed to turkeys.  These differences are inconsequential to
safety and efficacy.  NADA 101-862 contains sufficient information, such that
further studies are not required.<p>

For human safety information relative to turkeys, refer to the FOI for
GARASOL&#174; Injection (NADA 47-486).  The data, summaries,
and conclusions which support this approval are now filed in NADA 101-862.<p>

<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>
 
The data submitted in support of this supplement to the NADA satisfy the
requirements of Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and
support the request to add the claims for GARASOL&#174; Injection (5
mg/mL) approved for turkeys (NADA 47-486) to GARASOL&#174; Injection
(50 and 100 mg/mL) approved for chickens (NADA 101-862).<p>

This action will provide for an animal drug to be marketed under the same
conditions as a previously approved animal and, therefore, qualifies for
categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(iii).  No change in the dose and
indications of GARASOL&#174; Injection provided to chickens and
turkeys is permitted by this action<p>

The patent has expired, and approval of this supplement does not affect
exclusivity.<p>

<B>Tradename:</B> DORMOSEDAN(TM)<P>
<B>Marketing Status:</B> Rx<P>
<B>II. Indications for Use:</B><P>
Detomidine hydrochloride is indicated  for use as a sedative and
analgesic to facilitate minor surgical and diagnostic procedures in mature
horses and yearlings.<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> 11/12/89
<B>III. Dosage Form</B>: Sterile injectable solution<P>
<B>Route of Administration:</B> Intravenous or intramuscular injection<P>
<B>Recommended Dosage:</B><P>
For Sedation:<P>
Administer detomidine hydrochloride IV or IM at the rates of 20
or 40 mcg detomidine hydrochloride per kilogram of body weight (0.2 or 0.4 mL
of detomidine hydrochloride per 100 kg or 220 lbs.), depending on the depth and
duration of sedation required. Onset of sedative effects will usually occur in
two to four minutes with IV administration and in three to five minutes with IM
administration. Twenty micrograms per kg will provide 30 to 90 minutes of
sedation and 40 mcg/kg will provide approximately 90 minutes  to two hours of
sedation.<P>
For Analgesia:<P>
Administer detomidine hydrochloride IV at the rates of 20 or 40
mcg detomidine hydrochloride per kilogram of body weight (0.2 or 0.4 mL of
detomidine hydrochloride per 100 kg or 220 lbs.), depending on the depth and
duration of analgesia required. Twenty micrograms per kg will usually begin to
take effect in two to four minutes and provide 30 to 45 minutes of analgesia.
The 40 mcg/kg dose will also begin to take effect in two to four minutes and
provide 45 to 75 minutes of analgesia.<P>
For Both Sedation and Analgesia:<P>
Administer detomidine hydrochloride IV at the rates of 20 or 40 mcg detomidine
hydrochloride per kilogram of body weight (0.2 or 0.4 mL of detomidine
hydrochloride per 100 kg or 220 lbs.), depending on the depth and duration of
sedation and analgesia required.<P>
<B>IV. Effectiveness:</B><P>
Seven pivotal, well-controlled studies in horses for dose titration and
evaluation of clinical effectiveness
have shown that detomidine hydrochloride, at doses of 20 mcg/kg and 40 mcg/kg,
provide reliable sedation and analgesia to normal, fractious, or injured horses
subjected to painful procedures, and to horses with abdominal pain.Duration and
depth of treatment effects increased with the higher dose. This was confirmed
in five corroborative studies with 517 clinical cases.<P>
<B>A. Pivotal Studies:</B><P>
<B>1. First Pivotal Study:</B><P>

<B>c) General Design of Investigation:</B><P><B>1) Purpose:</B><P>
The objectives of this study were: <P>
a) To determine the intensity and duration of cutaneous analgesia produced by
increasing dose of detomidine hydrochloride in horses treated intravenously and
using an objective method in a blind trial.<P>b) To confirm the intensity and duration of simultaneously observed signs of
sedation.<P>c) To objectively determine quantitative changes in spontaneous locomotor
activity caused by increasing dose of detomidine hydrochloride given to horses
in an isolated equine activity chamber.<P>d) To evaluate the effects of increasing doses of detomidine hydrochloride on
respiratory rate, cardiac action, pupillary  size and body temperature.<P>
<B>2) Test Animals:</B><P>
Eight healthy, adult thoroughbred horses (four mares, four
geldings) were used. Horses were randomly paired and utilized in a four way
Latin square design.<P>
<B>3) Type of control:</B><P>
Baseline responses to all evaluation parameters were
obtained for each horse prior to treatment  for comparison to responses
obtained subsequent to treatment. In this manner, each horse served as its own
control with regard to physiological responses to treatment. Placebo
injections were used as negative treatment controls. In addition, all
Treatments were "double-blinded".
 One individual determined and prepared all doses, and also determined the
subject randomization and treatment order. A second individual, blinded to
treatment identity, administered treatments as designated by the first
individual. Two other individuals, also blinded as to treatment
identity, served as observers.<P>
<B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>
Diagnostic procedures were not applicable to this dose response
study and were not used.<P>
<B>5)  Dosage Form:</B> Injectable solution.<P>
<B>6)  Route of Administration:</B>  Intravenous injection<P>
<B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>
0 mcg/kg body weight (placebo), 10 mcg/kg body weight, 20
mcg/kg body weight and 40 mcg/kg body weight.<P>
<B>8)  Test Duration:</B><P>
Overall, the study lasted for 28 days, with
treatments in the Latin square design being switched each seventh day.<P>
<B>9)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>
a)  Nociceptive Threshold: Baseline values for the two parameters given below
were obtained at ten minute intervals for 30 minutes, or until values
stabilized. Post injection values were obtained at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,
120, and 180 minutes.<BR>
1) Hoof withdrawal reflex latency ( HWRL): Time elapsed
(in seconds) from illumination of a heatlamp onto a prepared spot on the
fetlock until limb withdrawal.<BR>
2) Skin twitch reflex latency (STRL): Time
elapsed (in seconds) from illumination of a heatlamp on to a prepared spot on
the withers until contraction of cutaneous musculature.<P>
b)  Sedation: Assessed according to the following parameters <BR>

1)  Head ptosis: Measured automatically with a device attached to the animal's
head which measures decreases in voltage as the head drops. Values obtained at
the same intervals as for nociceptive threshold.<BR>
2)  Spontaneous locomotor activity: Measured by placing animal in a close box
stall having four orthogonally mounted photoelectric counters. Counts were
obtained whenever a limb disrupted an infrared beam and were recorded
continuously up to 180 minutes post injection.<P>
c)  Latent or prolonged motor excitement or sedation: Measured as for
spontaneous locomotor activity but for 60 continuous minutes daily for six days
post injection. <P>
d)  Autonomic Responses:<BR>
1)  Respiratory rate:  determined by impedance pneumography. <BR>
2)  Cardiac rate:  determined by electrocardiogram. <BR>
3)  Rectal temperature:  determined by thermocouple. <BR>
4)  Skin temperature:  determined by infrared thermometer. <BR>
5)  Pupil size:  calculated from photographs of the eye using a Polaroid CU-5
close-up camera and measuring along a vertical axis.<P>

In addition, detomidine hydrochloride caused small, dose related
decreases in skin temperature at the suprascapular area which lasted for about
60 minutes; however, this effect was not evident at the fetlock.<P>
<B>e)  Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
Each of the 11 response variables was
statistically analyzed by an analysis of variance procedure for a Latin square
crossover design involving four groups, four dose levels, four treatment
sessions (i.e., periods, each separated by seven days), and two horses per
group. The variation in each response variable over time, as well as each
interaction involving "Time", was evaluated by the Geisser-Greenhouse
test (i.e., dividing both degrees of freedom for the F-test
by the degrees of freedom for "Time") in addition to the usual analysis of
variance F-test.<P>
Variation in each response variable among the four dose levels was partitioned
via orthogonal polynomial contrasts; the relationship of each response to the
dose level was evaluated with respect to time by the interaction of each of
these three polynomial contrasts with time. Due to the significance of the
"Dose by Time" interaction, means for the four dose levels were compared at
each sampling time via application of the least significant difference (LSD)
method with the appropriate pooled mean square error. Differences between
mares and geldings with respect to the effects of detomidine hydrochloride were
evaluated by repeating the above statistical analyses but with "Sex" of the
horse as a factor in the analysis of variance. Finally, analysis of
covarience was applied to the post-injection
data for the two response variables for which the F-test
for "Dose" was statistically significant in the analysis of the pre-injection
baseline data.<P>
<B>f)  Conclusions:</B><P>
Results of this study confirm the dose-dependent
sedation and analgesia provided by detomidine hydrochloride, and extend the
efficacy of its analgesic capability to slow-burning
pain which is qualitatively different form that produced by electric shock, as
reported in the following study summary.<P>
<B>g)  Adverse Reactions:</B><P>
No adverse reactions were noted. Side effects included
prolonged depression in cardiac rate at all doses tested (Figure 5). Peak
bradycardia occurred within 15 minutes post injection and was sustained for
several hours at all doses. Significant bradycardia was observed for 120
minutes at the low dose, and for 180 minutes at the medium and high doses
(Table 1). There was little evidence of a return to baseline levels at the
medium and high doses during the 180 minute observation period. Detomidine
hydrochloride appeared to increase the duration more than the intensity of the
bradycardia. A significant linear dose effect was obtained over the 180 minute
observation period. Detomidine hydrochloride produced a prolonged bradypnea
with a similar time course to that obtained for heart rate (Figure 6). Peak
effects generally occurred within 30 minutes and recovery rates again appeared
to be a function of dose. Both intensity and duration of effect increased with
dose. Significant bradypnea was observed for 120 minutes at the low dose, and
for 180 minutes at the medium and high doses (Table 1). A linear dose effect
was obtained for the entire 180 minute observation period. Rectal temperature
varied widely over time following various doses of detomidine hydrochloride
(Figure 8). Hyperthermia was the initial response following the low and medium
doses of detomidine hydrochloride. Temperature increased rapidly following the
medium dose, and significant hyperthermia was observed from 15-60
minutes post injection. At the low dose a brief but non-significant
period of hyperthermia was followed by a hypothermic response which was
significant only at 120 minutes post injection. A late onset hyperthermic
response was observed at the high dose which lasted from 45-60
minutes post injection. No significant linear effect over treatments was
obtained. To a varying degree at all doses, detomidine hydrochloride produced
an undesirable but self-limiting
syndrome consisting of dyspnea, rales, facial edema, salivation and serous
nasal discharge. This syndrome, along with cyanotic gingiva, was particularly
prevalent at the high dose. However, recumbency was never observed at this
dose and no residual effect was noted. In each experiment, all subjects
returned to their normal pre-injection
status within 24 hours.<P>

<B>c)  General Design of Investigation:</B><P>
<B>1)  Purpose:</B><P>
To determine objectively in blinded trials a dose response curve
of detomidine hydrochloride for both sedation and analgesia in horses treated
intramuscularly.<P>
<B>2)  Test Animals:</B><P>
Six mature healthy quarterhorse type horses (3 geldings,
2 stallions, 1 mare) were utilized in a 6x6 Latin square design.<P>
<B>3)  Type of Control Used:</B><P>
In the initial, non-treatment
phase, each animal was evaluated according to a group of clinical parameters
for sedation. Each animal's response to pain, as afflicted to the coronary
bands and perineal area using a metered, constant current shock generator, was
also assessed. These baseline values were then used to compare treatment-induced
sedation and analgesia as evaluated by the same methods. Therefore, each animal
served as its own control with regard
to physiological responses to evaluation parameters. Regarding control
treatments, placebo injections were used as a negative control while xylazine
(Rompun, Haver-Lockhart
Labs, Shawnee, KS 66201) and acepromazine (Promace, Fort Dodge Labs, Fort
Dodge, IA 50501) were used as positive controls. In addition, the investigator
was blinded with regard to the identity of treatments given.<P>
<B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>
Diagnostic procedures were not applicable to this dose response
study and were not used. <P><B>5)  Dosage Form:</B><P>
a)  Sterile injectable solution.<P>
b)  The formulations of the subject new animal drug used in this study were not
the same as the formulation to be marketed. In order to maintain blinded
conditions, the subject drug was manufactured so that the volume of solution
administered was identical in all cases but the concentrations of active
ingredient were different. Concentrations of test solutions were 0 mg/mL
(placebo), 1.0 mg/mL, 16.0 mg/mL, and 32.0 mg/mL.<P>
<B>6)  Route of Administration:</B><P>
All treatments were administered intramuscularly.<P>
<B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>
Detomidine hydrochloride was administered at 0
(placebo), 5, 20, 80, and 160 mcg/kg body weight. Xylazine was given at a
level of 1.1 mg/kg body weight. Acepromazine was administered at 0.066 mg/kg
body weight intramuscularly.<P>
<B>8)  Test Duration:</B><P>
The overall duration of the study was 70 days. The duration
of individual replicates, including washouts, ranged from 11-16
days (detomidine hydrochloride vs. xylazine). The acepromazine trial began 37
days after completion of the detomidine hydrochloride vs. xylazine trial. This
phase of the trial, with no washout, lasted three days.<P>
<B>9)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>
Sedation:<P>
The following sedation-related
parameters were determined during the first 15 minutes after dosing and their
occurrence as to sedation onset and the full extent of sedation were timed.
These determinations were continued thereafter in 15 minute intervals for four
hours or until signs of drug effect had disappeared.<P>
a)  Dropping of the horse's head by:<BR>
1)determining the angle formed between neckline and withers (see Table 1
for definition); <BR>
2)determining the distance between the lowest part of the lower lip and
the floor. <P>
b)  Dropping of the horse's ears by determining the distance between ear tips.<P>
c)  Dropping of the horse's eyelids by rating the degree of upper eyelid
relaxation as light (about 1/4; score 1), medium (about 1/2; score 2) or
heavy (about 3/4 of the visible eyeball covered; score 3).<P>
d)  Dropping of the lower lip by determining if it occurs (1) or not 0).<P>
e)  Dropping of the penis (in gelding and stallions) by determining if it
occurs (1) or not (0).<P>
f)  Clinical evaluation of the sedative effect:<P>
Score 0:  No sedation;<BR>
Score 1:  Poor sedation, unsatisfactory to perform clinical procedures;<BR>
Score 2:  Fair sedation, satisfactory to perform clinical procedures;<BR>
Score 3:  Good to excellent sedation, highly satisfactory to perform clinical
procedures.<P>
g)  Response (reaction) to noise (banging on an empty bucket):<P>
Score 0:  Full reaction, i.e. the animal heard the noise and moved vigorously
away from its source; <BR>
Score 1:  It is evident the animal heard the noise but its reaction and
movements are somewhat muted; <BR>
Score 2:  Animal does not show any indication that noise was heard.<P>
h)  Ability to recognize and step over a standardized obstacle
(barrier): a white painted pole, 4-5
centimeters in diameter and tow meters long, was suspended between two hoses,
each 30 to 35 centimeters high. The horse's ability in avoiding or striving to
avoid touching the pole or throwing the pole off its resting place was recorded
and transformed into scores. This was done in hourly intervals only.<P>
Score 0:  Got over the obstacle with all four feet: <BR>
Score 1:  Hit with the 4th foot when going over the barrier; <BR>
Score 2:  Hit with the 3rd foot when going over the barrier; <BR>
Score 3:  Hit with the 2nd foot when going over the barrier; <BR>
Score 4:  Hit with the 1st foot when going over the barrier; <BR>
Score 5:  Walking unsteady, does not recognize the barrier, walks right into
it.<P>
Analgesia:<P>
A constant current shock generator (metered), widely used in lab
animal pharmacology for pain infliction, was used in these studies. For testing
the pain threshold at the front and the hind leg, two electrodes were fixed
about two centimeters apart at the inside of a leather dog collar. Before each
trial, these collars were positioned around the coronary band of the left front
leg and the left hid leg and closed tight. The hair at the coronary bands was
kept closely clipped. The electrodes were connected to the shock generator
before the trial and, before each test, the space between collars and coronary
bands was filled with electrical contact gel. The current output was raised
until the animal responded to pain not only by shifting, but by actually
lifting the afflicted front or hind leg. The threshold levels at which this
occurred were recorded. For testing the pain threshold in the perineal area,
two pointed electrodes were mounted about two centimeters apart at the end of a
plastic handle approximately one meter long. Pain response was elicited by
touching the perineal area, previously wetted with electrical contact gel, and
raising the current output until the animal responded to pain with anal
sphincter contractions. The individual pain threshold and the response to drug
treatments were determined as noted previously.<P>

<B>e)  Statistical Analysis:</B><P>For statistical evaluation, an analysis of variance
(general linear model procedures SAS) was performed. As noted previously under
"Results", the values for duration of drug effects presented in Tables 1 and 2
are significantly different from placebo at the .05 level. For sedative
effects (Table 1), the lowest dose (5 mcg/kg body weight) was essentially
indistinguishable from placebo. All parameters for all other doses were
significantly different from placebo after intramuscular administration. For
the sedative measures collectively (Table 3), the Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient is 0.95, and with dose on a logarithmic scale the Pearson's product
moment correlation coefficient is 0.94. With dose on a linear scale this
coefficient is only 0.91. For analgesia (Table 4), at the front leg, all doses
were significantly different from placebo. At the rear leg, only the higher
doses (80 and 160 mcg/kg) were significantly different from placebo.<P>

<B>f)  Conclusions:</B><P>
Detomidine hydrochloride provided sedative effect which were
highly related to dose level. The analgesia and its duration provided by
detomidine hydrochloride is clearly influenced by the location of pain on the
body. The data indicate that the dose of 20 mcg/kg body weight given
intramuscularly should provide sufficient sedation for most purposes and that
increasing the dose up to twice the recommended highest dose will increase
effectiveness and the duration of effects without significantly decreasing
safety.<P>
<B>g)  Adverse Reactions:</B><P>
No adverse reactions were noted. Side effects included
sustained bradycardia and reduced pulse rate at the 80 and 160 mcg/kg body
weight dose levels. Diuresis occurred with most horses at the 20 mcg/kg dose
and with all horses given the two higher doses. These effects were judged by the
investigator not to be serious.<P>

<B>c)  General Design of Investigation:</B><P>
<B>1)  Purpose:</B>  The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate in blinded
fashion, using a balloon-induced
abdominal pain model, the sedation and analgesia provided by detomidine
hydrochloride given via intravenous and intramuscular administration for
controlling abdominal pain in horses.<P>
<B>2)  Test Animals:</B><P>Ten cecal-fistulated
ponies (five geldings and five mares) were each randomly assigned to one of ten
treatments representing five different dosages. Treatment assignments were
switched for each of five replicates.<P>
<B>3)  Type of Control:</B><P>In the first phase (intravenous administration), placebo
was used as negative treatment control. In addition, the investigator was
blinded to the concentration and identity of drug given. The concentrations of
test solution were adjusted to maintain blinded conditions so that 0.5 mL/100
kg body weight was the volume of test drug used to calculate all dosages.
Following this trial, an open trial was performed using xylazine in the same
animals at 0.5 mg/lb. body weight intravenously for positive treatment control
comparisons. In the second phase (intramuscular administration), placebo was
again used as negative treatment control and investigators were also blinded as
to identity and strength of treatments. This phase was also followed by an
open trial using xylazine at 1.0 mg/lb. body weight intramuscularly in the same
animals for positive control treatment comparisons.<P>
<B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>
Since the balloon model intentionally produced the required
signs and symptoms of abdominal pain associated with colic, use of diagnostic
procedures was not necessary.<P>
<B>5)  Dosage Form:</B><P>
a)  All treatments were injectable solution.<P>
b)  The formulations used in these studies were not the same as the formulation
to be marketed. The concentrations of test solution were adjusted to maintain
blinded conditions so that 0.5 mL/100 kg body weight was the volume of test
drug used to calculate all dosages.<P>
<B>6)  Route of Administration:</B><P>In phase one trials, all solutions were given
intravenously. In phase two, all solutions were given intramuscularly.<P>
<B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride was administered
intravenously and intramuscularly at 0 mcg/kg bodyweight (placebo: diluent
without active drug substance) and 5, 20, 80 and 160 mcg/kg body weight.
Xylazine was given intravenously at 1.1 mg/kg body weight and intramuscularly
at 2.2 mg/kg body weight.<P>
<B>8) Test Duration:</B><P>The overall study lasted throughout a period of 308 days.
Each of the ten ponies was used in five replicates each for detomidine
hydrochloride given intravenously and intramuscularly, respectively, and in tow
subsequent trials with xylazine. A washout period of at least six days was
allowed between treatments. Immediately prior to balloon inflation and
continuing throughout the period of drug effect, observations were recorded
during five minute long observation periods. Cessation of drug effect was
indicated by return to baseline response values.<P>

<B>d)  Results:</B><P>
Duration of pain relief, in minutes, provided for each pony by
each treatment, is presented in Table 1 for the intravenous trial and for the
intramuscular trial. The mean and standard deviation of the duration of pain
relief for the data are summarized in Table 2. The duration of relief from pain
under the IV route of injection was found to vary significantly (p&#60;.001)
among the five dose levels. Most of this variability in duration of pain
relief (98.9&#37;) was found to be attributable to a linear trend over the five
dose levels (p&#60;.001). Mean duration of pain relief under IV route of
injection was not found to differ between male and female ponies (p&#61;.869).
Neither the overall variation among the five dose levels nor the linear trend
was significantly different between male and female ponies (p&#61;.967 and p&#61;.555,
respectively). The 5 mcg/kg IV dose and the 5 mcg/kg and 20 mcg/kg IM doses
were not significantly better than placebo with regard to duration of pain
relief.<P>
<B>e)  Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
The varying time interval between treatments was
ignored (as supported by their clinical evidence) so that "Period" was not a
factor in the analysis. Instead, the "Order" of treatments received was
considered a factor in the design and the data were statistically evaluated by
an analysis of variance procedure for an experimental design involving two
independent Latin squares, one for female ponies and one for male ponies.<BR>
In order to statistically evaluate the possible effect of the varying time
interval between treatments, the data on the duration of pain relief under IV
and IM injection were also analyzed via analysis of covariance in which the time
interval between treatments was used as a covariate. Duration of pain relief
was found to be not linearly related to the time interval between treatments;
hence, the results of the analysis of covariance were essentially the same as
those obtained in the analysis of variance.<P>
<B>f)  Conclusions:</B><P>
The analgesic and sedative effects of detomidine
hydrochloride were found to be statistically significant and significantly
related to dose level. The variation in each analgesic and sedative response
variable over the post-injection
sampling times was significantly different among the four dose levels. Similar
results were found in the analysis of the autonomic response variables. Also,
analysis of a measure of delayed sedation revealed no significant effects of
detomidine hydrochloride on delayed sedation.<P>
<B>g)  Adverse Reactions:</B><P>
No adverse reactions were noted. Side effects included
diuresis and cessation of cecal contractions under the influence of detomidine
hydrochloride. No detrimental conditions were evident because of these
effects; in fact, the interference with gut motility was thought to have aided
the analgesic effect by reducing pressure peaks in the wall of the bowel.<P>

Dept. Large Animal Medicine<BR>
School of Veterinary Medicine<BR>
University of Georgia<BR>
Athens, GA 30602.<P>
<B>c)  General Design of Investigation:</B><P>
<B>1)  Purpose:</B><P>
To evaluate the effectiveness of detomidine hydrochloride for
sedation and analgesia in horses showing the severe abdominal pain associated
with equine colic.<P>
<B>2)  Test Animals:</B><P>
A total of 40 horses, clinically diagnosed as having colic,
were admitted to this study. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment
groups. Stallions, mares and geldings of a variety of breeds were admitted.<P>
<B>3)  Type of Control:</B><P>
Each of three treatments was letter coded
according to a blinding scheme which was unknown to the investigator. Each vial
of drug within a treatment was also assigned one of three letters. Group 1
vials (4 mg/mL detomidine hydrochloride) were given "A", "M", or G"; Group 2
vials (2 mg/mL detomidine hydrochloride) were given "C", "I" or "O" and Group 3
vials (10 mg/mL butorphanol tartrate: Torbugesic&#174;, Bristol Labs), were given
"B", "H" or "N" and were used as positive treatment control. All drugs were
given at the identical rate of 1.0 mL/100 kg body weight.  Each animal served
as its own control with regard to physiological response to treatment.<P>
<B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>
Animals presenting clinical signs of colic (obvious abdominal
discomfort or pain, abnormal postures, lying down and getting up, etc.)  were
further evaluated by rectal exam when possible to confirm initial diagnoses and
determine causes.<P>
<B>5)  Dosage Form:</B><P>
All treatments  were injectable solutions. The
formulations of detomidine hydrochloride used in this study were not the same
as the intended market formulation. As the basis for the blinding scheme,
detomidine hydrochloride was manufactured at concentrations of 2 and 4 mg/mL
whereas the concentration of the intended market formulation is 10 mg/mL.<P>
<B>6)  Routes of Administration:</B>  All drugs were administered
intravenously.<P>
<B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>
Detomidine hydrochloride was given at either 20 mcg/kg body
weight or 40 mcg/kg body weight. Torbugesic was administered at a level of
0.1 mg/kg body weight.<P>
<B>8)  Test Duration:</B>  The overall duration of this study was 270 days.<P>
<B>9)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>
The severity of abdominal pain accompanying
colic was determined prior to (time 0) and after drug administration at 15, 30,
45 and 60 minutes and, if possible, in half-hour
intervals thereafter until drug effects had subsided, using a standardized
objective and subjective scoring system designed to describe several clinical
parameters common to equine colic. The criteria for evaluating the intensity
of abdominal pain were as follows:<BR>
Sweating :  0 Normal appearance and no
sweating; 1 Warmer than normal to touch but no sweating; 2 Slight dampness to
touch, sweating is barely recognizable; 3 Wet to touch, sweating is obvious; 4
Severe to excessive sweating.<BR>
Kicking:  0 Standing quietly, no kicking; 1
Occasional kicking at abdomen (approximately once in 3 min.); 3 Frequent
kicking at abdomen (approximately one or more/min.); 4 Violent attempts to kick
and intermittent attempts to lie down.<BR>
Pawing:  0 Standing quietly, no pawing;
1 Occasional pawing (approximately once in 3 min.); 2 Occasional pawing
(approximately 2x in 3 min.); 3 Frequent pawing (more than 2x/min.); 4
Continuous moving and stomping or pawing.<BR>
Head &#38; Body: 0 No evidence of
discomfort - head kept mostly straight; 1 Occasional looking at flank (approximately
once/min.); 2 Shifting weight side to side, looking at flank (approximately
2x/min.); 3 Frequent shifting of weight - looking
at flank (approximately 3-5x/min.); 4 Exaggerated body movements -
lies down, kicks, paws, etc.<BR>The investigator was asked to evaluate attitude by
selecting, from the list below, the choice that best described the animal at
the prescribed time interval.<P><DL>
<DD>A Sedated, lowered head, little or no response to auditory stimulation.
<DD>B Stands quietly, occasional weight shift, normal response to auditory
stimulation.
<DD>C Stands normally, occasional head movement - bright and alert.
<DD>D Very alert, exaggerated response to noise, rapid eye movement.
<DD>E Twitching, continual movement, very excited.</DL>
Drug response  and duration
were determined by comparing pre- and post-treatment
evaluation scores at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes and in half hour intervals
thereafter. All observations on the strength and duration of sedation,
analgesia, side effects, and an assessment as to whether the
drug effect was satisfactory for the intended
purpose were recorded individually on a case report form during the entire
evaluation period. For the assessment of the analgesic effect of the
experimental drug, the following characterizations and criteria were used:<P><DL>
<DT>Highly satisfactory:<DD>If the drug produced a very good analgesic effect
for a period adequate to perform diagnostic procedures and to permit
alleviation of the intestinal problem by specific therapy.<P>
<DT>Satisfactory:<DD>If the drug used produced a noticeable analgesic effect in
relieving pain associated with colic, but minor indications of pain are still
present.<P>
<DT>Barely satisfactory:  <DD>If the drug used produced only a barely noticeable
analgesic effect in relieving pain associated with colic.<P>
<DT>Not satisfactory:  <DD>If the drug used produced not noticeable analgesic effect in
relieving pain associated with colic.<P></DL>

For the assessment of the experimental drug, the following
characterizations and criteria were used:<P><DL>
<DT>Highly satisfactory:  <DD>If the drug used produced a deep sedative effect for a
period adequate to perform all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The
animal was not easily aroused when stimulated (e.g., rectal examination) and
did not respond to noise. Staggering was not a problem. Almost no movements.<P>
<DT>Satisfactory:  <DD>If the drug used produced a noticeable sedative effect
sufficient to perform all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The animal
was slightly aroused when stimulated and seemed to recognize noise, but did not
respond to it. Slight staggering; little movement.<P>
<DT>Barely satisfactory:  <DD>If the drug used produced only a barely noticeable
sedative effect not quite sufficient to perform all diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures. The animal responded to stimulation and to noise, albeit in a
somewhat subdued manner. Incoordinate or coordinated movements were a problem.<P>
<DT>Not satisfactory:  <DD>If the drug used produced no noticeable sedative effect.

Attempts were made to record temperatures of these horses at the
prescribed intervals.  Clinical manipulations (rectal palpations) caused
rectal dilation so that temperatures could not be taken accurately.<P>
<B>e)  Conclusions:</B><P>
Irrespective of the cause of abdominal pain,
detomidine hydrochloride provided at least satisfactory levels for and
analgesia. There were differences between dose levels.
With the higher dose, effects appeared slightly faster,were slightly more
intense and were longer lasting. Thus, this drug provided the kind of sedation
and analgesia desirable for examining colicky horses safely and thoroughly, and
for initiating the appropriate therapy or therapeutic procedures.<P>

<b>Trade Name:</b>       TYLAN&#174; <p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> OTC <p>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>     June 29, 1994 <p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and monensin.
Previous approvals have required a 48 hour pre-slaughter drug withdrawal for
heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with either tylosin or
monensin and tylosin. <p>
<b>II.	Indications for Use:</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for the combined
administration of melengestrol acetate and tylosin either with or without
monensin which are: <p>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter. <p>
<b>III.	Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b> <p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b>                            Feed <p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>                   Oral <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>	<b>Melengestrol acetate: </b> 	0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
<b>Monensin (as monensin sodium):</b>  	50 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton 		air
dried complete feed)<br>	<b>Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate):</b>  	90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
	complete feed) <p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 90 mg tylosin per head per day with or without 50
to 360 mg monensin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement for
slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate of
0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head. <p>
<b>IV. Effectiveness</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the indications for these combinations. <p>
<b>V. Animal Safety </b><p>
This supplement does not affect target animal safety of these combinations. <p>
<b>VI. Human Safety </b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b> <p>
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period. <p>
A tolerance of 0.05 ppm has been established for negligible residues of
monensin in the edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.420). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed monensin (21 CFR 558.355). <p>
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625). <p>
<b>2.	Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin.</b> <p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of
the supplemental application for MGA (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402) and that the
concentration of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances, when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, tylosin and monensin in combination, each
at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
withdrawal. This study is summarized below. <p>
Groups of heifers were individually fed for 90 days either no additive
(control, n=14) or melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin in combination at
1X (n=7), 3X (n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive
(1X = 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate, 30 g monensin/ton air dried feed and 10 g
tylosin/ton air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero
withdrawal. <p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the method described in JAOAC
59:507-515:1976. This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from heifers in the control and 1X treatment group had concentration of
melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat samples from heifers in the 3X and 5X dose groups were 29.2 ppb
(range 18.2 to 39.6 ppb) and 42.2 ppb (range 35.8 to 49 ppb), respectively. <p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of monensin and tylosin
residues. No residues of either monensin or tylosin were detected in any of the
liver samples from these heifers. The limit of detection for these analyses
were 0.04 and 0.1 ppm for monensin and tylosin, respectively. <p>
<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
These data demonstrate that when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin and
monensin in combination the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is
below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and the concentration
of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances. <p>
<b>3. Assay noninterference </b><p>
Data, previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrated <p>
1)	the presence of monensin and tylosin does not interfere with the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<br>
2)	presence of monensin and melengestrol acetate does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for tylosin; and<br>
3)	presence of melengestrol acetate and tylosin does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for monensin <p>
<b>4. Regulatory methods</b> <p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, monensin and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, 
Room 12A30). <p>
<b>5. Conclusions</b> <p>
This supplement provides for the deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
pre-slaughter withdrawal period for melengestrol acetate when fed in combination
with tylosin and either with or without monensin. No changes are made in either
the approved dosages of any of these additives, the approved indications of use
or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the conclusion
that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is below the established
tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of melengestrol acetate
and tylosin either with or without monensin. Accordingly this change in
regulations for melengestrol acetate is not expected to have adverse effects on
public health or food safety. <p>
<b>VII.   Agency Conclusions</b> <p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and
monensin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity data for MGA
contained in NADA's 034-254 and 039-402. <p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>	2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

The basis for the original approval of this ANADA was published in 60
FR 14217, March 16, 1995. <p>

<b>	3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

<i>Tolerance</i><p>

The tolerance for neomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle,
swine, sheep, and goats was originally established at 0.25 ppm (21 CFR
556.430).  The tolerance is being revised using the new food consumption
factors as described in the FDA/CVM July 1994 guideline entitled, "General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing
Animals" (59 FR 37499).  A tolerance of 7.2 ppm is established for residues of
parent neomycin (marker residue) in the kidney (target tissue), 7.2 ppm in fat,
3.6 ppm in liver, 1.2 ppm in muscle of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats.  A
tolerance of 0.15 ppm is established for neomycin in milk.<p>

<i>Studies Establishing the Withdrawal Period</i><p>

Four separate residue depletion studies were conducted by Colorado Animal
Research Enterprises Inc. (CARE), Fort Collins, Colorado under VMF 5154.  The
purpose of the studies was to determine the depletion of neomycin in swine,
cattle, sheep, or goats following administration of 10 mg neomycin
sulfate/pound body weight/day through drinking water for 14 days.<p>

1.  Ten male and ten female swine weighing approximately 100 lbs each were
administered neomycin sulfate at 10 mg/lb/day for 14 days through the drinking
water.  One male and one female swine served as controls.  The swine were
sacrificed in groups of four (2M, 2F) at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after the last
dose.  Samples of kidney, liver, muscle, and fat were taken and assayed for
residues.  Only kidney had detectable amounts of residues.<p>

A weighted least squares regression line was fit to tobit maximum likelihood
(ML) estimates of central location for each time point.  The weights were based
on ML estimates of dispersion.  This accommodates values below the limit of
quantitation and above the limit of detection.  Using a statistical tolerance
limit for the 99th percentile of the population with 95% confidence, the
following withdrawal times were calculated for animals treated with 10
mg/lb/day neomycin sulfate for 14 days through drinking water:  <p>

<i>Regulatory Method for Residues</i><p>

The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> suspension.  The
method is published  by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols",
revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974. <p>

<b>	4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>

Neomycin sulfate, codified in 21 CFR Parts 520.1484(c)(3) and 556.430, is
approved for marketing as a soluble powder for the treatment and control of
colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>
susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle (excluding veal calves), swine,
sheep, and goats.<p>

The data submitted in support of this supplemental ANADA requesting an increase
in the tolerance satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrate that neomycin sulfate (Neomycin 325 Soluble Powder) at a dose of 10
mg/lb/day for 14 days orally in the drinking water, will produce concentrations
of residues in the kidneys (target tissue) in cattle, swine, sheep, and goats
which are below the accepted tolerance (7.2 ppm) by the following revised
withdrawal periods.  The withdrawal period for cattle is 1 day, sheep is 2
days, and swine and goats is 3 days. <p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy, this is a Category II change
[21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(x)and(xi)]. The approval of this change, a recalculation
of the tolerance, is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or
effectiveness of this new animal drug.  The change in tolerance allows for a
decrease in the withdrawal period.  Accordingly, this approval  did not require
a reevaluation of the safety or effectiveness data in the parent
application.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food , Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the application does not contain reports of new clinical or
field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) or new
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

The objectives of these studies were to select an appropriate model for
dose-response efficacy testing in the horse and to determine an appropriate
intravenous dosage for further clinical testing of ketoprofen in that model.<P>
Test animals included 14 previously healthy mature horses, 10 geldings and 4
mares, ranging in body weight from 804 to 974 pounds.<P>
The left carpal joint of each horse was surgically prepared and 0.7 ml Freund's
complete adjuvant was injected into the intercarpal space.  This procedure is
known to result in acute inflammation of the joint which, if left untreated,
progresses to chronic degenerative arthritis.  After seven days, by which time
swelling, heat, pain, and lameness had developed in all study animals, each
horse was given a single intravenous injection of ketoprofen at the randomly
assigned dosage of 0 (placebo), 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mg/lb body weight.  Four (4)
horses were treated at each of the 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/lb dosage while two (2)
horses received the placebo treatment.<P>
Controls were given placebo (vehicle not containing ketoprofen) injections at
the rate of 1 mL/100 lb body weight.<P>
Dosage form was ketoprofen injectable solution containing 100 mg ketoprofen per
ml, identical to the formulation to be marketed.<P>
Dosages, routes of administration, and duration were 0 (placebo), 0.5, 1.0 or
1.5 mg/pound body weight given intravenously as a single injection and
evaluated for 30 hours after treatment.<P>
This study was blinded by having the treatment administered by one individual
and the post treatment observation made by a second individual.<P>
Pertinent parameters measured before each treatment and 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and
30 hours after each treatment were the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate
<li>Angle of flexion at rest (degrees)
<li>Maximum flexion permitted (degrees)
<li>Stride length (distance between steps at a walk)
<li>Clinical lameness score (0-3, where 0=normal, 3=severe)
<li>Circumference of inflamed joint (measured with a tape measure)</ul>

Results of the study revealed that all dosages of ketoprofen were active, and
lower dosage of 0.5 mg/lb was less effective than dosages of 1.0 and 1.5 mg/lb
and these were not different from each other.<P>

Among the parameters measured, maximum flexion and stride length appeared to be
the most sensitive in separating dosage effects as illustrated graphically in
the following figures.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/140269-2.gif" ALT="STRIDE LENGTH">
<P>During the study there were no observed adverse reactions in the treated
horses. <P>
Statistical analysis of the data was performed by analysis of variance and the
Student-Newman-Keuls and Duncan's Multiple Range procedures on change from
baseline (preinflammation) at each observation time at the 0.05 level of
significance.  In general, for parameters listed in the above tables, the mean
values in the 1.0 and 1.5 mg/lb ketoprofen groups were significantly
(p&lt;0.05) different from those in placebo and 0.5 mg/lb groups between about
4 and 16 hours after treatment but were never significantly different from each
other.<P>
Conclusions drawn from the study were that the adjuvant arthritis model is
appropriate for dose determination of ketoprofen and that 1 mg/lb is an
effective dosage intravenously.<P>

The purpose of this study was to compare the antiinflammatory effects of
ketoprofen given at the previously titrated dosage of 1.0 mg/lb intravenously
with the effects of an approved reference control drug and placebo in an equine
adjuvant arthritis model.<P>
Test animals included 18 previously healthy mature horses of quarter horse type
represented by both sexes, randomly divided into three treatment groups as
follows:
<pre>      Ketoprofen 1 mg/lb IV             6 horses
      Positive control (flunixin, IV    6 horses
      Negative control (placebo)        6 horses
</pre>
The left carpal joint of each horse was surgically prepared and 0.7 ml Freund's
complete adjuvant was 	injected into the intercarpal space.  This procedure is
known to result in acute inflammation of the joint which, if left unteated,
progresses to chronic degenerative arthritis.  After five to seven days, by
which time swelling, heat, pain, and lameness had developed in all study
animals, treatment was initiated on each horse according to the treatment group
to which it had been randomly assigned.  Horses were treated with ketoprofen
injectable solution containing 100 mg ketoprofen per ml, identical to the
formulation to be marketed, at a dosage of 1 mg/lb IV.<P>
Controls were given placebo (vehicle not containing ketoprofen) intravenous
injections at the rate of 1 mg/100 lb body weight.  Positive controls were
given flunixin (Banamine, Schering, 50 mg/ml) obtained from commercial sources,
at its approved dosage of 0.5 mg/lb IV.  Both drugs and placebo were given
daily for five days.<P>
This study was blinded by having the treatment administered by one individual
and the post treatment observation made by a second individual.<P>
Pertinent parameters measured before adjuvant injection, before treatment, 2,
4, 12, and 24 hours after the first treatment, and twice daily throughout the
study period were the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>General health (temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate)
<li>Angle of flexion at rest (degrees)
<li>Maximum flexion permitted (degrees)
<li>Stride length (distance between steps at a walk)
<li>Clinical lameness score (0-3, 0=normal, 3=severe)
<li>Circumference of inflamed joint (measured with a tape measure)
<li>Joint heat (0-3, where 0=normal, 3=severe)
<li>Pain on palpation (0-3, where 0=normal, 3=severe)</ul>

Results of the study indicated that ketoprofen by the intravenous route of
administration was equivalent in effectiveness to the approved reference
control drug flunixin.  The mean results for each parameter at each measurement
time are present in the following table.<P>
During the study there were no adverse reactions in the treated horses.<P>

Statistical analysis of the data was performed by analysis of variance and
Duncan's Multiple Range procedure on change from baseline (preinflammation) at
each observation time at the 0.05 level of significance.  Responses in
ketoprofen IV, and flunixin treated animals were significantly (p&lt;0.05)
better than those in placebo controls but were not significantly different
among drug treatment groups.<P>  
Conclusions based on results of the study were that ketoprofen, given at a
dosage of 1.0 mg/lb 	intravenously, shows marked antiinflammatory activity in
horses, equivalent to that of the approved reference control drug flunixin.<P>

The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical antiinflammatory
effects and side effect profile of ketoprofen given at the proposed dosage of
2.2 mg/kg (1 mg/lb) intravenously for 5 consecutive days in horses with
musculoskeletal inflammatory disorders, under conditions of veterinary
practice.<P>
Test animals included horses of either sex and of any age that, in the routine
course of the investigators' practice, were presented for diagnosis and
treatment of non-infectious inflammatory conditions of the musculoskeletal
system from the elbow or stifle joint distal.<P>
Diagnoses, based on physical examination and x-rays if indicated, included
various inflammatory condition characterized as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>Conditions less than 2-4 weeks duration
<li>Lameness of American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) grad 2 or
more, or marked pain on palpation
<li>Swelling or heat clinically greater than corresponding contralateral side
<li>Horses with a tentative diagnosis of any of the following conditions:<ul>
<li>Traumatic arthritis/synovitis
<li>Tendonitis/desmitis
<li>Osteochondritis dessicans
<li>Osselets
<li>Soft tissue swelling
<li>Post surgical inflammation and swelling</ul></ul>

Horses with inflammatory conditions of over 4 weeks duration; horses that had
received antiinflammatory or other anti-arthritic drugs within the previous 14
days; fracture cases <i>except</i>&#160;post surgical cases; and horses with a
tentative diagnosis of laminitis, splints, osteitis, or navicular disease; were
not included in the study.<P>
Dosage form, dosage, and duration. The investigational drug ketoprofen was
supplied as a sterile, 100 mg/ml solution, identical to the formulation to be
marketed, in glass vials each containing 50 ml.  The control drug flunixin, 50
mg/ml obtained from commercial sources, was supplied in 50 ml glass vials
identical to those containing ketoprofen.  Ketoprofen was given at a dosage of
1.0 mg/lb intravenously and flunixin was given at its approved dosage of 0.5
mg/lb intravenously.  Both drugs were given daily for five days.<P>
The study was blinded by providing each investigator with numbered vials
containing either ketoprofen or flunixin.  Both products were clear, colorless
aqueous solution, packaged in identical vials, and the recommended dosage of
each corresponds to 1 ml/100 lb of body weight was given intravenously.
Consecutive numbers from 1 to 100 were randomly assigned to either control or
test substance vials in a 50:50 ratio.  The substances were supplied to
investigators as kits each containing 10 vials numbered consecutively and
randomly but equally divided between ketoprofen and flunixin.  The coding
system was known only to Pharmaceutical Development personnel who prepared the
test substances and was not broken until the data were analyzed.<P>
Pertinent parameters measured included general physical examinations and
observations for any apparent side effects daily just prior to the scheduled
treatment.  Complete evaluation of lameness and pain on palpation, as well as
measurement of circumference and thermography of lesion site and corresponding
contralateral site, was conducted before treatment, on the 3rd day after
initiation of treatment, and again 24 hours after the 5th and final treatment
was as follows:<P>
Lameness, evaluated on a subjective 0-4 scale where
<dl>
<dt>0=normal
<dd>no detectable lameness
<dt>1=slight
<dd>subtle lameness without overt head movement,
<dt>2=moderate
<dd>easily recognizable, head-bobbing lameness
<dt>3=severe
<dd>definite lameness observed at a walk and at a trot
<dt>4=extreme
<dd>non weight-bearing on affected limb</dl>
Pain on palpation, evaluated on a 0-3 scale where
<dl><dt>0=normal
<dd>no response to firm pressure
<dt>1=slight
<dd>digital pressure at site of lesion induces muscle tremors and/or slight
avoidance movement

<dt>2=moderate
<dd>digital pressure at site of lesion induces definite limb withdrawal
<dt>3=severe
<dd>attempted digital pressure induces marked withdrawal</dl>
Swelling, circumference of affected part measured with a tape measure as
compared with the circumference of the corresponding site on the opposite
limb.<P>
Heat (thermography), Skin temperature at a predesignated and marked position
over the lesion site, and at the equivalent position on the contralateral limb
of the horse, was measured and recorded.  For this purpose microprobe
thermometers (Sensortek(TM), BAT-12), equipped with skin surface probes
(similar to miniature stethoscopes) were procured, tested for accuracy and
provided to each investigator.<P>
Overall evaluation of clinical response was made of each case at the time of
the last (24 hour post treatment) examination according to the following
criteria:<br>

<dl>
<dt>Excellent:
<dd>No detectable lameness or swelling, horse can be returned to normal
activity
<dt>Good:
<dd>Marked reduction in lameness and swelling but horse not completely back to
pre treatment condition
<dt>Fair:
<dd>Only slight reduction in lameness and swelling
<dt>Poor:
<dd>No improvement, or condition worsened</dl>
Results were obtained from a total of 52 horses, 25 treated with ketoprofen and
27 treated with flunixin, distributed among the four investigators.  Both drugs
showed antiinflammatory activity under clinical conditions and the responses
were similar.  The data are summarized in the following table.<P>

<P><b>Statistical analysis</b><P>
A procedure for comparing proportions from <i>m</i>&#160;independent samples as
described by Fleiss (1981) was used to test for investigator effect on
proportions of "excellent" or "good" responses (satisfactory) vs "fair" or
"poor" responses (unsatisfactory).  No significant investigator effects
(p&gt;0.05) were detected by this analysis.<P>
Three factor ANOVA, investigator and drug as between-subject factors and time
as a within-subject factor, of both subjective and objective variables was
performed using the CLR ANOVA for the Apple&#174; Macintosh(TM). For this
analysis subjective parameters lameness and pain scores were expressed change
relative to pretreatment, designated dLAME and dPAIN
respectively.  For objective parameters circumference (CIRC) and heat (HEAT),
ANOVA was conducted on (a) the values relative to contralateral value,
designated d , (b) the change relative to pretreatment of the values relative
to contralateral value, designated dd, (c) the absolute measurements of the
lesion side, designated L, and (d) the change relative to pretreatment of the
absolute value on the lesion side, designated dL.<P>
No difference in response (p&gt;0.05) between the two drugs was detected with
regard to subjective parameters.  For objective parameters it appeared that the
variable circumference was less influenced by investigator than heat.  For the
measurement of circumference, CIRC, the result was the same whether the
measurement was compared with the contralateral site or not.  For measurement
of temperature of the lesion, however, a difference in interpretation did arise
depending on the whether the change only on the lesion side (dLHEAT) was
considered or whether the changes relative to contralateral (dHEAT and ddHEAT)
were considered.  No drug effect was seen for the variable dLHEAT.  Since the
results of dLHEAT are consistent with all of the other variables measured and
since dLHEAT measures the lesion directly, it would seem that in this
circumstance the use of the contralateral site did not serve as an appropriate
control.<P>

<P>
Since two of the parameters, lameness and pain on manipulation, were clinical
scores rather than actual measurements, the significance of any differences
between treatments was tested by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.  No
significant differences between treatment groups were detected for either of
the parameters at any of the post treatment times (p&gt;0.05).<P>
Finally, the significance of any difference between treatment groups with
regard to the overall clinical evaluation of excellent, good, fair or poor was
tested by contingency table analysis.  No significant differences between
ketoprofen and flunixin in overall clinical response were detected
(p&gt;0.05).<P>
No adverse reactions were encountered in the study in either treatment
group.<P>
<b>Conclusions</b><P>
The results of this study confirm that ketoprofen given at dosage of 1.0 mg/lb
is effective intravenously as an antiinflammatory agent, has an acceptable side
effect profile, and is equivalent in effectiveness and clinical safety to the
positive control drug flunixin when tested under conditions of veterinary
practice.<P>

The purpose of this study was to compare the antiinflammatory effects of
ketoprofen given intravenously and intramuscularly at a dosage of 1.0 mg/lb
with the effects of flunixin given by the same routes at its approved dosage of
0.5 mg/lb, under conditions of veterinary practice.<P>
Test animals included 115 horses presented to the veterinarian during the
course of his routine practice for diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory
conditions of the musculoskeletal system.<P>
Each investigator was provided with a computer generated randomized drug/route
assignment list which resulted in the horses being randomly divided into four
treatment groups. Case reports for 22 animals were removed from final
evaluation because they did not meet protocol criteria.  The remaining 93 case
reports were from animals treated as follows:<pre>
     Ketoprofen (1 mg/lb) by intravenous route      26 horses
     Ketoprofen (1 mg/lb) by intramuscular route    22 horses
     Flunixin (0.5 mg/lb) by intravenous route      21 horses
     Flunixin (0.5 mg/lb) by intramuscular route    24 horses
</pre>
Diagnoses, based on physical examination and x-rays if indicated, in descending
order of frequency included (1) minor fractures and bone chips, (2) joint
inflammation and carpitis, (3) injury inflammation, (4) post operative
inflammation, (5) soft tissue inflammation, myositis, and cellulitis, and (6)
laminitis.<P>
Positive controls were given flunixin at its approved dosage of 0.5 mg/lb
intravenously or intramuscularly.<P>
Dosage forms, dosages, and duration were ketoprofen injectable solution
containing 100 mg ketoprofen  per ml, identical to the formulation to be
marketed, and flunixin 50 mg/ml, obtained from commercial sources. Ketoprofen
was given at a dosage of 1.0 mg/lb intravenously or intramuscularly and
flunixin was given at its approved dosage of 0.5 mg/lb intravenously or
intramuscularly.  Both drugs were given daily for five days.<P>
Pertinent parameters measured daily before each of the five treatments and 24
hours after the last treatment were the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Clinical lameness score (0-3, where 0=normal, 3=severe)
<li>Pain on palpation or compression (present or absent)
<li>Pain on flexion, extension, or rotation (present or absent)
<li>Swelling (0-3, where 0=normal, 3=severe)
<li>Heat (present or absent)
<li>Reaction after each injection (present or absent)
<li>Overall efficacy evaluation (excellent, good, fair, or poor)
<li>Side effects (yes or no, if yes specify)</ul><br>
Results of the study indicated that ketoprofen was equivalent in effectiveness
to the approved reference control drug flunixin by both routes of
administration.  Case reports from 93 of the horses were considered complete
and acceptable for evaluation.  Among these 93 horses the diagnoses were as
follows:  minor fractures and bone chips (29 cases), joint inflammation and
carpitis (24 cases), injury inflammation (18 cases), post operative
inflammation (10 cases), soft tissue inflammation, myositis, and cellulitis (9
cases), and laminitis (3 cases).  The results illustrating parallel responses
are presented in the following figures.<P>

No post injection reactions were observed other than swelling apparently due to
injection of part of the dosage outside the vein on two occasions in the
ketoprofen IV group.<P>
Statistical analysis were conducted on the data by analysis of covariance with
age, sex, duration, chip, nerve, therapy, and surgery as covariates, and also
by analysis of variance.  With each analysis the following contrasts were
tested for significance:  (1) ketoprofen IM vs IV, (2) flunixin IM vs IV, (3)
ketoprofen vs flunixin averaged over routes of administration, (4) ketoprofen
IV vs flunixin IV, and (5) ketoprofen IV vs all flunixin.  These analyses were
performed on the means after adjustment for any differences that may exist in
the covariates between treatment groups.  Additionally, the same analyses were
performed on average values over time, the difference between pretreatment and
post treatment (day 5) values, and for the linear slope over time.<P>
Fewer significant differences between ketoprofen and the positive control
flunixin at the 0.10 level of significance were detected than would be expected
by chance alone.  For ketoprofen, between IM and IV administration, only 15 of
112 tests were significant, about the number expected by chance.  However, of
the 15 significant differences, 13 favored the IM route of administration such
that any differences, although small, would seem to favor the IM route of
administration.<P>
Conclusions based on results of the study were that ketoprofen given at a
dosage of 1.0 mg/lb is as effective as the positive control drug flunixin and
is clinically effective whether administered intramuscularly or
intravenously.<P>

The purpose of these studies was to determine serum levels of the ketoprofen
following administration by the intravenous and intramuscular route.  The
dosage selected for the intravenous and intramuscular route was 1 mg/lb
ketoprofen, which is the dose determined by the dose titration studies as the
effective dose and was the dosage used in the clinical efficacy studies.<P>
There were a total of eight (8) mature horses utilized in these studies.
Weight of the animals ranged from 590 to 930 pounds.  All horses used in the
studies were maintained at the Fort Dodge Laboratories facilities.  They were
housed in outdoor facilities and received care and maintenance consistent with
good laboratory management practices.  The studies consisted of two sets of
four (4) horses each.  The first set of four (4) horses were randomly assigned
to receive the ketoprofen twice by the same parenteral route of administration
with a 16-day interval between treatments.  Blood samples were collected at 0,
5, 15, and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post injection.  Serum was
separated from the samples and transported to the analytical laboratory for
analysis by a validated HPLC assay method.<P>
The second set of four (4) horses were handled as a separate trial.  These four
(4) horses were randomly assigned to treatment by either the intravenous
administration or the intramuscular administration of ketoprofen at the dosage
of 1.0 mg/lb.  After a three (3) day time period, all four (4) animals were
again  treated by cross-over (the horses who received the intravenous treatment
for the first dosage were retreated by the intramuscular route and vise-versa.)
Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 20 and 40 minutes and at 1, 2,
4, 6, and 8 hours post treatment.  Serum was separated and analyzed by a
validated HPLC assay method.<P>
For all studies the individual animal had pretreatment blood samples collected
which served as a control for that animal.  No untreated control animals were
utilized during these blood level studies.<P>
During these trials there were no observed local or systemic adverse reactions
in any of the treated horses.<P>
Results of the blood level studies are illustrated graphically in the following
charts depicting all values from all eight (8) horses.  Since this was a
corroborative study with a limited number of horses involved, no statistical
analysis was performed.<P>

Conclusions based on results of these studies were that following IM or IV
administration ketoprofen reached measurable, albeit variable, serum
concentrations in the horse.<P>

The purpose of the study was to determine the safety of ketoprofen given at 0,
1x, 3x, and 5x the recommended dosage for 3x the recommended treatment period
in horses as the intended target species.<P>
Test animals included 24 horses of both sexes including geldings, of quarter
horse or thoroughbred type, ranging in age from 2 to 8 years, and in body
weight from 705 to 930 pounds.  The horses were randomly divided into four
groups, six horses per group.  The study was blinded in that neither the
veterinarian making the observations, nor the laboratory performing the tests,
had prior knowledge of the dosage administered.<P>
Dosage form was ketoprofen injectable solution containing 100 mg ketoprofen per
ml, identical to the formulation to be marketed.<P>
Dosages, routes of administration, and duration were 0 (placebo), 1.0, 3.0, or
5.0 mg/lb body weight given intravenously daily for 15 consecutive days.<P>
Parameters measured before treatment, on days 5, 10, and 15 during treatment,
and 7 days after treatment included a battery of blood chemistry tests, fecal
analysis for occult blood, urinalysis, and hematology (Listed in Table 1 and
Table 2).  Additionally, BSP liver function tests were performed before
treatment and on the last day of treatment and two animals from each dosage
group were euthanized and necropsied one week after treatment.<P>

Results were that all animals remained healthy throughout the study and no
reactions were observed clinically.  Blood chemistry, urinalysis, and
hematology determinations likewise failed to indicate consistent deviation from
normal values.  Occult blood was detected in feces on only two occasions, in a
horse of the placebo group and in a horse of the 1 mg/lb group, both on day 10.
BSP half lives did not change appreciably during the study period in any of the
dosage groups.<P>
At necropsy, gross lesions that were observed were randomly distributed among
all dosage groups including placebo.  These included excess peritoneal fluid (6
cases), ulcers at the margo plicatus in the stomach (5 cases) and pylorus (6
cases), slightly swollen kidney (2 cases), nodules in lung (3 cases), and
internal parasites (2 cases).<P>
Since it is well known that gastrointestinal ulceration is a potential toxic
effect of any nonsteriodal antiinflammatory agent, an independent pathologist
(Dr. James R. Rooney, University of Kentucky) was consulted to review the
histopathology slides of the ulcers noted above and to submit an opinion as to
whether or not they represented a treatment effect.  Dr. Rooney's opinion
corroborated the findings of Dr. Beasley, namely that the ulcer lesions
encountered were coincidental, not uncommon in horses as a result of bots
(stomach worms) for example, and not related to ketoprofen treatment at any
dosage.<P>
Statistical analysis of the numerical data was conducted by analysis of
variance at the 0.05 level of significance according to the following

In addition to the overall analysis, a separate analysis was conducted for each
of the four treatment days.  This amounted to a simple one-way analysis of
variance with dose groups as the defining factor.  Duncan's multiple range
analysis followed any significant differences indicated by the various analyses
of variance.  No significant (p&lt;0.05) relevant dose related effects were
detected.<P>
Conclusions of the study were that no evidence of any toxic effects of
ketoprofen dosage in horses was encountered, even when the drug was given at up
to five fold multiples of the recommended dosage for three times longer than
that recommended by the proposed labeling.  It was thus demonstrated that an
ample margin of safety is associated with ketoprofen when used as directed in
horses.<P>

The purpose of the study was to further characterize the margin of safety of
ketoprofen by assessing the response in horses to toxic doses of the drug.<P>
Test animals included 4 horses of both sexes, of quarter horse type, ranging in
age from 2 to 5 years, and in body weight from 800 to 945 pounds.  The horses
were randomly divided into two groups, two horses per group.  The study was
blinded in that neither the veterinarian making the observations, one the
laboratory performing the tests, had prior knowledge of the dosage
administered.<P>
Dosage form was ketoprofen injectable solution containing 100 mg ketoprofen per
ml, identical to the formulation to be marketed.<P>
Dosages, routes of administration, and duration were 15 to 25 mg/lb (15 and 25
times the recommended dosage, two horses per dosage) intravenously daily for
five consecutive days.<P>
Parameters measured before treatment and 24 hours after each of the five
treatments included physical examination for signs of toxicity, a battery of
blood chemistry tests, fecal analysis for occult blood, urinalysis, and
hematology (Listed in Table 1 and 2).  The animals were euthanized and
necropsied after treatment.<P>

</PRE>
Results indicate that horse A, one of the animals receiving the 15 mg/lb
dosage, developed severe laminitis between days 4 and 5.  No other drug related
lesions, abnormal laboratory results, or gross and histologic post mortem
changes were noted in the 15 mg/lb group.  In the 25 mg/lb group, horse C
showed severe toxic signs characterized by depression, inappetence, icterus and
abdominal swelling by day 3 and was euthanatized in moribund condition for
necropsy on day 5.  These findings were consistent with the clinical blood
chemistry results.  The table above shows that horse C, receiving the 25x
overdose (25 mg/lb), had increased AP, LDH, SGOT, SGPT and GGT over the
pre-treatment values and was positive for fecal occult blood on one sampling
day.  Horse D, that received the 25 mg/lb dose, showed some depression and
inappetence by the end of the dosage period but did not show any meaningful
changes in the blood chemistry values.  In three(3) of these blood chemistry
parameters, we observed that some pre-treatment values were outside of normal
value limits (higher than normal for AP, SGOT and BUN).  In all animals used,
the Study Director clinically determined the horses to be healthy, normal
animals meeting study protocol criteria and acceptable for use in this trial.
Although the BUN readings for horses A and B (15 mg/lb dosage) were slightly
elevated at day 4 and 5, no elevation was noted in the group receiving the 25
mg/lb dosage at day 4 and 5.  Therefore these findings were not considered  to
be drug related.<P>
The hematology results showed minor changes in the horses receiving 25 mg/lb
dose.  Horse C showed elevated hemoglobin, hematocrit and lymphocyte values.
The urinalysis of horse C showed the appearance of protein and blood.<P>
The gross and histopathologic report revealed toxic manifestations only in one
horse of the 25x group that exhibited severe toxic signs.  This was
characterized as toxic hepatitis, toxic nephritis, and adrenal necrosis and
hemorrhage.  No evidence of lesions attributed to treatment with ketoprofen was
demonstrated in the two horses receiving the 15x dosage or the other horse of
the 25x dosage group.  Due to the limited number of horses (2 at each dosage
level), no statistical analysis was performed.<P>
Conclusions based on the results of the study revealed that at 15 fold overdose
(15 mg/lb/day) for 5 days, one of two horses developed severe laminitis but no
gross lesions or histologic changes were observed.  The toxic effects observed
in the horses given the 25 fold overdosage included inappetence, depression,
icterus, abdominal swelling and post-mortem findings of toxic nephritis,
hepatitis, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenals.<P>
<P>
<b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><P>
Data on human food safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved only for use
in horses that are not to be used for food and is to be labeled:  <b>Warning:
not for use in horses intended for food.</b><br>
<br>
Human safety relative to possession, handling, and administration:  no special
caution statement needed.<P>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
The data submitted in support  of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  It
demonstrates that Ketofen (ketoprofen), when used under its labeled conditions
of use, is safe and effective.<P>
For the safe and effective use of Ketofen (ketoprofen), it is necessary to
provide a differential diagnosis of the pathology causing the clinical
condition which only a trained professional can accomplish.  Accordingly, we
have classified Ketofen (ketoprofen) as a prescription product.<P>

<b>Established Name: </b> Tylosin<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>       TYLAN&#174; <p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> OTC <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>     June 29, 1994 <p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b> <p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and monensin.
Previous approvals have required a 48 hour pre-slaughter drug withdrawal for
heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with either tylosin or
monensin and tylosin. <p>
<b>II.  Indications for Use</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for the combined
administration of melengestrol acetate and tylosin either with or without
monensin which are: <p>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter. <p>
<b>III. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b> <p>
<b>Dosage Form:  </b>                            Feed <p>
<b>Route of Administration: </b>                  Oral <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>   Melengestrol acetate:  0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
Monensin (as monensin sodium):  50 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton air
dried complete feed)<br>   Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate):  90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
    complete feed) <p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 90 mg tylosin per head per day with or without 50
to 360 mg monensin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement for
slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate of
0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head. <p>
<b>IV. Effectiveness</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the indications for these combinations. <p>
<b>V. Animal Safety </b><p>
This supplement does not affect target animal safety of these combinations. <p>
<b>VI. Human Safety </b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b> <p>
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period. <p>
A tolerance of 0.05 ppm has been established for negligible residues of
monensin in the edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.420). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed monensin (21 CFR 558.355). <p>
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625). <p>
<b>2.  Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin.</b> <p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of
the supplemental application for MGA (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402) and that the
concentration of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances, when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, tylosin and monensin in combination, each
at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
withdrawal. This study is summarized below. <p>
Groups of heifers were individually fed for 90 days either no additive
(control, n=14) or melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin in combination at
1X (n=7), 3X (n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive
(1X = 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate, 30 g monensin/ton air dried feed and 10 g
tylosin/ton air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero
withdrawal. <p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the method described in JAOAC
59:507-515:1976. This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from heifers in the control and 1X treatment group had concentration of
melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat samples from heifers in the 3X and 5X dose groups were 29.2 ppb
(range 18.2 to 39.6 ppb) and 42.2 ppb (range 35.8 to 49 ppb), respectively. <p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of monensin and tylosin
residues. No residues of either monensin or tylosin were detected in any of the
liver samples from these heifers. The limit of detection for these analyses
were 0.04 and 0.1 ppm for monensin and tylosin, respectively. <p>
<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
These data demonstrate that when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin and
monensin in combination the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is
below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and the concentration
of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances. <p>
<b>3. Assay noninterference </b><p>
Data, previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrated <p>
1)  the presence of monensin and tylosin does not interfere with the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<p>
2)  presence of monensin and melengestrol acetate does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for tylosin; and<p>
3)  presence of melengestrol acetate and tylosin does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for monensin <p>
<b>4. Regulatory methods</b> <p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, monensin and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, 
Room 12A30). <p>
<b>5. Conclusions</b> <p>
This supplement provides for the deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
pre-slaughter withdrawal period for melengestrol acetate when fed in combination
with tylosin and either with or without monensin. No changes are made in either
the approved dosages of any of these additives, the approved indications of use
or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the conclusion
that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is below the established
tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of melengestrol acetate
and tylosin either with or without monensin. Accordingly this change in
regulations for melengestrol acetate is not expected to have adverse effects on
public health or food safety. <p>
<b>VII.   Agency Conclusions </b><p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and
monensin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity data for MGA
contained in NADA's  34-254 and  39-402. <p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations. 
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

Kalamazoo, MI 49001<p>
<b>Generic Name:</b> ceftiofur sodium<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b> NAXCELR&#174; Sterile Powder<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b><p>
This is a prescription legend product and includes the Caution Statement as
follows: 
Federal (U.S.A.) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian.<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
Provides for the use of ceftiofur sodium (NAXCEL Sterile Powder) in lactating
dairy cattle, 
a new class of animal, for the same indications approved in the parent NADA.<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>March 15, 1991<p>
<b>II. Indications for Use</b><p>
NAXCEL Sterile Powder is indicated for treatment of bovine respiratory disease
(shipping fever, pneumonia) in beef and dairy cattle. This product may be used in
lactating dairy cattle.<p>

<b>III. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b><p>
NAXCEL Sterile Powder is available in two package sizes: 1 gram and 4 gram
vials.<p>
Reconstituted product should be used within 12 hours if stored at controlled
room 
temperature 15&#176; - 30&#176; C (59&#176; - 86&#176; F) or within 7 days if stored in a
refrigerator.<p>
<b>1 gram vial</b> <p> Reconstitute with 20 mL Sterile Water for Injection or with
Bacteriostatic 
Water for Infection. Each mL of the resulting solution contains ceftiofur
sodium equivalent to 50 mg ceftiofur.<p>
<b>4 gram vial</b> <P> Reconstitute with 80 mL Sterile Water for Injection or with
Bacteriostatic 
Water for Injection. Each mL of the resulting solution contains ceftiofur
sodium equivalent

to 50 mg ceftiofur.<p>
NAXCEL Sterile Solution should be administered by intramuscular injection to
cattle at the dosage range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg ceftiofur per pound of body weight (1 to 2 mL
reconstituted sterile solution per 100 lb body weight). Treatment should be repeated 
every 24 hours for a total of three treatments. Additional treatments may be given 
on days four and
five for animals which do not show a satisfactory response (not recovered) after the first
three treatments.<p>

<b>IV. Effectiveness</b><p>
Effectiveness of NAXCEL Sterile Powder for the treatment of BRD is addressed in
the FOI summary dated January 25, 1988, and made available when the NADA was codified
on February 24, 1988 (53 FR 5369/70).<p>
<b>V. Animal Safety</b><p>
Target animal safety is addressed in the FOI summary dated January 25, 1988.<p>

<b>VI. Human Food Safety</b><p>
<b>A. Toxicity Tests</b><p>
Toxicity studies are addressed in the FOI summary dated January 25, 1988.<p>
These include mutagenicity, oral feeding and hypersensitivity potential
studies.<p>
The lowest no-observed-effect-level from the oral feeding studies was 30 mg
ceftiofur per kg body weight.<p>
<b>B. Safe Concentrations of Total Residues</b><p>
Previous determinations have resulted in safe concentrations for total residues
of ceftiofur in tissues to be:<p>
muscle - 3 ppm<br>
kidney - 9 ppm<br>
liver - 6 ppm<br>
fat - 12 ppm<p>
The calculated safe concentration for total residues of ceftiofur in milk is 1
ppm (one third  that of muscle).<p>
<b>C. Total Residue and Metabolism Studies</b><p>
Two 14-C-labeled ceftiofur studies were completed in lactating dairy cattle to
1) determine time to peak concentration of total residues in milk following intramuscular
administration of ceftiofur, and 2) determine total residue depletions in milk 
following last treatment.<p>
In contrast to intramammary treatment, where there is a regular (approximately
12 hour) interval between time of treatment and next milking, intramuscular
administration of drug can occur at any time prior to normal milking, therefore, 
it is relevant to determine time to peak concentration of total residues in milk 
following IM administration. In the initial study,
therefore, one cow (616 kg) in its second lactation received five intramuscular
injections of 0.5 mg/lb of 14-C-ceftiofur at 3, 6, 9, or 12 hours prior to the 
first normal milking. Total residues of ceftiofur were higher (0.045 ppm) at 
12 hours after treatment than at any other
time interval post treatment. The data from this study provided in tabular form
showed that
12 hour intervals post treatment are the critical time periods for the purposes
of the residue depletion study.<p>

</pre>

A residue depletion study was then conducted to 1) ascertain total residues of
ceftiofur in 
milk at 12 hour intervals following the last of five daily IM injections and to
characterize the 
residues present in the milk.<ul><p>
<li>Animals used: 6 lactating dairy cows (Holstein)<p>
<li>Route of Administration and Dosage: Drug was administered via intramuscular
injection 
at 1.0 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg) body weight once daily for five consecutive days at 24
hour 
intervals.<p>
<li>Sample Times: Milk was assayed at 12 hour intervals following each treatment
and

through 120 hours after last treatment. Animals were sacrificed at 120 hours
after last

treatment.<p>
Total residues were highest (0.115 ppm) at 12 hours after the fifth daily
treatment. This

peak (0.115 ppm) is approximately one-tenth the calculated Safe Concentration
(1 ppm)

for total residues of ceftiofur in milk. Approximately one third of the total
residues occur in

the non bound (free) form of which about one fourth is microbiologically active
(or, about

1/12 of the total residues present in milk is microbiologically active).
Microbiologically

based analytical screening procedures measure only the microbiologically active
residues

in milk.<p>
Each of the three screening tests used to monitor milk from these treated
animals

measures microbiological activity and each showed negative findings (no
detectable

residues) for each of the six animals at each of the 18 milkings. These data
are provided

in Tabular form. Characterization of the residues present in milk is addressed
in Section VI

<b>D. Comparative Metabolism Study Results</b><p>
In a drug accountability study milk was found to contain less than 0.15 percent
of the total dose. Over the same time interval, 120 h, urine and feces accounted for 62.8
and 35.7 percents of the dose, respectively.<p>
Approximately 65 percent of the total residues of milk were bound to
macromolecules as a single metabolite (desfuroylceftiofur). This compares with 75 percent of the
total residues in kidney which were bound to macromolecules, also as the same metabolite. The
free metabolites consisted of polar and non-polar compounds of which one
(desfuroylceftiofur-cysteine disulfide or DCD) was the single most prevalent metabolite. 
When total residues were highest in milk (0.115 ppm at 12 h after last daily dosage), the
concentration of this metabolite was also at its highest value of 0.01 ppm.<p>
The predominant free metabolite (DCD) in milk has the same HPLC column
retention time as a metabolite previously tested in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis study in
guinea pigs to evaluate the hypersensitivity potential of ceftiofur sodium. The
concentration of this metabolite in kidney tissue is much higher (&#126;1.3 ppm) than it 
is in milk (0.01 ppm).<p>
In summary, milk contains no metabolites not heretofore observed in edible
tissues of bovine and satisfactorily tested for human safety.<p>
Other comparative metabolism data addressing the IM use of ceftiofur sodium in
the bovine are included in the FOI summary dated January 25, 1988.<p>

<b>E. Tolerance for the Market Residue</b><p>
Total residues at 12 h post last, or any, treatment are substantially lower
than the corresponding calculated safe concentration for milk, therefore neither a
marker compound nor a tolerance for a marker compound is required.<p>
See FOI summary dated January 25, 1988 for information pertaining to edible
tissues other than milk.<p>

<b>F. Study Establishing Withdrawal Period</b><p>
No milk discard time is required because observed total residues of ceftiofur
are well below the calculated safe concentrations at all time intervals post dosing
through 120 hours after last treatment.<p>

<b>G. Regulatory Method</b><p>
A regulatory method is not required.<p>

<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
Supplemental Application, Naxcel&#174; sterile powder<p>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Naxcel is safe and effective when
used according to label directions for its proposed use.<p>
This supplemental application provides for the use of ceftiofur sodium (Naxcel&#174;
sterile powder) in lactating cattle, a new class of animal in addition to the
previously approved use in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle. The firm submitted new residue data
for milk in support of this application.<p>
Under the Agency's policy for supplemental approvals, 55 FR 46052, November 1,
1990, this a category II supplement. It required reevaluation of data in the parent
application because its approval would increase exposure to residues. The toxicology and
metabolism data in the original application meet current standards and additional
comparative metabolism work has been done demonstrating that residues in milk have been
adequately tested. Because the residues of this product in milk are one tenth of the
established safe concentration of 1 ppm at 12 hours post administration, a method to monitor
residue levels and a milk withholding time are therefore not required for the safe use of
ceftiofur sodium in lactating dairy cattle.<p>
Adequate data pertaining to hypersensitivity issues that are often raised with
beta-lactam antibiotics are discussed in the FOI Summary dated January 25, 1988.<p>
This supplemental application does not qualify for a period of exclusivity
because investigations supporting approval do not qualify as new clinical or field
trials for target animal safety and/or effectiveness.<p>

<b>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><p>

	For increased rate of weight gain in pasture steers (slaughter, stocker and
feeder steers).<p>

<b>3. DOSAGE FORM(S), ROUTE(S) OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</b><p>

The dosage form is implantation.  The route of administration is subcutaneous
implantation on the posterior aspect of the middle one-third of the ear by
means of an implant gun.  The recommended dosage is one implant containing 40
mg trenbolone acetate and 8 mg estradiol.  Each implant is made up of two
pellets with each pellet containing 20 mg trenbolone acetate and 4 mg
estradiol.  Each implant is contained in one division of a multiple dose
cartridge.  There are ten doses in each cartridge.  The cartridge is designed
to be used with a special implant gun which places the implant under the skin
on the posterior aspect of the ear.<p>

<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>

The supplemental new animal drug application for REVALOR-G contains data
from adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of
the new animal drug for the indications for use and dosage as given in Sections
2 and 3 above.<p>

Pivotal Studies:<p>
	
The pivotal studies are dose titration studies in which the parameters measured
are the same parameters as are measured in field investigations.  Four dose
titration studies were conducted in Idaho, Virginia, Nebraska, and Wyoming
using a uniform protocol so that the results of the studies could be pooled and
summarized.  The studies were conducted in the major beef producing areas of
the United States.<p>

The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the dose response for trenbolone
acetate (TBA) and estradiol (E2beta) on average daily gain of steers maintained on
pasture.  The test animals were straight-bred and cross-bred animals of English
and European breeds.  For each study, 300 steers were blocked by weight (six
steers/block) and randomly assigned within block to one of six treatments (50
replicates/treatment).  The treatments consisted of Control (no implant), 10 mg
E2beta, 40 mg TBA, 2 mg E2beta/10 mg TBA, 4 mg E2beta/20 mg TBA, and 8 mg E2beta/40 mg TBA.
The steers average weights for each study were between 530 lbs. and 617 lbs.
when the studies were initiated.  The duration of the studies ranged between
107 and 116 days.<p>

Each steer was administered TBA and E2beta via subcutaneous implantation on the
backside of the mid-ear.  The steers were administered the implant once at the
initiation of each study.  After the cattle were implanted they were maintained
together in the same pasture for the duration of the study.<p>
Average daily gain (ADG) data for the steers are summarized in Table 1 for each
of the four dose titration studies.<p>

A randomized complete block design was used for all four studies and the data
were pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect
of TBA/E2beta implants on ADG.  There were significant (P &lt; .05) linear and
quadratic components in the response of average daily gain to increasing levels
of the combination product with an optimal dose near 8 mg E2beta /40 mg TBA.  The 8
mg E2beta /40 mg TBA treatment also was shown to be significantly (P &lt; .05)
better than 40 mg TBA alone and 10 mg E2beta alone.  These data are sufficient to
support the claims and dosage as provided in Sections 2 and 3.<p>

<b>5. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>

	The supplemental new animal drug application for REVALOR-G references the
target animal safety studies summarized in the FOI for NADA 140-992 (60 FR 4376
- January 23, 1995).  The data from those studies demonstrate the safety of the
new animal drug for the indications for use and dosage as given in Sections 2
and 3 above.<p>

<b>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>

A.	Toxicity Tests and Safe Concentration<p>
	
	The toxicity studies summarized in the FOI from NADA 138-612 (52 FR 24994 -
July 2, 1987) establish the safe concentration for TBA.  The safe concentration
for total residues is 50 ppb for muscle, 100 ppb for liver, 150 ppb for kidney,
and 200 ppb for fat.  Residues for estradiol and related esters may not exceed
the following increments above the concentrations of estradiol naturally
present in the untreated animals; in the uncooked edible tissues of heifers,
steers, and calves, 120 parts per trillion (ppt) for muscle, 480 ppt in fat,
360 ppt for kidney, and 240 ppt for liver (21 CFR 556.240).<p>
	
B.	Residue Depletion Study<p>
	
	A tissue residue study was conducted to determine the residues of estradiol
and the two metabolites of TBA (17alpha-hydroxytrenbolone (17alpha-TB) and
17beta-hydroxytrenbolone (17beta-TB)).  This study was conducted by Dr. Don Henricks,
at Clemson University, Clemson, S.C.  Eight (8) steers were treated with 140 mg
trenbolone acetate and 28 mg estradiol.  An additional eight (8) steers were
treated with 200 mg TBA.  There were also four (4) control steers in the study.
In each treatment group, four steers were sacrificed 15 days after treatment
and the other four steers were sacrificed 30 days after the initial
implantation.  Muscle, fat, liver and kidney samples were collected from each
animal on each of the sacrifice dates.  After collection, the samples were
immediately frozen in dry ice and held frozen until they were assayed for
17alpha-TB, 17beta-TB, and estradiol residues.  The following two tables summarize the
results from this study.  As residue levels were similar at the 15 and 30 day
sampling, the results in the following two tables were averaged across both
sampling dates for the treated animals.  Estradiol residues were assayed in
only the control steers and steers treated with 140 mg TBA and 28 mg
estradiol.<p>

	In Table 2, the results from the estradiol tissue assays are summarized.  The
results of the estradiol assays from the treated and control animals are
compared with the acceptable safe incremental increases above naturally
occurring levels established in 21 CFR 556.240.  The estradiol
levels from the treated and control animals were many times lower than the
acceptable safe incremental levels.  Since the acceptable safe incremental
increases of estradiol exceed the estradiol levels found in treated steers by
such a wide margin, it was concluded that no pre-slaughter withdrawal period
and no withholding restrictions were necessary.  Thus there is no need for a
regulatory tissue assay method for estradiol.<p>

		The residues of 17alpha-TB and 17beta-TB are reported in Table 3.  When the residues
of the two trenbolone metabolites are compared between the two implant groups,
the residues from the implant containing 140 mg TBA/28 mg estradiol are
consistently lower than the residues from the steers implanted with only TBA
(200 mg).  Thus, implanting cattle with the combination product gave trenbolone
residues that were lower compared to the residues when TBA is implanted alone.
Additional information on the residues of TBA can be found in the Freedom of
Information Summary for NADA 138-612 (52 FR 24994-July 2, 1987).<p>

C.	Withdrawal Period<p>

	As discussed above, no withdrawal period is required following the use of TBA
and estradiol.<p>

D.	Regulatory Method<p>

	As discussed above, no withdrawal time is required.  Therefore it is not
necessary to have a regulatory assay method or a confirmatory assay method for
TBA or estradiol tissue residues.  The respective RIA procedures for TBA and
estradiol were checked for cross-reactivity with the anti-sera of the other and
it was concluded that no interference existed.<p>

<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

	Adequate data were provided to demonstrate the safe and effective use of
Revalor-G (ear implant containing 40 mg TBA and 8 mg estradiol) when used in
pasture steers (slaughter, stocker and feeder steers) for increased rate of
weight gain.<p>

	Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR
514.106(b)(2)), this is a Category II change providing for the use
of an ear implant containing 40 mg TBA and 8 mg estradiol in pasture
steers.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any adverse effect
on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.  Therefore, a
reevaluation of data in the parent application was not necessary.<p>

	Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for three years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the supplemental
application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  The three years of marketing
exclusivity applies only to the change for which the supplemental application
was approved, i.e., use of an ear implant containing 40 mg TBA and 8 mg
estradiol in pasture steers.<p>

<b>Generic Name of Drug:</b> Milbemycin Oxime Tablets<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b> INTERCEPTOR&#174;<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Rx,
For use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.<p>
<b>Date of Summary: </b> December 29, 1992<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
Approval of the supplemental NADA will change NADA No. 140-915 by adding
indications for the removal and control of adult <i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160;
(roundworm) and <i>Trichuris vulpis</i>&#160; (whipworm) infections in dogs over
eight weeks of age. Data supporting efficacy for the roundworm and whipworm
indications is contained in this supplemental NADA. The supplemental
application does not propose any changes in the formulation, dosage forms,
manufacturing procedures, recommended dosages or treatment regiment for
INTERCEPTOR (milbemycin oxime).<p>
<b>Indications for Use</b><p>
INTERCEPTOR tablets are indicated for use in the prevention of heartworm
disease caused by <i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>, the control of adult <i>Ancylostoma caninum</i>
(hookworm), and the removal and control of adult <i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160;
(roundworm) and <i>Trichuris vulpis</i>&#160; (whipworm) infections in dogs over
eight weeks of age.<p>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Adminstration, and Recommended Dosage</b><p>
The ingredients of INTERCEPTOR are formulated into various sized tablets to be
administered orally (swallow) as appropriate for the weight of the dog (see
below) at monthly dosing intervals. The tablets supply the recommended minimum
dose level of 0.5 mg milbemycin oxime per kilogram (0.23 mg/lb.) of body
weight.<p>

</pre>
  
Dogs over 100 lbs. are provided the appropriate combination of these
tablets.<p>
<b>4. Effectiveness</b><p>
The Supplemental New Animal Drug Application for milbemycin oxime tablets
contains adequate and well-controlled studies which demonstrate efficacy in
removing and controlling roundworm and whipworm infections in dogs.<p>
<b>A. Dose Establishment</b><p>
Controlled studies were undertaken to confirm the effectiveness of milbemycin
oxime tablets against adult intestinal stages of roundworm (<i>Toxocara
canis </i>) and whipworm (<i>Trichuris vulpis </i>). These additional claims are
added to the existing indications for heartworm prevention and hookworm
control. One confirmation study was completed for each parasite.<p>
At necropsy, the entire gastrointestinal tract was removed from each dog. The
contents of the tract were removed, sieved, and parasites were recovered and
identified. The opened tracts were examined carefully for remaining parasites
which were recovered and identified. Additionally, the small intestine was
incubated in saline for recovery of embedded parasites which also were counted
and identified.<p>
Percent efficacy was calculated using the formula:<p>
<pre>

Mean Number of Parasites         Mean Number of Parasites  
  in Control Animals       -       in Treated Animals     
-----------------------------------------------------------   X   100&#37; Efficacy   
              Mean Number of Parasites
                in Control Animals



</pre>
 
The studies are identified in Table 1 and the results are summarized in Table
2.<p>
These studies confirmed the effectiveness of milbemycin oxime tablets at a
minimum dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight for the removal and control of adult
roundworm and whipworm parasites.<p><ul>

<b>B. Well-Controlled Clinical Field Trial</b><p>
<b>Study No. MT-147-00-89</b><p>
A multi-location, well-controlled clinical field trial employing essentially
identical study protocols was conducted during 1989-90.<p>
The overall objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milbemycin
oxime for the removal and control of roundworms and whipworms when used under
typical veterinary practice conditions. The study employed six individual
veterinary hospitals or clinics in the following states: Alabama, California,
Florida, and Texas.<p>
The specific trial objectives were achieved by comparing the relative
effectiveness of milbemycin oxime formulated tablets, administered monthly, to
Filaribits Plus chewable tablets (Norden Laboratories) administered daily.<p>
Patients were selected for inclusion in the study from animals presented to the
hospital or clinic for routine immunizations, physical examinations, heartworm
examinations, etc. Dogs of various breeds, ages, weights and of either sex,
were entered into the study. Animals were evaluated for nematode infections by
standard fecal egg flotation procedures. When appropriate infections
(roundworm, whipworm) were discovered, animals were assigned to treatment group
A (milbemycin oxime) or treatment group X (Filaribits Plus, Norden
Laboratories) according to a computer-generated randomization table. Each
investigator was provided with his own unique randomization table. Fecal egg
flotation counts were scored on the case report form according to the following
format:<p>


<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>

Eggs Found              Score</b>

0 epg                        0

1-5 epg                    &#43; 1

6-20 epg                   &#43; 2

&gt; 20 epg                   &#43; 3


</pre>
 
Dogs also received the clinic's standard physical examination.<p>
Supplies of milbemycin oxime (treatment A) were supplied to the investigator by
the sponsor in three tablet sizes. Treatment was administered three times at
thirty day intervals. The practical dosing regimen was as follows:<p>


<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>
Body Weight     Milbemycin oxime</b>

0-10 lbs.           1 Brown tablet

11-25 lbs.          1 Green tablet

26-50 lbs.          1 Yellow tablet

51-100 lbs.         2 Yellow tablets

&gt; 100 lbs.       Appropriate tablet mix


</pre>
The reference drug, Filaribits Plus&#174; chewable tablets (Norden Laboratories),
was provided by each investigator and administered according to label
directions.<p>
Test subjects receiving either treatment A or treatment X were returned to the
clinic for follow-up examinations according to the following schedule:<p><ul>
<li>At 7-10 days following the initial treatment, a fecal sample was returned for
evaluation of adult worm removal by each treatment, TA and TX.<p>
<li>Thirty days after initial treatment, each TA dog returned to the clinic for
fecal examination and the second TA treatment. TX dogs received daily
treatments, and also returned on day 30 for follow-up fecal examination.<p>
<li>If the fecal examination at day 30 for a TA dog was positive, another fecal
examination was required on day 37-40. For TX dogs, this fecal was not
required.<p>
<li>Sixty days after initial treatment, each TA dog returned to the clinic for
fecal examination and the final TA treatment. TX dogs received their final
fecal and physical examination on day 60.<p>
<li>If the day 60 fecal examination was negative for TA dogs, they received a
final physical examination on day 60. If the day 60 fecal was positive, the TA
dog returned at day 67-70 for final fecal and physical examinations.</ul><p>
<b>Results:</b><p>
A total of 231 patients were enrolled in the field trial, 115 in treatment
group A (milbemycin oxime) and 116 in treatment group X (Filaribits Plus,
Norden Laboratories). Of the 231 patients initially enrolled, 220 (95.28&#37;)
successfully completed the study regime. Approximately 77 (33.3&#37;) of the study
patients were puppies (6 months or less) and 16 (6.92&#37;) were 10 years old or
greater. The study population breakdown by weight was as follows:<p>

0-10 lbs. - 23.5&#37;<br>
11-25 lbs. - 24.3&#37;<br>
26-50 lbs. - 18.3&#37;<br>
&gt; 50 lbs. - 33.9&#37;<br>


</pre>
 
Thirty-four different breeds of dogs were represented as well as a large
selection of mixed breeds. See Table 3.<p>
The 220 patients successfully completing the study regime generated 329 cases
of roundworm and whipworm infections. Many patients had dual infections.
Treatment group A (milbemycin oxime) results were as follows: 84 cases of
roundworm successfully cured, 98.8&#37;, 7 days after the initial treatment, 100&#37;
by study completion (60 days); 85 cases of whipworm successfully cured 96.5&#37;, 7
days after the initial treatment, 100&#37; by study completion (60 days). See Table
4. INTERCEPTOR&#174; was used safely in animals receiving frequently used veterinary
products such as vaccines, anthelmintics, antibiotics, steroids, flea collars,
shampoos, and dips.<p>
Treatment group X (Filaribits Plus) results were as follows: 90 cases of
roundworm successfully cured 76.7&#37; after 7 days of treatment, 95.6&#37; by study
conclusion after 60 days of treatment, 70 cases of whipworm clinically
controlled, 62.9&#37; after 7 days of treatment, 82.9&#37; by study conclusion, after
60 days of treatment. See Table 4.<p>
<b>C. Non-Pivotal Field Trials Conducted in Canada</b><p>
Three trials were conducted in Canada during 1988-89 which evaluated and
corroborated the efficacy of milbemycin oxime for the treatment of intestinal
nematodes in dogs. Dogs diagnosed with intestinal nematode infections were
treated with a single dose of milbemycin oxime at &gt; 0.5 mg/kg body weight.
The identical four tablet formulations used in U.S. trials were administered to
dogs in these trials. All dogs were reexamined by fecal flotation 7-10 days
following treatment.<ul><p>

re-examined during the trials. Fecal egg counts from these dogs were reduced by
more than 96&#37; for <i>T. canis </i>, 98&#37; for <i>A. caninum</i>&#160; and 99&#37; for T.
vulpis following treatment with milbemycin oxime.</ul></uL><p>
 <b>Conclusion - Effectiveness</b><p>
Based upon data generated in laboratory studies and clinical field trials, it
can be concluded that milbemycin oxime tablets, at the labeled rate of 0.5
mg/kg, are safe and effective for the removal and control of adult roundworm
(<i>T. canis </i>) and whipworm (<i>T. vulpis </i>) parasites in dogs.<p>
<b>5. Animal Safety</b><p>
No adverse side effects were attributed to milbemycin oxime during the well
controlled clinical field trial.<p>
This supplemental NADA does not require re-evaluation of target animal safety
data submitted in support of the initial NADA No. 140-915. Please refer to the
original Freedom of Information Summary (NADA 140-915) for additional
information on target animal safety studies.<p>
<b>6. Human Safety</b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is to be labeled for use in
dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b><p>
The data in support of this supplemental NADA complies with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. It
demonstrates that INTERCEPTOR&#174; (milbemycin oxime) tablets when used under the
labeled conditions of use is safe and effective.<p>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 6436) this is a
Category II change. This supplement provides for the addition of claims to
include the removal and control of roundworms (<i>Toxocara canis </i>) and
whipworms (<i>Trichuris vulpis </i>). The approval of the supplemental
application has no adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the new
animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the
safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>
For this supplement, the drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian because professional expertise and proper diagnosis are
required to determine the existence of roundworm and/or whipworm infection. In
addition, professional expertise is required to determine the existence of
heartworm and/or hookworm infection, and to then properly treat existing
heartworm infection prior to starting treatment with INTERCEPTOR&#174; (milbemycin
oxime) Tablets in a prevention program, and for the control of hookworm
infection (original approval).<p>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this supplemental new animal drug application
qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity because new clinical or
field investigations conducted by the sponsor were essential to the approval of
this supplemental NADA.<p>

1  Number of dogs is fewer than total number of infections 
   because some dogs had multiple infections; 
   i.e.; 133 A treatment dogs, 193 A treatment parasite cases.     
   
2  "Cured" means no eggs or proglottids found at final fecal examination.     

3  Clinical control was achieved in all cases but low number of eggs 
   were found at final fecal examination for 12 dogs. This is a 
   hyperendemic whipworm area.

    <b>Date of Summary:  </b> December 11, 1995<p> 
<b>II.  INDICATIONS FOR USE :  </b><p> 
        <b>Pre-Starter and Starter Feeds:</b><p>  Administer to swine in a 
        complete feed for
reduction of the incidence of cervical abscesses; treatment of bacterial
enteritis (salmonellosis or necrotic enteritis caused by <i>Salmonella
choleraesuis</i>&#160;  and vibrionic dysentery); maintenance of weight gains in the
presence of atrophic rhinitis; increased rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency from 10 pounds body weight up to 6 weeks post-weaning.  For swine
raised in confinement (drylot) or on limited pasture.<p> 
        <b>Grower and Finisher Feeds:</b><p>  Administer to swine in a complete feed for
reduction of the incidence of cervical abscesses; treatment of bacterial
enteritis (salmonellosis or necrotic enteritis caused by <i>Salmonella
choleraesuis</i>&#160;  and vibrionic dysentery); maintenance of weight gains in the
presence of atrophic rhinitis; increased rate of weight gain from 6 to 16 weeks
post-weaning.  For swine raised in confinement (drylot) or on limited
pasture.<p> 
<b>III.  DOSAGE FORMS :</b><p> 
This NADA provided for the use of the approved Type A medicated articles, CSP
(TM) 250 and CSP (TM) 500, as per 21 CFR &#167;  558.155, to make Type B
medicated feeds and Type C medicated feeds.  CSP (TM) 250 is supplied as Type A
medicated articles in 5, 10 and 50-lb bags.  CSP (TM) 500 is supplied as Type A
medicated articles in 5 and 50-lb bags.  <p> 
    <b> ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION :</b>  Orally, in the feed.<p> 
    <b> RECOMMENDED DOSAGE :</b><p> 
The recommended dosage of chlortetracycline, sulfathiazole and penicillin is
100, 100, and 50 grams per ton in combination in Type C medicated feeds for
swine.<p> 
<b>IV.   EFFECTIVENESS and ANIMAL SAFETY :</b><p> 
The supplemental NADA provides for revised Type A medicated article, and Type B
and C medicated feed labeling.  Changes in the approved labeling are required
to bring the labeling in concert with existing management practices, i.e.,
lower weaning weights.  Although the previous label indicates use in 20 pound
pigs, the data in the NADA support the safety and effectiveness of CSP(TM) from
10 pounds body weight up to 6 weeks post-weaning.  Changes to the label include
"for use in pigs from 10 pounds body weight up to 6 weeks post-weaning," and
deletion of the "Minimum Desired Daily Feed Intake" table in the "Caution"
statement.  The "Permitted Claims and Limitation" and "Caution" sections of the
labeling reflect these changes.<p> 
The "Minimum Desired Daily Feed Intake" table is removed because the enhanced
performance or therapeutic benefits of CSP(TM) is based on <i>ad libitum</i>&#160; 
consumption, and not the minimum desired daily feed intake consumption values
reported in the table.  Therefore, these consumption values may be misleading
if these desired daily feed intake consumption values are obtained and the
desired performance does not result.  This together with changes in weaning
weights renders the "Minimum Desired Daily Feed Intake" table obsolete.<p> 
Additional effectiveness studies were not required because the data from
studies contained in the NADA indicate that CSP(TM) is effective when used in
swine feeds in accordance with the revised label.  For performance claims, the
starting weights of pigs used in the original studies ranged from &#126; 13 to &#126; 20
pounds.  For therapeutic claims, the pathology of the labeled diseases are
similar between 10 pound pigs and the pigs used to demonstrate the therapeutic
effectiveness in the NADA.  No scientific evidence could be established that
would indicate differences in drug metabolism for CSP(TM) between 10 pound pigs
and pigs used to demonstrate therapeutic or production claims.  Differences in
immune competency and differences in digestive enzyme production should not
affect the effectiveness or metabolism of CSP(TM) in 10 pound pigs for the
labeled claims.  Therefore, the effectiveness data contained in the NADA
supports the approval of this supplemental NADA for the use of CSP(TM) in from
10 pounds body weight up to 6 weeks post-weaning.<p> 
An additional safety study was not required because adequate data has been
provided to show that these compounds are compatible in combination when used
in swine feeds.   The target animal safety data in the NADA is adequate to
support this supplemental NADA.  The starting weight of the pigs used in the
target animal safety study ranged between 13 and 24 pounds.  No scientific
evidence could be established that would indicate differences in drug
metabolism for CSP(TM) between 10 pound pigs and 13 to 20 pound pigs.
Differences in immune competency and differences in digestive enzyme production
between 10 and 13 pound pigs should not affect the safety or metabolism of
CSP(TM) in 10 pound pigs.  The target animal safety study demonstrates that no
ill effects occurred when these drugs were fed in combination.   Therefore,
based on the data in the NADA, it is concluded that these drugs may be
effectively and safely fed to swine, as indicated on the labeling.<p> 
<b>V.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS :</b><p> 
 The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that CSP (TM) 250 and
CSP (TM) 500 are safe and effective for the claims indicated in Section II of
this FOI summary.<p> 
Pursuant to 21 CFR &#167;  514.106 (b)(2), this supplemental NADA approval
is regarded as a Category II supplemental change which did not require a
reevaluation of safety and effectiveness data.  These drugs are to be fed in
Type B and Type C medicated feeds, in accordance with Sections II and III of
the FOI Summary and the Type A medicated article and Blue Bird labeling that is
attached to this document. <p> 
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the supplemental application does not contain new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>B. Safe Concentration of Residues</b><P>
The most sensitive species shown in the toxicity studies 
was the mouse for which a no-effect level (NOEL) of 0.07 
mg/kg/day was found. For chronic toxicity a 100 observed-fold 
safety factor is applied for calculating a safe 
concentration. The safe concentration of total residues 
of halofuginone in the uncooked edible tissues of 
broilers are 0.1 ppm in muscle, 0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 
ppm in skin with adhering fat. Based on the data on the 
following section, (C. Residue Depletion and Metabolism) 
halofuginone hydrobromide has an established tolerance in 
broilers of 0.16 ppm for parent halofuginone hydrobromide 
(marker residue) in liver (target tissue). A marker 
residue concentration of 0.16 ppm in liver corresponds to 
a concentration for total residues of halofuginone 
hydrobromide of 0.3 ppm in liver.<P>
<b>C. Residue Depletion and Metabolism</b><P>  
Total residues of 14-C-halofuginone in tissues of chickens 
were determined in two studies, one using halofuginone 
radiolabeled in the piperidine ring and one with 
halofuginone radiolabeled in the quinazolinone ring. The 
results of the two studies were similar showing that 
extensive metabolism into components containing only the 
piperidine or quinazolinone moieties does not occur. The 
data from the study using 14-C-piperidine ring labeling 
are shown in the following table as that study gave 
somewhat higher total residues values in the mid range of 
that depletion curve for liver tissue. The investigator 
for this study was:<P>
Dr. D. R. Hawkins<br>
Huntingdon Research Centre<br>
Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire<br>
England<P>
Thirty-six broilers were given daily oral doses of 14-C-halofuginone 
on 14 consecutive days. Each daily dose was 
0.3 mg 14-C-halofuginone which corresponds to a dietary 
incorporation of 3 ppm. Six broilers (3 of each sex) were 
sacrificed at each time point. The average total residue 
levels (in ppm) observed at each sacrifice interval and 
the corresponding standard deviation are shown below 
(Table 1).<P>

</pre>
Liver
and pooled kidney tissues from the above total 
residues study were also assayed for parent halofuginone 
by HPLC assay. The results of those assays showed that 
parent halofuginone represents a significant portion of 
the total residue in both liver and kidney, but of the 
two tissues, liver had the overall depletion 
characteristics most favorable for the target tissue. 
<P>
Dr. Leon LeVan, Hazleton Laboratories America, Inc., 
Madison, WI 53707, conducted the final 14-C-halofuginone 
hydrobromide residue study in broiler liver to determine 
the tolerance for parent halofuginone hydrobromide in 
broiler liver. Twenty-four broilers (twelve of each sex) 
were given daily doses of 14-C-halofuginone hydrobromide 
for six consecutive days. Each daily dose was 0.3 mg/kg 
body weight which corresponds to a dietary incorporation 
of 3 ppm halofuginone hydrobromide. Six broilers (three 
of each sex) were sacrificed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours 
after the final dose. The average total residues (total 
radioactivity) and the parent compound (halofuginone 
hydrobromide) recovered are shown in Table 2. Based on 
these data, when the average total residue in the liver 
(target tissue) is at the consumption adjusted safe 
concentration of 0.3 ppm, the parent halofuginone 
hydrobromide (the marker residues) equals 0.16 ppm. The 
Rm or tolerance, was thus determined to be 0.16 ppm 
halofuginone hydrobromide in broiler liver.<P>

</pre>
A
comparative metabolism study was completed in which six 
female chickens were given a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg 
body weight (BW) 14-C-halofuginone hydrobromide and twelve 
mice (6 males, 6 females) were given a single 0.24 mg/kg 
BW oral dose of 14-C-halofuginone hydrobromide. This study 
was conducted by Dr. D. R. Hawkins, Huntingdon Research 
Centre, Huntingdon, England.<P>
Extracts of chicken liver from birds killed at zero 
withdrawal contained predominantly one component which 
corresponded to unchanged halofuginone (94%). A small 
percentage (6%) of a less polar metabolite was also 
present. Female mouse liver extract was shown to contain 
predominantly (85%) a component which corresponded to 
unchanged halofuginone plus 15% of a more polar 
component. Male mouse liver extract contained as the 
major (51%) component a metabolite which was less polar 
than halofuginone hydrobromide and which was not present 
in the extracts of either female mouse liver or female 
chicken liver. In addition, 30% of a component 
corresponding to parent halofuginone hydrobromide was 
present in male mouse liver extract. On a qualitative 
basis, the radioactive components detected by 
chromatography of female chicken liver extracts were also 
present in extract of male and female mouse liver. A 
similar qualitative relationship was also demonstrated 
with the metabolite pattern for chicken excreta and for 
mouse urine and feces. Thus, it was concluded that a test  
species (the mouse) and the chicken were each 
qualitatively exposed to the same residue of 
halofuginone.<P>
<b>D. Tolerance for Marker Residue</b><P>
The above data show that, when the average total residue 
level in liver (the target tissue) is at the consumption 
adjusted safe concentration of 0.3 ppm, parent 
halofuginone hydrobromide (the marker residue) represents 
approximately 53% of that residue or 0.16 ppm. The Rm or 
tolerance, was thus determined to be 0.16 ppm 
halofuginone hydrobromide in the liver.<P>
<b>E. Withdrawal Time</b><P>
The withdrawal time for this drug use was determined from 
a residue study in which broiler chickens were treated 
with unlabeled halofuginone hydrobromide. The broilers 
were treated continuously from 1 day of age to 7 weeks of 
age (market weight) with halofuginone hydrobromide at 3 
ppm in the feed. Six birds, (3 males and 3 females) were 
sacrificed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days of withdrawal, 
and the livers were assayed for halofuginone hydrobromide 
(the marker residue) by the HPLC regulatory assay. The 
investigators for this study were Drs. Paul Griminger and 
Hans Fisher, Nutrition Dept., Rutgers, The State 
University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903. The average residue 
levels and the standard deviation are presented in Table 3.<P>

</pre>
The
statistical analysis of the depletion data using the 
upper tolerance limit containing 99 percentile of the 
population with 95% confidence yields a withdrawal period 
of 4 days for this drug use. The analytical method used 
to generate the depletion data has lower limit of 
reliable measurement of 0.05 ppm, and values below that 
level were not used in the statistical analysis. 
<P>
<b>F. Regulatory Methods</b><P>
The determinative method for quantitating residues of 
halofuginone in chicken liver is based on high-pressure 
liquid chromatography. The confirmatory assay is a 
negative ion chemical ionization spectrometry/mass 
spectrometry procedure.<P>
The determinative and confirmatory methods were validated 
satisfactorily by FDA and USDA laboratories. The 
validated regulatory methods are filed in the Food 
Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of 
Information Public Room (room 12-A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, 
Rockville, MD 20857).<P>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
Halofuginone hydrobromide, codified in 21 CFR 558.265 and 
CFR 556.308, is approved for marketing as a Type A 
Medicated Article for use for the prevention of 
coccidiosis in broiler chickens and turkeys.<P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA 
requesting an increase in the tolerance satisfy the 
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate 
that halofuginone hydrobromide (STENOROL&#174;) at a 
concentration of 3 ppm in finished feed, will produce 0.3 
ppm total concentration of residues in the liver (target 
tissue) of broiler chickens. This concentration 
corresponds to a concentration of parent halofuginone 
(marker residue) of 0.16 ppm (rather than 0.1 ppm), in 
liver. The safe concentrations for total residues in the 
uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens remain 0.1 
ppm in muscle, 0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 ppm in skin with 
adhering fat and the withdrawal period for such chickens 
remains 4 days.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy, this is 
a category II change [21 CFR 514.106 (b)(2)(xi)]. The 
approval of this change, a recalculation of the 
tolerance, is not expected to have any adverse effect on 
the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug. The 
change in tolerance requires no change in either the safe 
concentration or the withdrawal period, i.e., an increase 
in residue concentration is not expected. Accordingly,
this approval did not require a reevaluation of the 
safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<P>
In implementing the Generic Animal Drug and Patent 
Restoration Act, the Center's third policy letter 
published August 28, 1989 (54 FR 35534) discusses 
"Exclusivity for Human Safety Data Submitted in 
Supplemental Application."  The Center's policy states 
that the provision of exclusivity does not apply in the 
case of human food safety studies submitted to obtain a 
different tolerance, because a tolerance for a drug 
necessarily applies to all products containing the same 
drug substance.<P>

<h3>IV.  EFFECTIVENESS</h3> 
A.  Pivotal Studies - Dose Determination<p>

<ol>
<li>Overview:<p>
    NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium) was approved
in August 1992 (NADA 140-338) for use in day-old chicks for control of
colibacillosis associated with <i>E. coli</i>  susceptible to ceftiofur at
a dosage range of 0.08 to 0.20 mg ceftiofur/chick.  After the efficacy of
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder was demonstrated in chicks, a
development program was initiated for the control of early mortality associated
with <i>E. coli</i> organisms susceptible to ceftiofur in day-old turkey poults.  <p>
    Since pathogenesis, lesions and bacterial strains associated with early mortality due to <i>E. coli </i>are similar in poults and chicks, an effective dose in day-old turkey poults was determined by comparing plasma
pharmacokinetic data from chicks and turkey poults.  The primary plasma
pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were AUC (area under the curve estimated
to the last quantifiable value), CMAX (maximum plasma concentration), and TMIC
(time above minimum inhibitory concentration for <i>E. coli</i> ).  The
approach was to determine the dose in turkey poults that produces ceftiofur and
desfuroylceftiofur metabolite concentrations (measured as derivatized
desfuroylceftiofur acetamide) over time which correspond to the plasma
concentration time profile produced in the chick for a known efficacious dose in chicks.  <p>
    Use of this method of dose extrapolation requires an assumption of similar  interspecies protein binding characteristics of the active moieties (TR 812-7926-94-002), comparable partition characteristics of drug from blood to lung (TR 812-7926-92-001 and 812-7926-94-003), similar pathogen response to ceftiofur and its desfuroylceftiofur metabolites (TR 705-7922-90-005 and 705-7923-95-009) and similar host responses to the pathogens (literature survey).  The validity of these assumptions has been supported by the results of both pivotal and non-pivotal studies.<p>
    The dose-response relationships of the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for both the turkey poult and the chick results were modeled as simple linear regressions.  Using the fitted regression equations, the upper 90% confidence limit corresponding with the pharmacokinetic parameter associated with a dose of 0.08 mg/bird in chicks was matched to the turkey dose associated with
the lower 92.5% confidence limit.  Since CMAX and TMIC resulted in almost
identical dose estimates, the modeled CMAX values for chicks and turkey poults were used to predict a dose in the turkey poult corresponding to the low end of the approved chick label dose range (0.08 mg ceftiofur/chick).  The predicted poult dose corresponding to a chick dose of 0.08 mg ceftiofur/chick is 0.17 mg ceftiofur/poult.  The upper dose of the dose range (0.5 mg/poult) for day-old turkey poults is easily justified based on drug residue and target animal safety data.<p>
    Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations show that the <i>in vitro</i> susceptibility of<i> E. coli </i>isolated from chicks and turkey poults to ceftiofur is similar.  In addition, ceftiofur and its
desfuroylceftiofur metabolite, demonstrated equal <i>in vitro</i> potency
against <i>E. coli</i>. <p>

Type of Study:  These reports (Upjohn Technical Report 812-7926-91-003, Upjohn Technical Report 812-7926-95-003, Upjohn Technical Report 812-7926-95-004) describe the pharmacokinetics of total ceftiofur active moiety in plasma, liver, lung and yolk sac of chicks following a single subcutaneous injection of 14-C-ceftiofur sodium at 0.04, 0.08 or 0.16 mg ceftiofur free acid equivalents/chick.<p>

c.  General Design:  <p> <ol>
<li>)  Purpose of Study:  To determine pharmacokinetics of total ceftiofur active moiety in plasma, liver, lung and yolk sac after administration of a single subcutaneous injection of ceftiofur sodium to chicks.<p>
<li>)  Animals:  chicks; Vantress Cross<p> 
* 80 males and 80 females per treatment group<p>
* 30 to 40 g each<p>
* 48 to 60 hours old  <p>
<li>)  Experimental Design:  Chicks (5 birds per cage; mixed sex) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (0.04, 0.08 or 0.16 mg
ceftiofur/chick) for each week over four weeks.<p>
<li>)  Sampling:  Chicks were euthanatized at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 hours post-treatment.  The yolk sac, liver, and lungs were collected as composite tissues from each of the five replicate chicks per cage and stored at -20&#176;C until processed.  Blood was collected as a composite sample (5 chicks within a cage) during euthanasia and was processed into plasma immediately (within 2 hours) after collection.<p>
<li>)  Assay Method:  The samples were assayed by HPLC equipped with an ultraviolet (UV) detector and a radioactive monitor.  The limit of quantitation for the chick plasma assay method is 0.093 ug/mL (Upjohn Technical Report 812-7926-95-004).<p>
<li>)  Dosage Form:  A stock solution was prepared by dissolving purified
14-C-ceftiofur sodium in water for injection.  The dose solutions were prepared by diluting
the stock solution with water for injection.<p>
<li>)  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Model:  The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were CMAX , AUC, and TMIC.  The Cmax was defined as the first observed maximum plasma concentration that occurred post 0.1 hour.  The 0.1-hour time point was excluded because incomplete mixing of the blood pool at this time point might have produced an erroneous Cmax.  The AUC was determined by a trapezoidal algorithm implemented in SAS&#174;, and was determined only to
the last time point.  The TMIC values were calculated by fitting the raw data (from 2 to 8 hours) to a mono-exponential model using the SAS NLIN procedure.  The TMIC was then calculated from the following fitted model:<p>
[LN(MIC90) - LN (A)]/-k
<p>
where A equals the Y intercept based upon the fitted data and k equals the elimination rate constant based on the concentrations from Hours 2 to 8 postdose.  An acceptance criteria for r squared was not established due to the random fluctuations associated with the plasma concentration versus time profile. </ol> <p>
d.  Results:  Chick plasma pharmacokinetic data for the three dose levels of ceftiofur are presented in Table 4.1.  AUC, CMAX and TMIC estimates were  confirmed to be dose proportional within the dosage range of 0.04 to
0.16 mg/bird.<p>

e. Conclusions:  The dose-proportionality of the three pharmacokinetic measures, AUC, CMAX and TMIC is consistent with the use of linear regression models as a method for interspecies dose extrapolation.  Therefore, these three measures were used to predict an appropriate low end for the dose range for poults.  <p>

*  72 males and 72 females per treatment group<p>
*  42 to 83 g each <p>

<li>)  Experimental Design:  Poults (3 birds per cage; mixed sex) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (0.12, 0.24 or 0.48 mg ceftiofur per poult) for each of 6 replicates.<p>
<li>)  Sampling:  Poults were euthanatized at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, or 12 hours post-treatment.  Blood was collected as a composite sample (3 birds within a cage) during euthanasia and was processed into plasma immediately after collection.  The plasma was stored frozen until assayed.<p>
<li>)  Assay Method:  The samples were assayed by HPLC equipped with an ultraviolet (UV) detector and a radioactive monitor.  The limit of quantitation of the
plasma assay method is 0.189 ug/mL (Upjohn Technical Report
812-7926-95-004).<p>
<li>)  Dosage Form:  A dose solution was prepared by combining 14 -C-
ceftiofur sodium with NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium).<p>
<li>)  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Model:  The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were CMAX , AUC, and TMIC.  The CMAX value was defined as the first observed maximum plasma concentration that occurred post 0.1 hour.  The AUC was
determined by a trapezoidal algorithm implemented in
SAS&#174;, and was determined only to the last time point.
The TMIC value was calculated by fitting the raw data (from 2 to 12 hours) to a mono-exponential model using the SAS&#174; NLIN procedure.
The TMIC was then calculated from the following fitted model:<p> 
[LN(MIC90) - LN (A)]/-k<p>
where A = the Y intercept based upon the fitted data and k
equals the elimination rate constant based on the concentrations from Hours 2 to 12 postdose.  An acceptance criteria for r-squared was not established due to the random fluctuations associated with the plasma concentration versus time profile. </ol> <p>
d.  Results:<p>
    A summary of the pharmacokinetic data for the three dose levels of ceftiofur in turkey poults is presented in Table 4.2.  As seen with chicks, these measures suggest a linear correlation between dose and total blood ceftiofur
concentrations, thereby justifying the use of linear regression models for the
extrapolation of a minimum effective dose in poults.  The target
pharmacokinetic endpoints (means and upper 90% confidence limits) for the 0.08
(lowest approved dose in chicks), 0.12 and 0.20 mg/chick (maximum approved dose
in chicks) are presented in Table 4.3.  For a particular pharmacokinetic
endpoint, the across-week-average intercept and slope, as well as the sample
variance-covariance estimates, were computed.  The dose at which the poult's
lower 92.5% prediction interval equaled the target of the endpoint
(corresponding to chick doses of 0.08, 0.012 and 0.20 mg/bird) is shown in
Table 4.4.<p>
    The pharmacokinetic endpoints (CMAX, AUC and TMIC) did not estimate the exact same dose.  These differences were in part attributable to error introduced by comparing AUC values estimated over different time point ranges (0 to 8 hr in chicks; 0 to 12 hr in poults).  However, from dose estimates based on CMAX and TMIC values, it was concluded that this interspecies extrapolation would be most accurate if based upon observed CMAX values.<p>

General Design:<p> <ol>
<li>)  Purpose:    To evaluate the effectiveness of NAXCEL&#174;
Sterile Powder administered to day-old turkey poults for control of early poult
mortality associated with <i>E. coli</i> organisms susceptible to ceftiofur.<p>
<li>)  Animals:    Day-old BUTA and Nicholas large white turkeys from commercial
hatcheries.<p>
<li>)  Experimental Design:<p>
    The study included eight trial sites.  A randomized complete block design with
12 blocks in each of the trial sites was used.  The experimental unit was a pen
containing 50 poults (same sex).  A block consisted of four adjacent pens.
Within each block, the treatment design was a 2 x 2 factorial.  The factors of
the factorial design were experimental group (control and ceftiofur) and sex
(male and female poults). The design included a total of 19,200 poults (9,600
males and 9,600 females); the actual number of poults placed was 19,189 (9,589
males and 9,600 females).<p>
<li>)  Experimental Groups:<p>
    Group 1 (control)   Male poults injected with 0.2 mL Sterile Water for
Injection<p>
    Group 2 (control)   Female poults injected with 0.2 mL Sterile Water for
Injection<p>
    Group 3 (ceftiofur) Male poults injected with a single dose of 0.17 mg of
ceftiofur free acid equivalents in 0.2 mL Sterile Water for Injection.<p>
    Group 4 (ceftiofur) Female poults injected with a single dose of 0.17 mg of
ceftiofur free acid equivalents in 0.2 mL Sterile Water for Injection<p>
<li>)  Diagnosis:  Morbidity/mortality was defined as having been associated with <i>E. coli</i> only if the final diagnosis by the poultry diagnostician
indicated that<i> E. coli</i> was a causative microorganism, and all of the
following conditions were met: 1) death occurred after treatment was initiated,
2) lesions indicative of <i>E. coli</i> were present, and 3) culture results
were positive for <i>E. coli</i>..<p>
<li>)  Dosage Form of Test Articles:  The dosage form was an aqueous solution
containing 50 mg ceftiofur per mL (stock solution).  The stock solution
was prepared using NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder and Sterile
Water for Injection.  The stock solution was diluted with Sterile Water for
Injection to prepare a dose solution of 0.17 mg/0.2 mL.<p>
<li>)  Route of Administration:    Test articles were administered as a single
subcutaneous injection in the back of the neck.<p>
<li>)  Dose:  0.17 mg/poult<p>
<li>)  Test Duration:  14 days at each site<p>
<li>) Pertinent Variables Measured:  The pivotal response variable was poult
morbidity/mortality associated with <i>E. coli</i>, and was defined as the
cumulative number of moribund plus dead poults in a pen over the 14-day                                                                          
trial period divided by the total number of poults in the pen at the beginning
of the trial. </ol> <p>
d.  Results:  The mean cumulative percent morbidity/mortality associated with
<i>E. coli</i> for the control and ceftiofur group throughout the 14-day
test period for all trials are shown in Table 4.8.<p>

*Note: Data from one site not included due to technical problems.<p>
e.  Statistical Analysis<p>
The pivotal response variable was analyzed by the method of weighted analysis
of variance with trial location being considered random.  The weight was the
number of poults in a pen.  There was no significant TREATMENT GROUP x SEX
interaction at alpha=0.05, so the effects of groups were tested by
averaging across sex.   To conclude that ceftiofur at 0.17 mg/poult was
efficacious, the pivotal response variable for the ceftiofur group had to be
significantly lower compared to the control group at alpha=0.05.  The analysis of the pooled data (excluding the one site mentioned above) showed that ceftiofur at 0.17 mg/poult significantly (p = 0.038) reduced the morbidity/mortality associated with <i>E. coli</i> compared to the control group.<p>
f.  Conclusion:<p>
It was concluded that NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder is effective
at the 0.17 mg dose for control of early mortality associated with
<i>Escherichia coli</i> (colibacillosis) susceptible to ceftiofur in
one-day-old turkey poults.<p>
g.  Adverse Reactions:  No adverse reactions were observed.<p>

<h3> V.  ANIMAL SAFETY</h3> 
A.  Pivotal Study<p> <ol>
    <li>Target Animal Safety Study<p>
a.  Type of Study:  This was a 7-day study in turkeys in which a single
injection of NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder at a dose of 0, 100,
400, or 800 mg/kg of body weight was administered subcutaneously at 1 day of
age followed by a 7-day observation period.  The study was conducted and
inspected according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.<p>

c.  General Design:<p> <ol>
<li>)  Purpose:<p>
This study was designed to determine the toxicological effects of ceftiofur
administered by subcutaneous injection to turkeys.  <p>
<li>)  Animals:    A total of 258 one-day-old Nicholas broad-breasted white turkey poults were used for this study.  Twenty-nine/sex (initial) and 10/sex (repeated) Nicholas broad-breasted white day-old turkey poults were assigned to each of four treatment groups.<p>
<li>)  Dosage Form of Test Articles:  The dosage form was an aqueous solution
containing 25, 100, or 200 mg ceftiofur/mL prepared using
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder and Sterile Water for Injection.
The 0-mg dose group received Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride for Injection.<p>
<li>)  Dose:  The doses were 0, 100, 400, or 800 mg ceftiofur/kg body weight.<p>
<li>)  Route of Administration:  Test articles were administered by subcutaneous injection.<p> 
<li>)   Study Duration:  The study spanned 7 days beginning at 1 day of age.<p>
<li>)  Pertinent measurements/observations:<p>
Daily clinical observations, mortality, hematological measurements,
(Day 4), body weight (control period and terminal), gross necropsy, and histopathology were evaluated to assess potential toxicity in turkeys for all birds in the initial portion of the study.  <p>
Due to problems encountered during the analysis of the blood samples collected on Day 4 from the birds in the initial portion of the study, additional poults  were treated and blood samples collected four days later.  Since birds used in the repeated portion of the study were intended to provide only the hematological measurements (Day 4) not obtained from the initial part of the study, birds from the repeated part of the study were not necropsied.  Findings listed in the Results section below were derived from data collected from birds used in the initial portion of the study, with the exception of the
hematological results which were obtained from birds in the repeated portion of
the study. </ol> <p>
d.  Results:<p> <ol>
 <li>)  Clinical Observations<p>
Of the three dosages tested, only the 800 mg/kg dose produced clinical signs of toxicity, including depression, ataxia and prostration.  No clinical signs were noted in any of the mid dose poults (400 mg/kg).  One female poult in the low dose group (100 mg/kg) showed mild signs of depression.  <p>
<li>)  Mortality<p>
The only mortalities that appeared to be drug related occurred in the high dose group.  Table 5.1 summarizes poult mortality for the initial portion of the study.<p>

Note: * for initial portion of study<p>
<li>)  Body Weight<p>
    Poults from the 800-mg/kg dose group showed reduced gains at Day 4, probably
due to toxicity.  There were no adverse effects on weight gain in the other treatment groups.<p>
<li>)  Hematology<p>
    Blood samples were collected and analyzed on Day 4 from birds in the repeated portion of the study.  There was no evidence of treatment effects on red blood cell count, hemoglobin or hematocrit.<p>
<li>)  Gross Necropsy Observations<p>
    Only birds in the 800-mg/kg group showed gross changes in tissues that were thought to be drug related.  Observations included:  large blood clots surrounding the heart (5/20 males, 1/20 females); roughened, white heart surface (4/20 males, 1/20 females); white peritoneal surface (5/20 males, 2/10 females); liver and intestinal adhesions (3/20 males, 1/20 females).  Additional observations (also from the high dose group) included mottled or pale liver with attached small pale or red nodules, and fluid in the thoracic or abdominal cavity.<p>
<li>)  Histological Observations<p>
    There were no histological observations that were treatment related in the 100- or 400-mg/kg treatment groups.  Microscopic lesions that were thought to be indications of drug related toxicity in the 800-mg/kg group included:
mineralization of the heart muscle, necrosis of the heart muscle, and
alterations of the lymphoid tissue in the bursa of Fabricius, spleen, and
thymus. </ol> <p>
e.  Conclusion<p>
    The subcutaneous injection of ceftiofur sodium to day-old turkey poults at 100 and 400 mg/kg [twelve times (12X) and fifty times (50X) the maximum label dose]  caused no adverse effects that were believed to be drug related in this study.  This, in conjunction with the lack of adverse effects in the clinical field trial indicates that NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder is safe when
used in day-old turkeys in accordance with label directions. </ol> <p>

<h3> VI. HUMAN SAFETY</h3> 
A.  Toxicity Studies:  All issues concerning toxicity testing of
ceftiofur are addressed in the previous Freedom of Information Summary for NADA
140-338, the approval notice for which appeared in the FEDERAL REGISTER on
April 12, 1990 (55 FR 13768): Freedom of Information Summary for
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium) for Bovine
Respiratory Disease.  This summary was updated in June 1992.<p>
B.  Safe Concentration of Total Residues:<p> <ol>
<li>No Observed Effect Level (NOEL):<p>
Studies include mutagenicity, oral feeding, and hypersensitivity studies.  The
lowest no observed effect level (NOEL) from the 90-day oral feeding studies in
both dogs and rats was 30 mg ceftiofur per kg body weight (bw).  Since the drug
is considered a Low Use Drug intended for therapeutic use in specific animals
and because it has undergone extensive safety testing, chronic toxicity studies
were not required.  Thus, the ADI was based, without the 25 ug/kg bw/day
limitation, on the 90-day studies; a safety factor of 1000 is used in the safe
concentration calculations.<p>
<li>Calculation of Allowable Daily Intake (ADI)<p>


<pre>
                                     Lowest NOEL

                                          30 mg/kg                        
The lowest NOEL is 30 mg/kg, so ADI =   ____________        
                                            1000 
                                            
                                     =  0.03 mg/kg bw/day.          
       
                                            
</pre>
<li>Allocation of ADI:<p>
    The revised General Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals (FDA-CVM July 1994) provides for the reservation of a
portion of the ADI for milk.  Since 1) ceftiofur sodium is approved for
parenteral use in lactating dairy cattle, 2) both salts, hydrochloride and
sodium, accede to the same primary metabolite, and 3) total residues are
indistinguishable quantitatively or qualitatively, the ADI for both salts is
the same.<p>
    The portion of the ceftiofur ADI reserved for milk is 27%.
    <pre>
    
    ADI for milk  = 27% x total ADI
                  = 0.27 x 0.03 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day 
                  =0.008 mg/kg body weight/day
                  
    ADI for edible tissues  = total ADI - ADI for milk
                            = 0.030 mg/kg bw/day - 0.008 mg/kg body weight//day
                            = 0.022 mg/kg bw/day
</pre>

<li>Animals:  Twenty-four Kent broad-breasted white turkeys (12 males and 12 females) were used in the study.  Poults were 48 to 60 hours old at time of treatment and weighed 52 to 76 grams.<p>
<li>Dose:  Each poult received a single subcutaneous dose containing 0.091 mg 14-C-ceftiofur sodium in 0.2 mL in the dorsal side of the neck.<p>
<li>Results:  The total residue concentrations of 14-C-ceftiofur free
acid equivalents in edible tissues of turkey poults at 21 days post injection
are shown in Table 6.2.  Analysis of the tissues at 21 days post treatment
revealed that all residues were significantly below the safe concentration for
ceftiofur (4.4, 13.2, 26.4, ppm for muscle, liver, and skin/fat,
respectively). <p>

<li>Conclusion:  This residue study was conducted at approximately two times the
maximum dose level.  Since total ceftiofur residue levels for edible tissues at
21 days after treatment are markedly below (over 1000 times) the safe
concentration, this study supports assignment of a zero-day withdrawal period.
 </ol> <p>
D.  Metabolism and Comparative Metabolism<p> 
The metabolism and comparative metabolism requirements in turkey poults are
minimal and are waived for the following reasons: <p> <ol>
<li>Under current commercial practices, tom turkeys are marketed at
approximately 122 days, and hen turkeys are marketed at approximately 98
days.<p>
<li>Ceftiofur sodium will only be used in day-old turkey poults which provides
an inherent withdrawal time of at least 21 days.<p>
<li>The total residues at 21 days post treatment were well below the safe
concentration. </ol> <p>
E.  Tolerance for the Marker Residue<p>
    Total residues at 21 days following the injection of ceftiofur sodium in
turkey poults are markedly lower than the calculated safe concentrations.
Therefore, a tolerance is not required.<p>
F.  Withdrawal Time<p>
The residue data showed that the mean concentrations of total ceftiofur
residues at 21 days post treatment were significantly below the safe
concentration (over 1000 times lower) for each of the edible tissues of turkey poults treated with approximately two times the maximum dose.  Poultry husbandry practices assure that no turkey poult will be handled more than once and therefore would not receive more than one injection, nor will the poults be brought to market prior to 21 days post treatment.  Therefore, a withdrawal period will not be required for the use of ceftiofur sodium in day-old turkey poults.  Since a withdrawal period will not be required, a target tissue, marker residue, and tolerance have not been assigned.<p>
G.  Regulatory Method<p>
An official regulatory method is not required because the toxicology and
residue data support a zero-day withdrawal for the use of
NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium) in day-old
turkey poults. <p>
<h3>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</h3> 
The data submitted in support of this NADA supplement satisfy the
requirements of Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of the implementing regulations.  The data demonstrate that NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium), when
administered as a single subcutaneous injection to one-day-old turkeys, is safe and effective for the control of early mortality associated with <i>E. coli</i> organisms.  <p>
This supplement also provides for a change in the wording for the chick
indication.  Wording for the chick indication has been modified to more closely resemble that for the poult.  Accordingly, the indications for both the chick and the turkey poult are:  "...for the control of early mortality associated with <i>E. coli</i> organisms susceptible to ceftiofur".<p>
The Allowable Daily Intake (ADI) for this product was revised reserving 27
percent of the ADI for milk.  The safe concentrations were recalculated using the new consumption values.  The safe concentrations for total residues of ceftiofur are 4.40 ppm in muscle, 13.20 ppm in liver, and 26.40 ppm in skin/fat.  The total residue data showed that the mean concentrations of total ceftiofur residues at 21 days after injection were well below the permitted safe concentration in the edible tissues of growing turkey poults.  Husbandry practices for turkeys are such that they will only be handled at one day of age for injection with ceftiofur and not enter the human food chain until 98 or more days of age.  Therefore, a withdrawal period will not be required for this use of NAXCEL&#174; Sterile Powder in day-old turkey poults.
An official regulatory method is not required because the residue and
toxicology data support a zero-day withdrawal.<p>
Labeling restricts this drug to use by or on order of a licensed veterinarian.
This decision was based on the following factors:  (a) adequate directions
cannot be written to enable lay persons to appropriately diagnose and
subsequently use this product to control early mortality associated with <i>E. coli </i>organisms, and (b) the rate of emergence of ceftiofur-resistant
organisms may be reduced by the involvement of veterinarians in product use.<p>
Public health concerns associated with potential increases in antimicrobial
resistance have been satisfactorily addressed by establishing conditions of use
intended to minimize inappropriate use of this product, and excretion of
ceftiofur and ceftiofur-resistant zoonotic pathogens into the environment.  <p>
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required.  The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the
evidence supporting that finding are contained in an environmental assessment,
which may be seen in the Docket Management Branch (HFA-305),
Parklawn Building (Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Maryland
20857.<p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(v) and
(vii)), these are Category II changes.  The approval of these changes is not
expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new
animal drug and, therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or
target animal safety data in the parent application.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for turkey poults qualifies for THREE years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations and new human food safety
studies essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored
by the applicant.<p>

    <b>Sponsor Name and Address:</b><p>The Upjohn Company<br>       Agricultural Division<br>
Kalamazoo, MI 49001 <p>
<b>Established Name:</b>    Melengestrol acetate<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>  MGA&#174;100/200 Premix, 
MGA&#174;500 Liquid Premix <p>
<b>Established Name:</b>  Monensin<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>       RUMENSIN&#174; <p>
<b>Established Name: </b> Tylosin<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>       TYLAN&#174; <p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> OTC <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>     June 29, 1994 <p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b> <p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and monensin.
Previous approvals have required a 48 hour pre-slaughter drug withdrawal for
heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with either tylosin or
monensin and tylosin. <p>
<b>II.  Indications for Use</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for the combined
administration of melengestrol acetate and tylosin either with or without
monensin which are: <p>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter. <p>
<b>III. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b> <p>
<b>Dosage Form:  </b>                            Feed <p>
<b>Route of Administration: </b>                  Oral <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>   Melengestrol acetate:  0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
Monensin (as monensin sodium):  50 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton air
dried complete feed)<br>   Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate):  90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
    complete feed) <p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 90 mg tylosin per head per day with or without 50
to 360 mg monensin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement for
slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate of
0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head. <p>
<b>IV. Effectiveness</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the indications for these combinations. <p>
<b>V. Animal Safety </b><p>
This supplement does not affect target animal safety of these combinations. <p>
<b>VI. Human Safety </b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b> <p>
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period. <p>
A tolerance of 0.05 ppm has been established for negligible residues of
monensin in the edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.420). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed monensin (21 CFR 558.355). <p>
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625). <p>
<b>2.  Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin.</b> <p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of
the supplemental application for MGA (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402) and that the
concentration of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances, when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, tylosin and monensin in combination, each
at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
withdrawal. This study is summarized below. <p>
Groups of heifers were individually fed for 90 days either no additive
(control, n=14) or melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin in combination at
1X (n=7), 3X (n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive
(1X = 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate, 30 g monensin/ton air dried feed and 10 g
tylosin/ton air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero
withdrawal. <p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the method described in JAOAC
59:507-515:1976. This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from heifers in the control and 1X treatment group had concentration of
melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat samples from heifers in the 3X and 5X dose groups were 29.2 ppb
(range 18.2 to 39.6 ppb) and 42.2 ppb (range 35.8 to 49 ppb), respectively. <p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of monensin and tylosin
residues. No residues of either monensin or tylosin were detected in any of the
liver samples from these heifers. The limit of detection for these analyses
were 0.04 and 0.1 ppm for monensin and tylosin, respectively. <p>
<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
These data demonstrate that when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin and
monensin in combination the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is
below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and the concentration
of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances. <p>
<b>3. Assay noninterference </b><p>
Data, previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrated <p>
1)  the presence of monensin and tylosin does not interfere with the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<p>
2)  presence of monensin and melengestrol acetate does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for tylosin; and<p>
3)  presence of melengestrol acetate and tylosin does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for monensin <p>
<b>4. Regulatory methods</b> <p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, monensin and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, 
Room 12A30). <p>
<b>5. Conclusions</b> <p>
This supplement provides for the deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
pre-slaughter withdrawal period for melengestrol acetate when fed in combination
with tylosin and either with or without monensin. No changes are made in either
the approved dosages of any of these additives, the approved indications of use
or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the conclusion
that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is below the established
tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of melengestrol acetate
and tylosin either with or without monensin. Accordingly this change in
regulations for melengestrol acetate is not expected to have adverse effects on
public health or food safety. <p>
<b>VII.   Agency Conclusions </b><p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and
monensin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity data for MGA
contained in NADA's  34-254 and  39-402. <p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations. 
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>
<b>VIII.  Labeling</b><p>
1.  Package label bag or bulk medicated heifer dry supplement (Type B Medicated Feed) 
containing MGA and tylosin<br>
2.  Package label bag or bulk medicated heifer dry supplement (Type B Medicated Feed) 
containing MGA, monensin and tylosin<p>

<B>4. EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>
The drug was the subject of National Academy of	Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11647).  The Academy 	evaluated
these products as  probably effective for growth promotion and feed	efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline.<p>

The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease)  caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability,under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the
preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6)effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage.<p>

The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues.,  July 21, 1970).  FDA proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 135-938 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness.
That review resulted in a letter to the sponsor in which the agency stated that
it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only for the control
and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to chlortetracycline
pre-mixes in chickens, turkeys, cattle, sheep and swine.<p>

Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<p>

1. Appropriate oral doses for all the allowable species and claims based on
milligrams per pound or gallons per ton are on the current labels.<p>

2. Claims pertaining to egg production and hatchablilty have been deleted from the labels.<p>

3. Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
approriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride.  Disease claims which were not so qualified have been
deleted.<p>

4. Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<p>

5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated feed adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<p>

6.	Claims for growth promotion or stimulation have been removed.  Allowable
claims are for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed effieciency.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B> <p>

 No further safety data are required.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><p>

The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.  FDA's approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.  The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at 21 CFR 556.150.<p>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the
Act and demonstrates that Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Article when used
under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled
indications.  The approval provides for use of ChlortetracyclineType A
Medicated Article for the control and treatment of specific diseases in swine,
cattle, chickens,turkeys, and sheep.<p>

The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlotetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER </b>of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph.  The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<p>

When NADA 138-935 was reviewed under NAS/NRC/DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.
Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Article for use in food-producing animals
are also currently on the market as over-the-counter products.  Therefore, the
Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-the-counter marketing status.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category ll change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<p>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<B>4. EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>

The drug was the subject of National Academy of	Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11647).  The Academy	evaluated these products as  probably effective for growth promotion and feed efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline.<p>

The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the
preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6) effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage. <p>

The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues.,  July 21, 1970).  FDA proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 92-286 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness.
That review resulted in a letter to the sponsor in which the agency stated that
it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only for the control
and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to chlortetracycline
pre-mixes in chickens, turkeys, cattle, sheep and swine.<p>

Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<p>

1. Appropriate oral doses for all the allowable species and claims based on
milligrams per unit of body weight or grams per ton are on the current
labels.<p>

2. Claims pertaining to egg production and hatchablilty have been deleted<br>
	from the labels.<p>
	
3. Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
approriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride.  Disease claims which were not so qualified have been
deleted.<p>

4. Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<p>

5. Claims for growth promotion or stimulation have been removed.  Allowable
claims are for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed effieciency.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><p>

  No further safety data are required.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><p>

 The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.  FDA's
approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.  The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at 21 CFR 556.150.<p>

When NADA 92-286 was reviewed under NAS/NRC/DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.  Other
Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Articles for use in food-producing animals
are also currently on the market as over-the-counter products.  Therefore, the
Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-the-counter marketing status.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category ll change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<p>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<body><b>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</b><p>

<b>CHLORTETRACYLINE FOR GRAZING CATTLE</b><p>

<B>1. General Information:</B><p>

<I>NADA Number</I>:<p>
48-761<p>
	
<I>Sponsor</I>:<p>

Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc.<br>
340 Kingsland Street<br>
Nutley, New Jersey 07110<p>

<I>Established Name</I>:<p>
Chlortetracycline (CTC)<p>

<I>Trade Name</I>:<p>

Aureomycin&#174;<p>

<I>Marketing Status</I>:<p>
OTC<p>

<I>Effect of Action</I>:<p>

This supplemental approval provides for a supplemental cattle feed (Moorman's
Special Range Minerals AU Type C Medicated Feed) to provide 0.5-2.0 mg CTC/lb
bodyweight/day for the control of active infection of anaplasmosis caused by
<i>Anaplasma marginale</i> susceptible to chlortetracycline, in grazing beef
cattle (weighing over 700 lbs).  The resultant supplemental feed containing
chlortetracycline is offered free-choice continuously throughout the period in
which the cattle are grazing pasture. <p>

<B>2.Indications for Use:</B><p>

Control of active infection of anaplasmosis caused by <i>Anaplasma
marginale</i> susceptible to chlortetracycline, in grazing beef cattle
(weighing over 700 lbs).<p>

<I>Dosage Form(s), Route(s) of Administration, and Recommended Dosage:</I><p>

Chlortetracycline is supplied as a Type A Medicated Article that is
administered orally by mixing the Type A Medicated Article into a supplemental
cattle free-choice feed (Moorman's Special Range Minerals AU Type C Medicated
Feed) to provide 0.5-2.0 mg CTC/lb. bodyweight/day.  The resultant supplemental
feed containing chlortetracycline is to be offered free-choice continuously
throughout the period in which the cattle are grazing pasture.<p>

Warning:<p>

Discontinue use 4 days before cattle are slaughtered.<p>


<B>3. Effectiveness:</B><p>

Chlortetracycline was approved (see 53 FR 31316, dated August 18,
1988) for use in free-choice cattle feeds such as feed blocks or salt-mineral
mixes.  Such feeds are given to beef cattle and non-lactating dairy cattle to
provide a daily minimum intake of 0.5 milligram of CTC per pound of body weight
to aid in the prevention of anaplasmosis.  Since only a minimum dose (which is
impractical for free-choice feeding situations) was established for efficacy
and not a dose range, the Agency/Sponsor needed to address setting an upper
limit for CTC consumption, so that human food safety concerns would not arise.
A study was conducted (summarized in the Human Food Safety Section of this FOI
Summary) that establishes the upper limit as 2.0 mg CTC per pound of body
weight, when a 4 day withdrawal period is observed.  Thus, the daily dosage
range for CTC in free-choice feeding situations is 0.5-2.0 mg of CTC per pound
of body weight.<p>

The consumption of the medicated range minerals was tested in six free-choice
pasture cattle studies to establish that the average consumption of CTC was
within the daily dosage range of  0.5-2.0 mg of CTC per pound of body
weight.<p>

A.<i>Mississippi (#4941)</i>: Conducted by Drs. C. Pat Bagley and Richard
Evans (Northern Mississippi Research and Extension Center) at Prairie,
Mississippi.  Thirty-six mixed breed heifers were pastured on bermudagrass and
fescue; and fed medicated range minerals containing CTC at 8000 grams per ton.
There were three replicates in this study, each containing 12 animals, with the
replicates being rotated between pastures at 14 day intervals.  Average daily
consumption of CTC was 0.633 mg per pound of body weight.  Before the study was
initiated the animals were offered non-medicated range minerals for 29 days, to adapt them to consuming the free-choice product.<p>

B.<i>Colorado (#4942)</i>: Conducted by Dr. Kenneth Odde (Colorado State
University) at the Eastern Colorado Research Center, Akron, Colorado.
Thirty-six mixed breed steers were pastured on native grasses; and fed
medicated range minerals containing CTC at 8000 grams per ton.  There were
three replicates in this study, each containing 12 animals, with the replicates
being rotated between pastures at 14 day intervals.  Average daily consumption
of CTC was 0.961 mg per pound of body weight.  Before the study was initiated
the animals were offered non-medicated range minerals for 20 days, to adapt them to consuming the free-choice product.<p>

C.<i>Illinois (#4958)</i>: Conducted by Dr. Britt Hicks (Moorman Research
Farm No. 2) at Mendon, Illinois.  Twenty-four Angus steers were pastured on
orchardgrass; and fed medicated range minerals containing CTC at 8000 grams per
ton.  There were three replicates in this study, each containing 8 animals,
with the replicates being rotated between pastures at 14 day intervals.
Average daily consumption of CTC was 0.887 mg per pound of body weight.  Before
the study was initiated the animals were offered  non-medicated range minerals
for 35 days, to adapt them to consuming the free-choice product.<p>

D. <i>Mississippi (#4944)</i>: Conducted by Dr. C. Pat Bagley (Northern
Mississippi Research and Extension Center) at Pontotoc, Mississippi.  Thirty
mixed breed cow-calf pairs were pastured on bermudagrass; and fed medicated
range minerals containing CTC at 8000 grams per ton.  There were three
replicates in this study, each containing 10 cow-calf pairs (plus a bull for
the first twelve days of drug treatment), with the replicates being rotated
between pastures at 14 day intervals.  Average daily consumption of CTC for a
cow-calf pair was 1.13 mg per pound of body weight.  Before the study was
initiated the animals were offered non-medicated range minerals for 26 days, to
adapt them to consuming the free-choice product.<p>

E.<i>Colorado (#4943)</i>: Conducted by Dr. Kenneth Odde (Colorado State
University) at the Eastern Colorado Research Center, Akron, Colorado.  Thirty
mixed breed cow-calf pairs were pastured on native grasses; and fed medicated
range minerals containing CTC at 8000 grams per ton.  There were three
replicates in this study, each containing 10 cow-calf pairs, with the
replicates being rotated between pastures at 14 day intervals.  Average daily
consumption of CTC for a cow-calf pair was 1.86 mg per pound of body weight.
Before the study was initiated the animals were offered non-medicated
range minerals for 20 days, to adapt them to consuming the free-choice product.<p>
      
F.<i>Illinois (#4959)</i>: Conducted by Dr. Britt Hicks (Moorman Research
Farm No. 2) at Mendon, Illinois.  Thirty Hereford x Angus cow-calf pairs were
pastured on fescue; and fed medicated range minerals containing CTC at 8000
grams per ton.  There were three replicates in this study, each containing 10
cow-calf pairs (plus a bull for the first 39 days of drug treatment), with the
replicates being rotated between pastures at 14 day intervals.  Average daily
consumption of CTC for a cow-calf pair was 0.52 mg per pound of body weight.
Before the study was initiated the animals were offered non-medicated range
minerals for 36 days, to adapt them to consuming the free-choice product.<p>

The results of these studies indicated the average consumption of CTC fell
within the daily dosage range of  0.5-2.0 mg of CTC per pound of body weight
when provided in free-choice range minerals.  Because the medicated free-choice
range minerals provided a daily minimum intake of 0.5 milligram of CTC per
pound of body weight the Agency has concluded they are effective for the
control of active infection of anaplasmosis caused by <i>Anaplasma
marginale</i> susceptible to chlortetracycline, in grazing beef cattle
(weighing over 700 lbs).<p>

<B>4.Target Animal Safety:</B><p>

As discussed in the Freedom of Information Summary dated February 16,
1996, that states "NADA 48-761 was originally approved as safe on November 9,
1951."<p>

<B>5. Human Food Safety:</B><p>

Part A.  Tolerance<p>

Safety of the approved product, chlortetracycline premix, has been established
by data in the original application, NADA 48-761.<p>

The tolerance for chlortetracycline in the edible tissues of beef cattle and
nonlactating dairy cattle is 0.1 ppm in uncooked kidney, liver, and muscle (21
CFR 556.150).<p>

Part B.  Study Establishing the Withdrawal Period<p>

A residue depletion study was conducted by Moorman Manufacturing, Quincy,
Illinois to satisfy the human food safety requirements for chlortetracycline
(CTC) at a concentration of 4 g/lb in free-choice mineral feeds for growing
calves and for cows with nursing calves.  The purpose of the study was to
determine the depletion of CTC in cattle fed 2 mg CTC/pound body weight/day for
28 days.<p>

Three nonmedicated control (2 steers, 1 heifer) and 24 test Hereford cattle (12
heifers and 12 steers) with an average initial weight of 598 pounds were used.
Test cattle were fed AUREOMYCIN &#174; 90 chlortetracycline
granular Type A medicated article mixed in supplemental feed to provide 2 mg
CTC/pound body weight/day for 28 days.  The control cattle were fed
nonmedicated feed.  After 28 days of test drug feeding, the medicated feed was
withdrawn and replaced with nonmedicated feed.  At 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84
hours after the end of medication, two male and two female cattle were
sacrificed and the appropriate tissues were assayed for residues.<p>

</pre>

The statistical method used to calculate the withdrawal time was that described
by FDA:  VI.  Guideline for Establishing a Withdrawal Period, September, 1986.
Using a statistical tolerance limit for the 99th percentile of the population
with 95% confidence, a withdrawal time of four days in kidney was assigned for
cattle fed AUREOMYCIN &#174; 90 chlortetracycline granular Type
A medicated article mixed in supplemental feed to provide 2 mg CTC/pound body
weight/day for 28 days. (hours)  <p>

Part C.  Regulatory Method<p>
The validated microbiological method with minor modifications was used to
measure antimicrobial activity of chlortetracycline in cattle tissue
(Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues:  Methods,
Reports, and Protocols, FDA, 1968).  The limit of quantitation is 0.05 ppm.
The method is on file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug
Administration, HFV-199, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, Maryland  20855.<p>

<B>6. Agency Conclusions:</B><p>

This NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512(b) of the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act, and demonstrates that chlortetracyline when used under
the proposed conditions of use is safe and effective for the labeled
indications.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for three years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of the approval because the application
contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change.  However, this action did not require a reevaluation of
the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>

<p>
This FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY references data in Public Master File (PMF)
5307, 56 FR 61021, November 29, 1991, in support of the supplemental new animal
drug application for ranch-raised foxes.  The data were generated by:<P>
William J. Foreyt, Ph.D.<br>
Dept. of Vet. Microbiology and Pathology<br>
Washington State University<br>
Pullman, Washington  99164-7040<P>
<b>	2.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY </b><P>
Target animal safety data from the FOI summary for PMF 5307, 56 FR
61021, November 29, 1991, demonstrated that based on clinical observation,
foxes treated with ivermectin at a dosage of 1000 &#181;g/kg body weight (5X the
optimal dose) were not adversely affected by the elevated level of the drug.
The data demonstrate that ivermectin injection, when administered
subcutaneously at a dosage of 200 &#181;g/kg body weight, twice at a 3 week
interval, is safe to ranch-raised foxes.  <P>
<b> 	3.	DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
Efficacy data from the FOI summary for PMF 5307, 56 FR 61021, November 29,
1991, demonstrated that ivermectin injection, when administered subcutaneously
at a dose of 200 &#181;g/kg body weight, twice at a 3 week interval, was efficacious
in controlling ear mites (<i>O. cynotis</i>). <P>
<b>	4.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
		The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that ivermectin, when
used under the proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the
control of ear mites (<i>Otodectes cynotis</i>) in ranch-raised foxes.<P>
The original approval of ivermectin was as an over-the-counter drug.  Accurate
diagnosis of ear mites in ranch-raised foxes, which is the new species to be
added to the label, can be made with reasonable degree of certainty by the
layman.  Adequate directions for use have been written for the layman, and the
conditions for use prescribed on the labeling are likely to be followed in
practice.  Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has concluded
that this product shall have over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy 21 CFR 514.106(b)(2), this is a
Category II change. The approval of this change did not require a reevaluation
of the safety or effectiveness data in the parent application.<P>

<B>l. Effect of Supplement:</B><p>

To increase the tolerance in the target tissue, kidneys, to 7.2 ppm and to decrease the withdrawal periods to 1 day in cattle, 2 days in sheep, and 3 days for swine and goats.<p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY and DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

<b></b>The basis for the original approval of this ANADA was published in 57 FR
26604, June 15, 1992.<p>

<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

<i>Tolerance</i><p>

The tolerance for neomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle,
swine, sheep, and goats was originally established at 0.25 ppm (21 CFR
556.430).  The tolerance is being revised using the new food consumption
factors as described in the FDA/CVM July 1994 guideline entitled, "General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing
Animals" (59 FR 37499).  A tolerance of 7.2 ppm is established for residues of
parent neomycin (marker residue) in the kidney (target tissue), 7.2 ppm in fat,
3.6 ppm in liver, 1.2 ppm in muscle of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats.  A
tolerance of 0.15 ppm is established for neomycin in milk.<p>

<i>Studies Establishing the Withdrawal Period</i><p>
	
1.  Ten male and ten female swine weighing approximately 100 lbs each were
administered neomycin sulfate at 10 mg/lb/day for 14 days through the drinking
water.  One male and one female swine served as controls.  The swine were
sacrificed in groups of four (2M, 2F) at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after the last
dose.  Samples of kidney, liver, muscle, and fat were taken and assayed for
residues.  Only kidney had detectable amounts of residues.<p>

on ML estimates of dispersion.  This accommodates values below the limit of
quantitation and above the limit of detection.  Using a statistical tolerance
limit for the 99th percentile of the population with 95% confidence, the
following withdrawal times were calculated for animals treated with 10

<i>Regulatory Methods for Residues</i><p>

The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> suspension.  The
method is published  by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols",
revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974.<p>

<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>

Neomycin sulfate, codified in 21 CFR Parts 520.1484(c)(3) and 556.430, is
approved for marketing as a soluble powder for the treatment and control of
colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>
susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle (excluding veal calves), swine,
sheep, and goats.<p>

The data submitted in support of this supplemental ANADA requesting an increase
in the tolerance satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrate that neomycin sulfate (Neomycin Sulfate Soluble Powder) at a dose
of 10 mg/lb/day for 14 days orally in the drinking water, will produce
concentrations of residues in the kidneys (target tissue) in cattle, swine,
sheep, and goats which are below the accepted tolerance (7.2 ppm) by the
following revised withdrawal periods.  The withdrawal period for cattle is 1
day, sheep is 2 days, and swine and goats is 3 days. <p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy, this is a Category II change
[21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(x)and(xi)]. The approval of this change, a recalculation
of the tolerance, is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or
effectiveness of this new animal drug.  The change in tolerance allows for a
decrease in the withdrawal period.  Accordingly, this approval  did not require
a reevaluation of the safety or effectiveness data in the parent
application.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food , Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval does not qualify for marketing
exclusivity because the application does not contain reports of new clinical or
field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) or new
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<B>4. 	EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>

The drug was the subject of National Academy of	Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11647).  The Academy evaluated
these products as  probably effective for growth promotion and feed	efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline.<p>

The Academy states that: (1) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the
preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6) effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage.<p>

The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues.,  July 21, 1970).  FDA proceeded to review all available data
relating to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 48-480 to determine
which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness.
That review supported effectiveness only for the control and treatment of
certain bacterial diseases susceptible to chlortetracycline pre-mixes in
chickens, turkeys, and swine.<p>

Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<p>

1. Appropriate oral doses for all the allowable species and claims based on
milligrams per unit of body weight or grams per ton are on the current
labels.<p>

2. Claims pertaining to egg production and hatchablilty have been deleted from the labels.<p>

3. Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
approriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride.  Disease claims which were not so qualified have been
deleted.<p>

4. Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<p>

5. The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated feed adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease signs.<p>

6. Claims for growth promotion or stimulation have been removed.  Allowable
claims are for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed effieciency.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><p>
No further safety data are required.<p>

<B>6. 	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><p>
The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal.  FDA's
approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application.  The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at 21 CFR 556.150.<p>

<B>7.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the
Act and demonstrates that CHLORATET 50 Type A Medicated Article when used under
its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled
indications.  The approval provides for use of CHLORATET 50 Type A Medicated
Article for the control and treatment of specific diseases in swine, sheep,
cattle, calves, chickens, and turkeys.<p>

The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlotetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER </b>of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the paragraphs above.  The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<p>

When NADA 48-480 was reviewed under NAS/NRC/DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.  Other
Chlortetracycline Type A Medicated Article for use in food-producing animals
are also currently on the market as over-the-counter products.  Therefore, the
Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-the-counter marketing status.<p>

Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category ll change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<p>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p> This supplement provides for label and package
insert changes as follows:<P>
 <b>A. Label Changes</b><P>
<ul> 
 <li>Removal of current "Contraindication" statement reading "<b>CONTRAINDICATION:</b> Regu-Mate&#174; (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% is contraindicated for use in pregnant
mares."<P>
<li>Addition of a new "Contraindication" statement reading "<b>CONTRAINDICATION:</b> Regu-Mate (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% is contraindicated for use in mares
having previous or current history of uterine inflammation (i.e., acute,

<li>Addition of a new "Additional Information" statement reading:<P>
"<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</b> A 3-year well-controlled reproductive safety study
was conducted in 27 pregnant mares, and compared with 24 untreated control
mares. Treated mare received 2 ml altrenogest/110# body weight (2x dosage
recommended for estrus suppression) from day 20 to day 325 of gestation. This
study provided the  following data:<P>

    1. In filly offspring (all ages) of treated mares, clitoral size was
increased.<P>
    2. Filly offspring from treated mares had a shorter interval from Feb. 1 to
first ovulation than fillies from their untreated mare counterparts.<P>
    3. There were no significant differences in reproductive performance between
treated and untreated animals (mares &#38; their respective offspring)
measuring the following parameters:<P>
<ul>    
    <li>interval form Feb. 1 to first ovulation, mares only.<P>
    <li>mean interovulatory interval from first to second cycle and second to third
cycle, mares only.<P>
    <li>follicle size, mares only.<P>
    <li>at 50 days gestation, pregnancy rate in treated mares was 81.8% (9/11) and
untreated mares was 100% (4/4).<P>
   <li>after 3 cycles, 11/12 treated mares were pregnant (91.7%) and 4/4 untreated
mares were pregnant (100%).<P>
    <li>colt offspring of treated and control mares reached puberty at approximately
the same age (82 &amp; 84 weeks respectively).<P>
    <li>stallion offspring from treated and control mares showed no differences
seminal volume, spermatozoal concentration, spermatozoal motility, and total
sperm per ejaculate.<P>
    <li>stallion offspring from treated and control mares showed no difference in
sexual behavior.<P>
    <li>testicular characteristics (scrotal width, testis weight, parenchymal
weight, epididymal weight and height, testicular height, width and length)
were the same between stallion offspring of treated and control mares.<P>
</ul>
This supplement does not affect the status of the original approval and
Regu-Mate&#174; (altrenogest) remains a "by prescription only" product.<P>
</ul>
<b>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><P>
REGU-MATE&#174; (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% is indicated to suppress estrus in
mares.<P>
Suppression of estrus allows for a predictable occurrence of estrus following
drug withdrawal and to facilitate the attainment of regular cyclicity during
the transition from winter anestrus to the physiological breeding season.
Suppression of estrus will also facilitate management of prolonged estrus
conditions. Suppression  of estrus may be used to facilitate scheduled breeding
during the physiological breeding season.<P>
<b>3. DOSAGE</b><P>
A. Dosage form - oil solution<P>
B. Route of administration - oral<P>
C. Recommended Dosage - Administer orally at the rate of 1 ml/110 pounds body
weight (0.044 mg/kg). To be given one dose daily for 15 consecutive days.<P>
<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b><P>
The new animal drug application upon which this supplement is based was the
subject of approved NADA 131-310 dated 9/12/83.  See FR Vol. 48, No. 177, p.
40887.<P>
<b>5. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><P>
Adequate animal safety data was established in the NADA 131-310 as approved
9/12/83.  See FR Vol. 48, No. 177, p. 40887.<P>
This supplement provides for reproductive safety studies in pregnant mares
which were conducted at two different sites (Colorado State University and
University of California at Davis). Summary findings are listed below:<P>

Pregnancy
rates (day 15) for treated controls in each of the three cycles are shown in
Table 4.  The cycle 1 pregnancy rate for control animals was 100% while that
for treated was 81.8%.  These pregnancy rates are considered to be extremely
high.  Due to the 100% pregnancy rate experienced by control animals, no
statistical comparison could be made with the treated group for cycles 2 and 3.
Two treated mares from the first cycle did not become pregnant and one mare
(913) experienced early embryonic death between 25 and 30 days and was
inseminated on a second cycle.  Two of the three mares became pregnant on cycle
2 (66.7%).  One treated mare was bred on cycle 3 but failed to become pregnant.
Over 3 cycles, 11 of 12 treated mares and 4 of 4 control mares became pregnant
(mare 913 counted twice).  In addition to one
treated mare not becoming pregnant, one mare (911) experienced early embryonic
death between 45 and 50 days.  Thus, at 50 days of gestation, 9 of 11
altrenogest-treated mares were pregnant (81.8%) as compared to 4 of 4
controls.<P>

castration.  There was similar number in treated stallions. In addition, the number
of elongated spermatids per gram of testis did
not differ between control and treated stallions (Table 9).  Thus, the
efficiency of spermatozoal production was similar in treated and control
stallions.  Based on examination of codes-histologic sections, it was evident
that spermatogenesis was not affected by prior treatment of the dams during
gestation with Altrenogest (Table 10).  The number of spermatids, old
spermatocytes, young spermatocytes and spermatogonia were similar between
treated and control stallions.<P>

<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
There appears to be little difference in reproductive performance between
offspring of mares that were administered Altrenogest throughout pregnancy and
the offspring of mares who received no progesterone supplementation.  The only
parameters where there was a significant difference between control and treated
groups was the interval from February 1st to the first ovulation and the
clitoral size of the fillies.  Filly offspring from treated mares experienced
their first ovulation approximately one month sooner than their counterparts
from untreated mares.  Filly offspring from treated mares (at all ages) also
had slightly larger clitori than their counterparts from untreated mares.
There were no parameters measured in the stallions that were different between
to pregnant mares does not appear to be a detriment to the functional
reproductive performance of the offspring.<P>

This study was conducted primarily to measure estrogen levels in pregnant mares
as method to clarify the main source of estrogen in the pregnant mare.
However, a major component of experimental design was the use of altrenogest on
both intact pregnant mares and ovariectomized pregnant mares.  All mares were
bred by one of two proven sire stallions on site at the Equine Reproductive
Laboratory at UCD.<P>
In this study, it would be expected that ovariectomized mares would abort due
to inability to produce sufficient progesterone (P4) to maintain pregnancy.
Conversely, such mares should (hypothetically) be able to maintain pregnancy if
supplemented with an exogenous progesterone/progestin source in sufficient
quantity and duration of administration.<P>

<b>6. HUMAN SAFETY<P>
A. Human Food Safety</b><p> Data on human safety pertaining to consumption of drug
residues in food were not required for approval of this supplemental NDA.  The
drug is approved for use in horses that are not to be used for food and is
labeled: <b>"Do not use in horses intended for food"</b><P>
<b>B. Human Safety relative to handling, possessing and administration.<P>
"WARNING:  Pregnant women and others of childbearing age should exercise
extreme caution when handling this product.  Accidental absorption could lead
to disruption of the menstrual cycle or prolongation of pregnancy.  Direct
contact with the skin should therefore be avoided.  Accidental spillage on the
skin should be washed off immediately with soap and water."<P>
INFORMATION FOR HANDLERS:<P>
Effects of overexposure:</b><P>
There has been no human use of this specific product.  The information
contained in this section is extrapolated from data available on other products
of the same pharmacological class that have been used in humans.  Effects
anticipated are due to the progestational activity of altrenogest.<br>
Acute effects after a single exposure are possible; however, continued daily
exposure has the potential for more untoward effects such as disruption of the
menstrual cycle, uterine or abdominal cramping, increased or decreased uterine
bleeding, prolongation of pregnancy and headaches.  The oil base may also cause
complications if swallowed.<p>
In addition, the list of people who should not handle this product (see below)
is based upon the known effects of progestins used in humans on a chronic
basis.<P>
<b>People who should not handle this product:</b><P>
1. Women who are or suspect they are pregnant.<br>
2. Anyone with thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders or with a history
of these events.<br>
3. Anyone with cerebral-vascular or coronary-artery disease.<br>
4. Women with known or suspected carcinoma of the breast.<br>
5. Women with known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia.<br>
6. Women with undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.<br>
7. People with a benign or malignant tumor which developed during the use of
oral contraceptives or other estrogen-containing products.<br>
8. Anyone with liver dysfunction or disease.<P>
<b>Accidental Exposure</b><P>
Altrenogest can be absorbed from contact with the skin.  In addition, this oil
based product can penetrate porous gloves. Absorption can be increased from
areas covered by occlusive materials, such as latex or rubber gloves.  The
following measures are recommended in case of accidental exposure:<P>
<b>Skin Exposure:</b> Wash immediately with soap and water.<p>
<b>Eye Exposure:</b> Immediately flush with plenty of water for 15 minutes.  Get
medical attention.<p>
<b>If Swallowed:</b> Do not induce vomiting.  Regu-mate&#174; (altrenogest) is an  oil
solution.  Call a physician.  Vomiting should be supervised by a physician
because of possible pulmonary damage via aspiration of the oil base.  If
possible, bring container and labeling to the physician.<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> For oral use in horses only. <br>
Keep this and all medication out of the reach of children.<P>
<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data in support of this supplemental NADA complies with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  It
demonstrates that Regu-mate(TM) (altrenogest) Solution when used under the
labeled conditions of use is safe and effective.<P>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 6436) this is a
Category II change.  This supplement provides for the deletion of the label
contraindication statement for use in pregnant mares and replaces it with the
contraindication for use in mares having previous or current uterine
inflammation.  The approval of the supplemental application has no adverse
effect on the safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug.  Accordingly,
this approval did not require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness
data in the parent application.<P>
For the safe and effective use of Regu-Mate(TM) (altrenogest) Solution, it is
necessary to provide a differential diagnosis between winter anestrus and the
physiological breeding season.  To make this diagnosis, it is necessary to know
the reproductive status of the ovary per rectal palpation which only a trained
professional who can differentiate between acute, subacute or chronic
endometritis and be in a position to know the current history of uterine
infections. Therefore, the drug is classified as a prescription drug.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this supplemental New Animal Drug Application does not
qualify for marketing exclusivity, because deletion of the contraindication for
use in pregnant mare does not expand the conditions of use of the product.
Addition of the contraindication against use in
pregnant mares with a history of uterine inflammation does not qualify for
exclusivity because the agency has determined that public policy requires that
such warnings should appear on all generic copies, and because in this case the
sponsor did not submit new clinical or field investigations. <P>

<b>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</b><P>





<b>FOR DIETHYLCARBAMAZINE CITRATE AND OXIBENDAZOLE CHEWABLE TABLETS FOR DOGS</b><P>
<b>1. Identification:</b><P>
<b>NADA Number:</b> Supplement to NADA 136-483<P>
<b>Sponsor Name/Address:</b><P>
Norden Laboratories<br> 
601 West Cornhusker Hwy<br>
Lincoln, Nebraska 68521<P>
<b>Generic Name:</b> Diethylcarbamazine Citrate and Oxibendazole Chewable Tablets<P>
<b>Trade Name:</b> Filaribits&#174; Plus Chewable Tablets<P>
<b>Marketing Status:</b><P>
Prescription Drug - Accurate laboratory diagnosis for the
presence of existing heartworm disease is required in the proper use of
the product.<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> January 18, 1989<P>
How the Supplemental NADA modifies or changes NADA 136-483:<P>
The approval of the supplemental NADA, the subject of this FOI summary, will
result in the addition of a label statement to provide for the removal and
control of mature and immature stages of intestinal <i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160; 
(ascarid infection).  Adequate data showing efficacy for the additional use
has been submitted in the supplemental application which is the subject of this
approval.<P>
The following changes and additions will be made:<P>
<b>2. Indications for uses:</b><P>
FILARIBITS Plus are indicated for use in the prevention of infection with
<i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>&#160;(heartworm disease), <i>Ancylostoma caninum
</i>&#160;(hookworm infection), the removal and control of <i>Trichuris vulpis
</i>&#160;(whipworm infection) and the removal and control of mature and immature
stages of intestinal <i>Toxocara canis </i>&#160;(ascarid infection) in dogs.
FILARIBITS Plus may be given to dogs of all ages, including bitches, throughout
the reproductive period and following whelping.<P>
<b>3. Dosage and Administration:</b><P>
FILARIBITS Plus are chewable tablets that are palatable to most dogs. Tablets
may be fed free-choice or placed on food. FILARIBITS Plus are scored for
convenient adjustment of dosage.<P>
<b>For the Prevention of
Heartworm Disease, Hookworm Infection and for the Removal and Control of
Whipworms and Mature and Immature Stages of Intestinal Ascarids in Dogs</b><P>
FILARIBITS Plus are given orally (once a day) at a dosage rate of 3 mg
diethylcarbamazine citrate and 2.27 mg oxibendazole per pound of body weight.
Young dogs may be started on the preventive program at two months of age.
Administration of FILARIBITS Plus in heartworm or hookworm endemic areas should
start prior to hookworm exposure and at least one month before the beginning of
the mosquito season. FILARIBITS Plus administration should continue daily
throughout the entire period of exposure to hookworms and two months past the
mosquito season since there is little residual effect of the drugs. Continuous
low level administration effectively prevents maturation of hookworms (<i>A.
caninum</i> ) and recently inoculated heartworm larva
(<i>D. immitis</i> ) into adults and provides for the removal and control of
whipworms (<i>T. vulpis</i> ) and mature and immature stages of intestinal
ascarids (<i>T. canis</i> ).  If FILARIBITS Plus is discontinued because of
seasonal heartworm problems, hookworm prevention or therapy and whipworm and
ascarid removal and control should be continued.<P>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><P>
<b>A. LABORATORY STUDIES</b><P>
The efficacy of FILARIBITS Plus in removing and controlling ascarids is
reported in four critical laboratory efficacy studies involving a total of 42
dogs (Table I).<P>
Critical laboratory studies were conducted by the following investigators:<P>
M.L. Sharp, D.V.M.<br>
Sharp Veterinary Research<br> 
P.O. Box 353<br>    
Vernon, TX 76384<P>   
John McCall, Ph.D.<br>
TRS Labs, Inc.<br>

Athens, GA 30605<P>
S.M. Kruckenberg, D.V.M., Ph.D.<br>
Kruckenberg Drug Research<br>
2851 Oregon<br>
Manhattan, KS 66502<P>
Critical laboratory studies were conducted using each animal as its own
control.  Efficacy of FILARIBITS Plus was determined using the formula:<P>
<pre>
No. Parasites Removed
---------------------
No. Parasites Removed +       x  100  =  % Efficacy
No. Parasites Remaining  

</pre>
Treated
dogs showed 100% ascarid removal in all four studies, (Tables II, III, IV and
V) after a 30 day treatment period.<P>
<b>B. CLINICAL (FIELD) STUDIES</b><P>
In the clinical (field) trials, 68 dogs from eighteen veterinary practices in
twelve states were studied.  All dogs were infected with ascarids when entering
the study. They received FILARIBITS Plus as the only deworming agent for an
average of 73.5 days. Eleven ascarid infected dogs in a control group received
a diethylcarbamazine citrate containing product (FILARIBITS) for an average of
71 days.  Fecal examinations were conducted in all dogs before and at
approximately 4 week intervals during the trials.<P>
In pivotal studies seven (7) of the eighteen (18) investigators evaluated
controls (FILARIBITS) as well as treated cases (FILARIBITS Plus). Using a
Mantel-Haenszel test on data from the pivotal studies and evaluated at the
first two fecal recheck examinations, the number of dogs cleared of ascarids is
significantly greater (P&lt;0.02) for the FILARIBITS Plus groups than the
FILARIBITS groups. The results of the field trials are shown in Tables VI and
VII.<P>
In corroborative studies eleven (11) of the eighteen (18) investigators
evaluated the efficacy of FILARIBITS Plus. The results of these studies are
shown in Table VI.<P>
<b>5. Animal Safety</b><P>
No adverse reactions or unusual observations associated with FILARIBITS Plus
were reported by investigators conducting the critical laboratory trials.<P>
Untoward reactions in the clinical trials were minimal in number as well as
severity. Investigators in the clinical trials reported one or more of the
following side effects in a total of 4 dogs: vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia,
tenesmus and depression plus elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and white
blood cell count levels.
Safety was rated excellent or good in all of the dogs by the investigators.<P>
Labeling contains a boxed warning that addresses the occasional association
with hepatic toxicity including several fatalities. It also provides advice
for monitoring of animals receiving the drug and the clinical/biochemical
criteria which should be considered.<P>
For additional information on target animal safety studies, refer to the
Freedom of Information Summary filed for the original approval.<P>
This supplement falls under Category II Supplements in which the safety data is
unchanged and re-evaluation was not required. <i>Federal Register, </i> Vol. 42, No.
247, P. 64367-64371.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>
Data on human food safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for the approval of this NADA. The drug is labeled to be
used in dogs, which are non-food animals.<P>
Human Safety considerations other than food safety. No identified hazards or
characteristics of the drug were observed in a wide range of toxicological
studies. No specific precautions over and above those normally used when
handling drug substances are indicated.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data in support of this supplemental new animal drug application comply
with the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that
Filaribits-Plus (diethylcarbamazine citrate and oxibendazole) when used as
directed is both safe and effective for the removal and control of mature and
immature stages of intestinal <i>Toxocara canis</i> (ascarid infection) in
dogs.<P>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is a
Category II change. The approval of this supplemental application had no
adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of this new animal drug because
it provides solely for a claim of a new parasite species. Accordingly, this
approval did not require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in
the parent application.<P>
The product is categorized as Rx because veterinary intervention is needed to
diagnose heartworm, hookworm, whipworm and ascarid positive animals. Animals
having heartworms and hookworms would have to be converted to a parasite
negative status by the veterinarian prior to being placed on prophylactic
therapy.<P>

<b>Established Name:</b>	Melengestrol acetate<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>	MGA&#174; 100/200 Premix, MGA&#174; 500 Liquid Premix<p>

<b>Established Name: </b> Monensin<br>

<b>Established Name: </b> Tylosin<br>
<b>Trade Name: </b>      TYLAN&#174;<p>

<b>Marketing Status:</b> OTC<p>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>     June 29, 1994<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and monensin.
Previous approvals have required a 48 hour pre-slaughter drug withdrawal for
heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with either tylosin or
monensin and tylosin.<p>

<b>II.	Indications for Use:</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for the combined
administration of melengestrol acetate and tylosin either with or without
monensin which are:<p>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter.<p>

<b>III.	Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b> <p>
<b>Dosage Form: </b>                           Feed<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>                   Oral<p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>	<b>Melengestrol acetate  </b>	0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
<b>Monensin (as monensin sodium)  </b>	50 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton 		air
dried complete feed).<br>	<b>Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate)  </b>	90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
	complete feed)<p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 90 mg tylosin per head per day with or without 50
to 360 mg monensin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement for
slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate of
0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head.<p>

<b>IV. Effectiveness</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the indications for these combinations.<p>

<b>V. Animal Safety</b><p>
This supplement does not affect target animal safety of these combinations.<p>

<b>VI. Human Safety</b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b><p>
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period.<p>
A tolerance of 0.05 ppm has been established for negligible residues of
monensin in the edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.420). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed monensin (21 CFR 558.355).<p>
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625).<p>

<b>2.	Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin.</b><p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of
the supplemental application for MGA (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402) and that the
concentration of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances, when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, tylosin and monensin in combination, each
at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
withdrawal. This study is summarized below.<p>
Groups of heifers were individually fed for 90 days either no additive
(control, n=14) or melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin in combination at
1X (n=7), 3X (n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive
(1X = 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate, 30 g monensin/ton air dried feed and 10 g
tylosin/ton air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero
withdrawal.<p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the method described in JAOAC
59:507-515:1976. This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from heifers in the control and 1X treatment group had concentration of
melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat samples from heifers in the 3X and 5X dose groups were 29.2 ppb
(range 18.2 to 39.6 ppb) and 42.2 ppb (range 35.8 to 49 ppb), respectively.<p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of monensin and tylosin
residues. No residues of either monensin or tylosin were detected in any of the
liver samples from these heifers. The limit of detection for these analyses
were 0.04 and 0.1 ppm for monensin and tylosin, respectively.<p>

<b>Conclusion</b><p>
These data demonstrate that when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin and
monensin in combination the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is
below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and the concentration
of monensin and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances.<p>

<b>3. Assay noninterference</b><p>
Data, previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for these
NADA's, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrated<p>
1)	the presence of monensin and tylosin does not interfere with the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<br>
2)	presence of monensin and melengestrol acetate does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for tylosin; and<br>
3)	presence of melengestrol acetate and tylosin does not interfere with the
tissue residue assay for monensin<p>

<b>4. Regulatory methods</b><p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, monensin and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, 
Room 12A30).<p>

<b>5. Conclusions</b><p>
This supplement provides for the deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
pre-slaughter withdrawal period for melengestrol acetate when fed in combination
with tylosin and either with or without monensin. No changes are made in either
the approved dosages of any of these additives, the approved indications of use
or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the conclusion
that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat is below the established
tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered without a
pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of melengestrol acetate
and tylosin either with or without monensin. Accordingly this change in
regulations for melengestrol acetate is not expected to have adverse effects on
public health or food safety.<p>

<b>VII.   Agency Conclusions</b><p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with tylosin or with tylosin and
monensin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity data for MGA
contained in NADA's 034-254 and 039-402.<p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations. <p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b>
<p>
A clinical field study was initiated to determine the safety and efficacy of
Primor (sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim in 5:1 ratio) for the treatment of
canine urinary tract infections.  The treatments were evaluated for efficacy by
the veterinary investigator using a clinical scale based on:  (1) resolution of
clinical signs; (2) resolution of the bacterial infections based on
pre-treatment and post-treatment urinalysis and sterile urine culture; and (3)
the necessity for additional therapy.  Physical examination, hematology, blood
chemistry and presence or absence of adverse reactions were the parameters to
determine safety.<p>

The well-controlled, blinded trial was conducted at study sites over three
geographic regions.  An identical protocol common to all sites was used to
compare Primor to a positive control, Tribrissen (sulfadiazine and
trimethoprim).  Blinding was accomplished through the use of a separate,
dispensing investigator and by packaging of investigational supplies.  Animals
entering the study were assigned to treatment groups on a random basis
according to a randomization table provided to the investigator with the study
protocol.<p>

Dogs of any breed and weight and either sex with acute, naturally occurring
urinary tract infections of bacterial origin were admitted to the study.  The
diagnosis of the urinary tract infection was based on the animal showing
clinical signs of a urinary tract infection (e.g. increased frequency of
urination, decreased volume of urine voided, hematuria, stranguria and urgency)
and laboratory confirmation of the infection by urinalysis, and bacterial
culture and sensitivity.<p>

Animals were excluded from the study due to:  (1) known or suspected allergic
potential to either the experimental or control drug; (2) treatment for the
same condition within three weeks prior to entering the study; (3) pregnancy or
the animals being used for breeding purposes; (4) co-existing disease impacting
the urinary system (i.e. cancer, uroliths, persistent urachus, diabetes
mellitus, Cushing's Disease); (5) concurrent use of topical or systemic
anti-bacterial drugs, antibiotics or antibacterial agents; and (6) chronicity
of the condition requiring repeated or prolonged treatment.<p>

Permissible diagnostic and therapeutic procedures included:  radiography,
pneumocystography, double contrast cystography and related sedation or
anesthesia, as well as flushing of the urinary bladder with normal saline or
electrolyte solution.  However, the urinary bladder could not be flushed with
antiseptic or antibacterial solutions (i.e. chlorhexidine or betadine).<p>

All dogs were treated orally.  Both drugs were dosed per label instructions:
Primor at 25 mg/lb body weight once daily on the first day of treatment
followed by 12.5 mg/lb body weight once daily on subsequent days of treatment;
and Tribrissen at 12 mg/lb once daily throughout the course of treatment.  The
duration of therapy was for a minimum of ten days and a maximum of fourteen
days.<p>

A pre-treatment evaluation was conducted on day 0.  That included:  (1)
physical examination (with measurement of temperature); (2) documentation of
clinical signs; (3) blood hematology and chemistry; and (4) urinalysis, urine
culture and sensitivity.  Urine samples were always collected by cystocentesis.
An interim documentation of clinical signs and temperature measurement was
repeated on day 3 and day 7.  The post-treatment evaluation of day 13 or 17
included:  (1) temperature measurement; (2) documentation of clinical signs;
(3) blood hematology and chemistry; and (4) urinalysis and urine culture.<p>

Clinical efficacy was evaluated by the investigator and classified into one of
the following categories:  (1) excellent; (2) good; (3) fair; or (4) poor
(failure).<p>

All dogs entered into the study and administered the experimental or control
drug were evaluated for safety.  All investigators were instructed to report
any adverse reactions to the sponsor.  A total of 7 adverse reactions were
reported, 3 with Primor and 4 with Tribrissen.  There were also 10 cases with a
total of 16 notable changes in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, 7
with Primor and 9 with Tribrissen.<p>

<b>Overall Results </b><p>

This study was conducted as a multicentered trial involving nine
investigators.  There were 75 dogs with urinary tract infections that were
treated with either experimental or control drug and completed the study
protocol.<p>

<b>Bacteriological Results</b><p>
The 75 dogs with urinary tract infections that completed the
study protocol had a total of 76 bacterial isolates from the pre-treatment
culture. One dog was found to be infected with both<i> E. coli</i> &#160;and
<i>Proteus mirabilis</i>.  The number of cases infected with any particular
isolate are summarized in the following table.<p>

Of the 76 bacterial isolates, 43 were treated with Primor and 33 were treated
with Tribrissen.  Those treated with Primor had an overall elimination rate of
93% versus an overall elimination rate of 90% for Tribrissen treated isolates.
For <i>E. coli</i>, the most common isolate, the elimination rate with Primor
was 87% and with Tribrissen it was 86%.  The next most common isolate,
<i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, had elimination rates of 92% and 100% for Primor and
Tribrissen, respectively.  For <i>Staphylococcus</i> &#160;spp., the elimination
rates were 100% and 83% for Primor and Tribrissen respectively.  The
elimination rates for each of the isolates are outlined in the following
table.<p>

<b>Clinical Response Results</b><p>

At the end of therapy, the clinical investigator graded the
clinical response to treatment as excellent, good, fair or poor.  Excellent and
good ratings, which required no further antibiotic therapy, were considered a
positive response to therapy.  Fair and poor ratings, which required additional
antibiotic therapy, were considered a negative response to therapy.<p>

Of the 75 cases that completed the study protocol, 42 were treated with Primor
and 33 were treated with Tribrissen. One dog had both <i>E. coli</i> &#160;and
<i>Proteus mirabilis</i>.  The following table contains a summary of the

<b>Study Conclusions</b><p>

Based on the bacteriologic cure rates (comparison of pre- and
post-treatment bacterial culture), clinical cure rates, and low incidence of
reported adverse reactions, it can be concluded that Primor is safe and
efficacious for the treatment of canine urinary tract infections caused by
<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i> &#160;spp. (see Note *), and <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>.<p>

*Note = includes <i>S. aureus</i> &#160;and <i>S. intermedius</i>. End Note.<p>

<b>5. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>
    Cross reference  the existing FOI Summary for Primor Tablets (NADA
100-929).<p>

The original FOI summary contains a description of the safety study that was
conducted to support the approval of this product. The safety data include both
laboratory and clinical evaluations conducted in accordance with existing FDA
guidelines. Primor tablets will be used in the same species at the same dosage
as labeled in the original approval.   <p>


<b>6. HUMAN SAFETY</b><p>

    A.Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption<p>

        Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA.  This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only in dogs, which are non-food animals. <p>

B. Human Safety Considerations Other Than Food Safety</b><p>

        In regard to possession, handling, and administration, labeling contains the
statements:  "NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS - For Use In Dogs Only" and "KEEP OUT OF
REACH OF CHILDREN."<p>

<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

The data in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
The data demonstrate that Primor (sulfadimethoxine/ormetoprim),  when used under
the labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective.<p>

According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106), this
is a Category II change.  This supplement provides for the additional claim to
include the treatment of urinary tract infections in dogs.  The approval of
this change has no adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the new
animal drug.  Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the
safety and effectiveness  data in the parent application.  <p>

For this supplement, the drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian because professional expertise and proper diagnosis are
required to determine when a urinary tract infection is present and when
treatment is necessary.  <p>

Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, provides for a three year period of exclusivity for a
supplemental application which contains reports of new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of
the supplement and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  This supplemental
NADA qualifies for such an exclusivity period (new claim only), which will
expire three years from the date of approval.<p>

<b>Date Stamped:</b>  June 29, 1994 <p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b> <p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with lasalocid and
tylosin. Previous approvals have required a 48 hour pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with
these drugs. <p>
<b>II.    Indications for Use:</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for these combinations
which are: <p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate and lasalocid in combination is indicated
for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and suppression of
estrus (heat) in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. <p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination is
indicated for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency,
suppression of estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in
heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. <p>
<b>III.	Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b><p>
	<b>Dosage Form: </b>                       Feed <p>
<b>Route of Administration: </b>               Oral <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>	<b>Melengestrol acetate  </b> 	0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
<b>Lasalocid (as lasalocid sodium)  </b> 	100 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton 		air
dried complete feed).<br>	<b>Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate)  </b> 	90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
	complete feed) <p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 100 to 360 mg lasalocid per head per day either
with or without 90 mg tylosin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate
of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head. <p>
<b>IV.    Effectiveness </b><p>
This supplement does not affect the efficacy of these combinations. <p>
<b>V.    Animal Safety</b> <p>
This supplement does not affect the target animal safety of these
combinations. <p>
<b>VI.    Human Safety </b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b> <p>
<b>Melengestrol acetate</b><br>
 
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period. <p>

<b>Lasalocid</b><br>
 
In cattle parent lasalocid has been established as the marker residue for total
lasalocid sodium residues, liver was selected as the target tissue and 0.7 ppm
for parent lasalocid in liver was established as the tolerance (21 CFR
556.347). No pre-slaughter withdrawal period is required for cattle fed
lasalocid (21 CFR 558.311). <p>

<b>Tylosin</b><br>
 
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625). <p>

<b>2.	Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin.</b> <p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's
138-904 and 138-992, dated 30 April 1990; and NADA's 139-876 and 140-288, dated
16 December 1987; demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in
fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of the
supplemental application for MGA (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402) and that the
concentration of lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination,
each at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
drug withdrawal. This study is summarized below: <p>
Groups of heifers were fed for 90 days either no additive (control, n=14) or
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination at 1X (n=7), 3X
(n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive (lX = 0.5 mg
melengestrol acetate, 30 g lasalocid/ton air dried feed and 10 g tylosin/ton
air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero withdrawal. <p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the official AOAC method (JAOAC
59:507-515:1976). This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from the control heifers and 5 of 7 heifers in the 1X treatment group
had concentration of melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. Fat samples from the
remaining two heifers in the 1X group contained melengestrol acetate at 12.7
and 13.7 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat samples
from the 3X and 5X dose groups were 37.6 ppb (range 30.9 to 46.3 ppb) and 49.4
ppb (range 36.6 to 57.0 ppb), respectively. <p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of lasalocid and tylosin
residues. No residues of tylosin were detected in any of the samples. The limit
of detection for the assay utilized was 0.1 ppm. <p>
No lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from the control heifers.
Lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from each of the 7 heifers in the
1X group with a mean and standard deviation of 0.09 +/- 0.11 ppm. The highest
individual value was 0.26 ppm. All concentrations of lasalocid were well below
the tolerance limit of 0.7 ppm in liver. <p>
<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
These data demonstrate that following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin
and lasalocid in combination, the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat
is below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and residues of
lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances when
heifers are slaughtered without a pre-slaughter withdrawal. <p>
<b>3.	Assay noninterference </b><p>
Data included in previous Freedom of Information Summaries for these NADA's
have demonstrated; <p>
1)	the presence of lasalocid and tylosin does not interfere with 	the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<br>2)	presence of lasalocid and
melengestrol acetate does not 	interfere with the tissue residue assay for
tylosin; and  <p>
It has also been demonstrated that the presence of melengestrol acetate does
not interfere with the tissue residue assay for lasalocid (NADA 96-298; J.Agri.
Food Chem. 31:75-78:1983). <p>
<b>4.    Regulatory methods</b> <p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, Room 12A30). <p>
<b>5.	Conclusions </b><p>
This supplement provides for deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
pre-slaughter drug withdrawal period when melengestrol acetate and lasalocid are
fed in combination either with or without tylosin. No changes are made in
either the approved dosages of any of these drugs, the approved indications of
use or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the
conclusion that residues of melengestrol acetate in fat are below the
established tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered
without a pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin. Accordingly, approval of this
change in pre-slaughter withdrawal period from 48 hours to no withdrawal is not
expected to have adverse effects on public health or food safety. <p>
<b>VII.	Agency Conclusions</b> <p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with
lasalocid and tylosin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity
data for MGA contained in NADA's 034-254 and 039-402. <p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations. <p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<B>DIRECTIONS FOR USING 4% SAFE-GUARD PREMIX&#174; FOR PIGS, SOWS, GILTS AND BOARS:</B><P>
<b>Mixing directions:</b><p>
Thoroughly mix the contents of this bag with 1,995 pounds of feed ingredients
to make one ton of complete feed.  It is recommended that this package be
premixed with 45 pounds of fine group grain before combining with the remaining
1950 pounds of feed ingredient.  Mixing time should be sufficiently long to
insure complete mixing.<P>
<b>Feeding Directions:</b><p>
The resultant complete feed containing 45.3 mg fenbendazole/pound must be fed
as the sole ration for three (3) consecutive days at a rate of 1.5 pounds of
complete feed per 50 pound of body weight each day.<P>
No prior withdrawal of feed or water necessary.  When Safe-Guard&#174; containing
feed has been fed for 3 days and blended according to the above rates based on
pig weight and average daily feed consumption, a total intake of 4.08 mg
fenbendazole per pound of body weight is assured.  Safe-guard&#174; containing
swine feeds can be fed pelleted or as meal.  Safe-Guard&#174; can be fed to
pregnant sows. There is no withdrawal period for Safe-Guard&#174;.  It can be fed
to day of slaughter.<P>
<b>For feeding periods longer than 3 days (i.e., 6 days or 12 days):</b><P>
If a longer feeding period is desired, mix this five (5) pound bag with more
feed; for example, a six (6) day feeding period can be achieved by mixing this
bag into 3,995 pounds of complete swine feed and feeding at the same rate as
stated above (1.5 pounds of complete feed per 50 pounds of body weight each
day).  A twelve (12) day feeding period can be achieved by mixing this bag into
7995 pounds of complete swine feed and feeding at the same rate as stated above
(i.e., 1.5 lbs. of complete feed per 50 lbs. of body weight each day).<P>

* This reduced level of efficacy was thought to be resultant from 
one highly infected pig which may have been crowded away from feed 
by other pigs.  In other studies conducted using the 12-day treatment 
regimen against adult <i>T. suis,</i> efficacy ranged from 91-100% 
(see supplement to NADA 131-675 submitted 8/21/86, Vol. 2, 382, 452-453).

<b>Procedure:</b><p>
The 40 animals were selected from a local farmer after it was determined that
these pigs harbored a patent infection of<i>Trichuris suis</i>&#160; but were
otherwise clinically healthy.  Fecal worm egg counts were conducted prior to
purchase to determine the individual infection rate.  All animals were ear
tagged upon arrival and then were weighed, sexed and fecal sampled the
following day.  The animals were then randomly split into treatment groups
based on sex, weight and fecal worm (<i>T. suis </i>) egg counts.  A log of feed
consumption was recorded daily and all animals were also observed daily for
adverse reactions.  Animals were weighed again prior to necropsy.  Necropsy was
performed in replicate 6 and 7 days after the last treatment.  Equal numbers
from each group were necropsied each day.  The gastrointestinal tract and lungs
were opened and all worms present were counted according to accepted
parasitological techniques (described in Swine Anthelmintic Guidelines).
<i>Trichuris suis</i>&#160; were categorized as to larval stages according to the
parameters described by Beer (Parasitology, 67:  263-278, 1973).<P>

* This reduced level of efficacy was thought to be resultant from 
one highly infected pig which may have been crowded away from feed 
by other pigs.  In other studies conducted using the 12-day treatment 
regimen against adult <i>T. suis,</i> efficacy ranged from 91-100% 
(see Supplement to NADA 131-675 submitted 8/21/86, Vol. 2, pp. 382, 
452-453).
 
There were no adverse reactions in any of the pigs treated with 
fenbendazole during the course of this trial.

<b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
Fenbendazole, when fed to growing pigs over a 3-day, 6-day, or 12-day period
was safe and efficacious.  Fenbendazole had an efficacy (100%) against both
adult and larval stages of <i>Trichuris suis</i>&#160; and the 3-day and 6-day
treated groups.  The 12-day treatment was also effective against the larval
stages (98.7%) but this efficacy was somewhat reduced against adult stages of
<i>T. suis</i>&#160; (81.6%) although it was not determined whether these adult worms
developed from larval stages during  the trial period.  Also, this reduced
level of efficacy in the 12-day treatment 
regimen versus <i>Trichuris suis</i>&#160; was thought to be related to one highly
infected pig which may have gotten crowded away
from medicated feed by other pigs.<P>

<b>STUDY DESIGN<P>
Rationale:</b><p>
This study was designed to evaluate different larval stages of <i>Ascaris
suum</i>&#160; in the liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.  Pigs were inoculated
with 20,000 embryonated <i>Ascaris suum</i>&#160; eggs as per the schedule listed
below; they were then necropsied at either 5 or 14 days post inoculation which
enabled a means of evaluation efficacy against different larval stages in the
liver, lung and gastrointestinal tract.  Due to the large number of pigs used
in this study, the trial was conducted in two replicates.<P>

<b>Procedure:</b><p>
The 120 pigs were selected from a local farmer which raised all of their
litters on raised wire crates.  Animals were purchased, and delivered to the
research facility.  All animals were determined to be healthy upon arrival at
the research facility.  The animals were then randomly split into treatment
groups based on sex and weight.  A log of
feed consumption was recorded daily and all animals were also observed for any
adverse reactions to treatment. Animals were inoculated with 20,000 embryonated
<i>Ascaris</i>&#160; eggs on the day scheduled.  The inoculum was
previously tested for infectivity by infecting a test pig prior to trial
initiation. Animals were group weighed weekly to determine the amount of
Fenbendazole which was to be administered each week.  Animals were weighed
again prior to necropsy.  Necropsy was performed 5 and 14 days post inoculation
as listed in the trial design section.  The 
gastrointestinal tract was opened and all worms present were counted according
to accepted parasitological techniques (described in the Swine Anthelmintic
Guidelines).  The lungs (20%) were subject to the von Baermann's procedure and
all the <i>Ascaris</i>&#160; larvae present were recovered and counted.  The liver
was inspected and the number of spots in a 9 square centimeter area of the mid lobe as well
as the total number of spots present were counted and tabulated.<P>
<b>RESULTS AND SUMMARY TABLE</b><p>
All treated animals were group fed their medicated feeds according to their
respective treatment in order to duplicate normal field conditions.  Weight
gain and feed consumption data indicated that all medicated feeds were
uniformly consumed in the allotted time and that the pigs in each treatment
group were gaining weight at an acceptable rate.  Also, no adverse reactions
were noted in any of the treated groups.<P>

<b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
These data indicated that a total dose of 9 mg/kg body weight of Fenbendazole
when fed to growing pigs over a 3, 6 or 12-day period was efficacious in
reducing the <i>A. suum</i>&#160; L3 larvae reaching the lung or L4 larvae reaching
the small intestine following infection.  These data also indicated that
although Fenbendazole did not completely prevent liver damage of <i>A. suum</i>&#160;
larvae, these larvae were killed sometime before they reached the lung and
small intestine
parasite normal migration route) in all treatment groups.  The data also
further substantiated that fenbendazole is safe during the extended treatment
regimen.<P>
<b>Summary of Conclusions (both studies)</b><P>
Fenbendazole was supplied to the investigators as a 4% Type A Medicated Article
(premix).  The drug was administered in the feed.  These supplementary studies
involved a total of 160 treated swine while 30 swine served as controls.  The
results demonstrate that, in swine, fenbendazole at a total dose of 9 mg
fenbendazole/kg body weight and given over a period of 3-12 days is an
effective anthelmintic with a wide spectrum of activity.<P>
<b>Clinical Studies:</b><p>
No additional clinical studies were needed for this supplemental filing.
Clinical studies were documented in the original approval of the NADA 131-675
see 21 CFR 558.258 (49 F.R., p. 3846, Jan. 31, 1984).<P>
<b>5. Target Animal Safety (TAS):</b><P>
No additional target animal safety studies were needed for this supplemental
filing. TAS studies were documented in the original approval of the NADA
131-675 see 21 CFR 558.258 (49 F.R., p. 3846, Jan. 31, 1984).<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>
No additional human safety studies were needed for this supplemental filing.
Human safety studies wee documented in the original approval of the NADA
131-675 see 21CFR 558.258 (49 F.R., p. 3846, Jan. 31, 1984).<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that fenbendazole 4% and
20% premixes (Type A medicated Articles) when used under their proposed
conditions of use, are safe and effective.<P>
These additional data from two controlled critical studies conducted by one
investigator at one location demonstrate the effectiveness of fenbendazole for
its labeled indications in swine feeds when fed at 9 mg/kg body weight over a
period of 3-12 days.  These additional studies demonstrate the efficacy of a
3-12 day treatment for removal of larvae (L3, L4 stages - liver, lung,
intestinal forms) of the large roundworm (<i>Ascaris suum </i>) and larvae (L2,
L3, L4 stages - of intestinal mucosal forms) of the whipworm (<i>Trichuris
suis </i>).<P>
Fenbendazole product for use in food producing animals are generally over the
counter products.  Accurate diagnosis can be made with reasonable degree of
certainty by the layman.  Adequate directions for use have been written for the
layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on labeling are likely to be
followed in practice.  Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has
concluded that this product remain under over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this approval qualifies for three (3) years of
marketing exclusivity of the new claim and field trial data were required for
the approval.<P>
According to the Center's approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is a Category II
change.  The supplement provides for an extended treatment regimen for
treatment of certain worms in swine.  The drug was previously approved for the
same extended treatment regimen for other species and stages of worms in swine.
Accordingly, these changes pose no increased
human risk from exposure to residues of the animal drug, nor does it change the
conditions of the drug's safe use in the target animal species. The supplement,
accordingly, is approved without reevaluation of the underlying human safety
and effectiveness data contained in the parent application.<P>

<B>IV. Effectiveness:</B><p>

Efficacy of Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel)     Broad
Spectrum Anthelmintic Tablets [59 FR 33908, July 1, 1994]  against  <i>E.
multilocularis</i> in dogs is based on the scientific data described in the
Freedom of Information (FOI) Summary for Droncit (praziquantel).  Tablets [NADA
111-798, 58 FR 42852-3, Aug. 12, 1993].<p>

<i> Echinococcus granulosus</i> and<i> Echinococcus multilocularis </i>are
classified  in the same genus.   The laboratory data described in the FOI
Summary of NADA 111-798 indicate that Droncit (praziquantel) Tablets [NADA
111-798, 58 FR 42852-3, Aug. 12, 1993] is 100% efficacious  against both<i> E.
granulosus</i> and <i>E. multilocularis. </i>  The FOI Summary for  the
three-way combination Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel)
Broad Spectrum Anthelmintic Tablets (59 FR 33908, July 1, 1994] states that
neither pyrantel nor febantel interfered with the activity of praziquantel
against<i> E. granulosus.</i><p>

Since<i> E. granulosus and E. multilocularis</i> are classified in the
same    genus, Droncit (praziquantel) Tablets  [NADA 111-798, 58 FR 42852-3,
Aug. 12, 1993] demonstrated 100% efficacy against both E. granulosus    and E.
multilocularis in laboratory studies, and no interference was demonstrated in
the three-way combination product, it is concluded that praziquantel in
Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel) Broad Spectrum
Anthelmintic Tablet is as   efficacious as the Droncit (praziquantel) Tablet
against <i>E.  multilocularis.</i><p>

<B>V. Animal Safety:</B><p>

Animal safety is cross referenced to the existing, orginal Freedom of
Information Summary for Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel) Broad Spectrum Anthelmintic Tablets (59 FR 33908, July 1, 1994] .  The original FOI Summary describes the safety studies  that were conducted to support the approval of this product.<p>

<B>VI. Human Safety:</B><p>

    Human safety is cross referenced to the existing, original Freedom of
Information Summary for Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel) Broad Spectrum Anthelmintic Tablets (59 FR 33908, July 1,1994].<p>

<B>VII. Agency Conclusions:</B><p>

The data in support of this supplemental New Animal Drug Application complies
with the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the
implementing regulations.  When used under the labeled  conditions of use, the
data demonstrates that Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel)
Broad Spectrum  Anthelmintic Tablets (59 FR 33908, July 1, 1994] are safe and
effective in the treatment of dogs with <i>Echinococcus multilocularis.</i><p>

Since the approval of this supplement utilized studies conducted with another formulation of praziquantel [Droncit (praziquantel) Tablets, NADA 111-798, 58 FR 42852-3, Aug. 12, 1993], the addition <i>of E. multilocularis</i> as a claim on the label does not extend the original
exclusivity period for Drontal(TM) Plus (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel)
Broad Spectrum Anthlmintic Tablets which began  May 19, 1994 (59 FR 33908, July 1, 1994].<p>

<b>Generic Name:</b> Febantel and Praziquantel<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b> Vercom Paste Anthelmintic<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Rx<p>
<b>Date Stamped:</b>  September 12, 1991<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
This supplement provides for the addition of the following warning statement to 
the label:<p>
"Warning: Consider alternative therapy or use with caution in animals with
pre-existing liver or kidney dysfunction."<p> The addition of this warning is
based on data gathered during the safety evaluation of febantel alone for Rintal
Tabs, NADA 140-912. A summary of this data can be found in the FOI for that
product under the heading, <i>General Safety Evaluation</i>&#160; (General Safety
Evaluation for the Use of Febantel Tablets in Cats). It was shown in this study,
that, at elevated doses, toxicity may be increased in the animal already
compromised by hepatic or renal disease.<p> <b>2. Indications for Use:</b>
<P>Vercom Paste Anthelmintic is indicated for the removal of the following
nematode parasites (these are unchanged by this supplement):<P><b>In Dogs and
Puppies:</b><P>Hookworms (<i>Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria
stenocephala</i>)<br> Ascarids (<i>Toxocara canis, Toxocara leonina</i>)<br>
Whipworms (<i>Trichuris vulpis</i>)<br> Tapeworms (<i>Dipylidium caninum and

(<i>Ancylostoma tubaeforme</i>)<br> Ascarids (<i>Toxocara cati</i>)<br> Tapeworms
(<i>Dipylidium caninum and Taenia taeniaeformis</i>)<P>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route
of Administration and Recommended Dosages:<P>Dosage Form:</b> Paste<P>
<b>Route of Administration:</b><p> Oral; directly into the mouth or, for mature animals, mixed with
food and fed to the animal.<P>
<b>Recommended Dosages:</b><P>
Dogs and Cats:<p> 1 g/7.5 lb
body weight (BW) given to mature dogs and cats (10 mg febantel and 1.0 mg
praziquantel/kg BW) given daily for 3 consecutive days.<P>Puppies and Kittens
younger than 6 mo. of age:<p> 1 g/5 lb BW (15 mg febantel and 1.5 mg praziquantel/kg
BW) given on a full stomach daily for 3 consecutive days.<P><b>4.
Effectiveness</b><P>Well-controlled critical anthelmintic studies (which involved
the sacrificing of animals and examination to determine the number of parasites
in the intestinal tract) were conducted to establish and confirm the minimum
effective dose of Vercom paste. These studies are included in the original FOI
Summary for Vercom Paste, NADA 133-953 (50 FR 19167). Additional data were
collected and a supplement was approved extending the parasite spectrum for which
the drug is approved, and this FOI summary is also available (53 FR
48533).<P><b>5. Animal Safety</b><P>This supplement provides for the addition of
the following warning statement to the label, "Warning: Consider alternative
therapy or use with caution in animals with pre-existing liver or kidney
dysfunction."<P>The addition of this warning is based on data gathered during the
safety evaluation of febantel alone for Rintal Tabs, NADA 140-912. A summary of
this data can be found in the F.O.I. for that product under the heading,
<i>General Safety Evaluation</i>&#160; (General Safety Evaluation for the Use of
Febantel Tablets in Cats). It was shown in this study, that, at elevated doses,
toxicity may be increased in the animal already compromised by hepatic or renal
disease.<P><b>6. Human Safety</b><P>a. Human Food Safety<P>Data on human safety,
pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were not required for
approval of NADA. The drug (febantel and praziquantel) is labeled for use in dogs
and cats only.<P>b. Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration<P>
Laboratory animal toxicity studies verify the lack of potential hazards to human
handling of the formulation. The label states: Keep out of reach of children.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b><P>Under the Center's supplemental approval policy
(55 FR 46045), published November 1, 1990, this is a Category II change because
it provides solely for the addition of a user warning statement. The approval of
this supplemental application has no adverse effect on the safety and
effectiveness of this new animal drug. Accordingly, this approval did not require
a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.
Safety is enhanced by the addition of the following labeling
statement:<P>"Warning: Consider alternative therapy or use with caution in
animals with pre-existing liver or kidney dysfunction."<P>Under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.
360b(c)(2)(F), this approval does not qualify for any term of marketing
exclusivity because no new clinical or field investigations conducted by the
sponsor were essential to the approval of this supplemental NADA.<P>The expertise
of a trained professional is required for a definitive diagnosis, to monitor the
results of treatment, and determine the occurrence of adverse effects; therefore,
the drug is a prescription product.<P> <b>8. Labeling</b><P> 1. Unit Label 4.8 g Syringe<br>

<b> IV. EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>
<b>A.    Pivotal Studies Summary (2) :</b><p>  Two separate clinical studies
were conducted which demonstrate that ceftiofur sodium is effective as therapy
for acute bovine interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot, pododermatitis).<P>
    Ceftiofur sodium at the dosage range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb BW
administered intramuscularly at 24-h intervals for 3 to 5 days is approved for
the treatment of bovine respiratory disease.  The foot rot dose-finding study
evaluated both the 0.5 and 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb BW dosage regimes.  Since both
regimes were equally effective during the dose finding evaluation, the lower
dosage regime (0.5 mg of ceftiofur/lb BW) was evaluated during the dose
confirmation study.  The lower ceftiofur dosage regime was effective therapy
during the dose confirmation study (0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb BW); therefore, a
dosage range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb BW is indicated for therapy of acute
bovine interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot, pododermatitis).<P>
     <b>Pivotal Dose Determination Study Summary :</b><p> Thirty-nine yearling beef
cattle were evaluated during an induced acute foot rot dose determination model
study.  <i>Fusobacterium necrophorum</i>&#160; and <i>Bacteroides
melaninogenicus </i>, two bacteria associated with foot rot lesions, were used
to induce foot rot in 3 feet of each study animal.  Each animal was randomly
assigned to one of 3 treatments:  placebo (5 mL sterile water daily for 3
days), or 0.5 or 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb BW for 3 days.  All treatments were
administered intramuscularly.  Both ceftiofur treatments were more effective
than placebo for treating foot rot (P &lt;  0.001).<P>
    Based on these data, the treatment regime of 0.5 mg of ceftiofur per pound
body weight administered intramuscularly at 24-h intervals for 3 consecutive
days was evaluated for treatment of naturally occurring foot rot during a
pivotal dose confirmation field study.<P>

    <b> Pivotal Dose Confirmation Study Summary:</b><p>   Eighty-eight cattle
(47 beef, 41 lactating cows) from 11 different locations were used in a
pivotal dose confirmation trial.  Animals were randomly assigned to either
placebo or 0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb BW for 3 days.  Prior to the first treatment,
foot rot lesions were sampled from 33 cattle at 5 locations (4 feedlots, 1
dairy).  These samples were cultured and anaerobic bacteria isolated.
Twenty-eight <i>B. melaninogenicus</i>&#160;  isolates and 21 <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160;
isolates were obtained from the lesions of 33 cattle.  Both <i>B.
melaninogenicus</i>&#160;  and <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160; were isolated from 61&#37; (20/33)
of the lesions.<P>
    These clinical data support the effectiveness of 0.5 mg of ceftiofur/lb BW
administered intramuscularly once daily for 3 consecutive days for the
treatment of bovine foot rot.<P>

<li>iii.    Controls:  A placebo (sterile water) contemporary control group was
included in the study.<P>
<li>iv. Diagnosis:  To induce foot rot, the animals were challenged with an
inoculum of <i>F.  necrophorum</i>&#160; and <i>B. melaninogenicus </i>&#160;in the
interdigital space of three feet.  Animals were scored daily by the study
veterinarian for clinical signs of lameness and extent of interdigital swelling
and lesion size. The animals began to exhibit lameness 2 days
post-challenge.  Animals were randomly administered treatments by the drug
administrator at the first sign of lameness.<P>
<li>v.  Dosage Form:  Ceftiofur sterile powder reconstituted to sterile solution by
addition of sterile water for injection. Each mL of resulting solution
contained ceftiofur sodium equivalent to 50 mg ceftiofur.<P>
<li>vi. Route of Administration:  Intramuscularly.<P>
<li>vii.    Doses:  Five (5) mL sterile water (placebo); 0.5 and 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb
BW at 24-h intervals for 3 consecutive days.<P>
<li>viii.   Test Duration:  Animals were monitored for 10 days after initial
treatment by the study veterinarian.<P>
<li>ix. Pertinent Parameters Measured:  The study was conducted according to a
blinded, parallel group design.  The lesions were evaluated and scored by the
study veterinarian on Day 2 postchallenge and on post-treatment Days 3, 7 and
10. Lesions were scored using a  0-5 scoring system (0 &#61;no lesion to 5 &#61;most
severe).  In addition, the animals were evaluated by the study veterinarian for
lameness on post-treatment Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10.  Lameness was scored
using a  0-3 scoring system (0 &#61;normal gait to 3 &#61;severe lameness).  The lesion
and lameness scores were added together to obtain a numerical value for data
analysis.</ul><p> 
<li> d. Post-treatment Microbiology:  On Day 3 post-treatment,
<i>F. necrophorum,</i>&#160; was isolated from all 12 lesions cultured from the
placebo group, but in only 3 of 8 ceftiofur treated cattle.  On post-treatment
Day 7, <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160; was isolated from 9 of 9 placebo cattle but only 1
of 4 treated cattle.  This indicates that ceftiofur was eliminating the <i>F.
necrophorum</i>&#160; in the majority of the cattle treated.
<i>B. melaninogenicus</i>&#160; was isolated from all lesions cultured.  This
was not unexpected since <i>B. melaninogenicus</i>&#160; is commonly present in the
feces and the lesions in the feet were constantly being recontaminated by the
feces.  Ceftiofur minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) data had previously
determined that <i>F. necrophorum </i>&#160;is susceptible to ceftiofur (MIC range of
0.016 to 0.062 &#181;g/mL).<P>
<li>e.  Statistical Analysis:  Within treatment group, the mean scores for lameness
and lesions for all affected feet were added to obtain a numerical score.  The
statistical analysis was based on the changes in these combined lameness and
lesion scores observed for each individual animal during the pre-treatment,
treatment and observations periods.<P>
    The lameness, lesion and combined lameness and lesion scores were averaged for
each day for each animal. The mean total scores and the mean foot scores for
each treatment group were examined.  Differences among treatments were tested
using the GLM procedure of SAS and tested at  alpha   &#61; 0.05.<P>
<li>f.  Results:  Combined mean lesion and lameness scores at post-treatment Days 0,
3, 7 and 10 are shown in Table 4.2.<p>

<li> g. Decision Criteria:  Ceftiofur at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/lb BW was effective for the
therapy of acute bovine foot rot if the reduction in the summed lameness and
lesion scores from Day 0 to Day 3 or 7 was significantly greater than the
reduction seen for the placebo group.<P>
    If both ceftiofur dosage regimens were determined to be significantly better
than the placebo control group, the lower ceftiofur dosage regimen would be
considered the effective regimen and evaluated further in a pivotal dose
confirmation study with naturally occurring bovine foot rot.<P>

<li>h.  Conclusions:  Both 0.5 and 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb BW administered
intramuscularly at 24-h intervals for  3 consecutive days were more
effective than placebo (P &lt; 0.0001) in reducing the severity of
lesions and lameness of bovine foot rot.  The 0.5 and 1.0 mg of ceftiofur/lb BW
regimens were not significantly different (alpha  &#61; 0.05) from each other.<P>

A relapse was defined as a reoccurrence of foot rot in the same foot within 15
days after initial therapy.  One ceftiofur treated beef animal relapsed on Day
14 after initiation of therapy and was not included as a cure.<P>
     Microbiology Results :  Prior to administration of therapy,  samples
from foot rot lesions from cattle at 5 locations (4 feedlots, 1 dairy)
were cultured and anaerobic bacteria isolated.  Twenty-eight (28)  <i>B.
melaninogenicus</i>&#160;  and 21 <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160; were isolated from the

were isolated from 61&#37; (20/33) of the lesions.<P>
<li>e.  Statistical Analysis:  The primary parameter used to determine the
effectiveness of ceftiofur sodium was the overall Day 4 and Day 7 clinical
evaluation performed by a veterinarian.  A cure was defined as a reduction in
lameness score by 2 points with none to moderate swelling and healed or healing
lesions.  Percent cure was calculated as number of animals evaluated as
cured/total animals evaluated.  Percent cure for each treatment group for each
investigator was calculated, and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey double
arcsine transformation (Freeman and Tukey, 1950) to satisfy the assumptions of
the analysis of variance.  The difference between the transformed cure rates
was tested for significance at 0.05 (one-sided) using the GLM procedure of SAS

    The mean cure rate for animals treated with ceftiofur was
significantly greater (P &lt; 0.003) than for animals treated with sterile
water.  This difference was consistent for both beef and dairy cattle (i.e.
there was no significant (P  &#61; 0.07) Type x Treatment interaction).
Mean cure rates did not differ significantly (P &#61; 0.33) between the two types

<b>B.   Overall Conclusions : </b><P> Data from the pivotal dose determination and
pivotal dose confirmation field study determined that both  0.5 mg and 1.0
mg ceftiofur/lb BW dosage regimes to be effective as therapy for acute bovine
foot rot.  Acute bovine foot lesions may vary in degree of severity from
moderate to quite severe.  Therefore, depending on the severity of the foot rot
lesion, a ceftiofur dosage range identical to the dosage range approved for
bovine respiratory disease (0.5 to 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb BW) is indicated as
follows:<ul><P>
<li>INDICATIONS FOR USE:  NAXCEL&#174;     Sterile Powder (ceftiofur as

<li>RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:  NAXCEL&#174;     Sterile Solution (ceftiofur as
ceftiofur sodium) is to be administered to cattle at the dosage range of 0.5 to
1.0 mg ceftiofur /lb BW (1 to 2 mL reconstituted sterile solution per 100 lb
BW).  Treatment should be repeated every 24 hours for a total of three
treatments.  Additional treatments may be given on Days 4 and 5 for animals
which do not show a satisfactory response (not recovered) after the first three
treatments.</ul><P>
<b>C.   Corroborative Studies (6) :</b><P>  Two laboratory studies (one <i>in
vitro</i>&#160;, one <i>in vivo </i>) were conducted with ceftiofur for diseases
caused by or associated with <i>F. necrophorum </i>.  <P>
    One preliminary induced foot rot model study and three clinical efficacy
studies were conducted.  The data from these studies confirmed that ceftiofur
administered intramuscularly once daily at 0.5 mg/lb BW for  3 consecutive
days was effective therapy for acute bovine foot rot associated with <i>F.
necrophorum</i>&#160; and <i>B. melaninogenicus </i>.<P>
 <b>Laboratory Studies :</b><P>
<i>In vitro</i>&#160;  evaluation of ceftiofur sodium against <i>F. necrophorum </i>: 
Ceftiofur sodium was evaluated <i>in vitro</i>&#160; against <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160;
from bovine liver abscesses and foot rot and was highly active (MIC &#190; 0.25
&#181;g/mL) against <i>F. necrophorum </i>.  The results of the <i>in vitro</i>&#160;
testing suggested that ceftiofur might be useful in treatment of certain
anaerobic infections of domestic animals.  In addition, the effectiveness of
ceftiofur sodium was evaluated in a <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160; mouse disease model.
Ceftiofur was deemed effective <i>in vivo </i>, producing an ED50 value of
4.4&#177;1.3 mg/kg.  <P>
<b> Clinical Effectiveness Studies :</b><P>
<b>1.  Efficacy of ceftiofur sodium as therapy for experimentally induced bacterial
foot rot:</b>  The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate the efficacy
of 0.5 and 1.0 mg of ceftiofur sodium/lb BW administered IM once daily for 3
consecutive days for treatment of acute bacterial foot rot in cattle when
compared to placebo controls.  An established model that produces lesions
virtually identical to naturally occurring acute foot rot was utilized for this
study.  The animals were challenged with an inoculum of <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160;
and <i>B. </i> <i>melaninogenicus</i>&#160; in the interdigital space of 3 feet to
induce foot rot.  The lesions were individually evaluated and scored on Day 3
postchallenge and on post-treatment Days 3, 7 and 14.  Lesions were scored
using a pre-established 0-5 scoring system (0 &#61;no lesion to 5 &#61;most severe).  In
addition, the animals were evaluated for lameness on post-treatment Days 1, 2,
3, 7 and 14.  Lameness was scored using a pre-established 0-2 scoring system
(0 &#61;normal gait to 2 &#61;severe lameness).  The animals were evaluated by two
veterinarians who worked independently and who were blinded to treatments.  The
lesion and lameness scores were added to obtain a combined score, which was
used for data analysis and as the basis for evaluation of efficacy.
Twenty-five (25) head of yearling cattle were acclimated for at least
21 days prior to challenge.  Bacteriologic culturing for <i>F.
necrophorum</i>&#160; and <i>B. melaninogenicus</i>&#160; was conducted on 18 selected
lesions from 18 cattle prior to treatment to confirm the presence of the
infectious agents.  All lesions were culturally positive for both <i>F.
necrophorum</i>&#160; and <i>B. melaninogenicus </i>.  All treatments were
administered by intramuscular injection.  The treatment groups were as
follows:<P>
   <b> Group A (8 cattle):</b><br> Treated with ceftiofur as ceftiofur sodium at  0.5
mg/lb BW once daily for 3 days.<P>
    <b>Group B (9 cattle):</b><br> Treated with ceftiofur as ceftiofur sodium at  1.0
mg/lb BW once daily for 3 days.<P>
    <b>Group A (8 cattle):</b><br> Treated with placebo, 5 mL sterile water per animal,
intramuscularly once daily for 3 days.<P>
    No statistically significant differences ( alpha  &#61; 0.05) were detected
among the 3 treatment groups.  A trend for greater clinical improvement was
observed for the 2 groups administered the ceftiofur treatment regimens.
During this initial study, all animals were treated on Day 3 post-challenge
resulting in some animals progressing to the advance stages of foot rot which
did not respond well to treatment.  Based on the information provided by these
preliminary data, it was recommended that future protocols using this model be
designed so the treatments are administered as animals exhibit signs of
lameness in even one foot.  This is consistent with the treatment of foot rot
by the practicing veterinarian. <P>
    Ceftiofur MIC were determined for the <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160; isolate used in
this study and for 37 other isolates of cattle origin.  MIC for all isolates
were 0.016 to 0.062 &#181;g/mL.  These data indicate that <i>F. necrophorum</i>&#160; is
quite susceptible to ceftiofur.<P>
<b>2.  Efficacy of ceftiofur sodium for the treatment of acute foot rot in cattle:</b>
The objective of the study was to evaluate ceftiofur sodium administered
intramuscularly at 1.0 mg ceftiofur/kg BW (0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb) for 3
consecutive days as treatment for acute naturally acquired bovine foot rot.
The study was conducted in Cheshire, United Kingdom.  Forty-three lactating
dairy cows ranging in weight from 350 to 798 kg with acute bovine foot rot were
treated intramuscularly with 1.0 mg ceftiofur/kg BW (0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb) at 24
hour intervals for 3 consecutive days.  Local treatments, paring and
bandaging were not administered to animals in this study.  The study
veterinarian evaluated the cows 1 and 4 days after the last treatment.
Clinical efficacy was defined as the number of animals treated that were free
of lameness on Day 7.  Cows not improved by Day 4, and all animals that were
not completely free of lameness on Day 7 were treatment failures.  No untreated
control groups or positive control groups were included in this study.  One
animal was excluded from the study.  The observed cure rate was 31 of 42 cases
or 73.8 &#37;.  Under the conditions of this study, ceftiofur sodium at a dose of 1
mg ceftiofur/kg BW (0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb) administered intramuscularly at
24-hour intervals for 3 consecutive days is an effective treatment for acute
bovine foot rot (interdigital necrobacillosis).<P>
<b>3.  Efficacy of ceftiofur sodium as therapy of foot rot in lactating dairy cows:</b>
The objective of this field experience report study was to determine if
ceftiofur sodium was efficacious as therapy for acute foot rot in lactating
dairy cows.  Thirty-eight lactating dairy cows from eight farms in three
regions of Chile with moderate to severe foot rot, were utilized in this study.
Each animal was treated with ceftiofur sodium by intramuscular injection at a
dose of 1 mg ceftiofur/kg BW (0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb) daily for 3 consecutive
days.  Treatment effects were scored at 3 and 7 days after the last injection.
The results demonstrated that 35/38 animals (92 &#37;) recovered completely within
10 days of the last treatment.  It was concluded that ceftiofur is highly
effective for the treatment of bovine foot rot.<P>
<b>4.  Efficacy of ceftiofur sodium as therapy for acute foot rot in French
lactating dairy cattle:</b>  The purpose of this field experience study was to
evaluate ceftiofur sodium for the treatment of acute bovine foot rot in the
Bretagne region of France. Lactating dairy cattle with acute foot rot of not
more than 3 days duration were enrolled in the study.  On Day 1, the
degree of lameness, amount of edema and extent of necrotic lesions, were scored
by the veterinarians.  If inclusion criteria were met, animals were treated by
intramuscular injection of ceftiofur sodium at a dose of 1 mg ceftiofur/kg BW
(0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb) given at 24-hour intervals for  3 days.  No additional
local or general treatment was administered.  The response to therapy was
evaluated Day 4 (the day after the last treatment).  Lameness, edema and
necrotic lesions were scored again on Day 4 as on Day 1, and the treatment was
judged to be very efficacious, efficacious or ineffective.  A total of 27 cows
met the inclusion criteria for the study.  The ceftiofur treatment regime was
found to be very efficacious in 13/27 (48 &#37;), efficacious in 9/27 (33.5 &#37;) and
ineffective in 5/27 (18.5 &#37;) of the animals.  No relapses were reported.  Under
the conditions of this study, ceftiofur sodium at a dose of 1 mg ceftiofur/kg
(0.5 mg ceftiofur/lb) administered intramuscularly once daily for 3 consecutive
days was effective for the treatment of bovine foot rot.<P>
<b> V.  ANIMAL SAFETY</b><P>
        Target animal safety is addressed in the FOI summary dated January 25,
1988.<P>
<b> VI. HUMAN SAFETY</b><P>
<b> A.   Toxicity Tests:</b> <P> Toxicity studies are addressed in the FOI summary
dated January 25, 1988.  These include mutagenicity, oral feeding and
hypersensitivity potential studies. <P>
    The lowest no-observed-effect-level from the oral feeding studies was 30 mg
ceftiofur per kg body weight.<P>
<b>B.  Safe Concentrations of Total Residues:</b><P> The safe concentrations for total
residues of ceftiofur in tissues were addressed in the FOI summaries dated
January 25, 1988, and March 21, 1991.<P>
<b>C.  Total Residue and Metabolism Studies:</b><P>  These data are addressed in the FOI
summary dated March 21, 1991.<P>
<b>D.  Comparative Metabolism Study Results:</b><P>  These data are addressed in the FOI
summary dated March 21, 1991.<P>
<b>E.  Tolerance for the Marker Residue:</b><P>  These data are addressed in FOI summary
dated March 21, 1991.<P>
<b>F.  Study Establishing Withdrawal Period:</b><P>  No milk discard time or preslaughter
holding period is required because observed total residues of ceftiofur are
well below the calculated safe concentrations.  These data are addressed in FOI
summaries dated January 25, 1988, and March 21, 1991.<P>
<b>G.  Regulatory Method:</b>   A regulatory method is not required.<P>

<b> VII.    AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and  21 CFR
514.11 of the implementing regulations.  The data demonstrate that
NAXCEL&#174;     Sterile Powder (ceftiofur sodium), when used under
labeled conditions of use is safe and effective for the treatment of acute
bovine interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot, pododermatitis) associated with
<i>Fusobacterium necrophorum</i>&#160; and <i>Bacteroides melaninogenicus </i>.<P>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy,  21 CFR
514.106(b)(2)(v), this is a Category II change.  This supplement provides for
the use of ceftiofur sodium in cattle for a new indication.  The approval of
this change is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or
effectiveness of this new animal drug.  Accordingly, this approval did not
require a reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent
application.<P>
Both clinical efficacy and <i>in vitro</i>&#160; bacterial susceptibility data were
utilized to support the effectiveness of ceftiofur sodium at the dosage range
of 0.5 to 1.0 mg ceftiofur/lb body weight administered intramuscularly once
every 24 hours for 3 to 5 days for the treatment of bovine foot rot.  The
recommended dosage range (0.5 to 1.0 mg/lb) gives the practitioner greater
flexibility of using the drug based on his/her clinical judgment.<P>
The product remains a prescription drug for safe and effective use by a
veterinarian in the treatment of properly diagnosed foot rot in cattle.<P>
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment.  The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI)
and the evidence supporting that finding are contained in an environmental
assessment, which may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Park
Building (Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Maryland  20855.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity beginning on
the date of approval because the application contains reports of new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and, in
the case of food producing animals, human food safety studies (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>
<b> VIII.   APPROVED PRODUCT LABELING</b><P>
<b></b>Since addition of this new
indication requires no revisions to the approved NAXCEL&#174;     Sterile
Powder bottle, packer and shipper labeling, these labeling pieces are not being
included in this supplemental application.<P>

<b>A.   Endoparasites (Nematodes)-Dose Confirmation</b><p>
Study ASR 14160 was conducted in the United States to confirm that IVOMEC
Premix is effective against nematodes in adult pigs when administered at 0.1
mg/kg bodyweight daily for 7 consecutive days.  Twelve adult swine with natural
infections were divided into two groups of six each.  One group was not
treated; the other group received ivermectin in the feed at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 7
consecutive days.  The animals were necropsied 7 days following the termination
of the 7-day treatment period and the reductions in the numbers of nematodes
are summarized below.  The medicated feed was readily consumed.  No adverse
reactions were observed.<p>

IVOMEC Premix against <i>Sarcoptes scabiei </i>&#160;var. <i>suis </i>in adult swine
when administered at 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight daily for 7 consecutive days.
Fourteen adult swine with natural infestations of sarcoptic mange mites were
divided into two groups of seven each.  One group was not treated and the other
received ivermectin in the feed at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days.  The
animals were housed individually in solid wall pens.  Mites from preselected
locations were counted on Days -3, 14, 28 and 42 of the study.  No living mites
were found on any of the ivermectin treated pigs after the Day -3 count.  The
medicated feed was readily consumed.  No adverse reactions were observed during
the study.<p>

<b>5.   Target Animal Safety</b><p>
<b>A.   Boar Reproductive Safety</b><P>
Study ASR 14075 was conducted in the United States to assess the safety of
IVOMEC Premix for adult breeding boars when included in the ration at a dose of
0.3 mg/kg/day (3X the recommended use level) for 7 consecutive days.  Twenty
adult boars selected on the basis of successful test mating and breeding
soundness evaluation were used.  They were ranked by testicle size and age into
two age groups, penned individually and assigned to replicates of two animals
each.  Within each replicate, the boars were allocated randomly to a
non-medicated treatment group or a medicated treatment group to begin treatment
on Day 0.<p>
Semen was collected from each boar on Days -22 or -21, -14, -7 and 0 as part of
the breeding soundness evaluation and then on Day 7 and weekly to Day 56 to
determine any effects of the 7-day ivermectin treatment.  The semen evaluations
included measurements of volume, color, sperm concentration, percent
progressively motile sperm, total sperm ejaculated, and sperm morphology.
Testicular size was also measured at each semen evaluation.<p>
Following treatment, there were no overall treatment differences or treatment
by day interactions between the treated and control groups for testicular size,
total number of sperm per ejaculate, or percentage of sperm with proximal
droplets, abnormal heads, or abnormal midpieces.  Other categories of sperm
abnormalities (abnormal acrosomes, detached heads, coiled tails) were observed
relatively infrequently and appeared to occur at a similar rate in the treated
and control groups.  Weight gain of the control boars from Day -1 to 7 was not
significantly different from that of the treated boars.  Percentage of normal
sperm in the control group in the post-treatment period ranged from 91.5 to
96.1&#37;.   For the treated group post-treatment, the range was 92.8 to 94.7&#37;.<p>
No adverse treatment effects were exhibited on spermatogenesis or libido in
boars receiving a 3X dose of ivermectin in the feed for 7 days.<p>

<b>B.   Sow Reproductive Safety</b><p>
Study ASR 14074 was conducted in the United States to assess the safety of the
IVOMEC Premix for adult female breeding swine in all phases of reproduction.
One hundred fifty non-pregnant lactating females (1 to 4 years of age with
proven breeding histories) were used in the study.  Twelve boars with proven
breeding histories were used for breeding by artificial insemination.  There
were two groups, an untreated control receiving unmedicated feed (Group 1) and
an ivermectin-treated group (Group 2). The treated group received ivermectin at
0.3 mg/kg bodyweight/day in the feed for 7 days, four times with a four week
interval between dosing periods, under five schedules which started in the
premating period and ended in the late fetal development period as follows.<p>

 The
study was conducted in five consecutive phases with 30 sows per phase. In each
phase, 15 replicates of two sows were formed based on parity (1, 2, 3, or 4&#43;)
and initial weight. There were 3 sows assigned to each treatment schedule in
each of the 5 phases for a total of 15 sows per treatment schedule.  Day 0 was
the first day of the trial for each phase.  All sows of each phase had farrowed
a previous litter within 1 to 16 days prior to Day 0 for that phase.  For
estrus synchronization, the piglets of the previous litter were all weaned on
Day 32.  Sows were checked for estrus once daily and observations recorded.
Breeding was by artificial insemination.  Each sow was inseminated with semen
from the same boar on the first, second, and third day of estrus, and both sows
in the same replicate were bred to the same boar.  The semen was evaluated for
motility, color and physical condition prior to use.  Observation for estrus
continued for a period of 31 to 32 days following weaning.  Within this
interval, if a sow returned to estrus after being bred once, she was rebred
with semen from the same boar.  Those sows not observed in estrus during the 31
to 32 days following weaning were not bred.<p>
Primary parameters of interest were number of pigs born per litter, number of
live pigs born per litter, proportion of dead pigs born per litter, proportion
of pigs with abnormalities per litter, average birth weight of live pigs, and
weight gain from birth to weaning.  Estrus rate, conception rate and farrowing
rate were evaluated.<p>
Following treatment, the percent of sows exhibiting estrus of all sows
available 
for breeding (estrus rate) for the control sows was 96&#37; and for the treated
sows 93&#37;.  The percent of sows that were bred and diagnosed pregnant
(conception rate) for the control sows was 93&#37; and for the treated sows 90&#37;.
The percent of sows that farrowed of those bred for the control sows was 93&#37;
and for the treated sows 86&#37;.  The farrowing parameters (pigs born per litter,
live pigs born per litter, birth weight, pigs weaned per litter, weaning
weight), which are the primary parameters for this study, were all similar
between the treated and control groups.  There was no evidence of any
teratogenicity in the pigs born to ivermectin treated sows.  The effect on
nursing pigs was also taken into account in that all sows treated before
breeding were nursing pigs.  The weaning weights were comparable for the pigs
(born prior to the initiation of the trial) weaned from the ivermectin treated
sows and the control sows.<P>
The study shows that ivermectin premix, when incorporated in feed<b> </b>and
fed to sows during any stage of the reproductive cycle, does not have an
adverse effect on breeding or farrowing parameters.<p>

<b>6.   Human Food Safety</b><p>
The human food safety requirements and results are the same as in the original
approved NADA for 140-974 FEDERAL REGISTER, November 3, 1993, (58FR 58652).<p>
<b>A.   Toxicity Tests</b><p>
The toxicology studies conducted to support the safe concentration of
ivermectin in swine edible tissues are summarized in NADA 135-008.<p>
<b>B.   Safe Concentration of Residues</b><p>
The withdrawal period for swine is 5 days.  The safe concentration for total
ivermectin residues in uncooked edible swine tissues has been established as 25
ppb in muscle, 75 ppb in liver, 100 ppb in kidney, and 100 ppb in fat.  A
regulatory tissue residue method has been developed for the determination of
the marker residue, the B1a component of the parent ivermectin, with a
tolerance of 20 ppb in swine liver (21 CFR 556.344).<p>
<b>Validation</b><p>
The validated regulatory analytical methods for detection of residues of
ivermectin are filed in the Food Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom
of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD
20857).<p>
<b>7.   Agency Conclusions</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that ivermectin 0.6&#37;
Type A medicated article when used under the proposed conditions of use, is
safe and effective. These data from the controlled studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of ivermectin for its labeled indications in swine feeds when fed
at 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day for a period of 7 consecutive days.  These
studies demonstrate the efficacy of a 7 consecutive day regimen for treatment
and control of <i>Ascaris suum</i>-adult and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Ascarops
strongylina</i>-adults; <i>Hyostrongylus rubidus</i>-adult and fourth-stage
larvae;   
<i>Oesophagostomum </i>&#160; spp.-adult and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Stephanurus
dentatus </i>-adult and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Metastrongylus </i>&#160;spp.-adult;
<i>Haematopinus suis; </i>and <i>Sarcoptes scabiei </i>&#160;var. <i>suis.
                              </i><P>
The withdrawal period for swine is 5 days.  The safe concentration for 
total ivermectin residues in uncooked edible swine tissues has been 
established as 25 ppb in muscle, 75 ppb in liver, 100 ppb in kidney, and 
100 ppb in fat.  A regulatory tissue residue method has been developed for 
the determination of the marker residue, the B1a component of the parent
ivermectin, with a tolerance of 20 ppb in swine liver (21 CFR 556.344).<p>
Ivermectin products for use in food producing animals are generally
over-the-counter products.  Accurate diagnosis can be made with reasonable
degree of certainty by the layman.  Adequate directions for use have been
written for the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on the labeling
are likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine (CVM) has concluded that this product shall have over-the-counter
marketing status.<p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)(v)), this
is a Category II change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have
any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.
Accordingly, this approval did not require a reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food producing
animals qualifies for THREE (3) years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because the application contains reports of new clinical or
field investigations essential to the approval of the application and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant. The THREE years of marketing exclusivity applies
only to the claim for the treatment of breeding swine, for which the
supplemental application was approved.<p>

<b>Generic Name:</b>        Cefadroxil<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b>           CEFA-DROPS (cefadroxil) Veterinary Powder for Oral Suspension<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    Rx<p>
<b>Date of Approval:  </b>July 20, 1988<p>
<b>II. Indications for Use:</b><p>
CEFA-DROPS (cefadroxil) is indicated for the treatment of the following
conditions:<p>
<b>Dogs:</b> <p> Genitourinary tract infections (cystitis) caused by susceptible strains
of <i>Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, </i>and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>.  Skin and
soft tissue infections including cellulitis, pyoderma, dermatitis, wound
infections and abscesses caused by susceptible strains of 
<i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>.<p>

<b>Cats:</b><p> Skin and soft tissue infections including abscesses, wound infections,
cellulitis and dermatitis caused by susceptible strains of <i>Pasteurella
multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, </i>and <i>Streptococcus
 </i> &#160;spp.<p>
<b>III. Dosage:  </b><p>
<b>Dogs:</b>  10 mg/lb twice daily<br>
<b>Cats:</b>  10 mg/lb once daily<p>
Tap bottle lightly to loosen powder.  Add 10.4 ml of water in two portions.
Shake well after each addition.  After mixing, store in refrigerator.  Shake
well before use.  Discard unused portion after 14 days. <p>
 When mixed as
directed, each ml contains 50 mg cefadroxil activity.  The dropper supplied
with CEFA-DROPS is calibrated to deliver 0.25 ml (12.5 mg), 0.5 ml (25 mg),
0.75 mg (37.5 mg) and 1.0 ml (50 mg).<p>
<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><p>
The effectiveness of cefadroxil for the indications listed above has been
demonstrated and approved (NADA 119-688) using the tablet formulation in dogs
(September 17, 1982, October 26 1984 and April 14, 1987) and cats (February 3,
1986) as described in Freedom of Information Summaries released on those dates.
The relevance of those data to the present application was demonstrated in the
following studies.<p>

<b>A.  Pivotal Bioequivalency Studies in Dogs and Cats</b><p>
<b>1.  Investigator:</b> <p> Dr. John G. Babish, PhD<br>
            University of California<br>
            Davis, California 95616<p>
<b>2.  General Design of the Investigation:</b><p>
The purpose  of the studies was to determine whether the proposed oral powder
formulation of cefadroxil is bioequivalent to the approved tablet formulations
in both dogs and cats.  This was determined by giving each formulation orally
at the approved dosage of 10 mg/lb following a crossover experimental design
and comparing the serum concentration vs time profiles and other
pharmacokinetic parameters.<p>

Test animals were 12 mature Beagle dogs, of both sexes, in one study, and 12
mature domestic shorthair cats, of both sexes, in a second.  In each study,
animals were randomly divided into two subgroups of six each for crossover
treatment purposes.  Subgroup A received the tablet formulation first followed
one week later by the liquid formulation, while subgroup B received the liquid
formulation first.<p>

The control treatment was the approved formulation of cefadroxil film coated
tablets, while the test dosage form was cefadroxil powder for oral suspension,
equivalent to the formulation to be marketed, both administered orally at the
approved dosage of 10 mg/lb body weight.<p>
Pertinent parameters measured were cefadroxil concentrations determined by
standard microbiological assay methods on blood serum samples collected at
predetermined intervals following each treatment.<p>

<b>3.  Results</b><p>
Comparisons of the cefadroxil serum concentration time profiles between liquid
and tablet formulations in both dogs and cats are illustrated graphically
below.  These curves were derived by plotting the average actual concentration
(n = 12) against the average actual sampling time.<p>

<IMG SRC="140684-1.gif" ALT="DOG SERUM CEFADROXIL"><P>
<IMG SRC="140684-2.gif" ALT="CAT SERUM CEFADROXIL"><P>


No adverse reactions of any kind were noted in either dogs or cats given either
formulation.<p> 

Absorption and elimination rate constants were calculated for each individual
animal by mathematical curve fitting of its data points.  Area under the curve
was calculated by the trapezoid method, peak concentration was defined as the
highest concentration detected and time to peak was defined as the time at
which that concentration was measured, all calculated from actual
concentrations measured at actual sampling times.  The following
pharmacokinetic parameters were thus calculated:<p>

</pre>
<b>4.  Conclusions</b><p>
No differences were found in the abilities of cats and dogs to absorb
cefadroxil from either the tablet or liquid formulation. In cats the calculated
area under the curve was numerically larger for the liquid formulation than for
the tablets, indicating a slightly greater bioavailability of cefadroxil from
the liquid formulation.  In both dogs and cats, a shorter time was required for
cefadroxil to reach peak blood concentrations from the liquid formulation than
from the tablets.  This was anticipated since the tablets had to undergo
disintegration before cefadroxil could be absorbed.<p>

<b>3.  General Design of the Investigation</b><p>
The purpose of the study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of
cefadroxil given as an oral suspension formulation with that of the previously
approved film coated tablets under conditions of veterinary practice.<p>
Test animals were dogs of either sex and any age weighing up to 20 pounds that
were presented to the practicing veterinarian for treatment of either urinary
tract infections or skin and soft tissue infections, and cats of either sex and
any age that were presented for treatment of skin and soft tissue
infections.<p>
Controls in this study were dogs and cats treated with the approved tablet
formulation of cefadroxil (active treatment control).<p>
Diagnosis of urinary tract infections was made by physical examination and by
urinalysis and bacteriologic culture of samples obtained by cystocentesis
(aseptically placing sterile needle through abdominal wall into bladder and
withdrawing urine sample). Diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections was
made by physical examination, including drawing lesion(s) on schematic diagrams
provided, and by bacteriologic culture.<p>
Dosage forms, route, and dosage were cefadroxil powder for oral suspension
which, when reconstituted according to directions, provided 50 mg cefadroxil
activity per ml, and cefadroxil 50 mg film coated tablets, given orally at the
approved dosage of 10 mg/pound twice daily to dogs and once daily to cats.<p>

Pertinent parameters measured included comparison of pretreatment and post
treatment results of physical examination, microbiological culture of lesions
in skin infection cases, and urinalysis and culture of urine samples obtained
by cystocentesis. Post treatment cultures were taken approximately seven days
after last treatment with cefadroxil.  Investigators were also asked to give an
overall evaluation of response to therapy on an "excellent", "good", "fair" or
"poor" basis.<p>
<b>4.  Results</b><p>
A total of 148 animals were entered into the study of which 144 were evaluable,
comprised of 99 cats and 45 dogs.  Of the 99 cats, 55 were treated with the
cefadroxil liquid formulation and 44 with approved cefadroxil tablets.  Of the
45 dogs, 22 were treated with the liquid and 23 received the tablet
formulation.  All of the cats and 36 of the dogs were treated for skin and
soft tissue infections, while the remaining nine dogs were treated for urinary
tract infections.<p>
Clinically, both formulations of cefadroxil were found to be effective in
relieving signs of skin infections in cats an dogs as well as cystitis in dogs.
The microbiological results are summarized in the following table:<p>

<b>5.  Statistical analysis</b> was not deemed necessary to evaluate the results of this
study since the results by all criteria are clearly similar between animals
given cefadroxil as liquid or as tablets.<p>
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
Results of the study demonstrate the acceptability of cefadroxil powder for
oral suspension for treatment of dogs and cats, and demonstrate that safety and
effectiveness of the cefadroxil liquid are equivalent to that of the approved
tablet formulation, when tested under conditions of veterinary practice.<p>
<b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
No unexpected side effects were encountered in animals treated with either
dosage form.  Diarrhea was reported in one cat treated with liquid and two cats
treated with tablets.  Vomiting was reported in one cat in each group and
lethargy was noted in one cat of the tablet group.  No side effects were
reported in dogs.<p>

samples were collected before and at prescribed intervals following dosage,
frozen, and later analyzed for cefadroxil activity by an HPLC procedure.
Additionally, 24 hour urine collections were made on dogs given the drug
intravenously, and percent binding to serum protein was also determined.
Pharmacokinetic parameters determined following oral administration of the
respective formulations and intravenous injection were compared.<p>

</pre>
Results of urinary recovery studies revealed that an average of 39% of the
intravenous dose of cefadroxil was recovered within 24 hours from the dogs.
Protein binding averaged 25%.<p>
<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>
The safety of cefadroxil has been demonstrated and approved (NADA 119-688)
using the tablet formulation in both dogs (September 17, 1982) and cats
(February 3, 1986) as described in Freedom on Information summaries released on
those dates.  The relevance of those data to the present application was
demonstrated by results of the pivotal bioequivalency and clinical data
described above.<p>
<b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
Data on human food safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is labeled for use in
dogs and cats only, which are non-food animals.<p>
In regards to human safety relative to possession, handling and administration
of the drug, no special caution statement is needed.<p>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  It
demonstrates that CEFA-DROPS (cefadroxil, 50 mg/ml) Veterinary Powder for Oral
Suspension is safe and effective for the label indications when used in
accordance with the labeling directions.<p>
Differential diagnosis and monitoring of the progress of patients require the
professional expertise of a veterinarian.  The Agency, therefore, concluded
that CEFA-DROPS Veterinary Powder for Oral Suspension should be provided to the
public on a prescription basis.<p>

Tablets, NADA 140-441, 54 FR 3444 (January 24, 1989).</B><P>
The tablet NADA contains dose titration and dose confirmation model studies
which establish the dose and efficacy for the tablet formulation.  In addition,
pharmacokinetic and body fluid/tissue level studies profile the distribution of
enrofloxacin in dogs, while <i>in vitro</i>&#160;microbiological studies
demonstrate the drug's activity against a variety of bacterial pathogens.
Finally, both pivotal and corroborative clinical evaluations were conducted to
confirm the antibacterial activity of enrofloxacin in the tablet formulation,
under clinical conditions.<P>
<B>2.  Bioequivalency (Crossover) Study of Enrofloxacin Tablet and Injectable
Formulations in Dogs</B><P>
H.D. McCurdy and J.D. Craven, Shawnee Mission, KS.<P>
The purpose of this trial, conducted in accordance with the July 1985, FDA
Bioequivalence Guidelines, was to compare enrofloxacin tablets (NADA 140-441)
with the 2.27% injectable solution in dogs at a dose rate of 2.5 mg/kg (1.13
mg/lb) body weight for both formulations.  The enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable
formulation was that intended for market while the tablet formulation was that
currently approved and marketed.  The study compared enrofloxacin serum levels
collected at established time intervals, beginning just prior to dosing and
continuing for 24 hours after the single dose.  Following this, the dogs were
rested for seven days, then dosed again with the opposite formulation according
to the same procedure.<P>
Twenty-four purebred and mixed breed adult dogs of both sexes and a wide range
of body weights were used.  The dogs were in good condition at the time of the
study.  The study was conducted from August through October 1986.  The dogs
were randomly assigned to study groups so that half received the tablets and
half the injectable solution.  The oral formulation was given directly per os
and the injectable solution by IM administration.  The study was well
controlled and blinded in that the laboratory conducting the assays was not
advised of the treatments given.  Pretreatment blood samples were used to
confirm the absence of enrofloxacin in the serum before dosing.  Comparisons
were made between serum levels from dogs receiving the established tablet
formulation, as a positive control, and those from dogs receiving the
injectable formulation.  The second round of a single dose, and serum
collections using the opposite formulation (i.e., crossover), allowed the
evaluation of each dog with each formulation.<P>
Serum samples were submitted to an independent laboratory for analysis of
enrofloxacin levels according to a standard microbiological method.  Confidence
intervals (90%) for area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax)
and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) were calculated from an appropriate
analysis of variance for the crossover study design.  The results are presented
in Table 1 and Figure 1 below.  Other than the first hour when the injectable
values were higher (P&lt;0.01), there were no significant differences between
the tablet and injectable group.  Based upon this approach, the injectable
formulation is at least as bioavailable as the tablet formulation.  No adverse
effects were observed.<P>

A well-controlled, blinded, clinical investigation was conducted in several
geographical locations from March through May 1988. The purpose of the study
was to evaluate the clinical response under actual use conditions.  The
investigators (listed above) conducted trials according to a uniform protocol
to compare the efficacy and safety of enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable solution
followed by tablets with Tribrissen Injection followed by tablets, as the
positive control.  The enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable formulation was that
intended for market while the tablet formulation was that currently approved
and marketed.  The bacterial infections studied included naturally occurring
conditions of the dermal, otic, respiratory, enteric, and urinary system in
dogs.  Selection was made on the basis of clinical signs and a bacteriological
culture.  Data were submitted on 40 breeds plus mixed breeds including both
sexes, ages ranging from 1.5 months to 20 years and weights from 2.3 to 54.4 kg
(5 to 120 lbs). Of the 128 dogs initially selected, 13 were omitted from any
assessment because of protocol deviations that could be expected to influence
the results.  Clinical evaluations subsequently were conducted on 115 dogs, 61
dosed with enrofloxacin and 54 with the positive control.  An additional 21
dogs were omitted from microbiological evaluation because of incomplete culture
data.  A microbiological assessment was conducted on 94 dogs, 51 with
enrofloxacin and 43 with the positive control.<P>
Details of the distribution are presented by system in Table 2.<P>

The dogs were assigned to a treatment group by body system according to a
randomization schedule.  The study was blinded in that the investigator was not
informed of the drug being used until after all evaluations were completed.
Both the test and control medications were administered with a single
injection, at 1 mL/9.1 kg (1 mL/20 lb) body weight, followed by oral
administration of tablets for the remainder of the regimen. Enrofloxacin was
given at 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) twice daily (BID) for up to ten days.
Tribrissen was dosed according to label BID.<P>
Efficacy was evaluated by three methods.  The infections were rated according
to a uniform scoring system, (i.e., 0 = normal through 4 = most severe).  All
systems, except urinary tract infections used both before and after treatment
scores.  Urinary tract infections were only rated after treatment.  Comparison
with the positive control was accomplished by comparing the percentage
reduction in the score for each system.  The second method of evaluation was
the elimination of pathogens.  This was done by comparing the results of the
pretreatment and post-treatment cultures.  Subjective evaluations for ease of
administration, efficacy, and safety according to established uniform
definitions formed the final evaluation method.  Efficacy determinations were
based on medical decisions.  The data, therefore, are presented as means and
percentages rather than with statistical analyses.<P>
The results from each of these evaluations are presented in tabular form.
Table 3 illustrates the percentage reduction in the dermal, otic, respiratory,
and enteric scores and the percentage of the urinary tract scores that reached
normal (score = 0) at the post-treatment examination.  Enrofloxacin had a
medically significant effect on lesions from those systems, comparable to
Tribrissen.<P>

A clinical investigation was conducted at several geographical locations in the
US according to a uniform protocol comparing Baytril&#174;(enrofloxacin)
Injectable Solution plus Tablets with a similar regimen of Tribrissen as a
positive control.  The enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable formulation was that
intended for market while the tablet formulation was that currently approved
and marketed.  The injectable formulation was given by single intramuscular
injection followed by oral administration of tablets. Enrofloxacin was given at
2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) twice daily for up to ten days.  Tribrissen was given
according to the label recommended dose.  One hundred twenty four case reports
were submitted from December 1986 through October 1987 including infections of
the dermal, respiratory, enteric, and urinary systems. Ten dogs were omitted
for protocol deviations leaving 114 acceptable cases for evaluation.  Those
cases included 32 breeds plus mixed breeds, including 48 females and 66 males,
ranging in age from ten weeks to 15 years and in weight from 2.7 to 63.5 kg (6
to 140 lbs).  The infections consisted of 67 dermal, 24 respiratory, 17
urinary, and 6 enteric cases; 61 of these were treated with enrofloxacin and 53
with Tribrissen.<P>
Efficacy was evaluated for clinical and bacteriological response. The
infections were rated according to a uniform scoring system, (i.e., 0 = normal
through 4 = most severe).  All systems, except urinary tract infections, used
both before and after treatment scores.  Urinary tract infections were only
rated after treatment. Comparison with the positive control was accomplished by
comparing the percentage reduction in the score for each system.  The second
method of evaluation was the elimination of pathogens.  This was done by

<b>1.  Local Tolerance Evaluation (Local Tolerance Evaluation for Intramuscular
Treatment of Dogs with Bay Vp 2674 Formulation)</b><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted a study to evaluate for
tissue irritation by administering single intramuscular injections in each rear
leg to 12 male and female dogs of various breeds and a weight range of 12.3 to
16.0 kg (27.1 to 35.3 lb).  The dogs were injected with the 2.27% enrofloxacin
formulation intended for market, a placebo formulation without the active
ingredient, a 4.54% enrofloxacin formulation and normal saline.  The purpose of
this study was to evaluate BAY Vp 2674 for tissue irritation as per FDA Target
Species Safety Guidelines.<P>
The study was blinded in that the necropsy observations and histopathology
readings were made by an individual unaware of the treatments given.  The
subjective evaluations were made based on medical decisions.  All important
observations/findings were listed.  A statistical analysis, therefore, was
unnecessary to the conclusions drawn.  Each dog received 2 different injections
and thus each of the 4 test products was evaluated 6 times.  Volumes used were
equivalent to the 2.27% formulation, at a use rate of 2.5 mg/kg (1.13mg/lb).
Parameters were palpations for tissue swelling, necropsy observations, and
histology readings.  Study duration was 10 days.  No tissue swelling occurred
and no clinically significant lesions were present at necropsy. Histology
readings indicated adequate healing.  No adverse reactions were observed in any
of the treated dogs.  A brief summary is presented in Table 8 below.  In
conclusion, the findings of the study indicated that a single 	intramuscular

M. Kohlenberg, Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted an evaluation to define the
clinical signs following a single intramuscular treatment with an excessive
overdose of the 2.27% formulation intended for market.  The study was blinded
in that the necropsy observations and histopathology readings were made by an
individual unaware of the treatments given.  Also the clinical chemistry and
hematology values were collected without advising laboratory personnel of the

Four dogs (male and female) of various breeds were used with one being a
nontreated control, another receiving normal saline treatment, and 2 treated
with the 2.27% enrofloxacin formulation at a rate of 62.5 mg/kg or 28.4 mg/lb
(25 times the use rate).  The treatments were administered at multiple sites
due to the larger volume of material being  injected.<P>
The dogs were evaluated for 7 days following treatment.  The parameters
monitored were:  clinical signs, clinical chemistries, hematology, necropsy
observations, and histological readings. Signs of toxicosis in the 2 treated
dogs included excitation, incoordination, recumbency, convulsions, muscle
tremors, salivation, vomition, alterations in respiratory rate, and slight to
severe depression, but both were clinically normal within 24 hours
post-treatment.  They also had transient increases in CPK, SGOT, and SGPT
values, but these values had essentially returned to normal at 7 days
post-treatment.  There were no gross or microscopic lesions.  All important
observations and findings were listed.  Statistical analyses, therefore, were
unnecessary to the conclusions drawn.  A brief summary of the results is

M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted a study in 16 adult, male
and female Beagle dogs in groups of 4 with a combination of the 2.27%
injectable formulation intended for market and the approved 22.7 mg tablet
currently being marketed.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate for
clinical signs and histopathology following dosing at 1, 3, and 5x doses for a
3x duration.  This study was blinded in that necropsy evaluations and
histopathology readings were made by an individual unaware of the treatments.
Also the clinical chemistry and  hematology values were collected without
advising the laboratory personnel of the treatments.  Subjective evaluations
were made based on medical decisions.  Four dogs served as nontreated controls.
Initially, 3 intramuscular injections were administered to each animal at rates
of 2.5, 7.5, or 12.5 mg/kg (respectively 1.13, 3.40, or 5.67 mg/lb) followed by
oral treatment at the same dosage rate for a total duration of 30 days.
Treatments were twice daily and thus each dog received a combination of 3
injections followed by 57 oral treatments.  Parameters evaluated were clinical
signs, body weights, clinical chemistries, hematology, necropsy observations,
and histological readings.  All important observations and findings were
listed.  Statistical analyses, therefore, were unnecessary to the conclusions
drawn.  The results have been summarized in Table 10 below.  No adverse effects

<b>4.  Study in Female Breeding Dogs (Safety Evaluation for BAY Vp 2674 in
Female Breeding Dogs)</b><P>
A. Stuke and J. Magerkurth of Topeka, Kansas conducted a reproductive safety
study in 15 adult female Beagle breed dogs with the 22.7 mg enrofloxacin
tablet.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate libido and safety in female
breeding dogs following multiple treatments with the approved market tablet
formulation.  Before treatment the dogs were randomly assigned to one of three
groups.  Four dogs served as the nontreated controls, 5 received treatments
orally of 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) twice daily for a total of 5 mg/kg (2.27
mg/lb) per day and 6 were treated orally with 7.5 mg/kg (3.40 mg/lb) twice
daily for a total of 15 mg/kg (6.80 mg/lb) per day. Each female received
treatments for 10 consecutive days at each of 4 stages of reproduction (prior
to breeding, early pregnancy, late pregnancy and lactation). Parameters
monitored included number of pups born alive, average number of pups born alive
per female, number of dead pups at birth, average number of dead pups per
female, average body weight (birth, 2 and 4 weeks of age), average daily body

An in-depth statistical analysis was not appropriate.  The study results were
stated as simple averages to allow accurate comparison to the historical
control data.<P>
The study concluded that no adverse effects occurred upon reproductive
parameters nor were there any clinical signs of toxicosis when female breeding
dogs are treated with enrofloxacin tablets at doses as high as 3 times the
labeled rate for 10 consecutive days at 4 critical stages of reproduction:  30
to 0 days prior to breeding, early pregnancy (between the 10th and 30th days),
late pregnancy (between the 40th and 60th days), and during lactation (the
first 28 days).  This conclusion is further verified when the historical
control reproductive data from the colony are used as comparison.<P>

<b>B.  Corroborative Studies</b><P>
Corroborative safety studies were conducted by Mobay Corporation, Animal Health
Division, Shawnee Mission, Kansas and in the laboratories of Drs. M. L. Sharp,
Vernon, Texas and Robert Young of Modesto, California.  Additionally, clinical
field trial safety studies were conducted by 11 veterinary practitioners in
various geographical areas of the United States.<P>
<b>1.  Bioequivalency of Enrofloxacin Tablet and Injectable Formulations
(Bioequivalency of BAY Vp 2674 Tablet 	and Injectable Formulations in
Dogs)</b><P>
H. D. McCurdy of Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted a bioequivalency study in 24
adult male and female dogs of various breeds using a cross-over design.  The
tablet (5.7 and 22.7 mg) formulation, given orally as the positive control, was
compared to the 2.27% injectable formulation, as the test group, administered
via intramuscular route.  The enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable formulation was
that intended for market while the tablet formulation was that currently
marketed and approved.  The study was well controlled and blinded in that the
laboratory conducting the assays was not advised of the treatment given.  Serum
levels were monitored following single treatments at 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb).
The 2 formulations were deemed bioequivalent based upon statistical analysis of
the data.  Based upon bioequivalence, reference is made to the preclinical
safety evaluations conducted for NADA 140-441 (5.7, 22.7, and 68.0 mg
enrofloxacin tablets) as this formulation's safety was previously confirmed in
well-controlled studies.<P>
Additional details concerning the study may be found beginning on page 2
(section IV.A.2.) of this FOI Summary.<P>
<b>2.  Comparison of Two Injectable Formulations for Local Tolerance (Local
Tolerance Evaluation and Comparison in Dogs for the Use of BAY Vp 2674
Formulations When Administered as Single Treatments)</b><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas evaluated single subcutaneous and
intramuscular treatment of 10 dogs with 2 injectable formulations (2.5 and
2.27%) at a rate of 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) in a local tolerance study.  The
enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable solution was that intended for market while the
2.5% was a preliminary formulation.  The dogs were male and female, adults and
of various breeds.  Each animal received a total of 4 injections (one
subcutaneous and one intramuscular with each of the 2 formulations).  The test
animals each served as their own control.  They were observed for clinical
signs, pain responses, tissue swellings, necropsy at 21 days and microscopic
readings. No clinically significant side effects were observed, but the
histologist confirmed the 2.27% formulation to be preferred based upon less
tissue reactivity.  The lesions were in a healing process at necropsy.<P>
<b>3.  Preliminary Safety Evaluation (Safety Evaluation for the Use of an
Injectable BAY Vp 2674 Formulation Followed by Administration of BAY Vp 2674
Tablets to Dogs)</b><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted a preliminary uncontrolled
safety evaluation in 20 male 	and female adult dogs of varied breeding with a
combination treatment of oral (22.7 mg tablets, approved and marketed) and
injectable (2.27% intended for market) formulations.  Ten dogs received a
single subcutaneous treatment at either 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg (respectively 1.13 or
2.27 mg/lb) followed by the tablet orally at the rate of 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg
(respectively 1.13 or 2.27 mg/lb) twice daily for 7 days.  The other 10 dogs
received the same treatment scheduled except the initial treatment was via
intramuscular route.  Parameters included observations for pain at treatment,
palpation for tissue swelling, necropsy observations and histology.  The study
concluded these combinations are clinically acceptable.<P>
<b>4.  Additional Preclinical Safety Evaluations Conducted in Laboratory /
Clinical Conditions (Safety Evaluations of Baytril&#174; Injectable/Tablets
in Dogs)</b><P>
M. Sharp of Vernon, Texas and R. Young of Modesto, California conducted
additional safety evaluations with 88 dogs (male and female, greater than 8
months of age and of 29 breeds).  Each dog received a single enrofloxacin
intramuscular injection with the 2.27% formulation followed by twice daily
enrofloxacin tablet treatment orally for the remainder of the 10 day
regimen.<P>
The enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable formulation was that intended for market
while the tablet formulation was that currently approved and marketed.  Each
treatment was at a 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) rate.  In addition, 28 dogs received
treatment with Tribrissen (positive control) as per labeled directions
(injection followed by tablets) for comparative purposes.  Parameters included
monitoring for pain, tissue swelling and clinical signs. With the injections,
there was a 2.3% incidence of moderate tissue swelling following enrofloxacin
treatment and a 32.1% incidence of slight to moderate pain following the
Tribrissen injections.  Two cases of emesis were observed following treatment
with each of the 2 products.  This evaluation further confirmed safety for the
combination injectable and tablet enrofloxacin treatment.<P>
<b>5.  Confirmation of Safety in Clinical Field Trials</b><P>
Confirmation of safety for a single intramuscular injection followed by oral
tablet treatment was achieved in clinical field trials conducted by 11
veterinary practitioners at 10 geographic locations.  Additional details
concerning the investigators, etc. may be found beginning on page 4 (section
IV.A.3.) and page 7 (section IV.B.) of this FOI Summary.  Enrofloxacin
treatment (injection followed by tablets) was administered to 122 dogs.  The
enrofloxacin 2.27% injectable formulation was that intended for market while
the tablet formulation was that currently approved and marketed.  Enrofloxacin
was administered at 2.5 mg/kg (1.13 mg/lb) twice daily for up to 10 days.
Breeds of dogs treated were representative of the canine population.  Weight
range for the treated animals was 2.7 to 63.5 kg (6 to 140 lbs.).  Age range
was 1.5 months to 20 years.  No evidence of drug potentiation was observed for
concurrent treatment with enrofloxacin and a variety of other animal health
products.  No side effects were reported in the enrofloxacin treated dogs.  The
veterinary practitioners rated safety for enrofloxacin treatments as excellent
in 77% of the cases and good in the remaining 23%.  These trials used
Tribrissen (injection followed by tablets) as the positive control.<br>
<br>
<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><P>
<b>A.  Human Food Safety</b><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this 	NADA.  The drug is labeled for use in dogs,
which are non-food animals.<P>
<b>B.  Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration</b><P>
The labeling contains an adequate warning statement:  "WARNING: Keep out of
reach of Children."<P>
<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
The data consist of adequate and well controlled studies, including field
investigations, demonstrating effectiveness and adequate tests to demonstrate
safety to the target animal.<P>
Dermal infections (wounds and abscessed) caused by susceptible strains of
<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Proteus
mirabilis</i>&#160;and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.<P>
Respiratory infections (pneumonia, tonsillitis, rhinitis) caused by susceptible
strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i>&#160;and <i>Staphylococcus
aureus</i>.<P>
Urinary cystitis caused by susceptible strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i>,
<i>Proteus mirabilis</i>&#160;and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.<P>
A differential diagnosis and monitoring of a patient's progress require the
professional expertise of a veterinarian. Professional diagnosis, including
testing, is necessary to determine the nature of the infection, e.g. to
determine whether the infection is bacterial or of some other cause.  Laymen
are unable to make this diagnosis for the conditions indicated for this drug
because different causative organisms may produce the same signs in the animal.
For proper monitoring, a veterinarian must determine the parameters to be
measured, how often the measurement is to take place, and whether recovery is
taking place.  Therefore, the labeling for this product must contain the
veterinary prescription legend.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this new animal drug application qualifies for three
years of marketing exclusivity.<P>

		Swine:  Up to 5 days<P>


<B>IV.	EFFICACY:</B><P>
	The purpose of this supplemental application is to add certain claims 
for swine to the label of an 	existing product. Bioequivalency of this product 
was established in earlier submissions to the 	Center for Veterinary 
Medicine.  For details demonstrating the efficacy of this product, please 
refer to the Freedom of Information Summary provided as the basis of approval 
for NADA 130-435, as published in the <B>FEDERAL REGISTER</B> of August 14, 1985 (<B>50 
FR 32694</B>).<P>

SPECIAL ISSUES<P>
	The safety and efficacy of this product are based on the National 
Academy of Science/ National 	Research Council (NAS/NRC) review of 
oxytetracycline soluble powder published in the <B>FEDERAL REGISTER</B> of May 5, 
1970 (<B>35 FR 7089</B>). The NAS/NRC concluded, and the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) concurred, that the product is effective in swine for use in the 
treatment of bacterial enteritis, bacterial pneumonia and leptospirosis when 
each disease claim is properly qualified as, "appropriate for use in (name of 
disease) caused by (name of pathogens) sensitive to oxytetracycline". Other 
qualifying label revisions have been incorporated into the 	labeling for the 
product. <P>

<B>V.    ANIMAL SAFETY</B><P>
	The safety of oxytetracycline hydrochloride soluble powder to the target 
species is established 	under the conditions outlined in the NAS/NRC review of 
the product with reference to indictions for use, route of administration, 
recommended dosages and limitations of use, as specified in <B>35 FR 7089</B>. 
Therefore, to assure target animal safety, oxytetracycline hydrochloride 
soluble powder is to be used in accordance with NAS/NRC recommendations, and 
is not to be used for more than 5 consecutive days in swine. <P>

<B>VI.   HUMAN SAFETY</B><P>
	A.	Safe Concentration of Residues:<P>
		The tolerance established by the Food and Drug Administration FDA) 
by regulation (<B>21 CFR 556.500</B>) for residues of oxytetracycline in edible 
tissue of treated swine is:<P>
		"(a) In edible tissues of swine:
		(1) 0.1 parts per million in uncooked edible tissues
	B.	Residue Depletion Studies:<P>
		A study was designed and conducted to ascertain the rate of 
elimination of oxytetracycline (OTC)from edible tissues of swine treated with 
OXYTET SOLUBLE.  The study was performed to assess the elimination rate of OTC
relative to the tolerance of O. 10 parts per million of OTC residues in 
uncooked edible tissues of treated swine.<P>

			Colorado Animal Research Enterprises, Inc.<BR> 
			6200 E. County Road 56<BR> 
			Ft. Collins, CO 80524<BR>
			Study Director: Dan C. Ronning<P> 
	(b)    Description of Animals Used:<P>
		Thirty (30) near-market-age production swine (15 males, 15 
females) were administered OXYTET SOLUBLE. Three of the pigs in each medicated 
group were included as substitutes for any pig which might be removed from the 
study due to unforeseen circumstances. The weight of the males at the 
beginning of the study ranged from 124 to 144 lbs. and the weight of females 
ranged from 122 to 146 lbs. <P>
	(c)    Route of Administration:<P>
		Oral administration via voluntary consumption of medicated tap 
water to provide 10 mg/Ib body weight per day.<P> 
	(d)    Time and Duration of Dosing:<P>
		The daily doses were determined on an individual pig basis and 
administered at approximately 24-hour intervals for 5 consecutive days.<P>
	(e)  In accordance with the above parameters, the 30 pigs were treated 
for 5 consecutive days at medication rates which provided intake levels of 10 
mg oxytetracycline hydrochloride per pound body weight daily. At the end of 
the medication period, 2 medicated male pigs and 2 medicated female pigs each 
were sacrificed at intervals of 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after 
withdrawal of the drug and 1 non-medicated male and 1 non-medicated female 
each were 	sacrificed at 24 and 120 hours after withdrawal of the drug.  Loin 
muscle and kidney tissue were carefully collected for oxytetracycline residue 
analysis.<P>

	The study was conducted in compliance with standards established by 
FDA's Good Laboratory 	Practice Regulations (21 CFR 58).<P>

	The microbiological analysis of loin muscle and kidney tissues collected 
during the first part of the study at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hours 
following final treatment revealed samples of all loin muscle samples from 24 
through 120 hours had no OTC residues (i.e. less than detection limit) with 
the exception of one detectable, nonquantifiable residue of OTC at 24 hours: 
consequently, samples of loin muscle at the 144 hour sampling were not assayed 
for OTC levels. 	Additionally, the residue data on loin muscle were not 
statistically analyzed.<P>

	Data on residues of OTC in kidney samples were used to calculate the 
withdrawal time.  Kidney residue values obtained from the 24, 48, and 72 hour 
(at least 3 valid points at each timepoint) sample times above the LOQ of O. 1 
ppm OTC were used for withdrawal time calculations. Due to variabilities in 
the dosing solution assays, a correction factor of 1.07 was multiplied against 
each residue value.  The following kidney residue values (all values 
multiplied by 1.07) were used in the withdrawal time calculation:<P>

<PRE>
                            ------WITHDRAWAL TIME POINT------
                            24 hours    48 hours    72 hours

 OTC LEVEL                   0.254       0. 122      0. 119
  (ppm)                      0.205       0. 133      0. 124
                             0.408       0. 198      0. 170
                             0.215

</PRE>

	Statistical analysis of the above kidney residue data using 99% 
tolerance limit with 95% confidence, calculated a withdrawal time of 13 days 
to be necessary to allow OTC residues to deplete to less than 0. 1 ppm 
tolerance for market-size swine administered 10 mg oxytetracycline/lb. body 
weight for 5 days.<P>

	Oxytetracycline levels in loin muscle and kidney tissue samples were 
determined by the method described under "Regulatory Methods" below.<P>

	(f)	Regulatory Methods:<P>

	The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of 
oxytetracycline is a microbiological test using <I>Bacillus cereus</I> suspension. 
The method is as published by the Food and Drug Administration: "Antibiotic 
Residues in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports and 
Protocols", revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974.<P>


<B>VII  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><P>

	The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the 
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that I.D. Russell's 
product, Oxytet Soluble, when used under its proposed conditions of use is 
safe and effective in swine.<P>

	The sponsor submitted residue data for swine which calculated a 
withdrawal time of 13 days to be necessary to allow oxytetracycline residues 
to deplete to less than 0.1 ppm tolerance for market-size swine. This 
supplement is approved under DESI "me-too" pipeline provision and therefore 
the sponsor had to submit a residue study to satisfy human food safety 
requirements.<P>

	Oxytetracycline Soluble Powder for use in food-producing animals is 
currently on the market as an over-the-counter product. Adequate directions 
for use have been written for the layman, and the conditions for use 
prescribed in labeling are likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the 
Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has concluded that this product retains 
over-the-counter 	marketing status.<P>

	Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106 
(b)(2)(v)(vii)), this is a Category Il change. The approval of this change is 
not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this 
new animal drug and, therefore, did not require a re-evaluation of the human 
food or target animal safety data in the parent application.<P>

	This approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under any of 
the provisions of section 512 (c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act, (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)(F) (iii) because the supplemental 
application does not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations 
(other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and, in the case of food 
producing animals, human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or 
residue studies) essential to the approval and 	conducted or sponsored by the 
applicant.<P>

<B>Effect of Supplement:</B><p>
This supplement provides for the use of CALF-oid
in suckling beef calves (at least 45 days of age)
up to 400 lbs. of bodyweight.<p>
                        

<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><p>
  For increased rate of weight gain.<P>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><P>
CALF-oid implant consists of four individual pellets packaged in a plastic
cartridge.  Each pellet contains 25 mg progesterone and 2.5 mg estradiol
benzoate.  CALF-oid is administered by subcutaneous implantation in the ear. 
<P>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><P> 
  
A. Pivotal Studies:<P> 
  
The supplemental new animal application for CALF-oid contains four adequate and
well controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the new animal drug
for the indication for use as given in item 2 above.<P> 
  
The pivotal studies are dose titration studies in which the parameters measured
are the same parameters as are measured in clinical (field) studies.  The four
pivotal studies were conducted in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Colorado
using a uniform protocol so that the results of the studies could be pooled and
summarized.<P> 
<pre>
Investigators:  John Stuedeman, PhD, Watkinsville, GA
                Roger McCraw, PhD, Plymouth, NC 
                Bill Clymer, PhD, Amarillo, TX 
                John Vetterling, PhD, Fort Collins, CO 

</pre> 
The purpose of the studies was to determine the dose response for CALF-oid implants on average daily gain (ADG) of suckling beef calves.  The test animals were mostly crossbred animals of English breeds.  The calves weighed approximately 250 pounds when the studies were initiated.  A total of 446 calves (250 heifers and 196 steers) were used in these studies.<P> 
  
Calves in each study were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups.
One treatment group remained as non implanted controls, while each of the other
groups received one of the following subcutaneous ear implants: one, two, four
or eight pellets where each pellet contained 25 mg progesterone and 2.5 mg
estradiol benzoate.  Calves were pastured with their dams for the following 112
days.<P> 
  
The ADG for each study is shown in Table 1.  The studies were pooled by
Analysis of Variance to determine the significance of the number of pellets on
ADG.  The least square means for ADG are presented in Table 2.  There was a
significant (P&lt;&lt; 0.03) dose effect on ADG with the optimum effect at a
dosage of four pellets (100 mg progesterone/10 mg estradiol benzoate).  ADG of
calves implanted with the four pellet dose showed an increase of 0.13 pounds
(8.2% improvement; P&lt;&lt;.0013) over the untreated controls for the 112 day
period.<P> 
  
These data are sufficient to support the claim and dosage as outlined in
Sections 2 and 3 above.  No adverse reactions that affected animal safety were
reported during the effectiveness studies described above.  Since only
ruminating beef calves were used in the studies, CALF-oid is not be used in
veal calves.<P>

<b>5. Animal Safety:</b><P>
A. Pivotal Study<P>
Investigator:  Bill Clymer, PhD, Clymer Research And Consulting, Amarillo, TX<P>
Sixty (20 bulls, steers and heifers) crossbred suckling calves 50 to 78 days of
age and weighing 135 to 312 lbs. were randomly assigned to treatment groups and
implanted with either zero (T1), 0.5X (T2), 4X (T3), or 8X (T4) of the CALF-oid implant (100 mg progesterone/10 mg estradiol benzoate) on days 0, and 56 of the study.  Fifteen calves (five bulls, steers and heifers) were used per treatment group.  Calves were maintained on test for 112 days (day of weaning).  All animals were observed daily for any clinical or behavioral abnormalities.  On days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 112 the calves were individually weighed, received a physical examination, and blood was drawn for hematology and serum chemistries. At the end of the test period, three calves (one bull, heifer, and steer) from each treatment group were randomly selected and subjected to a complete gross pathological examination.  The three calves receiving the T4 dose were subjected to a complete histopathological examination.<P> 
No adverse clinical or behavioral abnormalities were observed. There were no
treatment related adverse conditions observed regarding hematology, clinical
chemistry, gross pathology, histopathology except reduced testicular size in
the bulls treated at all doses.<P>
CALF-oid labels contain the Caution statement, "Bulling, rectal
prolapse, ventral edema and elevated tail-heads have occasionally been reported
in calves implanted with progesterone and estradiol benzoate
implants."  Also, the label restricts the use of CALF-oid in calves
intended for reproduction or in calves less than 45 days of age. These data are sufficient to support the safety of the requested dose in suckling beef calves.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>
A. Safe Concentration of Residues:<P> 
  
The increases in hormone levels permitted in muscle above the amount naturally
present in untreated animals are 120 ppt for estradiol and 3 ppb for
progesterone.  The corresponding values for fat tissue based on relative
consumption of fat versus muscle are 480 ppt for estradiol and 12 ppb for progesterone. The basis for these conclusions was discussed in an earlier FOI Summary filed under this NADA for STEER-oid.<P> 
  
B. Residue in Calf Tissue:<P> 
  
The human food safety data for this submission relies on data gathered under
NADA 110-315 for STEER-oid and under NADA 135-906 for HEIFER-oid (<B>49 FR
29777/8; July 24, 1984</B>).  Extensive residue data were submitted on Steer-oid
(200 mg progesterone and 20 mg estradiol benzoate) and HEIFER-oid (200 mg
progesterone and 20 mg estradiol benzoate) using well validated RIA's to
measure hormone levels in tissues.<P> 
  
These data demonstrated that incremental levels of estradiol and progesterone
found in edible tissues of steers weighing 500 to 700 lbs. that had been
implanted with STEER-oid and heifers weighing more than 400 lbs. that had been
implanted with HEIFER-oid were well within the intervals considered safe.
Since the largest incremental increase found in the above mentioned studies was
only 10.4% of the level permitted for progesterone in fat, similar results,
well within the permitted values, would be expected for CALF-oid implants even
when the reduced body weight of calves is considered.  Based upon the residue
data for STEER-oid and HEIFER-oid, CALF-oid is approvably in calves other than
veal calves without additional residue data.<P> 
  
C. Analytical Methods for Residues:<P> 
  
The Agency's reasons for not requiring regulatory methods for estradiol and
progesterone were discussed in an earlier FOI Summary filed under this NADA (<B>47
FR 51108/9; November 12, 1982</B>).<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P> 
Under the Agency's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is a
Category II change.  Adequate data were provided to demonstrate that CALF-oid
is safe and effective in suckling beef calves for increased rate of weight
gain.  Sufficient human food safety data have been submitted under NADA 110-315
for STEER-Oid and under NADA 135-906 for HEIFER-oid to determine that CALF-oid
is safe for use in suckling beef calves (at least 45 days of age) weighing up
to 400 lbs. body weight.<P> 
The Agency concludes that, although regulatory analytical methods for
monitoring the residues of animal drugs demonstrated to be carcinogens are
ordinarily required under Section 512 (d) (1) (h) of the Act, for these unique
steroid hormones, estradiol and progesterone, it is satisfactory to rely upon
information provided by research analytical methods together with additional
safety information discussed here.  Specifically, the Agency concludes that a
regulatory method is not needed for CALF-oid implants because the maximum
increased exposure, even considering probable misuse of the drug, is
demonstrated to be far below those concentrations considered unsafe.  FDA has
concluded that requiring a regulatory method for estradiol would be
inappropriate because doing so would yield a result so unreasonable that it
"could not be thoroughly attributed to Congressional design." <i>United
States vs. Rutherford</i>, 442 U.S. 554, # 545 (1979).<P> 
The Agency also concludes that CALF-oid is safe for over-the-counter (OTC)
distribution.  Directions on labeling and packaging are adequate and ear
implantation is a common method of administration of this type product within
the cattle industry.  Producers who use this product can be expected to
accomplish implantation safely and successfully.  Further, there is no special need to recognize a disease condition, the drug is not a "controlled substance," and after implantation there is no need for medical monitoring or evaluation of the treated animal.  Accordingly, prescription restriction of this product is not warranted.

<b>Generic Name of Drug:</b> Prednisolone, USP oral tablet 5.0 mg<P>
<b>Trade Name of Drug:</b> PrednisTab(TM)<P>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Prescription (Rx)<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> November 8, 1991<P>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><P>
PrednisTab(TM) is intended for use in dogs. The indications for PrednisTab(TM)
are the same as those for other anti-inflammatory steroids and comprise the
various collagen, dermal, allergic, ocular, otic, and musculoskeletal
conditions known to be responsive to the anti-inflammatory corticosteroids.
Representative of the conditions in which the use of steroid therapy and
the benefits to be derived therefrom have had repeated confirmation in the
veterinary literature are: (1) dermal conditions, such as nonspecific eczema,
summer dermatitis, and burns; (2) allergic manifestations, such as acute
urticaria, allergic dermatitis, drug and serum reactions, bronchial asthma, and
pollen sensitivities; (3) ocular conditions, such as iritis, iridocyclitis,
secondary glaucoma, uveitis, and chorioretinitis; (4) otic conditions, such as
otitis externa; (5) musculoskeletal conditions, such as myositis, rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, and bursitis; (6) various chronic or recurrent
diseases of unknown etiology such asulcerative colitis and nephrosis.<P>
In acute adrenal insufficiency, prednisolone may be effective because of its
ability to correct the defect in carbohydrate metabolism and relieve the
impaired diuretic response to water, characteristic of primary or secondary
adrenal insufficiency. However, because this agent lacks significant
mineralocorticoid activity, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, hydrocortisone, or
cortisone should be used when salt retention is indicated.<P>

<b>4. Effectiveness</b><P>
<b>a. Introduction</b><P>
The biological and anti-inflammatory activity of methylprednisolone in dogs has
been determined by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) review to be effective and safe. The April 12, 1969 Federal Register
publication reflects the Food and Drug Administration's concurrence with the
findings of the NAS/NRC review.<P>
Prednisolone and methylprednisolone are synthetic steroids, which chemically
and pharmacologically are very similar, both being classified as
corticosteroids. Authoritative standard texts, such as the <i>United States
Pharmacopeia Dispensing Information</i>&#160;(USP DI)(Ref.1); Schleimer, Claman and
Oronsky's <i>Anti-Inflammatory Steroid Action, Basic and Clinical
Aspects</i> (Ref.2); and Goodman and Gilman's <i>The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics</i> (Ref.4) were consulted. These references indicate that the
biochemical mechanism of action of the two drugs is essentially the same.<P>
The basic chemical structure of the glucocorticoids consists of 21 carbon atoms
with a total of 4 rings: three 6-carbon rings designated A, B, and C, and a
five- carbon ring, D.<P>
Essential features of anti-inflammatory steroids consist of the following: 1) a
2-carbon chain at C-17; 2) methyl groups at C-18 and C-19; 3) a ketone oxygen
at C-3; 4) an unsaturated bond between C-4 and C-5; 5) a hydroxyl group at
C-11; and 6) a ketone oxygen at C-20. This is depicted by the structure of
hydrocortisone (cortisol) in Figure 1.<P>

 ALT="Figure 3. Structure of Methylprednisolone">
 <P>Figure 3. Structure of Methylprednisolone<P>
The introduction of a double bond between C-1 and C-2 as shown in Figure 2
provides the structure for prednisolone, which has a fourfold enhancement of
corticosteroid activity as compared to hydrocortisone. The addition of a methyl
group at the 6alpha- position of prednisolone forms methylprednisolone as shown
in Figure 3. Methylprednisolone is slightly more potent in glucocorticoid
activity than prednisolone and has slightly less electrolyte regulating potency
than prednisolone.<P>
Available data (Refs.2, 3, 4) suggest a number of similarities in the metabolism of
methylprednisolone and prednisolone. Both prednisolone and methylprednisolone
undergo continuous enzyme-regulated interconversion by oxidation of the
11beta-hydroxyl group to the 11-keto group and its reduction back to the
11-hydroxy compound, i.e., reversible reactions to prednisolone and
methylprednisolone, respectively. The interconversion reaction takes place
primarily in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney. The reduced,
(11beta-hydroxy) forms, prednisolone and methylprednisolone, are the active
forms of these corticosteroids in the body.<P>
Reduction of the C-4, 5 double bond in both compounds occurs at both hepatic
and extrahepatic sites and yields a metabolite that is inactive. Subsequent
reduction in both compounds of the 3-ketone to a 3-hydroxyl to form a
tetrahydrocortisol occurs only in the liver. The reduced A-ring metabolites are
enzymatically conjugated primarily in the liver and to some extent the kidney
with sulfate or with glucuronic acid to form water-soluble sulfate esters or
glucuronides, which are excreted in the kidney. Biliary or fecal excretion is
not thought to be of quantitative importance.<P>
The major metabolic enzyme involved in the transformation of prednisolone and
methylprednisolone include the 11-beta- hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase and
20-keto-steroid reductase. The metabolic fate of methylprednisolone and
prednisolone may differ slightly and evidence for their interconversion by
methylation or demethylation is lacking.<P>
The duration of action of both prednisolone and methylprednisolone are such
that their dosage regimes are similar.<P>
The following pharmacokinetic data(Ref.5) (in humans) for methylprednisolone and
prednisolone compare the two drugs:<P>

The above data and the following data and discussion support the thesis that
absence of the methyl group on prednisolone has little effect on the relative
safety and efficacy of prednisolone in the dog.<P>
Methylprednisolone tablets in dogs were included in the NAS/NRC review while
only prednisolone solution and suspension were reviewed. Accordingly, a
bioequivalency study was conducted to demonstrate the comparative
bioavailability of Vet-A-Mix's PrednisTab(TM) (prednisolone) tablets to the
approved pioneer product, Upjohn's Medrol&#174; (methylprednisolone)
tablets, NADA #11-403, which was the product included in the NAS/NRC
review.<P>

Joseph W. Denhart, DVM, at the College of Veterinary Medicine in the Toxicology
section of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames,
Iowa 50011 for Vet-A-Mix, Inc., Shenandoah, Iowa 51601. The sponsor certifies
that the study was performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (21
CFR, Part 58). It was audited by Patricia J. Varilek, an independent Quality
Assurance Unit monitor, during critical phases, including dosing, testing and
data processing, to certify compliance with GLPs. The dosing dates for Period I
and Period II of the crossover study were July 28 and August 18, 1988,
respectively. All dogs were additionally tested on July 25 (pre-trial) and
August 25 (post-trial) for selected hematologic, serum biochemical and urine
parameters.<P>
<b>3) General design of the investigation:</b><P>
<b>a) Purpose of the study</b><P>

</PRE>
The basis for determining the relative 5:4 milligram dosage of PrednisTab(TM)
versus Medrol&#174; is documented under "Corroborative literary references."
Haynes and Murad (Ref.4) show that the relative anti-inflammatory potency of
Prednisolone to 6alpha-Methylprednisolone is 4 to 5. The relative sodium
retaining potency is 0.8 to 0.5 and the equivalent dosage (mg) is 5 mg for
prednisolone and 4 mg for 6alpha-methylprednisolone. Liddle (Ref.3), in comparing
the relative effectiveness of 6alpha-methylated and non- methylated steroids on
excretion of sodium and potassium in the adrenalectomized dog, show that the
relative potency of prednisolone and methylprednisolone to be 3 to 2
respectively. Wilcke and Davis (Ref.6), Ferguson (Ref.8), and Mulnix (Ref.11) 
all reiterate
that the relative anti- inflammatory potency of prednisolone to
methylprednisolone is 4 to 5. Medleau (Ref.14) states "Four milligrams of
methylprednisolone (Medrol&#174; - Upjohn) is equivalent to 5 mg of
prednisone or prednisolone."<P>
<b>i) Test duration</b><P>
The dogs were acclimated at least 14 days, followed by Period I in which each
dog in a group of 9 or 10 dogs was administered a single oral dose of one of
the two drugs. After a washout of 21 days the procedure was repeated in Period
II with a reversal of the drug sequence. The dogs were fasted 24 hours before
and 24 hours after administration of the drugs at each Period.<P>

<b>5) Statistical analysis</b><P>
<b>a) Discussion of the statistical results</b><P><DL>
<DT>(1) Identification of statistical method(s).
<DD>The Draft Bioequivalence Guidelines of CVM, Food and Drug Administration, April
1989, were used for statistical analysis utilizing the confidence interval
approach.<P><DL>
<DT>(a) Eosinophil Counts
<DD>The primary parameters statistically evaluated for eosinophils were area under
the curve (AUC), minimum concentration (Cmin) and time to minimum concentration
(Tmin).<P><DT>(b) Blood Glucose Concentrations
<DD>The primary parameters statistically evaluated for glucose concentration were
area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum
concentration (Tmax).<P></DL>
<DT>(2) Statistical Results
<DD><DL>
<DT>(a) Eosinophil Counts
<DD>The lower and upper 90% confidence interval percent of the reference drug for
the mean minimum eosinophil count (Cmin) were outside the 20% guidelines. This
reflects the number of zero values in the data pool that tended to cause a
skewing effect which has invalidated a parametric analysis for Cmin.<P>
The lower and upper 90% confidence interval percent of the reference drug for
both total area under the curve (AUC) and mean time to minimum eosinophil count
(Tmin) are within the 20% guideline limit for acceptance of equal bioactivity.
Therefore, Medrol&#174; and PrednisTab(TM), when dosed at comparative
doses, are bioequivalent when considering the anti-inflammatory action of
depletion of circulating eosinophils.<P>
<DT>(b) Blood Glucose Concentrations
<DD>The upper and lower 90% confidence interval percent of the reference drug for
the mean time to maximum plasma glucose concentration (Tmax) were outside the
20% guideline limits. The difference of approximately one- half hour between
the two drugs to attain maximum plasma glucose concentration is too short a
time to be biologically or therapeutically significant.<P>
The upper and lower 90% confidence interval percent of the reference drug for
total area under the curve and maximum glucose concentration (Cmax) are well
within the 20% guideline limit for acceptance of equal bioactivity. Therefore,
Medrol&#174; and PrednisTab(TM), when dosed at comparative doses, are
bioequivalent when considering the glucocorticoid action of increased plasma
glucose concentrations.<P></DL></DL>

<b>6) Conclusions</b><P>
The biological and anti-inflammatory activity of methylprednisolone in dogs has
been determined by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) review to be effective and safe. The April 12, 1969 Federal Register
publication reflects the Food and Drug Administration's concurrence with the
findings of the NAS/NRC review.<P>
The reference drug, methylprednisolone, with a 6-alpha methyl substitution on
ring B of the molecule, is an analogue of the test drug, prednisolone.<P>
The bioequivalency of the test drug, Vet-A-Mix's PrednisTab(TM), compared to
the approved reference drug, Medrol&#174;, was studied using two
physiological endpoints, the anti-inflammatory action of the drugs as measured
by depletion of circulating eosinophils and the glucocorticoid bioactivity as
measured by increased plasma glucose concentration.<P>
Statistical analyses of pharmacokinetic parameters using the confidence
interval approach demonstrated bioequivalence of the two drugs. Bioequivalence
was shown using the physiological endpoint of eosinophil counts as measured by
area under the curve and mean time to minimum eosinophil count. Bioequivalence
was shown using the physiological endpoint of increased plasma glucose
concentration as measured by area under the curve and maximum glucose
concentration.<P>
In addition, the clinical parameters tested indicated that the dogs were
essentially normal prior to dosing and that the drugs did not effect any
toxicological changes after dosing.<P>
<b>7) Adverse Reactions</b><P>
No adverse reactions that could be ascribed to treatments were noted in this
study.<P>
<b>5. Animal Safety</b><P>
The biological and anti-inflammatory activity of methylprednisolone in dogs has
been determined by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) review to be effective and safe. The April 12, 1969 Federal Register
publication reflects the Food and Drug Administration's concurrence with the
findings of the NAS/NRC review.<P>
The detailed narrative comparison of methylprednisolone and prednisolone should
be referenced from pages 2 to 4. This information, bioequivalency data on pages
7 to 11 and additional clinical parameters measured pre and post- trial on page
10 support the thesis that absence of the 6alpha-methyl group on prednisolone
has little effect on the relative safety of prednisolone in the dog. The
conclusions of the bioequivalency study may be found on pages 11 and 12.<P>

Administration of a glucocorticoid results in an increase in the concentration
of glucose in the blood. An increase in gluconeogenesis, a decrease in
synthesis of new protein, altered lipid metabolism, and an anti-insulin effect
all contribute to this action.<P>
B. Glucocorticoids as Drugs<P>
...prednisone...lacks glucocorticoid activity until it is converted to
prednisolone. If hepatic function is in doubt, the active drug prednisolone
should be administered in preference to the prodrug prednisone.<P>

C. Chronic Administration of Glucocorticoids<P>
The wide range of anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of the
glucocorticoids leads to their use in the treatment of a variety of diseases.
The general indications for glucocorticoid therapy include ocular disease,
hepatic disorders, malignant hematologic disease, solid tumors, intestinal
disease, and most prominently immune-mediated and inflammatory-mediated
disease.<P>
The most successful approach to minimizing glucocorticoid side effects has been
the application of alternate-day therapy.<P>
D. Alternate-day Glucocorticoid Therapy<P>
Any patient being placed on chronic (longer than 14 days) steroid therapy
should be considered as a candidate for alternate-day therapy.<P>
Glucocorticoids suitable for this method have a duration of action of 12 to 36
hours. Prednisolone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone are suitable for this
method. ...the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis will be given a steroid-free
rest which will allow the axis to maintain some degree of responsiveness to
external stimuli.<P>

its therapeutic efficacy. <i>J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc</i>. 185:1098-1011.<P>
Corticosteroids can be safely and effectively used if the various factors
influencing dose and duration of action are considered vis-a'-vis the
biological response desired. Consideration of ester, vehicle, physical form,
and route are not esoteric exercises, but are critical for rational clinical
application of these drugs.<P>

Part 1. <i>Mod. Vet. Pract</i>. 66:101-105.<P>
A. Though glucocorticoids are widely used in veterinary medicine, there is
little objective information available on the efficacy and safety of these
drugs in domestic animals. Rational use, therefore, largely depends on clinical
experience and extrapolation of data from other species. Clinicians should
consider anticipated duration of therapy, individual patient factors, the dose
and preparation of glucocorticoid, and alternative modes of therapy that would
limit potential side effects of glucocorticoids.<P>
B. Glucocorticoids increase gluconeogenesis, decrease protein anabolism,
suppress production of ACTH, TSH, GH and cortisol, inhibit inflammation, cause
polyuria, polydipsia, immunosuppression, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and have
positive inotropic and chronotropic cardiac effects. They are only palliative
and not curative, and may mask signs of underlying disease. Short-acting
glucocorticoids should be used for long-term replacement or alternate-day
therapy, while intermediate or long- acting glucocorticoids may be appropriate
for initial immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory therapy.<P>

(9) MacDonald, J. M. 1987. The use of glucocorticoid therapy in small animal
dermatology. <i>Dermatology Reports</i>&#160;6:8.<P>
A. The practice of dermatology would be extremely compromised without the use
of glucocorticoids. Despite their necessity, glucocorticoids are the most
overused and abused group of therapeutic agents. With rational use of these
drugs, though, the plethora of side effects associated with their
administration usually can be prevented. In dermatology, glucocorticoids are
used for their anti-inflammatory (pruritic dermatoses such as atopy, flea
allergy, scabies) or immunosuppressive (autoimmune dermatoses such as the
pemphigus complex, lupus, pemphigoid, vasculitides) effects. Anticipated
duration of therapy is a prime factor in drug selection and regimen of
treatment. The specific disease being treated has a bearing on the dosage. Most
glucocorticoids are administered systemically; there are fewer indications for
topical therapy. Oral administration is preferred because it can be more
closely regulated and it is the only safe method of long-term therapy.<P>
B. If the anticipated duration of systemic therapy is less than three to four
weeks (short term), the selection of glucocorticoids is not critical; however,
if the disease requires long-term therapy (a period of more than three to four
weeks), drug selection should be restricted to oral, short-acting drugs.
Prednisolone, prednisone, or methylprednisolone is suitable for long-term oral
administration.<P>
C. Anti-inflammatory therapy includes induction and maintenance regimes.
Induction therapy of an oral glucocorticoid is achieved through the
administration of prednisone or prednisolone given SID or divided BID for five
to seven days. The anti-inflammatory maintenance dosage may be administered
every other morning.<P>
D. Patients requiring maintenance therapy should be placed on an alternate-day
regimen. Only short-acting oral glucocorticoids (prednisolone, prednisone, and
methylprednisolone) should be used for this purpose. Alternate-day oral
treatment with long- or intermediate- acting glucocorticoids such as
triamcinolone, dexamethasone, or betamethasone defeats the purpose of
alternate-day regimen, which is to provide the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis a steroid-free rest.<P>
E. Glucocorticoids are an essential part of dermatologic therapy and are relied
upon regularly for control of a variety of dermatoses. Side effects are
minimized by the alternate-day administration of the smallest effective dose
and the exclusion of dermatoses that are not steroid responsive.<P>
(10) Ferguson, D. C. 1985. Rational glucocorticoid therapy
in small animals, Part II. <i>Mod. Vet. Pract</i>. 66:175-179.<P>
Such short-acting glucocorticoids as hydrocortisone, cortisone, prednisolone
and prednisone should be used for replacement therapy or treatment of shock.
Glucocorticoids may be used alone or with nonsteroidal drugs for
immunosuppression. Nonsteroidal analgesics may be used to supplement the
beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in palliative treatment of chronic
arthritis or hip dysplasia. Alternate-day glucocorticoid use minimizes side
effects and is safer in case of sudden cessation of therapy. Alternate-day
therapy should be preceded by a period of daily use and should end with
gradually reduced doses. Withdrawal of glucocorticoids should be gradual and
prolonged to avoid complications. The ACTH stimulation test is used to assess
adrenocortical function. Glucocorticoids should be supplemented in times of
stress for animals with adrenocortical insufficiency.<P>

<DT>B. Rational Use of Corticosteroids in the Dog
<DD>1. Reasons for Using Corticosteroids as Therapeutic Agents
<DL>
<DD>a. Replacement therapy as in hypoadrenocorticism or following bilateral
adrenalectomy
<DD>b. Treat wide variety of nonendocrine disorders - this is the most common
reason for their use<P></DL>

<DD>2. Contraindications to the Indiscriminate Use of Glucocorticoids
<DL>
<DD>a. Pregnancy
<DD>b. Topical steroids in presence of corneal ulcer
<DD>c. Deep fungal infections
<DD>d. Generalized bone disease (osteoporosis)
<DD>e. Diabetes mellitus
<DD>f. Evidence of chronic infection<P></DL>
<DD>3. General System Indications for the Glucocorticoids are as follows:
<DL>
<DD>a. Ocular therapy
<DL>
<DD>Glucocorticoids are a great help in the treatment of noninfectious inflammatory
lesions of the eye. The complications that arise due to glucocorticoid use are
many. Glaucoma is a steroid-induced condition that seems to be seen only in man
and has a genetic link. Posterior subcapsular cataracts have been seen in
animals (dogs and rabbits) on high dosages of systemic steroids for prolonged
periods.<br>
Steroids are contraindicated if there is any suspicion of a fungal or viral
component to an ocular lesion. They will potentiate the problem which could
lead to irreversible damage.<br>
Both reversible pupillary dilation and ptosis have been reported with the use
of glucocorticoids.</DL>
<DD>b. Hepatic disease<DL>
<DD>Steroids seem to have no beneficial use in treating hepatopathies except in the
case of chronic active hepatitis in the dog.</DL>
<DD>c. Malignant hematologic diseases<DL>
<DD>The clinician is mainly concerned with lymphomas, lymphatic leukemia, and
multiple myeloma. Glucocorticoids are used for two purposes in treating these
disease conditions. First, they seem to directly destroy the neoplastic cells
by inhibiting RNA, protein synthesis, and glucose utilization. Secondly, the
steroids are useful in treating the secondary complications such as
thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and hypercalcemia.</DL>
<DD>d. Treatment of solid tumors<DL>
<DD>The glucocorticoids are used for secondary effects, i.e.,
hypercalcemia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and
cerebral edema associated with metastatic or primary
brain tumor.</DL>
<DD>e. Shock
<DL>
<DD>There has been much controversy in the use of steroids in shock. The following
is a brief summary of the effects of steroids in shock.
<DD>1) Cardiovascular effects<DL>
<DD>Steroids have not been proven to improve the cardiac output in any case of
shock. Corticosteroids do not directly influence vascular responsiveness or
function as adrenergic-blocking agents, nor are they direct vasodilators.</DL>
<DD>2) Membrane stability<DL>
<DD>Steroids are known to stabilize lysosomal membranes which contain acid
hydrolases. Corticosteroids can prevent injury to capillary basement membrane
and endothelium caused by endotoxin. There is evidence that corticosteroids
help to restore the metabolism of underperfused tissue toward normal.</DL>
<DD>3) Metabolic effect<DL>
<DD>Corticosteroids may reverse some of the metabolic abnormalities associated with
oxidative metabolism. In endotoxic shock there is definite benefit due to
stabilization of the endothelium and detoxification of the endotoxin.</DL>
</DL>
<DD>f. Intestinal disease<DL>
<DD>Glucocorticoids have been used in treating ulcerative colitis, regional
enteritis and granulomatous colitis. The steroids reduce the inflammatory
process along with restoring the integrity of the mucosal lining. The steroids
are used for only a brief period of time to stabilize the condition.</DL>
<DD>g. Infectious diseases<DL>
<DD>Steroids should be used only as a last resort measure in those patients with
serious infectious diseases. This measure is done more for the comfort of the
patient than for treatment of the disease. Corticosteroids alter the host
defense mechanism by: (1) suppression of acute and chronic inflammatory
responses; (2) alteration of immunologic responsiveness; (3) impairment of the
normal intracellular mechanism for disposal of ingested foreign material by
phagocytic cells; (4) diminution of interferon synthesis; and (5) interference
with healing of the injured tissue.</DL>
<DD>h. Allergic disease<DL>
<DD>The corticosteroids deplete histamine stores and delay resynthesis of histamine
by degranulated mast cells. This reduces the hypersensitive and allergic
reactions of patients. Steroids also have a direct suppressive action on
pruritus. It must be remembered that steroids are only a symptomatic
treatment.</DL>
<DD>i. Collagen vascular diseases<DL>
<DD>In this group of diseases are included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and
polymyositis. They have responded well to glucocorticoids and should be used in
the treatment regimen.</DL></DL>

Dermatology</i>. 3rd ed. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA. Pages
166-174.<P>
Glucocorticoid Hormone in Dermatologic Therapy<P>
A. The major indications for glucocorticoid therapy are hypersensitive
dermatoses (flea allergy dermatitis, atopy, food hypersensitivity), acute moist
dermatitis ("hot spot"), contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic), autoimmune
dermatoses (pemphigus, pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus) and acral lick
dermatitis.<P>
B. Of the systemic routes, oral administration is preferred because (1) it can
be more closely regulated (a daily dose is more precise than with a repository
injection; the drug can be rapidly withdrawn if undesirable side effects
occur), and (2) it is the only safe, therapeutic, physiologic way to administer
glucocorticoids for more long-term therapy.<P>
C. Factors that must be considered include the duration of therapy, the
personality of the patient, the personality and reliability of the owner, the
response of the patient to the drug, the response of the patient's disease to
the drug, and other patient-disease considerations.<P>
D. Dermatologically speaking, clinicians usually talk in terms of
anti-inflammatory versus immunosuppressive doses, and induction versus
maintenance doses of glucocorticoids.<P>
E. Maintenance therapy with oral glucocorticoid is best accomplished with
prednisolone, prednisone, or methylprednisolone on an alternate-day basis.<P>
F. Rarely, anti-inflammatory alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy with the
preferred prednisolone, prednisone, or methylprednisolone will not be
successful. In these cases, the clinician has three therapeutic options
(assuming that glucocorticoid therapy is all that can be done): 1) administer
prednisolone, prednisone, methylprednisolone on a daily basis, informing the
owner of the inevitability of iatrogenic hyperglucocorticoidism; 2) switch to a
more potent oral glucocorticoid on an alternate-day basis; or 3) switch to
injectable glucocorticoids. Although the more potent oral glucocorticoids are
usually not satisfactory for alternate-day therapy (because of potency and
duration of effect, they do not spare the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal
axis).<P>
G. Expected side effects with anti-inflammatory induction therapy include
polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia. These are usually unavoidable, of little
health significance, tolerated by most owners, and eliminated or greatly
minimized when alternate-day maintenance therapy is achieved. Far less common,
but much more alarming, are behavioral changes (depression, somnolence,
viciousness), panting, and diarrhea (which may be bloody). These usually
necessitate stopping therapy and often can be minimized or eliminated by
switching to a different glucocorticoid.<P>
H. Significant side effects with appropriate anti- inflammatory systemic
glucocorticoid regimens are uncommon in dogs, occurring in less than 10 percent
of the animals treated. However, with immunosuppressive regimens, the incidence
and severity of glucocorticoid side effects escalate alarmingly, and less than
50 percent of the dogs so treated can be satisfactorily managed.<P>
I. Evaluation of results during corticosteroid therapy is very important. The
risks of appropriate systemic anti- inflammatory glucocorticoid therapy to an
otherwise healthy dog are minimal. The risks of immunosuppressive doses are of
greater concern, especially since the medication is usually prescribed for
serious or life- threatening diseases.<P>

Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA.<P>
<B>Guidelines which should be followed when corticosteroids are administered
include the following:</B><P>
A. Use at correct dosage rate and frequency for a defined and appropriate
indication.<BR>
B. A single large dose of a glucocorticoid is unlikely to be harmful.<BR>
C. Prolonged therapy, at doses above substitution level, may produce harmful
effects.<BR>
D. Depression of the HHAA may occur and several months are required for
recovery to take place.<BR>
E. For long-term therapy, early morning alternate-day administration minimizes
detrimental effects on the HHAA (use short- or medium-acting
corticosteroids).<BR>
F. Taper off doses gradually in chronic cases and administer
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to promote function of depressed adrenal
cortex.<BR>
G. Recognize disadvantages of long-acting corticosteroids and
depo-preparations--especially with regard to HHAA suppression.<BR>
H. Long-term therapy should be accompanied by dietary supplementation with
high-quality protein, potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D.<BR>
I. The risk/benefit ratio of the concurrent use of corticosteroids and
antimicrobial agents should be appraised in each case. Bactericidal antibiotics
are preferred.<BR>
J. Where acute inflammatory reactions may produce lifelong impairment of an
organ's function, early effective doses of corticosteroids are vital.<BR>
K. Always recognize that corticosteroids may obscure clinical signs because of
the euphoric effects produced, together with improved appetite, reduced fever,
pain alleviation, and diminished inflammatory reaction.<P>

(14) Medleau, L. 1990. Linking chronic steroid-responsive pruritus to
allergies. <i>Vet. Med</i>. 85:259-271.<P>
The major differential diagnoses for dogs with pruritus that resolves with
anti-inflammatory doses of steroids are atopy, food-allergic dermatitis,
flea-allergic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis. To complicate
matters, dogs may have multiple allergies. Intradermal skin testing is used to
rule out flea and inhalant allergies. Food allergies are ruled out by feeding
the dog a trial hypoallergenic diet. And a diagnosis of allergic contact
dermatitis is based on clinical signs, exclusion of other allergic causes, and,
if possible, identification of the contact allergen.<P>

on daily and alternate-day prednisone administration. <i>Am. J. Vet. Res</i>.
40:936-941.<P>
The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate functional and morphologic
suppression of the adrenal cortex in dogs given daily physiological doses,
daily pharmacological doses, and alternate-day doses of prednisone over a
4-week period.<P>
Three groups of eight normal dogs each were orally given prednisone at doses of
0.22 mg/kg of body weight/day, 0.55 mg/kg/day, or 1.1 mg/kg on alternate
mornings. Four dogs served as nontreated controls. Samples were obtained from
members of each group to determine baseline serum cortisol and ACTH-stimulated
cortisol values and histologic features in the lateral thoracic skin before
prednisone administration, and after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of administration.
Some animals from each group were necropsied after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of
prednisone administration.<P>
Each course of prednisone administration resulted in adrenocortical atrophy and
hypofunction, but adrenocortical suppression was less severe and slower in
onset in the group given prednisone on alternate days. Extra-adrenal effects
observed were atrophy of the skin and focal, fatty change of the liver. These
changes were most evident in dogs given daily pharmacologic doses of prednisone
(0.55 mg/kg/day). Fewer extra-adrenal effects were observed in dogs given
alternate-day therapy. There were no extra-adrenal lesions in the dogs given
equivalent glucocorticoid replacement doses (0.22 mg/kg/day).<P>

in dogs given methylprednisolone. <i>Am. J. Vet. Res</i>. 41:1503-1506.<P>
Serum cortisol (hydrocortisone) was measured by radioimmunoassay in dogs given
methylprednisolone (MP) orally or methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) IM. The MP
was given on a daily and on an alternate-day basis to different treatment
groups and the MPA was administered weekly. Samples of blood were obtained
twice a week over a 9-week treatment period for serum cortisol determination,
and the adrenal gland response to ACTH was assessed on post-treatment days 1,
3, 5, and 7. Administration of MP on an alternate or daily basis caused a
slight but significant (P &lt; 0.05) depression in mean resting cortisol values
over time. The MPA administration caused a severe depression of resting serum
cortisol values. In response to ACTH, cortisol values invariably increased
sharply in non-treated control dogs and in those dogs given MP on an alternate-
day basis. Dogs given MP daily had a depressed response to ACTH. The MPA
treatment resulted in adrenal cortices that were unresponsive to ACTH. Dogs
given MPA, but not challenge exposed with ACTH, had markedly lowered cortisol
values for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment. Consequently, a
difference between daily- and alternate-day MP administration was detected
after ACTH challenge exposure; MPA administration inhibited adrenal cortisol
secretion for at least the duration of the experiment.<P>

A. Prednisolone suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis for
24 to 36 hours. Administration of glucocorticoids to dogs for 1 to 2 weeks is
unlikely to have a prolonged effect on the adrenal cortex. However, following
prolonged administration, adrenal cortical atrophy is possible.<P>
B. Recovery of adrenal function occurs relatively quickly in dogs after chronic
steroid administration.<P>
C. Although adrenocortical insufficiency following long- term glucocorticoid
therapy has been demonstrated in dogs, via ACTH stimulation test results,
clinical signs of iatrogenic hypoadrenocorticism have been uncommon.<P>

B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA.<P>
A. The oral route for glucocorticoid therapy is preferred in most systemic
illnesses. Oral dose forms are usually tablets containing the free steroid
alcohol. Oral absorption is usually quite rapid, and plasma half-lives are
relatively brief. Unlike many other drugs, however, the duration of
glucocorticoid biologic action (as measured by suppression of the hypothalamus
and/or pituitary) does not directly parallel the plasma half- life but persists
for some time after plasma levels decline. This apparent discrepancy is
understood by reiterating that glucocorticoids act by enhancing transcription
of both messenger RNA and ribosomal RNA in individual cells, thus creating a
wide array of results as well as different durations of action.<P>
B. Prednisolone and methylprednisolone are considered intermediate (12-36
hours) in duration of action.<P>
C. Glucocorticoids inhibit inflammation whether the inciting agent is radiant,
mechanical, chemical, infectious, or immune-mediated. Such therapy is
palliative in that the underlying cause of a disorder may remain but its
clinical manifestations are suppressed. This ability to suppress inflammation,
regardless of its cause, has made glucocorticoids valuable therapeutic agents.
However, these encompassing properties also make glucocorticoid therapy
dangerous because these agents are potent at masking the clinical expression of
a disease process. The inflammation that allows the clinician to evaluate a
chosen course of therapy can be completely suppressed, allowing a disease to
continue or worsen but not be identified. As with any therapy, the benefits of
glucocorticoid medication must be weighed against the risks of their use.<P>

Central nervous system depression associated with<br>
glucocorticoid ingestion in a dog. <i>JAVMA</i>. 173:91-92.<P>
Signs of a central nervous system disorder were observed following 2 instances
of accidental ingestion of glucocorticoid, one time being 250 mg of
prednisolone in tablets, in a young female Doberman Pinscher. The signs
included transient aggressive and paranoid behavior, amaurosis, disorientation,
ataxia with circling backward and depression. Vomiting, weight loss, and
abnormal drinking behavior persisted for several weeks following recovery from
the acute illness.<P>

<i>Am. J. Vet. Res</i>. 40:1742-1747.<P>
Effects of oral prednisolone (OP) on the development of immune responses of
Beagle pups to canine distemper virus (CDV) were studied. Dogs were treated
with OP for 21 days, twice a day for the first 7 days, once a day for the next
7 days, and on alternate days for the last 7 days. Dogs given dosages of OP (1
mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) showed a normal in vivo immunogenic response after CDV
vaccination and survived a virulent CDV challenge exposure, whereas nontreated,
non-vaccinated dogs became ill or died after challenge exposure. The most
marked effect of corticosteroid treatment on the immune system was the graded
phytoimmunosuppressive effect upon the lymphocyte blast transformation test.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>
<b>a. Human Food Safety</b><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is to be labeled for oral use
in dogs, which are non-food animals.<P>
<B>b. Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration</B><P>
The labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
This is a "pipeline DESI" product. This application was filed November 3, 1988
under the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) policy for New Animal Drug
Applications (NADA), prior to November 16, 1988 enactment of the Generic Animal
Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) (refer to the fourth policy
letter for GADPTRA, November 2, 1989). The NADA, filed under DESI policy, is
based on a demonstration of bioequivalence of an approved pre-1962 pioneer
product and an "identical, like or related" "me-too" product.<P>
This NADA is for PrednisTab(TM) (prednisolone) tablets, an oral
anti-inflammatory drug for use in dogs. The pre-1962 pioneer product is
Medrol&#174; (methylprednisolone) tablets, NADA #11-403, sponsored by the
Upjohn Co. The National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC)
DESI Review determined methylprednisolone tablets to be effective and safe as
an oral anti-inflammatory agent for dogs. The April 12, 1969 Federal Register
publication reflects the Food and Drug Administration's concurrence with the
findings of the NAS/NRC review.<P>
A bioequivalency study comparing the anti-inflammatory activity of the two
steroids was completed prior to November 16, 1988 enactment of GADPTRA. Based
on the established potency rating of 1 for hydrocortisone, the relative
anti-inflammatory potencies of prednisolone and methylprednisolone are 4:5,
respectively (A. G. Gilman et al, eds. The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics, 8th ed., 1990, p. 1447). The above referenced study conducted by
Vet-A-Mix confirmed the relative potencies and established the bioequivalence
of prednisolone/methylprednisolone at a dosage ratio of 5:4, respectively.<P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the regulations. It demonstrates
that PrednisTab (prednisolone), when used under the labeled conditions of use,
is safe and effective.<P>
The approval of this NADA is based on the demonstration of bioequivalency with
a pre-1962 NAS/NRC (DESI) reviewed product; therefore, the product does not
qualify for marketing exclusivity.<P>
The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because a knowledge of veterinary medicine is needed for the accurate diagnosis
of conditions for which the drug is intended and for determination of
appropriate dose, monitoring of treatment, and detection of possible adverse
reactions.<P>

<b>Marketing Status:</b>   OTC <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  June 29, 1994<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b><p>
This supplement provides for removal of the requirement of a pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal period for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with lasalocid and
tylosin. Previous approvals have required a 48 hour  pre-slaughter drug
withdrawal for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when fed in combination with
these drugs.<p>
<b>II.    Indications for Use</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the existing indications for these combinations
which are:<p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate and lasalocid in combination is indicated
for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and suppression of
estrus (heat) in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter.<p>
The feeding of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination is
indicated for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency,
suppression of estrus (heat) and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in
heifers fed in confinement for slaughter.<p>
<b>III.	Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b> <p>
	<b>Dosage Form:</b>                        Feed<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>                Oral<p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>	Melengestrol acetate:  0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
Lasalocid (as lasalocid sodium):  100 to 360 mg/head/day (5 to 30 g/ton 	air
dried complete feed).<br>	Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate):	90 mg/head/day (8 to
10 g/ton air dried 
	complete feed)<p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate per head
per day in combination with 100 to 360 mg lasalocid per head per day either
with or without 90 mg tylosin per head per day to heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter. The supplement containing melengestrol acetate is fed at a rate
of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head.<p>
<b>IV.    Effectiveness</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the efficacy of these combinations.<p>
<b>V.    Animal Safety</b><p>
This supplement does not affect the target animal safety of these
combinations.<p>
<b>VI.    Human Safety</b><p>
<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b><p>
<b>Melengestrol acetate</b><p>
 
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental
application for melengestrol acetate (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402), concurrently
approved with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period.<p>
<b>Lasalocid</b><p>
 
In cattle parent lasalocid has been established as the marker residue for total
lasalocid sodium residues, liver was selected as the target tissue and 0.7 ppm
for parent lasalocid in liver was established as the tolerance (21 CFR
556.347). No pre-slaughter withdrawal period is required for cattle fed
lasalocid (21 CFR 558.311).<p>
<b>Tylosin</b><p>
 
A tolerance of 0.2 ppm has been established for negligible residues of tylosin
in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21 CFR 556.740). No  pre-slaughter
withdrawal period is required for cattle fed tylosin (21 CFR 558.625).<p>
<b>2.	Residue depletion following combination feeding of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin.</b><p>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's
138-904 and 138-992, dated 30 April 1990; and NADA's 139-876 and 140-288, dated
16 December 1987; demonstrate that the concentration of melengestrol acetate in
fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the approval of the
supplemental application for MGA (NADA's  34-254 and  39-402) and that the
concentration of lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their tolerances when
heifers are fed melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination,
each at their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
drug withdrawal. This study is summarized below:<p>
Groups of heifers were fed for 90 days either no additive (control, n=14) or
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin in combination at 1X (n=7), 3X
(n=7) or 5X (n=7) the highest approved dosage for each additive (lX = 0.5 mg
melengestrol acetate, 30 g lasalocid/ton air dried feed and 10 g tylosin/ton
air dried feed). The heifers were slaughtered at practical zero withdrawal.<p>
Perirenal fat samples were collected from all heifers for analysis of
melengestrol acetate residue using the official AOAC method (JAOAC
59:507-515:1976). This method has a limit of sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat
samples from the control heifers and 5 of 7 heifers in the 1X treatment group
had concentration of melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. Fat samples from the
remaining two heifers in the 1X group contained melengestrol acetate at 12.7
and 13.7 ppb. The average concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat samples
from the 3X and 5X dose groups were 37.6 ppb (range 30.9 to 46.3 ppb) and 49.4
ppb (range 36.6 to 57.0 ppb), respectively.<p>
Liver samples were collected from seven of the control heifers and from the
seven heifers in the 1X treatment group for analysis of lasalocid and tylosin
residues. No residues of tylosin were detected in any of the samples. The limit
of detection for the assay utilized was 0.1 ppm.<p>
No lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from the control heifers.
Lasalocid was detected in the liver samples from each of the 7 heifers in the
1X group with a mean and standard deviation of 0.09 +/- 0.11 ppm. The highest
individual value was 0.26 ppm. All concentrations of lasalocid were well below
the tolerance limit of 0.7 ppm in liver.<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
These data demonstrate that following feeding of melengestrol acetate, tylosin
and lasalocid in combination, the concentration of melengestrol acetate in fat
is below the established tolerance for melengestrol acetate and residues of
lasalocid and tylosin in liver are below their established tolerances when
heifers are slaughtered without a pre-slaughter withdrawal.<p>
<b>3.	Assay noninterference</b><p>
Data included in previous Freedom of Information Summaries for these NADA's
have demonstrated;<p>
1)	the presence of lasalocid and tylosin does not interfere with 	the tissue
residue assay for melengestrol acetate;<p>2)	presence of lasalocid and
melengestrol acetate does not 	interfere with the tissue residue assay for
tylosin; and<p>
It has also been demonstrated that the presence of melengestrol acetate does
not interfere with the tissue residue assay for lasalocid (NADA 96-298;<i> J.Agri.
 Food Chem.</i>&#160; 31:75-78:1983).<p>
<b>4.    Regulatory methods</b><p>
Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid and tylosin may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual </i>&#160;on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Parklawn
Building, Room 12A30).<p>
<b>5.	Conclusions</b><p>
This supplement provides for deletion of the requirement for a 48 hour
 pre-slaughter drug withdrawal period when melengestrol acetate and lasalocid are
fed in combination either with or without tylosin. No changes are made in
either the approved dosages of any of these drugs, the approved indications of
use or in the target class of livestock. The data submitted support the
conclusion that residues of melengestrol acetate in fat are below the
established tolerance for melengestrol acetate when heifers are slaughtered
without a pre-slaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin. Accordingly, approval of this
change in pre-slaughter withdrawal period from 48 hours to no withdrawal is not
expected to have adverse effects on public health or food safety.<p>
<b>VII.	Agency Conclusions</b><p>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour
withdrawal period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination either with lasalocid or with
lasalocid and tylosin. This supplement evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity
data for MGA contained in NADA's  34-254 and  39-402.<p>
Adequate data were submitted which permitted the Agency to conclude that a
withdrawal period is not necessary for heifers fed these combinations.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

                                (5 to 30 g/ton air dried complete feed).

</pre>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.4 mg melengestrol acetate
per head per day in combination with 5 to 30 g monensin per ton of air dried
complete feed. Each additive may be provided via separate supplements or in a
single combination supplement either liquid or dry. The supplement containing
melengestrol acetate must be fed at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 pounds per head and
may be top dressed onto or mixed with a complete feed containing monensin.<P>

<b>IV. Effectiveness</b><P> 
This supplement does not affect the labeled indications for this combination.<P>

<b>V.  Animal Safety</b> <P>
The supplement does not affect target animal safety for this combination.<P> 

<b>VI. Human Safety</b> <P> 

<b>1. Tolerance and withdrawal period.</b><P>
As stated in the Freedom of Information Summary for the supplemental application
for melengestrol acetate (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402), concurrently approved
with this application, the tolerance of melengestrol acetate (MGA) is
established as 25 ppb in edible tissue of treated animals and fat is designated
as the target tissue for monitoring purposes. The approval also provides for
the deletion of the 48-hour withdrawal period.<P> 

A tolerance of 0.05 ppm
has been established for negligible residues of monensin in the edible tissues
of cattle (<B>21 CFR 556.420</B>). No preslaughter withdrawal period is required for
cattle fed monensin (<B>21 CFR 558.355</B>).<P>

<b>2. Residue depletion.</b><P>
Data previously summarized in Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's
124-309 and 125-476, dated 30 April 1990, demonstrate that the concentration of
melengestrol acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb established by the
approval of the supplemental application for MGA (NADA's 034-254 and 039-402) and
that the concentration of monensin in liver is below its tolerance when heifers
are fed melengestrol acetate, tylosin and monensin in combination; each at
their highest approved dosage, and slaughtered without a pre-slaughter
withdrawal. This study is summarized below.<P>

Groups of heifers were fed
for 90 days either no additive (control, n=14) or melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin in combination at 1X (n=7), 3X (n=7) or 5X (n=7) the
highest dosage approved for the three-way combination of these three additives
(1X = 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate, 30 g monensin/ton air dried feed and 10 g
tylosin/ton air dried feed). This provided melengestrol acetate at dosages of
1.25X, 3.75X and 6.25X the highest approved dosage (0.4 mg/day) for the two-way
combination of melengestrol acetate and monensin. The heifers were slaughtered
at practical zero withdrawal.<P>

Perirenal fat samples were collected
from all heifers for quantification of melengestrol acetate concentration using
the method described in JAOAC 59:507-515:1976. This method has a limit of
sensitivity of 10 ppb. All fat samples from heifers in the control and 1X
treatment groups had concentrations of melengestrol acetate below 10 ppb. The
average concentrations of melengestrol acetate in fat samples from heifers in
the 3X and 5X dose groups were 29.2 ppb (range 18.2 to 39.6 ppb) and 42.2 ppb
(range 35.8 to 49 ppb), respectively.<P>Liver samples were collected
from seven of the control heifers and from the seven heifers in the 1X
treatment group for analysis of monensin and tylosin concentration. Neither
monensin or tylosin were detected in any of the liver samples. The limits of
detection for these analyses were 0.04 and 0.1 ppm for monensin and tylosin,
respectively.<P>

<b>3. Conclusion</b><P> 
The concentration of melengestrol
acetate in fat is below the tolerance of 25 ppb and residues of monensin in
liver are below the established tolerance for monensin when heifers are
slaughtered without a preslaughter withdrawal following feeding of melengestrol
acetate and monensin in combination at their highest approved dosage
levels.<P>

<b>4. Assay noninterference</b>
<P> Data have been summarized in
Freedom of Information Summaries for NADA's 124-309, 125-476, 138-792 and
138-870 demonstrating that presence of melengestrol acetate does not interfere
with the tissue residue assay for monensin and presence of monensin does not
interfere with the tissue residue assay for melengestrol acetate.<P>

<b>5. Regulatory methods</b>
<P>Practical regulatory methods for analysis of tissue
residues of melengestrol acetate and monensin may be found in the <i>Food
Additives Analytical Manual</i> on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Parklawn Building, Room 12A30).<P>

<b>6. Conclusions</b><P>
This supplement provides for the removal of the regulation for a 48 hour
preslaughter drug withdrawal period for melengestrol acetate when melengestrol
acetate and monensin are fed in combination. No changes are made in either the
approved dosage range of either compound or in the target class of livestock.
The data submitted support the conclusion that the concentration of
melengestrol acetate in fat is below the established tolerance for melengestrol
acetate and that the concentration of monensin in liver is below the
established tolerance for monensin when heifers are slaughtered without a
preslaughter withdrawal following the combined feeding of melengestrol acetate
and monensin at their highest approved dosage level. Accordingly, approval of
this change is not expected to have adverse effects on public health or food
safety.<P>

<b>VII. Agency Conclusions</b> 
<P> Under the Center's
supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is a Category II
change providing for the removal of the requirement for a 48 hour withdrawal
period prior to slaughter for heifers fed melengestrol acetate when
melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with monensin. This supplement
evoked a reevaluation of the toxicity data for MGA contained in NADA's 034-254
and 039-402.<P> Adequate data were submitted in NADA's 034-354, 039-402,
124-309, and 125-476 which permitted the Agency to conclude that a withdrawal
period is not necessary for heifers fed this combination.<P> Under
section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this
approval for food animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because
the supplemental application did not contain new clinical or field
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS</b><P> 
 
Six floor pen experiments were conducted using approved 
protocols and 23,676 broiler chickens. Bacitracin 
methylene disalicylate at 0, 10, 25 and 50 grams per ton 
of feed was used in five of the experiments, while 0, 5 
and 50 grams per ton was used in one. Roxarsone at 0, 
11.3, 22.7 and 45.4 grams per ton was used in five of the 
experiments, while 0 and 45.4 grams per ton was used in 
one. Monensin sodium at 110 grams per ton was included in 
all experimental feeds. The experiments were designed to 
test the effects of bacitracin methylene disalicylate in 
the presence of monensin on body weight gains and feed 
efficiency.<P>

<b>Floor Pen Experiments Summary</b><P> 
 
Six adequate and well-controlled floor pen experiments, 
using approved protocols and 23,676 broiler chickens (in 
five experiments equal numbers of males and females, in 
one experiment all males) were conducted under conditions 
simulating actual field use to determine the growth 
promoting effects of bacitracin methylene disalicylate in 
the presence of monensin. Although these experiments were 
originally designed as titration studies, for purposes of 
this submission, only the highest levels of bacitracin 
methylene disalicylate (50 grams per ton) in the presence 
of monensin (110 grams per ton) are considered.<P> 
 
The efficacy data were evaluated according to the 
combination drug guidelines revised October 1983: Drugs 
approved individually at a range and codified in the CFR 
are not required to be titrated in the combination. 
However, each drug's contribution to the combination must 
be demonstrated by data from studies conducted with the 
maximum approved drug level. For the NADA, data from two 
treatment groups from each of the six trials are adequate 
to satisfy these requirements. Treatment one (1) monensin 
at 110 g/ton: Treatment two (2) monensin 110 g/ton plus 
BMD at 50 g/ton.<P> 
 
The data for each of the above two treatments from the 
six trials were pooled for analysis for weight gain and 
feed efficiency. The analysis for weight gain showed no 
significant difference (P &#61; 0.10) between the two 
treatments. The analysis of the feed to gain data showed 
a significant difference<br> (P &#60; 0.01) between the two 
treatments due to BMD.<P> 
 
The data from the non-interference studies and the six 
floor pen studies qualify the application for approval as 
an aid in the prevention of coccidiosis and for improved 
feed efficiency. The CVM policy outlined in the October 
1983 revised guidelines permits the quantity of the range 
for BMD codified in 21 CFR 558.76(e)(i), which is 4 to 50 
g/ton for use in combination with monensin at 90-110 
g/ton.<P>

<b>Effectiveness - Non-Interference</b><P> 
This submission provides additional information to the 
existing Freedom of Information Summary and approval of 
BMD-4-50 grams/ton and Coban 110 grams/ton: 51 FR 
12/17/86, 45105. These data report an additional non-interference 
study to demonstrate that the presence of 
BMD at 200 grams/ton did not interfere with the 
anticoccidial properties of monensin at 90 grams/ton of 
feed. The experiment was conducted by Dr. K. W. Bafundo 
and Dr. D. J. Donovan, Lilly Research Laboratories, 
Greenfield, Indiana.<P> 
 
These data constitute a series of seven battery 
experiments conducted to determine the compatibility of 
monensin (99 ppm) and the therapeutic level of BMD (220 
ppm) when fed in combination. Anticoccidial efficacy was 
assessed as an aid in the prevention of infections of 
<i>Eimeria acervulina, E. maxima, E. mitis/E. mivati, E. 
brunetti, E. necatrix, E. tenella,</i> and a mixed inoculum 
of the above coccidia as measured by growth performance 
(weight gain and feed/gain ratios) and reduction in 
mortality and lesion severity. The following seven tables 
(1-7) depict the efficacy profile of the combination.<P> 
 
Monensin, both alone and in combination with BMD, 
effectively reduced lesion scores and improved 
performance. The addition of BMD to feeds had no adverse 
effects on the efficacy of monensin as an aid in the 
prevention of coccidial infections. Thus, BMD was found 
to be compatible with monensin when the anticoccidial 
efficacy of the drug was assessed.<P> 
 
The data in Tables 1 through 7 show that 200 grams of BMD 
do not interfere with the anticoccidial activity of 90 
grams/ton (99 ppm) of monensin, which supports the 
conclusion that BMD at 4-50 grams/ton will not interfere 
with the anticoccidial activity of monensin at 90 
grams/ton (99 ppm).<P>

<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><P> 
 
The basic animal safety data for the individual drugs may 
be found in the original NADA 46-592 for bacitracin 
methylene disalicylate, NADA 38-878, for monensin and its 
referenced INADs and MFs, including NADA 49-463. Safety 
for the combination of bacitracin methylene disalicylate 
and monensin was demonstrated by the results of the non-interference 
study conducted by Elanco Products Co. and 
the results of six floor pen studies described in Section 
IV.<P> 
 
This application is in accord with the Animal Safety 
Guidelines. Additional safety studies were not required 
because, 1) the drugs have been approved singularly and 
2) adequate documentation has been provided to show that 
these drugs are compatible in combination when used in 
broiler chicken feeds. Therefore, based on the data in 
the original NADAs, the non-interference studies and the 
drug residue elimination study, it is concluded that this 
combination of drugs may be safely fed to broiler 
chickens.<P> 
 
<b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY</b><P> 
 
It has been established in the original NADAs (46-592 for 
bacitracin methylene disalicylate and 38-878 for 
monensin) that these products are not a hazard to human 
health when used according to approved labeling. 
Tolerances for residues of bacitracin methylene 
disalicylate are established at 0.5 ppm negligible 
residue in uncooked chicken tissue (21 CFR 556.70). Safe 
concentrations for total residues of monensin in chickens 
are 1.5 ppm in muscle, 3.0 ppm in skin with adhering fat 
and 4.5 ppm in liver (21 CFR 556.70). The tissue residue 
data supporting uses of bacitracin methylene disalicylate 
and monensin have been presented in the original 
applications for each.<P> 
 
The drug residue depletion study as presented was 
conducted by Elanco Products Co. Sexed, day-old Penobscot 
broiler chicks were used in a 56-day study. Chicks were 
allotted to pens by grab sample from each compartment of 
the shipping boxes so that each pen received 50 males or 
50 females. The floor pens provided 0.9 square feet per 
bird.<P> 
 
Each pen was bedded with clean, ground corn cobs. Feed 
and water was provided <i>ad libitum </i>. Feed was provided to 
each pen in two hanging feeders. The chicks were fed 
typical broiler starter and finisher rations. At 56 days 
the medicated feeds were replaced with non-medicated 
feeds.<P> 
 
Room temperature was maintained at 70&#176; &#177; 5&#176; F. Supplemental 
heat was provided by thermostatically controlled infrared 
heat lamps. Continuous light was provided. Ventilation 
was provided by 2 attic and 4 window fans.<P> 
 
At termination and up to 120 hours following treatment, 
birds of each sex were randomly selected and sacrificed 
for each drug to be assayed at each sampling interval. 
Feathers were mechanically removed. Samples of muscle, 
liver, kidney and skin/fat were collected from each bird, 
individually bagged and submitted for assay.<P> 
 
The summary of the tissue residue depletion study in 
Table 8 establishes that each drug in the presence of the 
other does not exceed its established safe concentration 
or tolerances. In addition, one drug does not interfere 
in the other's tissue residue assay. In this study 
broiler chickens were fed a combination of bacitracin 
methylene disalicylate (50 g/ton) and monensin (110 
g/ton) for 56 days. Edible tissues as required for each 
drug or combination of drugs were assayed for presence of 
drug residue.<P> 
 
Tissue assay non-interference and method validation 
studies for bacitracin assay were conducted by spiking 
control chicken tissues with bacitracin zinc standard and 
monensin and then assaying for bacitracin residue. The 
results demonstrated no interference by monensin for 
bacitracin (MO-B-TR-1-85). The recovery of bacitracin 
from the spiked tissues was 84 percent.<P> 
 
The non-interference of bacitracin on the determination 
of monensin was examined by the analysis of negative 
control chicken tissues fortified with the equivalent of 
5.0 and 0, and 5.0 and 0.05 ppm bacitracin zinc standard 
and monensin, respectively (S-AAC-83-03). No interference 
of bacitracin on the recovery of monensin was observed. 
Prepared extracts of tissue fortified with the equivalent 
of 5.0 ppm bacitracin gave no zone of inhibition on the 
bioautographic plate. The recovery of monensin from 
tissue fortified with 5.0 ppm bacitracin and 0.05 ppm 
monensin was about 86 percent (0.043/0.005) which is on 
the order of the expected experimental variation.<P> 
 
Based upon the established no withdrawal times for 
monensin and bacitracin methylene disalicylate, no 
residues were above tolerances in any tissues from these 
broiler chickens. The data support no withdrawal for the 
bacitracin methylene disalicylate/monensin combination.<P>

<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P> 
 
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with 
the requirements of Section 512 of the ACT and 
demonstrate that monensin (90-110 g/ton) plus bacitracin 
MD (4-50 g/ton) are safe and effective for the claims 
indicated in Section II of this FOI summary.<P> 
 
This supplemental NADA is regarded as a Category II 
application under CVM's supplemental approval policy (21 
CFR &#167; 514.106 (b)(2)) which did not require reevaluation of 
safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs. The 
supplement provides for a change in the approved dose for 
one of the ingredients in the combination. Monensin at a 
level of 110 g/ton is approved for use in combination 
with bacitracin methylene disalicylate at a level of 4 to 
50 g/ton. The supplement provides for the use of monensin 
at a level of 90 to 110 g/ton.<P> 
 
Residue data show monensin is well within the established 
safe concentration of 4.5 ppm in liver, 3.0 ppm skin/fat 
and 1/5 ppm muscle of the chicken at zero withdrawal. 
Residue data show bacitracin MD is well below tolerance 
of 0.5 ppm in edible chicken tissues at zero withdrawal.<P> 
 
Non-interference studies demonstrated that monensin alone 
prevented an outbreak of coccidiosis and in the presence 
of bacitracin MD when the birds were exposed to the six 
major species of <i>Eimeria.</i> The data from six well 
controlled floor pen studies demonstrate the 
effectiveness of bacitracin (50 g/ton) in the presence of 
monensin (110 g/ton). These data qualify the application 
for approval under CVM's policy outlined in the 
combination drug guidelines revised October 1983. This 
policy permits the granting of range approval for 
bacitracin MD (4-50 g/ton) plus monensin (90-110 g/ton) 
as an aid in the prevention of coccidiosis and for 
improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens, as shown in 
Section II of this FOI summary.<P> 
 
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Generic Animal 
Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this 
supplement does not qualify for an exclusivity period. 
The reports supporting the supplemental approval do not 
qualify as "new clinical or field investigations" under 
that section because there is an earlier approval under 
section 512(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act for the combined use of monensin sodium and 
bacitracin methylene disalicylate in broiler chickens 
based on similar investigations.<P>

<B>II. INDICATIONS FOR USE</B><p>

	ANTISEDAN&#174; is indicated for the reversal of the clinical effects of
the sedative and analgesic agent, DOMITOR&#174; (medetomidine
hydrochloride), in dogs.<p>

<B>III. DOSAGE FORM, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</B><p>

A.	Dosage Form:  Sterile solution for injection<p>

B.	Route of Administration:  Intramuscular injection<p>

C.	Recommended Dosage:<p>
	
 Antisedan&#174; is administered intramuscularly
regardless of the route used for Domitor&#174;.  The concentration of
Antisedan&#174; has been formulated such that the volume of injection is
the same (mL for mL) as the recommended dose volume of Domitor&#174;, and
may be given at any time following Domitor&#174; administration.
Although injection volumes are the same, the concentration of
Antisedan&#174; (5.0 mg/mL) is 5 times that of Domitor&#174; (1.0
mg/mL).  Dogs that are sedated but ambulatory may be treated with
Antisedan&#174;, if warranted.<p>

The dosage of Antisedan&#174; is calculated based upon body surface
area. Use the table below to determine the proper injection volume based on
body weight:<p>

Atipamezole dose determination following intramuscular administration of
medetomidine in dogs (CD-0001-91)<p>

</pre>

c.  General Design<p>

i. Purpose:<p>
 The objective of the study was to determine the optimum dose of
atipamezole to reverse the clinical effects of intramuscular medetomidine in
dogs.<p>

ii. Test Animals:<p>
Sixteen adult, purpose-bred, hound-cross mix-breed dogs
composed of equal numbers of males and females.<p>

iii. Control Drug:<p>
Placebo (same as other treatments except for active ingredients).<p>

iv. Dosage Form:<p>
All treatments were sterile injectable solutions which were
the same as the proposed market formula except for differing atipamezole
concentrations used to maintain blinding:  1.0 mg/mL, 5.0 mg/mL, 10.0 mg/mL.
Medetomidine used was the same as the proposed market formulation, 1.0
mg/mL.<p>

v.  Route of Administration:<p>

Atipamezole - intramuscular injection<br>
Medetomidine - intramuscular injection<p>

vi.  Dosages used:<p>

Medetomidine -	1.0 mg/m2 of body surface area<br>
Atipamezole - 	0, 1.0, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/m2 of body surface area<p>


vii.  Parameters Measured:<p>

 Recovery from medetomidine treatment was evaluated
by six measurements.  Three measurements were conducted at timed intervals:
Time -30 minutes (immediately prior to medetomidine injection), Time 0
(immediately prior to atipamezole), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,
180, and 240 minutes post-injection of atipamezole.  The measurements made at
timed intervals were:  sedation assessment (0, normal, to 5, unresponsive),
walking ability (0, normal, to 3, unable to walk) and heart rate.  Three
additional measurements (arousal time, standing time, and walking time) were
made at time intervals from injection of the antagonist until the dog was able
to attain a specific level of vigilance or physical ability.<p>

d.	Results:<p>
Results of sedation assessment and walking ability are listed in
Table 1.  Results of analysis of heart rates indicate no statistical difference
(p &#60; 0.05) between the 0 mg/m2 and 1 mg/m2 groups.  The 5 mg/m2 and 10 mg/m2
groups were statistically significantly different  (p &#60; 0.05) from each
other and from the 0 mg/m2 and 1 mg/m2 groups.  Although dogs may have appeared
clinically normal, reversal of heart rate lagged behind and did not return to
baseline values during the 4 hour duration of the study.  See Figure 3 for the
rate and magnitude of heart rate changes.  Sedation assessment, walking
ability, heart rate, and the arousal, standing, and walking times are depicted
graphically in Figures 1-4.<p>

e.Statistical Analysis:<p>

The study was conducted using a randomized, four-way
crossover design.  A 14-day "washout" period between dosing intervals was
observed.  Areas under the curves, times to "almost normal" and arousal,
standing and walking times were analyzed by ANOVA according to a crossover
design model with preliminary tests for one-period carryover effects. (Cochran
and Cox, 1956, Experimental Designs, 2nd ed. pp 127-138). <p>

f.	Conclusions:<p>
  An analysis was conducted to confirm that the 14 day washout
period was adequate to prevent previous treatments from affecting subsequent
treatments.  Carryover effects were non-significant for all variables.
Statistical analysis of the two most relevant variables, sedation assessment
and walking ability, were conducted for both area under the response curve
(AUC) and time for each dog to return to "almost normal" (scores of 0 or 1).
Results of these variables are presented in Table 1.  AUC was also analyzed for
heart rates, and findings were as stated in the "Results" section.<p>

Means of the continuous time variables were analyzed.  The parameters measuring
the times to arousal, standing and walking were variable due to the spontaneous
behavior of the dogs, but also followed a dose response trend (see Table 2 and
Figure 4) supporting the recommended dose.  Dogs treated with the recommended
dose aroused from sedation, stood, and walked within 12.7 minutes with the
minimum time to walking taking 2.6 minutes.<p>

Dogs in the 5.0 mg/m2 and 10.0 mg/m2 groups exhibited
rapid and complete clinical recovery from sedation, without relapse into
sedation during the 240 minute recording period.  Dogs in the
1.0 mg/m2 group also recovered from medetomidine-induced
sedation, but responded more slowly than the other treatment groups.
Placebo-treated dogs required the full four-hours for all dogs to return to
normal vigilance and activity.  Medetomidine-induced bradycardia was quickly
corrected in the 5.0 mg/m2 and 10.0 mg/m2 groups, but
values did not return to the pre-medetomidine rate.<p>

The results of the study demonstrate that the optimum intramuscular dosage of
atipamezole, when reversing the clinical effects of 1.0 mg/m2 intramuscular medetomidine, is 5.0 mg/m2.<p>

g.	Side Effects:<p>

 Urination was a common side effect of medetomidine treatment,
and was seen to a lesser extent in the 10.0 mg/m2 atipamezole dosage
group.  Emesis was another reported side effect related to medetomidine, with
occurrences in three of the 16 dogs participating in the study.<p>

c. General Design:<p>

i. Purpose:<p>

The previous dose determination study concluded that the optimum
dosage of the antagonist, atipamezole, was five times that of the agonist,
medetomidine, when administered intramuscularly.  The recommended dosage of
medetomidine, when administered intravenously, is less than that given
intramuscularly.  The objective of the present study was to confirm that the
same atipamezole:medetomidine ratio is safe and effective to reverse the
clinical effects of intravenous medetomidine.<p>

ii. Test Animals:<p>

Sixteen adult, purpose-bred, hound-cross, mix-breed, dogs
composed of equal numbers of males and females.<p>

iii. Control Drug:<p>

Placebo (same as atipamezole formula except the active ingredients)<p>

iv. Dosage Form:<p>

The test formula was a sterile injectable solution which
was the same as proposed market formula.<p>

v. Route of Administration:<p>

Atipamezole - intramuscular injection<br>
Medetomidine - intravenous injection<p>

vi.  Dosages used:	<p>

Medetomidine -0.75 mg/m2 of body surface area<br>
Atipamezole -0 or 3.75 mg/m2 of body surface area<p>

vii.  Parameters Measured:<p>

Observations were conducted exactly as in the
previous dose determination study.  Recovery from medetomidine treatment was
evaluated by six measurements.  Three measurements were conducted at timed
intervals:  Time -20 minutes (immediately prior to medetomidine injection),
Time 0 (immediately prior to atipamezole), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90,
120, 180, and 240 minutes pose-injection of atipamezole.  The measurements made
at timed intervals were:  sedation assessment (0, normal, to 5, unresponsive),
walking ability (0, normal, to 3, unable to walk) and heart rate.  Three
additional measurements (arousal time, standing time, and walking time) were
made at time intervals from injection of the antagonist until the dog was able
to attain a specific level of vigilance or physical ability.<p>

d. Results:<p>

Sedation assessment, walking ability, heart rate, and the arousal,
standing, and walking times are depicted graphically in Figures 1-4. <p>

e. Statistical Analysis:<P>

Results were unequivocal and did not require
statistical analysis for proper interpretation.<p>

f. Conclusions:<p>

Atipamezole completely reversed the clinical sedation produced
by medetomidine.  At the time of atipamezole injection, all dogs were heavily
sedated.  Between 6 and 15 minutes after atipamezole injection, all dogs
returned to normal or near-normal sedation assessment and remained so for the
subsequent four-hour recording period.  Walking times mirrored sedation scores.
Placebo-treated dogs gradually returned to normal during the same period.<p>

Atipamezole produced a rapid (generally within 3 minutes) antagonism of
medetomidine-induced bradycardia.  Reversal of this variable occurred more
quickly than observed for the other variables, but did not return to the
pre-medetomidine value.<p>

These data support the clinical efficacy and safety of atipamezole when used
intramuscularly and used at the recommended multiple of five times the
previously administered medetomidine (3.75 mg/m2 medetomidine) dose to reverse
the clinical effects of intravenous medetomidine in the dog.  The intravenous
route of medetomidine administration, with the concomitant dosage reduction,
did not influence the ratio of atipamezole dosage to medetomidine dosage in the
dog.<p>

g. Side Effects:<p>

Urination was a common side effect of medetomidine treatment.<p>

c.	General Design<p>

i.  Purpose:<p>

 The objective of the study was to evaluate, under field
conditions, the efficacy and safety of atipamezole as an antagonist of the
sedative effects of medetomidine in dogs.<p>

ii.  Test Animals:<p>

Of the 233 cases which could be used to evaluate
atipamezole, 115 were treated with atipamezole while 118 were treated with
placebo.  Dogs were well-balanced and well-represented across both treatment
groups with regard to age, sex, weight, breed, the length of procedure and the
severity of the procedure to which they were subjected.  Dogs ranged from four
to 129 lb body weight, and from three months to 14 years of age.<p>

Dogs were randomly assigned to either atipamezole or placebo treatment groups
and were treated intravenously or intramuscularly with medetomidine.  A
clinical procedure(s) and/or examination was conducted.  The dogs were then
blindly administered atipamezole or placebo and recovery from the effects of
medetomidine was then measured.<p>

iii. Control Drug:<p>

Placebo (same as other treatments except for active ingredients)<p>

iv.  Dosage Form:<p>

The atipamezole and medetomidine study drugs were sterile
injectable solutions which were the same as the proposed market formulas except
the atipamezole was provided in 2 mL vials (one vial/one dog) for
blinding.<p>

v.  Route of Administration:<p>

Atipamezole - intramuscular injection<br>
Medetomidine - intravenous and intramuscular injection<p>

vi.  Dosages used:<p>

Medetomidine:<br>
a) 0.75 mg/m2 of body surface area, intravenously<br>
b) 1.0 mg/m2 of body surface area, intramuscularly<p>

Atipamezole:<br>
a) 3.75 mg/m2 of body surface area, intramuscularly<br>
b) 5.0 mg/m2 of body surface area, intramuscularly<p>

Atipamezole was administered intramuscularly, at five times the dosage of
the previously administered medetomidine.<p>

vii.  Parameters Measured:<p>

Three observations were made at 15 minute
intervals for one hour following injection of the reversal agent:  heart rate,
sedation score, and ability to walk.  Sedation scores were rated from 0 to 5,
with 0 as normal and 5 as a maximum (unresponsive).  Assessment of the ability
to walk was rated 0 to 3, with 0 as normal and 3 designating an inability to
walk.  In addition, the time necessary for the dog to walk unassisted was
recorded as a measurable clinical endpoint of physical ability.<p>

A general, or overall, assessment of the reversal of sedation was recorded
summarizing response to treatment according to the following ratings:
excellent, good, poor or none.  For a period of at least four hours following
sedation injection, the dogs were observed to ensure that a relapse into
sedation did not occur.<p>

d.	Results:<p>

  Results of the atipamezole and placebo treatments are provided in
Table 1.  Immediately prior to reversal injection, at post-reversal Time 0, the
atipamezole treatment group had an average sedation score of 3.8 of a possible
5.  Profound sedation or unresponsiveness was exhibited in 76.5% of the dogs.
Though some dogs were able to walk prior to reversal, the ability to walk
scores indicated that 85.2% of the dogs were unable to walk, with an average
walking score of 2.8 of a possible 3.  Heart rate averaged 40% of the
pretreatment rate (single-sample).<p>

	At the first scoring interval, 15 minutes following atipamezole injection, the
average sedation score dropped to 0.4, with 91.3% of the subjects rated normal
or almost normal.  By 30 minutes post-reversal, 99.1% of the dogs were rated
normal or almost normal.  The mean walking score 15 minutes after reversal was
0.3 with 95.6% walking normally or with only slight missteps.  Dogs which were
scored completely normal in their walking represented 74.8% and 97.4% of the
group at the 15 minute and 30 minute intervals, respectively.  Within 15
minutes of treatment, the average heart rate returned to 83% of the
pre-treatment rate, with a slight increase at subsequent intervals.  Table 1
illustrates the distribution of cases according to heart rate.<p>

By comparison, the percentage of placebo-treated dogs with normal or almost
normal sedation scores at the 15 and 30 minute intervals were 4.2% and
8.5%, respectively.  The percentage of dogs in the placebo group which
were walking normally or with slight missteps at the same intervals were 7.6%

</pre>

The overall assessment in the atipamezole group was rated as excellent or good
in all dogs except one, which was rated "none."  Closer examination of this
case revealed that the sedation and walking scores progressed from 4 and 3,
respectively, to normal (0) within thirty minutes, suggestive of significant
reversal.  However, recovery was slower than expected, which may have had a
bearing on the investigator's overall assessment.<p>

Recovery of the placebo group was slow and more gradual than with atipamezole
by all parameters.<p>

A clinical success rating was determined by combining "excellent" or "good"
overall assessments of reversal with absence of relapse.  All cases but one in
the atipamezole group were clinical successes.  Conversely, the clinical
success rate in the placebo-treated group was 7 of 118, or 5.9%.  It is noted
that one placebo animal that initially reversed, relapsed. <p>

e.	Statistical Analysis:<p>

Rates of being evaluated as normal, in terms of
sedation and rates of walking normally, were significantly higher (p&#60;0.001)
in the atipamezole-treated group from 15 minutes post-treatment onward.  The
associated average sedation and walking assessment scores reflect the treatment
effect.  Clinical success rates and reversal assessment scores were
significantly higher (p&#60;0.001) in the atipamezole-treated group.<p>

f.	Conclusions:<p>

In diverse clinical settings, utilizing an adequate and
well-controlled design, atipamezole was shown to be a rapidly-acting, safe and
effective agent for the reversal of sedation and bradycardia induced by
intravenous or intramuscular administration of medetomidine to dogs.
Clinically, animals administered atipamezole had total reversal of signs, yet
heart rate measurements indicated a slower return to baseline.  No conclusions
can be made on the potential for drug interactions, although no untoward
effects were noted in this study.  Additionally, this study does not address
use of the drug in animals intended for breeding.<p>

g.	Side Effects:<p>

Atipamezole side effects were infrequent and mild.  Rarely,
dogs exhibited brief excitement or apprehensiveness upon reversal.<p>

B.	CORROBORATIVE STUDIES<p> 

Study to determine the antagonistic activity of atipamezole against
medetomidine induced cardiovascular and respiratory changes(Study No. Atip
5/2)<p>

a.  Type of Study/Objective:  The objective was to determine the ability of
atipamezole to reverse medetomidine-induced cardiovascular and respiratory
changes in dogs.  A randomized complete block design was used with at least 6
days between treatments.<p>

c.  Test Animals:<p>

  Six laboratory beagles<p>

d.  Control:<p>

  Placebo<p>

e.  Dosage and Route of Administration:<p>

Atipamezole was tested at five-and
ten-fold multiples of a range of medetomidine doses (20, 40, 80 micrograms per
kilogram), yielding a total of nine different combinations of medetomidine and
atipamezole, including placebo.  All doses were given intramuscularly.  (The
five fold multiple of atipamezole following 40 mcg/kg of medetomidine
intramuscularly is roughly equivalent to the proposed optimum dosage.)<p>

f.  Results and Conclusions:<p>

Atipamezole was able to reverse
medetomidine-induced bradycardia, respiratory depression and decrease in pO2.
Following doses which approximated recommended doses of medetomidine and
atipamezole, a transient decrease in systolic blood pressure of approximately
10% was seen during the first 10 minutes after injection of atipamezole, but
thereafter the effects on blood pressure were negligible.  There were no
significant differences in the overall efficacy of the two tested doses of
atipamezole in antagonizing medetomidine-induced effects.  No adverse reactions
were reported.<p>

after dosing were based on the use of radiolabeled atipamezole.<p>

f.  Results and Conclusions:<p>

Atipamezole was absorbed rapidly with Tmax
calculated to be 0.17 hr.  The apparent distribution volume was 2.5 L/kg.
Elimination half-life was 2.6 hr. No adverse reactions were reported.<p>

vii.  Parameters Measured:<p>

Clinical observations: mortality, morbidity, body weight, food consumption, water consumption<br>

Electrocardiography<br>

Ophthalmoscopy<br>

Laboratory parameters: hematology, clinical chemistry<br>

Necropsy, pathology and histopathology <p>
	

Animals were observed twice daily for mortality and moribundity.  On the days
of dosing, animals were observed continuously for approximately 4 hours post
dose.  Body weights were recorded on the day before initiation of the
treatment, on each day of dosing, approximately 24 hours after the last dose,
and on the day of necropsy.  Animals were observed daily for qualitative food
and water consumption.  Physical examinations were done before initiation of
treatment, daily during treatment (before dosing), approximately 24 hours after
the last dose, and before necropsy.  Electrocardiographic measurements and
ophthalmic examinations were done before initiation of treatment and
approximately 24 hours after the last dose.  Hematology and clinical chemistry
parameters were evaluated twice before initiation of treatment and
approximately 24 hours after the last dose.  All animals were necropsied two
days after the last dose.<p>

d.	Results:<p>

Dogs injected with atipamezole exhibited clinical signs suggestive
of having been dosed with a stimulant.  All male and female dogs in the 10X
group showed one or more effects (hyperactivity, panting, tremors, salivation,
soft or liquid feces, injected sclera, etc.) of stimulation.  Signs were also
noted among three of three male dogs and two of three female dogs in the 5X
group.  Of the male dogs in the 3X and 1X groups, only one dog in the 3X group
exhibited any significant changes (injected sclera).  Hyperactivity was noted
in three of three females in the 1X group and two of three females in the 3X
group.  Vomiting was observed in two of three female dogs in the 1X group and
one of three females in the 3X group.  Medetomidine-sedated dogs showed either
no effects of atipamezole administration or very mild effects similar to those
observed in the 1X and 3X groups.<p>

	There were no atipamezole-related effects on body weight, food consumption,
hydration, physical examination results, or electrocardiographic data.  Mean
creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase values were increased in dogs
administered the 10X dose of atipamezole.  Mean creatine kinase in 10X males
was 1760 iu/L, which was 5.9X higher than the control group males while the
mean value (1353 iu/L) for 10X females was 4.4X that of controls.  3X males had
a mean creatine kinase value of 654 iu/L, which was 2.2X that of the controls.
The mean aspartate aminotransferase value among male dogs in the 10X group was
62 iu/L, which was 1.7X that of control males.  The value for females was 1.8X
that of controls.  Females in the 10X group had a mean alanine transferase
value of 50 iu/L, which was 2.1X that of control females.  There were no
systemic anatomical pathology changes observed in dogs given atipamezole.  At
intramuscular injection sites, localized skeletal muscle degeneration and
necrosis occurred in all dogs given atipamezole.  However, dogs exhibited no
test material-related pain during injection compared with the placebo group,
and there was no post-injection pain, swelling or other clinically evident
injection site abnormalities.  The microscopic injection site lesions reported
in this study were considered relatively mild, clinically insignificant and a
common sequella to the process of drug administration by intramuscular
injection.<p>

e. Conclusions:<P>

Based on this study, the administration of atipamezole was not
associated with any life threatening toxicity when given in a single dose at
10X the anticipated use rate or when given daily for three consecutive days at
1X, 3X or 5X the anticipated use rate, both without prior administration of
medetomidine, and at 3X the anticipated dose rate following the administration
of medetomidine.  Atipamezole was well tolerated and is not expected to produce
significant signs of toxicity when used as directed.<p>

vii.  Parameters Measured:<p> 

Clinical observations: mortality, morbidity, body weight, food consumption, water consumption, physical examination<p>
Electrocardiography<p>
Ophthalmoscopy<p>
Laboratory parameters: hematology, clinical chemistry<p>

The animals were observed continuously through six hours after the last dose of
atipamezole.  Body weights were taken before treatment and approximately 24
hours after the last dose.  Animals were observed daily for qualitative food
and water consumption.  Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were done
approximately 24 hours before study initiation and approximately one and 24
hours after the last dose of atipamezole.  Clinical chemistry and hematology
information was obtained twice before study initiation and approximately 24
hours after the last dose.  Ophthalmic examinations were done once before study
initiation and approximately 28 hours post dose. <p>

d.  Results:<p>

 All dogs in Group 1 appeared sedated for 2 to 3 hours after
medetomidine administration and exhibited hypoactivity, uncoordinated movement,
and unsteadiness for up to 5 additional hours.  All dogs in Group 2 were
showing signs of arousal from sedation approximately 5 to 6 minutes after the
first injection of atipamezole.  Trembling was observed after the second and
third doses.  Five of six dogs in Group 2 exhibited some degree of hypoactivity
for approximately 2 hours after the medetomidine administration (or
approximately 30 minutes after the last atipamezole dose).<p>

There were no test material-related changes in body weights, food consumption
or hydration observed.  Expected decreases in body temperature, respiration
rates and heart rates were observed among the dogs not treated with atipamezole
due to the sedative effects of medetomidine. Prolonged Q-T intervals due to
bradycardia were also noted on ECG examinations of dogs not receiving
atipamezole.  All dogs given atipamezole had electrocardiographic results
(except heart rate) which were similar to baseline values.  A complete return
to basal heart rate was not observed in ten of twelve dogs one hour after
reversal with atipamezole or placebo, although the placebo-treated animals
achieved heart rates only approaching 50% of the atipamezole-treated animals.
There were no test material-related changes in hematological or clinical
chemical results.<p>

e.	Conclusions:<p>

Based on the results of this study, administration of
medetomidine at 3X the anticipated use rate followed by three successive
intramuscular injections of atipamezole at the anticipated dose rate was
well-tolerated and did not result in any unexpected effects.<p>

<B>VI. HUMAN SAFETY</B><p>

A. Human Food Safety<p>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is to be labeled for use in
dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>

B.	Human Safety Considerations Other Than Food Safety<p>

Keep out of reach of children.  Not for human use.  Atipamezole hydrochloride
can be absorbed and may cause irritation following direct exposure to skin,
eyes, or mouth.  In case of accidental eye exposure, flush with water for 15
minutes.  In case of accidental skin exposure, wash with soap and water.
Remove contaminated clothing.  If irritation or other adverse reactions occur
(e.g., increased heart rate, tremor, muscle cramps), seek medical attention.
In case of accidental oral exposure or injection, seek medical attention.
Precaution should be used while handling and using filled syringes.<p>

Users with cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension or ischemic heart
disease) should take special precautions to avoid any exposure to this
product.<p>

data sheet (MSDS) for this product call 1-800-366-5288.<p>

This product contains an alpha-2-andrenergic antagonist.<p>

<B>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>

Data in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of Section 512 of the
Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  It demonstrates that
Antisedan&#174; (atipamezole hydrochloride), when used under labeled
conditions of use, is safe and effective.<p>

Antisedan&#174; is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian because professional expertise is required to determine when a dog
should be reversed from the sedative effects of the prescription drug,
Domitor&#174; (medetomidine).<p>

Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this
approval qualifies for five years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of
the active ingredient) of the drug has been approved in any other
application.<p>

Dosages:</B><P>
Intravenous - 4 mL (40 mg). Intra-articular - 2 mL (20 mg) in the carpus
or fetlock. Treatment may be repeated at weekly intervals for a total of
three treatments.<P>
Strict aseptic technique should be observed when administering by
intra-articular injection. As with any intra-articular procedure, proper
injection site disinfection and animal restraint are important. Excess
joint fluid should be aseptically removed prior to injection. Care
should be taken to avoid scratching the cartilage surface with the tip
of the injection needle. Diffuse swelling lasting 24 to 48 hours may
result from movement of the needle while in the joint space.<P>
For intravenous administration, use aseptic technique and inject slowly
into the jugular vein.<P>
Horses should be given stall rest after treatment before gradually
resuming normal activity.<P>
Discard any unused portion of the drug and the empty vial after
opening.<P>
<B>4. Studies Demonstrating Effectiveness:</B><P>
<B>A. Pivotal Studies.</B><P>
<B>1.) Dose Titration Study - Intra-articular Injectable Solution</B><P>
A dose titration study was conducted by Dr. Doyne Hamm, at Research for
Animal Health, Fayetteville, Arkansas, from March to August, 1985.<P>
<B>a. Study Design</B><P>
This study was designed to determine the effective dose of Legend
Injectable Solution, a 1% injectable solution of MOBAY hyaluronate
sodium for intra-articular therapy of experimentally induced carpitis of
the horse. Thirty-six horses of Quarter Horse type were divided into six
treatment groups (six horses each): 1) Phosphate Buffered Saline,
negative control (2 mL); 2) 5 mg Legend Injectable Solution (0.5 mL); 3)
20 mg (2 mL); 4) 40 mg (4 mL); 4) 20 mg repeated in two weeks (2 mL-2
mL); 6) positive control commercial product (Hylartin-V, 2 mL). The Test
Drug was the formulation intended for market. Each horse was treated
once in the Intercarpal joint except for group 5 which received two
injections in the intercarpal joint at a two week interval. Five days
prior to treatment, lameness was induced in each horse using Freund's
Complete Adjuvant.<P>
The study was blinded by using two veterinarians. One administered drug
treatment and the other conducted the evaluation and did not know which
treatment each animal received.<P>
Evaluations were made at the day of induction of lameness and every
other week starting at the time of treatment. Measurements included:
body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, lameness score, standing
leg angle, flexed leg angle, range of motion, stride after rest, stride
after exercise, cast volume, joint circumference, white blood cells,
joint fluid protein, and joint fluid viscosity. Evaluations were carried
out for 6 weeks from treatment.<P>
<B>b. Results</B><P>
Clinical and laboratory parameters which provided the most meaningful
evaluation of dose groups were: lameness, range of motion, stride after
exercise, cast volume, synovial fluid protein and synovial fluid
viscosity.<P>
Graphs are provided (Figures 1 through 6) to show the combined results
of the data from six horses in each treatment group.<P>
Clinical judgement of the investigator indicated that all but the
placebo and 5 mg Legend Injectable Solution doses were equally
effective. Judgements were based upon clinical locomotion parameters
(e.g., flexion, stride, lameness). There was evidence of consistent
benefit by two weeks after initial hyaluronate sodium treatment. Maximum
benefit inclusive of virtual complete alleviation of lameness appeared
to occur from the fourth to sixth week. Stride, however, appeared mostly
resolved by the time of the second week observation, but clinical
judgement still revealed some residual lameness at this time. It was
notable that swelling (based upon carpal circumference and cast volume)
resolved more slowly and less completely during the overall observation
period.<P>
It was also noted that improvement in joint fluid protein values were
likewise less complete. There was no significant change in viscosity.
The variation of joint fluid WBC did not permit interpretation.<P>

An examination of Figures 1 through 4 reveals a definite difference in
response between dose groups. Figure 5 is less definite and Figure 6
shows little difference between dose groups based on this parameter.<P>
<B>c. Statistical Evaluation</B><P>
An analysis of variance was run at each observation period for each
variable. Statistical evaluation was conducted by Hamm and Walls
Associates.<P>
The lowest dose (5 mg) was not statistically significantly different
from the negative control at all times and all measures. In general, the
large doses (20 and 40 mg) of Legend Injectable Solution and positive
control drug were statistically different (p &lt; 0.05) from the
negative control and 5 mg dose groups. Thus, all but the lowest dose of
hyaluronate sodium were found to be comparable in efficacy to the
positive control and there was insufficient statistical evidence to
establish an unequivocal prefrence among the higher dose treatment
regimens utilized in this trial. These higher doses, as well as the
positive control drug, were efficacious in that treated animals showed a
definite return toward the baseline values.<P>
The variables showing this pattern of result included: lameness,
standing angle, flexed angle, range of motion, stride after rest, stride
after exercise, volume of cast, circumference over carpal joint, protein
and to some extent, the white blood cell count. Temperature, pulse,
respiration, and relative viscosity showed no significant differences
among treatment groups.<P>
<B>d. Adverse Reactions</B><P>
The investigator reported that no adverse effects were observed in this
study.<P>
<B>e. Conclusion</B><P>
These data show that the optimum effective dose of Legend Injectable
Solution for intra- articular treatment of the experimentally induced
carpitis is 20 mg (2 mL). Clinical signs and joint fluid analysis were
statistically analyzed and support this conclusion.<P>
<B>2.) Dose Titration Study - Intravenous Injectable Solution.</B><P>
An evaluation to determine the optimum dose of Legend Injectable
Solution given intravenously to treat equine carpitis was conducted by
Drs. Doyne Hamm and Danny Millar, at Research for Animal Health in
Fayetteville, Arkansas. Joint fluid assays were conducted at Specialized
Assays in Nashville, Tennessee.<P>
<B>a. Study Design</B><P>
This study followed the pattern set by the intra-articular dose
titration study except that horses were treated intravenously with the
1% Legend Injectable Solution or saline control. The Freund's Complete
Adjuvant model was used in thirty-two horses of Quarter Horse type. The
horses were divided into 4 treatment groups with 8 horses in each group.
Five days after model induction, a series of three, weekly injections of
Legend Injectable Solution were given to each horse. The treatment doses
were: 1) Phosphate Buffered Saline, negative control (4 mL); 2) 20 mg
Legend (2 mL); 3) 40 mg Legend (4 mL); and 4) 80 mg Legend (8 mL). The
Test Drug was the formulation intended for market.<P>
The study was blinded by using two veterinarians. One administered drug
treatments and the other conducted the evaluations and did not know
which treatment each animal received.<P>
Evaluations were made prior to induction of carpitis and every other
week for six weeks. These evaluations included body temperature, pulse
rate, respiration rate, joint circumference, lameness score, standing
leg angle, flexed leg angle, range of motion, stride length, cast
volume, joint fluid protein, joint fluid viscosity and joint fluid
WBC.<P>
<B>b. Results</B><P>
Clinical parameters which provided the most meaningful comparison of
dose groups were: carpal joint circumference, flexed leg angle, range of
motion, stride length and lameness score.<P>
Graphs are provided (Figures 7 through 11) to show the combined results
of the data from eight horses in each treatment group.<P>

An examination of Figures 7 through 11 shows a definite difference
between dose groups. The negative controls and low dose groups improve
slowly or not at all. The two higher dose groups steadily improve at
about the same rate.<P>
<B>c. Statistical Evaluation</B><P>
For each variable in the study, a separate analysis of variance was
performed on each day. This analysis was followed by a Duncan's multiple
range procedure (0.05 level) to contrast each pair of treatment group
means. The same analyses were performed on the change from baseline data
obtained by subtracting the value of Day -5 from each of the following
day values on each individual horse.<P>
Significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) was seen by the 14th day on flexed
angle, range of motion, stride length and lameness score on those
animals treated with 40 or 80 mg as compared to those treated at 20 mg
or the Controls.<P>
As a rule, no significant differences were seen between the low dose and
the controls or between the two highest doses.<P>
<B>d. Adverse Reactions</B><P>
The Investigator reported that no adverse reactions occurred in this
study.<P>
<B>e. Conclusions</B><P>
It is concluded that 40 mg of Legend Injectable Solution used
intravenously is the optimal dose for the treatment of experimentally
induced carpitis in the horse.<P>
<B>3.) Clinical Trial</B><P>
A well-controlled clinical trial was conducted to determine the efficacy
and safety of Legend (hyaluronate sodium) Injectable Solution for the
treatment of joint dysfunction in horses due to non-infectious synovitis
associated with equine osteoarthritis. This trial was conducted in two
phases (Phase I and Phase II) by the following principal investigators:
Dr. Mike Betley, Barrington, IL: Dr. Jerry Black, Oakdale, CA; Dr.
Robert Lewis, Elgin, TX; and Dr. Doyne Hamm, Fayetteville, AR. Principal
investigators for both phases were the same and the two protocols used
the same critical parameters, allowing for the data to be pooled for
analytical purposes. The pooled data as well as the results from each
phase are presented below. The time interval between the two phases of
the clinical field trial did not influence the results. Therefore,
combining the results constitutes one adequate and well- controlled
clinical field trial.<P>
<B>a. Study Design</B><P>
The purpose of the clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of Legend Injectable Solution when administered either
intravenously or intra-articularly in treating horses with clinical
cases of degenerative joint disease. There was no other drug approved
for intravenous administration, therefore, the positive control was
administered by intra- articular injection only.<P>
Cases were selected on the basis of clinical symptoms of synovitis of a
carpus or a fetlock joint including lameness, and signs of heat and pain
on palpation.<P>
The horses entered into the study were divided into three treatment
groups. Breeds included Thoroughbreds, Standardbreds and Quarter Horses.
Seventy-two horses successfully completed the study. Twenty-one horses
were treated with 40 mg (4 mL) of Legend Injectable Solution (1%
hyaluronate sodium solution) in the jugular vein. Twenty- five horses
were treated with 20 mg (2 mL) of the same Test Drug by an
intra-articular injection. The Test Drug was the formulation intended
for market. The final twenty-six horses were treated intra-articularly
with 20 mg (2 mL) of a commercial hyaluronate sodium control drug
(Hylartin-V). A total of fifty-one horses with dysfunction of one carpal
joint and twenty-one horses with dysfunction of one fetlock joint were
treated.<P>
Horses were treated one, two or three times, at weekly intervals based
on an evaluation of the response by the investigator.<P>
The study was blinded with one investigator at each location conducting
all evaluations (without knowing which treatments were given) while a
second administered all treatments. In addition, the three treatment
groups were randomly assigned. Evaluations were conducted as follows:<P>
<B>Lameness</B> was scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 meaning no lameness and
5 meaning refusal to move.<P>
<B>Pain on Palpation</B> was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 meaning no
pain reaction and 3 meaning that palpation was not possible.<P>
<B>Heat</B> was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 meaning a normal joint and 3 meaning
the joint was hot to the touch.<P>
<B>Overall Response Rating</B> was scored after the horse was back in training
and was rated as Excellent, Good, Fair or None.<P>
<B>Joint Fluid</B> samples were taken at the time of each treatment and
evaluated for: Protein, Hyaluronic Acid Concentration, Viscosity, WBC
and Mucin Clot.<P>
<B>b. Pooled Results</B><P>
A summary of the clinical response results by route of administration is
shown in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 show the clinical response by joint.
The overall response ratings are shown in Table 4, with Tables 5 and 6
providing the results by joint treated.<P>

<B>c. Statistical Methodology and Analysis of the Pooled Data</B><P>
To demonstrate efficacy, McNemar's test was used comparing improvement
versus worsening of condition of post-treatment response for heat,
lameness and pain, combining the response data for all investigators.<P>
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel categorical data analysis (row means score)
procedure, controlling for investigator, was used to test for pre- and
post-treatment differences among treatment groups for heat, lameness and
pain. For each response variable an overall analysis, combining fetlock
and carpus cases and separate joint analyses were investigated. The same
method was used to analyze the overall rating.<P>
As supportive analysis, post-treatment responses were analyzed in a
blocked one-way analysis of variance incorporating study investigator,
treatment and treatment by investigator terms. The study investigator
and treatment by investigator terms were considered as random effects. A
90% confidence interval of treatment differences was constructed. For
each response variable, an overall analysis, combining carpus and
fetlock cases, and by-joint analyses were considered.<P>
No statistical analyses were conducted for pre vs post-treatment WBC,
protein and viscosity because of the lack of completed paired data.<P>
A 0.05 level was used to determine all statistical significance.<P>
Analysis of clinical response data showed that IV treatment was as
effective as IA with either the Test or Control Drug (Table 1). All
indicated a significant improvement in response (p &lt; = 0.05). There was
no statistically significant difference between treatment groups for any
of the parameters measured pre-treatment. The combined data for Overall
Response Rating are shown in Table 4. The table reveals that most horses
responded with an excellent or good rating. The results of statistical
analysis showed no consistent differences among the treatment groups.<P>
d. Conclusion<P>
The results of this adequate and well-controlled clinical trial from 4
investigator sites using 72 horses demonstrated a clinically significant
reduction in lameness. Most of the horses treated either intravenously
or intra-articularly with Legend Injectable Solution returned to work,
training or racing without recurrence of symptoms during the observation
period.<P>
No adverse reactions were observed in any of the treated horses,
demonstrating safety for both routes of administration.<P>
<B>3.1) Clinical Trial - Phase I</B><P>
Thirty-seven horses were divided into three treatment groups. Breeds
included Thoroughbreds, Standardbreds and Quarter Horses. Eleven horses
were treated with 40 mg (4 mL) of Legend Injectable Solution (1%
hyaluronate sodium solution) in the jugular vein. Twelve horses were
treated with 20 mg (2 mL) of the same Test Drug by an intra- articular
injection. The Test Drug was the formulation intended for market. The
final 14 horses were treated intra-articularly with 20 mg (2 mL) of a
commercial hyaluronate sodium Control drug (Hylartin-V). A total of 24
carpal joints and 13 fetlock joints were treated.<P>
A summary of the clinical response is shown in Tables 7-9. Table 7 shows
combined results for both the carpal and fetlock joints while Tables 8
and 9 separate the results by joint.<P>

<B>B. Corroborative Study</B><P>
<B>1.) Clinical Trial - Intra-articular Injectable Solution</B><P>
The objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the results in
horses treated with 20 mg (2 mL) of Legend Injectable Solution. Four
investigators at different geographical sites were selected. These were
Dr. M. J. Betley, Chicago, IL; Dr. J. Black, Oakdale, CA; Dr. B.Wm.
Furlong; Oldwick, NJ; and Dr. D. Hamm, Fayetteville AR.<P>
<B>a. Study Design</B><P>
Eighty-two cases of joint dysfunction of the equine carpus were studied.
Forty cases were randomly selected for treatment with the Legend
Injectable Solution Test Drug and forty- two with a commercially
available 1% hyaluronate sodium positive Control Drug. The Test Drug
formulation was the one intended for market. Both drugs were injected
intra- articularly into the carpus at the rate of 20 mg (2 mL) per dose.
Repeat treatments at weekly intervals were allowed to a total of three
injections.<P>
Horses were evaluated for lameness, joint pain, effusion, range of
motion and overall improvement.<P>
<B>b. Results</B><P>
Improvements were noted in joint condition of horses treated with both
drugs. The Overall Response Rating for both products was essentially
equal.<P>
<B>c. Adverse Reactions</B><P>
No adverse reactions were reported by investigators using the Test or
Control drug in these studies.<P>
<B>d. Conclusion</B><P>
The results of this clinical trial conducted at four locations indicate
that Legend Injectable Solution given by intra-articular injection is
beneficial in the treatment of noninfectious synovitis associated with
osteoarthritis in the equine carpus. A dose of 20 mg (2 mL) compared
favorably to a commercially available hyaluronate sodium product when
evaluating joint dysfunction parameters by laboratory examination of
synovial fluid.<P>
<B>2.) Clinical Trial - Intravenous Injectable Solution</B><P>
A clinical trial was conducted at two locations to provide an early
evaluation of intravenous treatment of natural clinical cases. Studies
were conducted by Dr. Michael J. Betley in Chicago, Illinois, from
September to December, 1986 and by Dr. Doyne Hamm, at Fayetteville,
Arkansas, from March to May, 1987.<P>
<B>a. Study Design</B><P>
A total of 41 horses were treated from the two sites in a non-controlled
study. This early investigation was conducted to evaluate this route of
administration under field conditions using natural cases of joint
dysfunction of the carpus. Both investigators treated Thoroughbred or
Quarter Horses which were in training at local stables or tracks.<P>
All horses were treated intravenously with a 1% solution of hyaluronate
sodium using a dose of 40 mg (4 mL). The Test Drug was the formulation
intended for market. Selection for treatment was based on clinical
observations of lameness, joint pain, effusion and flexion. Repeat
treatments for a total of three weekly injections were allowed. Joint
fluid samples were analyzed for synovial protein, viscosity and WBC
count.<P>
<B>b. Results</B><P>
Results indicated a favorable response with all horses improving in the
clinical parameters. Joint fluid analysis indicated a general trend
toward improvement in protein and viscosity measurements.<P>
<B>c. Adverse Reactions</B><P>
There were no adverse reactions reported by either investigator.<P>
<B>d. Conclusion</B><P>
This study indicated that 40 mg Legend Injectable Solution, injected
intravenously, resulted in improvement of equine degenerative joint
disease of the carpus. Additional controlled studies were indicated.<P>
<B>5. Animal Safety</B><P>
<B>A. Pivotal Studies</B><P>
Three pivotal safety studies for the intra-articular and intravenous use
of Legend Injectable Solution in horses were conducted as per Good
Laboratory Practice Regulations.<P>
<B>1). Safety Evaluation for the Intra-Articular Use of Hyaluronate
Sodium in Horses</B><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas used 16 Quarter Horse type,
adult male and female horses in a general target species safety
conducted with the Legend Injectable Solution formulation via
intra-articular treatment. Each of 4 groups contained 4 horses with
treatments injected into the right intercarpal joint. Group I horses
received 2 mL of sterile saline, Group II horses received 2 mL of Legend
Injectable Solution (use rate), Group III horses received 6 mL of Legend
Injectable Solution (3X use rate) and Group IV horses received 10 mL of
Legend Injectable Solution (5X use rate). Each horse received 9
treatments at 7 day intervals (3X the labeled duration). The Legend
Injectable Solution was the formulation intended for market. The purpose
of the study was to determine a margin of safety for the intra-articular
administration of Hyaluronate 1% Injectable to horses.<P>
Parameters monitored included clinical signs, body weights, joint
swellings, body temperatures, hematology parameters (white blood cell
count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular
volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration, prothrombin time, WBC differential, RBC morphology and
platelet count), serum chemistries (calcium, phosphorus, glucose, blood
urea nitrogen, uric acid, cholesterol, creatinine, total protein,
albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase, sodium, potassium,
chloride; total, direct and indirect bilirubin; carbon dioxide, creatine
kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase,
albumin/globulin ratio, calcium/phosphorus ratio, BUN/creatinine ratio,
sodium/potassium ratio, amylase and sorbitol dehydrogenase), necropsy
observations and histological findings. The study was blinded for
clinical chemistry and hematology as these values were collected without
advising the laboratory personnel of the treatments.<P>
All the horses gained body weight during the study. No significant
post-treatment changes occurred in the body temperatures. No treatment
related clinical signs were observed. Slight and mild swellings of
injected joints were noted on occasions in horses within all treated
groups and the saline treated control group. None of the joint swellings
were classified as moderate or severe. No clinically significant trends
occurred in the clinical chemistry or hematology parameter group means.
No significant lesions were observed at necropsy. All soft tissues
(liver, kidney, gonad, adrenal gland, urinary bladder, spleen, stomach,
small intestine, colon, cecum, pancreas, lung, heart, thyroid gland,
cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla and pituitary) were normal histologically
as were the cartilages from the treated carpal joints.<P>

This study concluded adequate safety for intra-articular treatment in
horses with a 1% Legend Injectable Solution formulation. This conclusion
was based upon no significant adverse effects following treatment with 5
times the labeled use rate at 7 day intervals for a total of 9
treatments.<P>
<B>2). Drug Tolerance Evaluation for the Intravenous Treatment of Horses
with Hyaluronate Sodium</B><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted a drug tolerance
study to evaluate the effects of excessive overdoses of hyaluronate
sodium when administered intravenously for 3 consecutive days. Three
adult horses (male and female) of various breeds were used in this
study. Two horses received intravenous Legend Injectable Solution
treatment for 3 consecutive days; one at 10 times the use rate (40 mL)
and one at 25 times the use rate (100 mL). The third horse served as a
control and received physiological saline treatment. The Legend
Injectable Solution was the 1% formulation intended for market.<P>
Parameters monitored included clinical signs, body weights, body
temperatures, hematology parameters (white blood cell count, red blood
cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, WBC
differential, RBC morphology and platelet count), serum chemistries
(sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid,
creatinine, BUN/Cr ratio, creatine kinase; total, direct and indirect
bilirubin; alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl

adrenal gland, urinary bladder, spleen, stomach, small intestine, colon,
cecum, pancreas, mesenteric lymph node, lung, heart, thyroid gland,
cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla and pituitary) readings.<P>
There were no clinical signs of toxicosis nor clinically significant
variations in body weights or temperatures. No trends developed in the
hematology or serum chemistry parameters. No significant lesions were
observed at necropsy or upon histology readings. The hematology and
clinical chemistry evaluations were blinded in that the laboratory
personnel were unaware of the treatments given. A brief summary is

<b>3). Safety Evaluation for the Intravenous Use of Hyaluronate Sodium in
Horses</b><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas used 16 male and female horses
of various breeds and with an age range of 2 to 10 years in a general
target species safety evaluation to determine a margin of safety for the
intravenous administration of Hyaluronate Sodium 1% Injectable to
horses. Four horses served as controls and received 20 mL physiological
saline treatment. Each of the remaining 3 groups contained 4 horses and
they received Legend Injectable Solution intravenous treatments weekly
via the jugular vein for 9 consecutive weeks which is 3 times the
labeled duration. Treatment rates each week were at intravenous use rate
(4 mL), 3X use rate (12 mL) or 5X use rate (20 mL). The Legend
Injectable Solution was the formulation intended for market (10
mg/mL).<P>
Parameters monitored included clinical signs, body weights, body
temperatures, hematology (white blood cell count, red blood cell count,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular

</PRE>
This study concluded that intravenous treatment of horses is without
adverse effects at dosages up to and including 20 mL/treatment (5X the
use rate) when administered at 7 day intervals for a total of 9
treatments (3X the use duration).<P>
<B>B. Corroborative Studies</B><P>
The following safety studies are supportive of the pivotal studies
conducted in horses.<P>
<B>1). Preliminary Safety Evaluation for Intravenous, Intramuscular and
Subcutaneous</B> <B>Treatment of Horses</B><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas used 6 adult male and female
horses of various breeds in an uncontrolled preliminary safety study
with the Legend Injectable Solution intended for market. Two received
intravenous treatments of 2 mL for two consecutive days and a third
treatment after a 2 week interval. Likewise, two received intramuscular
injections and two were treated subcutaneously with 2 mL of product
according to the same schedule.<P>
Parameters were pain response, tissue swelling and clinical signs,
including those of sensitization.<P>
No adverse effects were observed.<P>
<B>2). Preliminary Safety Evaluation for Intravenous Administration to
Horses</B><P>
T. Wollen of Shawnee Mission, Kansas used 6 mixed-breed male and female
horses with an age range of 2 to 10 years in a preliminary uncontrolled
safety evaluation for intravenous use of Legend 1% Injectable Solution.
Five horses received three 4 mL intravenous treatments at weekly
intervals. One additional horse received the same treatment schedule,
but the product was injected perivascularly.<P>
Parameters were clinical signs, body temperatures and observations for
swelling or pain at the site of injection.<P>
No side effects were observed in this study utilizing the intravenous
route of administration. It furthered corroborated that perivascular
treatment did not induce adverse effects.<P>
<B>3). Additional Safety Evaluation for Intravenous Administration to
Horses; Including a Determination for Sensitization Potential</B><P>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas used 6 male and female adult
horses of Quarter Horse type in an additional uncontrolled preliminary
safety study to evaluate intravenous treatment. Three horses received 3
treatments on alternate days and a fourth treatment 16 days later at a
rate of 4 mL per treatment. Three additional horses were treated via the
same schedule but the dosage rate was 8 mL per treatment.<P>
Parameters were clinical signs (including observations for any potential
sensitization), body temperatures, body weights and local tolerance at
the injection site.<P>
There were no side effects and the study further corroborated the safety
of intravenous treatment of horses with Legend Injectable Solution.<P>
<B>4). Clinical Field Trial Safety Studies</B><P>
Confirmation of safety for the intra-articular and intravenous treatment
of horses with Legend Injectable Solution was achieved in the clinical
field trials. No adverse local or systemic side effects were observed in
the horses treated with Legend Injectable Solution in any of the
clinical field trials. See sections 4.A. and 4.B. of this FOI
Summary.<P>
In conclusion, the clinical field trials substantiate an adequate safety
margin for the intra- articular treatment of the carpal or fetlock joint
in horses with a dose of 20 mg (2 mL) per treatment of Legend Injectable
Solution for 3 treatments at weekly intervals. The trials further verify
the safety for the intravenous use of Legend Injectable Solution for 3
treatments at weekly intervals with a dose of 40 mg (4 mL) per
treatment.<P>
<B>6. Human Safety</B><P>
<B>A. Human Food Safety</B><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in
food, were not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is for use
in horses that are not to be used for food and is labeled: "Warning: Not
for use in horses intended for food."<P>
<B>B. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and
Administration</B><P>
Hyaluronate Sodium is a naturally occurring substance in both man and
animals. As such, there are no special handling requirements for the
drug. As a prescription drug, there are adequate directions in the
labeling for the proper use of Legend Injectable Solution by the
veterinarian.<P>
<B>7. Agency Conclusions</B><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing
regulations. The data in the NADA demonstrate that Legend (hyaluronate
sodium 10 mg/mL) Injectable Solution is safe and effective when used in
accordance with the labeling directions.<P>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, this new animal drug application qualifies for a period of 3 years
of marketing exclusivity. The active ingredient in Legend (hyaluronate
sodium) has previously been approved in another NADA, NADA 112-048 for
the use of hyaluronate sodium for intra-articular administration in
horses for the treatment of joint dysfunction of the carpus and fetlock
due to non- infectious synovitis associated with equine osteoarthritis.
New clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence studies)
were essential for approval of this NADA for the intravenous route of
administration and were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>
The safe and effective use of Legend (hyaluronate sodium) Injected
intra-articularly or intravenously in horses requires a veterinarian's
knowledge of aseptic technique and knowledge of the anatomy of the
specific joint. Therefore, the Agency has concluded that this drug
product must be provided to the public on a prescription basis.<P>

REVALOR&#174;-G<p>

<I>Marketing Status</I>:<p>

Over the counter (OTC)<p>

<I>Effect of Supplement</I>:<p>

Provides for the administration of REVALOR&#174;-G in
pasture heifers (slaughter, stocker and feeder heifers) for increased rate of
weight gain.<p>

<b>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><p>

For increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle (slaughter, stocker and
feeder steers and heifers).<p>

<b>3. DOSAGE FORM(S), ROUTE(S) OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</b><p>

The dosage form is implantation.  The route of administration is subcutaneous
implantation on the posterior aspect of the middle one-third of the ear by
means of an implant gun.  The recommended dosage is one implant containing 40
mg trenbolone acetate and 8 mg estradiol.  Each implant is made up of two
pellets with each pellet containing 20 mg trenbolone acetate and 4 mg
estradiol.  Each implant is contained in one division of a multiple dose
cartridge.  There are ten doses in each cartridge.  The cartridge is designed
to be used with a special implant gun which places the implant under the skin
on the posterior aspect of the ear.<p>

<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>

The supplemental new animal drug application for REVALOR-G contains data
from adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of
the new animal drug for the indications for use and dosage as given in Sections
2 and 3 above.<p>

Pivotal Studies:<p>

The pivotal studies are dose titration studies in which the parameters measured
are the same parameters as are measured in field investigations.  Four dose
titration studies were conducted using a uniform protocol so that the results
of the studies could be pooled and summarized.  The studies were conducted in
the major beef producing areas of the United States.<p>

</pre>

The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the dose response for trenbolone
acetate (TBA) and estradiol (E2beta) on average daily gain of heifers maintained on
pasture.  The test animals were straight-bred and cross-bred animals of
European and Exotic breeds.  For each study, 300 heifers were blocked by weight
(six heifers/block) and randomly assigned within block to one of six treatments
(50 replicates/treatment).  The treatments consisted of Control (no implant),
10 mg E2beta, 40 mg TBA, 2 mg E2beta/10 mg TBA, 4 mg E2beta/20 mg TBA, and 8 mg E2beta/40 mg
TBA.  The average weights of heifers for each study were between 475 lbs. and
593 lbs. when the studies were initiated.  The duration of the studies ranged
between 96 and 114 days.<p>

Each heifer was administered TBA and E2beta via subcutaneous implantation on the
backside of the mid-ear.  The heifers were administered the implant once at the
initiation of each study.  After the cattle were implanted they were maintained
together in the same pasture for the duration of the study.<p>

Average daily gain (ADG) data for the heifers are summarized in Table 1 for
each of the four dose titration studies.<p>

A randomized complete block design was used for all four studies and the data
were pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect
of TBA/E2beta implants on ADG.  There was a significant (P&#60;.01) linear response
in ADG to increasing levels of the combination product with the maximum
response seen at the highest dose (8 mg E2beta /40 mg TBA).  The 8 mg E2beta
/40 mg TBA treatment also was shown to be significantly (P &#60; .05) better
than 40 mg TBA alone and 10 mg E2beta alone.  These data are sufficient to support
the claims and dosage as provided in Sections 2 and 3.<p>

<b>5. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>

The supplemental new animal drug application for REVALOR-G references the
target animal safety studies summarized in the FOI for NADA 140-992 (60 FR 4376
- January 23, 1995).  The data from those studies demonstrate the safety of the
new animal drug for the indications for use and dosage as given in Sections 2
and 3 above.<p>

<b>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>

A. Toxicity Tests<p>

The toxicity studies summarized in the FOI from NADA 138-612 (52 FR 24994 -
July 2, 1987) have met the Agency's requirement for human food safety for TBA.
Allowable incremental increases of estradiol have been established by the
Agency under 21 CFR 556.240.<p>

B. Safe Concentration of Residues<p>

Under NADA 138-612 (TBA), it was determined that the safe concentration for
total residues of trenbolone was 50 ppb for muscle, 100 ppb for liver, 150 ppb
for kidney, and 200 ppb for fat (21 CFR 556.739).  The total average trenbolone
residues in the livers of animals treated with 200 mg 3H-TBA were determined to
be 43.8 ppb and 50.5 ppb at 15 and 30 days, respectively.  The residues in
muscle, kidney, and fat were much lower.<p>

C. Residue Depletion Study<p>

A tissue residue study was conducted to determine the residues of estradiol
and the two metabolites of TBA (17alpha-hydroxytrenbolone (17alpha-TBA) and
17beta-hydroxytrenbolone (17beta-TBA)) in heifers treated with 180 mg TBA + 18 mg
estradiol.  The results of the estradiol assays from the treated and control
animals were compared to the allowable incremental increases permitted under 21
CFR 556.240.  When the residues of estradiol in the treated animals were
compared to the naturally occurring levels in the untreated controls, they were
found to be much lower than the allowable incremental increases.  For
trenbolone acetate residues, the purpose of the study was to determine the
residue levels in the treated animals and compare them to the residues incurred
with the approved Finaplix-H implant (200 mg trenbolone acetate alone).  Liver
residues of 17beta-TBA resulting from the use of 180 mg TBA/18 mg estradiol were
not statistically different from the residues of 17beta-TBA resulting from the use
of 200 mg TBA alone at either 15 or 30 days postimplantation.  Furthermore, the
combined levels of 17alpha-TBA and 17beta-TBA were less than the combined amounts of
these residues for the 200 mg TBA implant which is approved.  This study is
summarized in the FOI Summary from NADA 140-992 (60 FR 4376 - January 23,
1995).<p>

Since the dose of TBA and estradiol are significantly lower for Revalor-G
(pasture heifers) than the dose approved for Revalor-H (feedlot heifers),
additional residue studies were not required for this approval.<p>

D. Withdrawal Period<p>

Residues of estradiol in heifers treated with Revalor-H were many times lower
than the allowable incremental increases permitted under 21 CFR 556.240.
Residues of 17beta-TBA in the tissues of heifers treated with Revalor-H were not statistically
different from the residues of 17beta-TBA resulting from the use of 200 mg TBA
alone.  The combined trenbolone levels (17alpha-TBA + 17beta-TBA) were lower in heifers
treated with Revalor-H than in heifers treated with 200 mg TBA alone.  As such,
a withdrawal period was not required for the approval of Revalor-H.<p>

Since the dose of TBA and estradiol are significantly lower for Revalor-G
(pasture heifers) than the dose approved for Revalor-H (feedlot heifers), a
withdrawal time likewise is not required for this approval.<p>

E. Regulatory Method<p>
	
Since a withdrawal period is not required for the use of Revalor-G, neither a
regulatory or confirmatory method was required for this approval.<p>

<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

Adequate data were provided to demonstrate the safe and effective use of
Revalor-G (ear implant containing 40 mg TBA and 8 mg estradiol) when used in
pasture heifers (slaughter, stocker and feeder heifers) for increased rate of
weight gain.<p>

	Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this
is a Category II change providing for the use of an ear implant containing 40
mg TBA and 8 mg estradiol in pasture heifers.  The approval of this change
is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of
this new animal drug.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for three years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the supplemental
application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  The three years of marketing
exclusivity applies only to the change for which the supplemental application
was approved, i.e., use of an ear implant containing 40 mg TBA and 8 mg
estradiol in pasture heifers.<p>

penaeid shrimp specified above, a 4-hour exposure from 50 to 100 ppm of formalin
daily until parasite control is achieved or a single treatment in ponds at 25 ppm
(may be repeated in 5 to 10 days if needed).</ol><p>
<b>IV.  ANIMAL EFFICACY</b><P>
Efficacy data from the Freedom of Information (FOI) summary for PMF 3543,
56 FR 20618, May 6, 1991, demonstrated that formalin, when used as directed, is 
effective in the treatment and control of external protozoan parasites on shrimp.<P>
<b>V.  ANIMAL SAFETY</b><P>
Target animal safety data from the Freedom of Information (FOI) summary for PMF
3543, 56 FR 20618, May 6, 1991, demonstrated that an adequate margin of animal
safety is inherent to formalin when it is used as directed by labeling in penaeid
shrimp.<P>
<b>VI.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><P>
<b>A.  Toxicity Testing:</b><p>
These have been adequately addressed in the FOI summary for PMF 3543.<p>
<b>B.  Withdrawal Time:</b><P>
Residue depletion data submitted under PMF 3543, 56 FR 20618, May 6, 1991,
support a zero-hour pre-harvest withdrawal time for penaeid shrimp treated with
the recommended dose of formalin.<p>
<b>VII.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that formalin, when used
under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the control of
external protozoan parasites on penaeid shrimp.<P>
 A tolerance is not required for shrimp because total residue data submitted under
 PMF 3543, 56 FR 20618, May 6, 1991, indicate that mean concentrations of formalin
 residues at 12 hours after the last treatment (zero-hour withdrawal) were not
 different from naturally-occurring formaldehyde, which is a product of autolysis.<p>
 The proposed labeling is adequate to assure the safe use of formalin by 
 aquaculturists.  Therefore, this product can be marketed Over-the-Counter (OTC).<P>
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required.
The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the evidence supporting
that finding are contained in an environmental assessment, which may be seen in
the Docket Management Branch (HFV-305), Park Building (Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn
Dr., Rockville, Maryland 20855.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy, 21 CFR 514.106(b)(2), this is a
Category II change.  The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this
approval for food producing animals does not qualify for marketing exclusivity
because the supplemental application does not contain reports of new clinical or
field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human
food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) esential to the
approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>Generic Name:</b>            Xylazine Injectable Solution, 20 mg/ml<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b>  AnaSed(TM), Injectable Solution<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b>        Rx<p>
<b>Effect of Supplement:</b>    Supplement provides for use of the product in an
additional species (dog).<p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> April 24, 1990<p>
<b>2. Indications For Use:</b><p>
<b>INDICATIONS: </b> Xylazine should be used in dogs when it is desirable to produce a state of
sedation accompanied by a shorter period of analgesia. Xylazine has been used
successfully as follows:<uL><p>
    <li>a.  Diagnostic procedures: Examination of mouth and ears, abdominal palpation,
rectal palpation, vaginal           examination, catheterization of the bladder and
radiographic examinations of head and extremities.<p>
    <li>b.  Orthopedic procedures, such as application of casting materials and
splints.<p>
    <li>c.  Dental procedures.<p>
    <li>d.  Minor surgical procedures of short duration such as debridement, removal
of cutaneous neoplasms and          suturing of lacerations.<p>
    <li>e.  To calm and facilitate restraint of fractious animals.<p>
    <li>f.  Major surgical procedures:<ul><br>
        <li>1) When used as a preanesthetic to general anesthesia.  <br>
        <li>2) When used in conjunction with local anesthetics.</ul></ul><p>
 
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p>
ANASED(TM) is supplied in 20 ml multiple dose vials as a sterile solution
containing 20 mg xylazine/ml.<p>
The routes of administration and recommended doses are: Intravenous, 0.5 mg/20
lb body weight (0.5 mg/lb, or 1.1 mg/kg); or intramuscular or subcutaneous, 1.0
mg/20 lb body weight (1.0 mg/lb, or 2.2 mg/kg).<p>
In large dogs (over 50 lbs), a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg (1.1 mg/kg) administered
intramuscularly may provide sufficient sedation and/or analgesia for most
procedures.<p>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
Two adequate and well controlled studies were conducted to establish the
effectiveness of AnaSed.  Additionally, a literature review was submitted which
confirmed the proposed dosage of xylazine and provided information on the
pharmacologic, physiologic, and clinical effects of xylazine at therapeutic and
toxic dose levels.<p>
<b>Pivotal Studies:<p>
    A.  Pivotal Studies<p>
    1. Controlled Laboratory Study</b><p>
    A combined study of dose titration (efficacy) and toxicity of the xylazine was
conducted.  The trials involved 30  adult dogs, randomly divided into 5 test
groups of 3 males and 3 females, to test graded doses of xylazine with a
geometric progression of 2.  A summary of dosing by test groups follows, with
the number of dogs tested per   group:<p>

</pre>
 
    Tests were conducted in 3 replicates (Phases), each replicate containing dogs
of both sexes and all groups.   Xylazine (AnaSed(TM), Canine Injectable
Xylazine HCl, Vet-A-Mix, Inc., containing 20 mg xylazine/ml) was    administered
by a single IV injection into a cephalic vein.  The effect on sedation was
assessed by recording the   Recumbency Time (RT), Arousal Time (AT) and Walk
Time (WT) after injection of xylazine.  The effect on   analgesia was done by a
toe pinch prior to injection, at five minutes, 15 minutes, and 35 minutes post
injection   of xylazine.  Responses were graded where 0 &#61; a violent reaction and
3 &#61; no response.<p>
    The study directors were Gary D. Osweiler, DVM, PhD and Joseph W. Denhart,
DVM, College of Veterinary Medicine,    Iowa State Univ., Ames, Iowa 50011.<p>
    The  6 dogs in the control Group 1 had no RT, AT, or WT.  This was expected,
since those dogs received no drug.      The ANOVA used to test sedation was
therefore conducted on the 4 groups containing the 24 dogs which     received
xylazine (groups 2,3,4 &amp; 5). The ANOVA was conducted on all 5 groups in
testing analgesia (Toe  Pinch).<p>
    <b>a.  Sedative Effects</b><p>
        Following are results of the study and statistical analysis.  The table
summarizes means of the results.<p>

        Generally some type of modeling is done in a dose titration study, but in
this instance the data collected do         not appear to warrant this type of
analysis.  Walk Time is the only sedation variable in which the treatment
means were significantly different and this was probably largely due to the 2.0
mg/lb group which was           included primarily for toxicology purposes.  The
standard deviations for Arousal Time and Recumbency Time        are large indicating
that the data is highly variable.  However, the drug appears to cause sedation
and .5 mg  AnaSed appears to give the most favorable results when all three variables
are considered -- shorter time to         recumbency than either .25 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0
mg, slightly longer arousal time than 1.0 mg but definitely         shorter than 2.0
mg (arousal time for .25 mg appears too short) and much better walk time than
either 1.0 or       2.0 mg.<p>
   <b> b.  Analgesic Effects</b><p>
        The following table summarizes the results of the toe pinch test:<p>
        An analysis of variance done at &#43;5 minutes and  &#43;15 minutes post injection
showed that the treatment means         were significantly different (p&#61;.03 and
p&#61;.01, respectively).  Using pairwise comparisons tests for the &#43;5         minute
toe pinch test all of the treatment means are significantly different from the
control.  In the &#43;15        minute toe pinch test the treatment groups 1.0 mg and
2.0 mg are significantly different from the control at      p&lt;.05.  The
treatment group 0.5 mg is significantly different from the control at P&#61;.08.<p>

   <b> c.  Conclusions</b><p>
        Sedation and analgesia were effected at all doses.  However, it appeared that
the minimum reliable dose was       0.50 mg/lb IV.  This dose effected mean
sedation times of approximately 30 minutes and analgesia for 5 to       35
minutes.<p>
<b>2. Controlled Clinical Field Trial</b><p>
    Clinical trials were conducted at Urbana, IL (Drs. John C. Thurmon, William
Tranquilli, and G. John Benson);    Nashville, TN (Drs. Robert F. Ingram 
and Jerry W. Perry); and Houston, TX (Drs. Frederick K. Soifer, S.A.
Fronefield, and Marc T. Hays) Rompun&#174; was used as active     control.  Rompun&#174; and
AnaSed(TM) were tested in a double blind study in 182 dogs of both sexes.  Sedation
was     tested by observing recumbency time, arousal time, and walk time as in the
laboratory study.  Analgesia was    tested by observing response to a needle
prick.  The xylazine products were administered by IV, IM or SC     injection.<p>
    Procedures conducted in these clinical trials following the administration of
xylazine included dentistry, nail   trimming, grooming, suturing of wounds,
radiography, and physical examinations of fractious animals.    Following are
results and statistical analyses.  Responses to AnaSed(TM) were
satisfactory.<p>
    Summary of clinical trials where AnaSed(TM) and Rompun&#174; were compared at
three locations using behavioral    scores:<p>
    There were: <p>    60 animals at Urbana, Illinois<br>
                60 animals at Nashville, Tennessee<br>
                62 animals at Houston, Texas<p>
    Animals were from both sexes and were given AnaSed(TM) or Rompun&#174; either I.V., I.M.
or S.C..<p>
    Measures of sedation were in minutes.  The measure of analgesia was a ranked
response to prick tests,    administered twice before and three times after
injection of xylazine.  The two measures taken before the   injection of the
drug were averaged to serve as a baseline and then compared to measures after
the injection of the    drug.  Analyses here are done on corrected post injection
scores obtained by subtracting the baseline from the    post injection score.
For both analgesia and sedation measures there were no significant differences
between the  two drugs.   <p>
    
    The means of measures of sedation by drug, administration, and location are
given below:<p>

<i>Veterinary Medicine/Small        Animal Clinician</i>&#160; 236-241, March, 1973.<p>
    Use of xylazine in 107 dogs and cats over 18 months demonstrated many clinical
uses.  IV, IM or SC routes  were used.  Alone, (59&#37; of cases) effective
analgesia and sedation occurred.  As a preanesthetic, xylazine reduced  the
required amount of anesthetic by as much as 75&#37;.  The only major side effects
noted were reduction in heart   and respiratory rates and a transitory drop in
blood pressure.<p>

in cystometry in the dog and    cat.  <i>Am. J. Vet. Res.</i>&#160; 34:665-668,
1973.<p>
    A variety of central nervous system (CNS) depressants and a skeletal muscle
paralyzing agent were evaluated for     restraining dogs and cats during air
cystometry.  General anesthetics frequently blocked the micturition reflex.
Tranquilizers and other agents blocked the reflex, allowed the animal to
inhibit the reflex or provided inadequate   restraint.  Xylazine was the only
drug which provided adequate restraint without blocking the micturition
reflex.<p>

    Both experimental (6 dogs) and clinical trials (12 dogs) were carried out to
assess the action of xylazine (0.15     mg of a 2&#37; solution/kg body weight) in the
dog.  It was concluded that xylazine may be used as a hypnotic, as  a mild
sedative and as a pre-anesthetic sedative in recently fed dogs.<p>

"xylazine" in dogs. <i> Philippine J.   Vet. Med </i>  .  11:122-133,
1972.<p>
    Induction was smooth and brief and without excitement.  Heart rate was reduced
50&#37; with a 36&#37; decrease in  respiratory rate.  Xylazine induced deep sleep or
hypnosis.  Strong analgesia resulted, as did excellent muscular     relaxation.
Recovery averaged 60 to 120 minutes.  No untoward results occurred, but a dose
of 34X and a dose   of 90X was fatal to two dogs receiving these.<p>

    At 0.02 ml/kg IV induced hypnosis and facilitated handling and induction of
general anesthesia, also providing  efficient analgesia and muscle relaxation.
Xylazine significantly reduced the amount of pentobarbital for surgical
anesthesia by 42&#37; as calculated.  Pulse rate was reduced 42&#37; and respiratory
rate 60&#37;. Recovery took an  average of 155 minutes, varying from smooth to
violent.  No untoward reactions were encountered.<p>

    Thirteen healthy male dogs and 11 healthy female dogs were subjected to
urodynamic assessment, using a  simultaneous urethral pressure profile and
urethral sphincter electromyogram (EMG).  The study was done on     the dogs in
the nonsedated state and after xylazine sedation.  Results showed a
significant decrease in maximal     urethral closure pressures in dogs of both
sexes after they were given xylazine (from 79.79 cm of H2O to 23.00     cm of H2O
in female dogs, and from 99.77 cm H2O to 41.77 cm of H2O in male dogs).  There
was a   significant reduction in EMG activities in dogs of both sexes after they
were given xylazine.  There was also    little variability in measurements made
on the same dog on consecutive days.  Simultaneous intravesicular   pressure and
urethral pressure monitoring indicated that the effect of bladder distention on
the urethral pressure   profile was minimal and there was no spontaneous
detrusor contractions.  This study indicates that xylazine  produced a
significant artifact in the simultaneous urethral pressure profile/EMG.<p>

</i>&#160;20:791-794, 1984.<p>
    A clinical dose of xylazine to 12 pointer dogs caused serum insulin to
decrease from control values at minute  twenty through one hundred twenty.
Thereafter, serum insulin rose, reaching control values at one hundred  eighty
minutes.  Plasma glucose concentration was increased at 60 through 240 minutes.
By 360 minutes, both    glucose and insulin concentration were near normal.<p>

    Radiographs taken prior to and 30 to 90 minutes after each of 12 dogs was
given 2&#37; xylazine HCl at 2.0 to 3.0     mg/kg IV or IM indicated 0 to 200&#37;
increase in gastric length (avg 95&#37;) and -40 to 611&#37; increase in width  (avg
125&#37;).  Intestinal diameter increased 15 to 275&#37; (avg 124&#37;).  Since
radiographic changes were consistent    with gastric dilation and paralytic
ileus, xylazine should not be used as a sedative for abdominal radiography.<p>
    <li>10. Yates WD: Clinical use of xylazine, a new drug for old problems.
<i>VM/SAC</i>&#160; 483-486, May 1973.<p>
    Xylazine was used as a sedative analgesic in 93 dogs and 22 cats and as a
preanesthetic in 130 dogs and 49 cats.      Handling of patients was easy,
induction was smooth and a quiet, peaceful recovery ensued.  Five typical
clinical    canine case histories were presented.  The versatility of xylazine,
combined with its predictable effectiveness     makes it an invaluable asset in
small animal practices.</ul><p>

    None of the Serum Biochemistry and Hematology parameters were significant by
ANOVA by Group*Time     interactions.  All Serum Biochemistry values were within
normal limits.  The values which were significant by    the Dunnett tests did not
appear to be indicative of any toxicological trends.<p>
    After injections minor muscle twitching or tremors were observed, increasing
with doses.  Vomiting was   common, not generally correlated with dosage
rate.<p>
    Post mortem examination revealed the presence of heartworms in 2 dogs and
whipworms in 1 dog.  There were     no gross pathological changes noted.
Histopathology of organs of the 8 dogs failed to reveal any pathological
changes related to the injections of xylazine.<p>

    Ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation were produced with
epinephrine in dogs induced to an   anesthetic state with thiamylal and
maintained with halothane.  In dogs given (premedicated) xylazine 20    minutes
prior to anesthesia, ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular
fibrillation, were induced with much    smaller doses of epinephrine than in 
nonpremedicated dogs.  Dogs premedicated with acetylpromazine 20   minutes prior to
anesthesia with thiamylal and halothane displayed protection from epinephrine
induced     arrhythmias.  Caution is advised from using xylazine in the presence
of halothane if epinephrine is to be    administered.<p>

    Changes in cardiac contractility were assessed by two indices of myocardial
contractile performance (dP/dt/Kp   max, V max).  Both indices demonstrated an
initial positive inotropic response to intravenous administration of    xylazine
(1.1 mg/kg).  This positive inotropic effect was followed by a return to or
significant decrease from   base line recordings in these times following
xylazine administration.  In addition, an increase in heart rate in     control
dogs was accompanied by a rise in both dP/dt/Kp max and V max, confirming
earlier evidence of the     Bowditch staircase effect in the intact dog
ventricle.<p>

weight: an index of vascular    capacity.  <i>Am. J. Vet. Res.</i>&#160; 43:2188-2192,
1982.<p>
    Splenic weight, an index of changes in vascular capacity, was used to assess
the effects of xylazine hydrochloride   in anesthetized dogs.  Intravenous
xylazine (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) produced dose dependent decreases in   vascular
capacity as assessed by decreases in splenic weight which were significant
(P&lt;.05) at the 1 mg/kg   dose.  Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic
receptor blocking drug, prevented the splenic contractile response  to
xylazine. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, did not alter
the splenic contractile response    to xylazine.  Intravenous xylazine (0.1 and 1
mg/kg) produced significant (P&lt;.05) decreases in heart rate,     splenic
arterial flow, and systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures.  Central
venous pressure increased   significantly (P&lt;.05) in dogs given the 1 mg/kg
dose.<p>

    The cardiopulmonary consequences of IV administered xylazine (1.0 mg/kg)
followed by ketamine (10 mg/kg)     were evaluated in 12 dogs. Xylazine caused
significant decreases in heart rate, cardiac output, left ventricular   work,
breathing rate, minute ventilation, physiologic dead space, oxygen transport,
mixed venous partial    pressure of oxygen, and oxygen utilization ratio.<p>
    The subsequent administration of ketamine was associated with significant
increases in heart rate (transient  increase), cardiac output, the alveolar
arterial PO2  gradient and venous admixture (transient increase), and arterial

    Neither IV or IM administration of xylazine changed significantly the arterial
pH, arterial oxygen or carbon   dioxide tension, but did significantly decrease
heart rate, aortic flow, and increased peripheral resistance and blood
pressure, though the latter decreased rapidly thereafter.  Atropine did not
significantly change any of these effects   of xylazine.</ul><p>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><p>
    a.  Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of       this supplemental NADA. The drug is to be
labeled for use in dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>
    b.  Human safety relative to possession, handling and administration: Labeling
bears adequate warning          statement.  Labeling states, "Warning: Not for Human
Use."<p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that AnaSed (xylazine)
Injectable Solution is safe and effective when it is desirable to produce a
state of sedation accompanied by a shorter period of analgesia.<p>
According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is a
Category II change.  The supplemental provided for the additional claim for use
in dogs and, therefore, required complete new safety and effectiveness data for
use of the new animal drug in dogs.  This approval did not require a
reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the parent application.<p>
Under section 512 (c) (2) (F) (iii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this supplement does not qualify for an exclusivity
period because the reports supporting the supplemental approval do not qualify
as "new clinical or field investigations" under that section because there is
an earlier approval under section 512 (b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act for xylazine in dogs based on similar investigations.<p>
AnaSed(TM) is used in the dog when conducting various diagnostic, orthopedic,
and dental procedures, for minor surgical procedures of short duration, and as
a preanesthetic to local or general anesthesia, all of which are procedures
which should be performed by a licensed veterinarian only.  Accordingly, AnaSed
is a prescription new animal drug.<p>

<b>EFFECTIVENESS:</b> <P>
NADA 065-256 was originally approved as safe for use as
labeled on October 14, 1966. The drug was the subject of National Academy of
Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) reports which were published in
the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 21, 1970 (<B>35 FR 11647</B>). The Academy
evaluated these products as probably effective for growth promotion and feed
efficiency and the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive
to chlortetracycline.<P>
The Academy states that: ( 1 ) Claims made regarding "for prevention of" or "to
prevent" should be replaced with "as an aid in the control of" or "to aid in
the control of"; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed
and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as "may
result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate
conditions"; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as
"appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to
(name of drug) "; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be
dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be
changed to "May aid in maintaining egg production and hatchability, under
appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms"; (5) the
labels should warn that treated animals must actually consume enough medicated
water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions
that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of
animal weight per day for each species as<i> </i>a guide to effective usage of
the preparation in drinking water or feed: and (6)effective blood levels are
required for each recommended dosage.<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs in the findings of the Academy;
however, the Administration concludes the appropriate claim for faster weight
gains and improved feed efficiency should be "For increased rate of weight gain
and improved feed efficiency for (under appropriate conditions of use)."<P>
The Food and Drug Administration concurs with the Academy's findings,
interpreting the phrase "...cannot be so qualified..." in paragraph (3) to mean
"...is not supported by adequate data..." (See <B>Fed. Reg. vol. 35, NO.
140-Tues., July 21, 1970</B>). FDA proceeded to review all available data relating
to the effectiveness of products subject to NADA 065-256 to determine which
label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. That
review resulted in a letter to the sponsor dated April 20, 1992, in which the
agency stated that it had concluded that such data supported effectiveness only
for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to
chlortetracycline hydrochloride in chickens, turkeys and swine.<P>
Thereafter, the sponsor complied with the evaluation of NAS/NRC and FDA's
conclusions in the following manner:<P>
1.	Appropriate oral doses of 10 mg per pound body weight daily in swine,
200-800 mg/gallon for chickens and turkeys and 25 mg per pound body weight for
turkeys when treating bluecomb disease (transmissible enteritis, coronaviral
enteritis) have been established.<P>
2.	Claims for inappropriate viral diseases have been deleted from the labeling
completely.<P>
3.	Each disease claim on the label has been properly qualified with the
appropriate genus and species of bacteria susceptible to chlortetracycline
hydrochloride. Disease claims which were not so qualified have been deleted.<P>
4.	Claims made for prevention have been revised to read "Control of..." where
appropriate.<P>
5.	The manufacturer's label carries the warning statement that treated animals
must have the medicated water adjusted to compensate for variation in age and
the weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease signs, and
environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water
consumption.<P>
<b>ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><P>
 NADA 065-256 was originally approved as safe on October
14, 1966. No further safety data are required.<P>
<b>HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
The NAS/NRC evaluation of the drug is concerned only
with the effectiveness and safety of the drug for the treated animal. FDA's
approval of the supplemental application does not involve reevaluation or
reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent application. The
tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are codified at <B>21 CFR 556.150.</B><P>
Withdrawal times: 5 days for swine, 24 hours for chickens and turkeys.<P>
<b>AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This supplemental NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Chlortetracycline Soluble Powder when used under its proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications. The
approval provides for use of Chlortetracycline Soluble Powder for the control
and treatment of specific diseases in swine, chickens and turkeys.<P>
The "probably effective" finding of the NAS/NRC regarding chlortetracycline
hydrochloride which was published in the <b>FEDERAL REGISTER</b> of July 21,
1970, was subsequently reviewed by FDA, resulting in the upgrade to "effective"
status with respect to the claims noted in the previous paragraph. The firm
submitted revised labeling to conform and, therefore, this supplemental NADA
complies with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions.<P>
When NADA 065-256 was reviewed under NAS / NRC / DESI program, it was an
over-the-counter product and this marketing status remains unchanged.
Chlortetracycline Soluble Powders for use in food-producing animals are also
currently on the market as over-the-counter products. Therefore, the Center for
Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this product should retain
over-thecounter marketing status.<P>
Under the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106(b)(2)), this is
a Category II change. The approval of this change is not expected to have any
adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of this new animal drug and,
therefore, did not require a reevaluation of the human food or target animal
safety data in the parent application.<P>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, this
approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section
512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b
(c)(2)(F)(iii)) because the supplemental application does not contain reports
of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and in the case of food producing animals human food safety studies
(other than bioequivalency or residue studies) essential to the approval and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<B>Generic Name:</B>       Hyaluronate Sodium<P>
<B>Trade Name:</B>     Equron<P>
<B>Marketing Status:</B>   Rx<P>
<B>Date of Approval:</B>  July 10, 1986<P>
<B>2.  Indications for Use:</B><P>
Equron is indicated for the treatment of joint dysfunction in horses due to
noninfectious synovitis associated with equine osteoarthritis.<P>

<B>3.Dosage Form and Administration:</B><P>
The dose of Equron in small and medium size joints (fetlock, carpal) is 2
ml (10 mg) administered intra-articularly.  In larger joints (hock), the dose
is 4 ml (20 mg).  Depending on the clinical response and medical judgement of
the veterinarian, the treatment may be repeated weekly for a total of four
treatments.<P>
Strict aseptic measures should be taken to prepare the site for injection
and during the intra-articular administration of Equron. Care should be used
while injecting to avoid scratching the cartilage surfaces.  Such trauma can
result in diffuse, transient swelling lasting 24 to 48 hours, but will have no
detrimental effect on the ultimate clinical response.  For best results, the
horse should be given two days of stall rest before gradually resuming normal
physical activity.<P>
<B>4.  Studies Demonstrating Effectiveness:</B><P>
<B>A.  Pivotal Studies</B><P>
<B>i.  Dose Determination</B><P>
A dose determination study was conducted between April 30 and June 6, 1985
at the Meadowlands, Racetrack, East Rutherford, NJ under the direction of Dr.
Kenneth Seeber, Oak Hollow Farm, Gladstone, NJ.  Equron injections were
performed by Dr. Seeber and clinical evaluations were performed by his
associate Dr. Kevin Skinner.   
Synovial fluid analyses were done by Chesapeake Biological Laboratories,
Inc., Hunt Valley, MD.<P>
<B>a.  Study Design</B><P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and synovial fluid
response of racing horses with joint lameness to various dosages of Equron.
Clinical cases actively in training or racing demonstrating lameness of the
carpal joint were selected by the directing veterinarian.  Selection criteria
for the clinical cases entered into the study were:  male or female, between 2
and 3 years of age, with lameness of a carpal joint demonstrating heat,
effusion, and pain upon flexion.  Only one joint per animal was treated.  Upon
acceptance into the study each case was randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment
groups:  control 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg Equron.  Each group consisted
of 10 cases, prior to treatment each case was graded for lameness, flexion,
heat, pain and swelling an a synovial fluid sample obtained for determination
of relative viscosity and protein concentration.  A single intra-articular
injection of the assigned Equron dose was administered and at 5-7 days
post-injection clinical evaluations and synovial fluid samplings were repeated.
Both the clinical evaluations and the synovial fluid analyses were conducted
blind.<P>
<B>b.  Results</B><P>
All forty cases displayed clinical signs of synovial inflammation of the
carpal joint prior to treatment.  The condition was characterized by reduced
range of flexion, pain upon pressure, swelling, heat and lameness.
Pretreatment synovial fluid analysis revealed reduced relative viscosity in all
cases.  The majority of the synovial protein concentrations were within the
normal range.<P>
At the post-treatment evaluation period, 9 of the 10 animals in the control
group (0.5 mg dose) had shown no change in their clinical lameness with one
case showing slight improvement.  In the 5 mg group 2 cases remained unchanged,
5 showed minimal improvement and 3 had returned to soundness.  All 10 cases in
the 10 mg group were judged sound at the post-treatment evaluation. Of the
cases in the 20 mg group, 9 were sound after 1 week.  The single case in this
group which did not achieve soundness was however greatly improved.<P>
Post -treatment synovial fluid analysis of the affected joints showed an
increase in the mean relative viscosity with increasing dosage of Equron.  Each
group exhibited some variation in the magnitude of change between individual
animals.  Since the pretreatment synovial fluid protein concentrations were
generally normal, no change in this parameter as a result of Equron injection
would be expected.  Protein concentrations remained largely within the normal
range with only a few cases showing slight elevations at the post-treatment
analysis.  Such variations ere random and not related to any specific dose
group.  Throughout the study all injections were well tolerated.  Despite the
 
dependency of efficacy on dose, no exacerbation of the pretreatment
condidtion or post-injection reactions were observed in any case.<P>
Table 1A summarizes the clinical results for pre and post-treatment
intervals for flexion, and clinical summary score. Table 1B summarizes the
laboratory results of the pre and post-treatment intervals for relative
viscosity and protein concentration of the synovial fluid.<P>

<B>c.  Statistical Analysis</B><P>
The data from the study was analyzed by the linear plateau models described
by Anderson and Nelson (Biometrics, 31:  303-318, 1975) to assess any dose
response relationship between the measured parameters and the amount of Equron
administered.  The clinical observations analyzed consisted of the observations
of heat, pain, swelling, and lameness.  Each of these latter four factors ere
ranked from 0 to 3 and the final clinical score was computed as the sum of the
four of each animal at both pretreatment and post-treatment intervals.  A
decrease in the clinical score indicates a reduction in one or more of the
parameters.  A score of 0 represents the absence of any clinical sign of joint
inflammation.<P>
The outcome variable for the dose response analysis consisted of the
observed differences between the post-treatment and pretreatment measures for
both flexion and the clinical summary score.  Additionally the two synovial
fluid parameters, protein concentration and ln (relative viscosity) were
analyzed as a function of dose for the difference between post-treatment and
pretreatment values.<P>
The data for all four groups was fit to three different models of dose
response:  linear model, plateau at 5 mg, and plateau at 10 mg.  The model
plateauing at the 10 mg dose level gave the best fit for clinical score and
flexion.  The change in relative viscosity, however, was best described by the
linear model with the highest dose giving the greatest change.  Synovial fluid
protein showed no significant change across the dose groups for either of the
models.<P>
In figures 1 and 2 the means of the differences in clinical score and
flexion are plotted as a function of dose.  For both the clinical score and
flexion, the basis for the plateau model selected is clearly seen.  The means
of the 10 and 20 mg groups are very similar.<P>

calculated as the sum of a 0-3 ranking for heat, pain, swelling, and lameness.
Maximum clinical score = 12 and minimum = 0.  A difference of 0 between post
and preclinical scores indicates no change and the larger the negative
difference, the greater the clinical improvement.  <P>

<B>d.  Conclusion</B><P>
Overall, these analyses demonstrate a positive dose response for 3 of the 4
measures in these animals.  Clinical scores and flexion strongly support the 10
mg dose while relative viscosity indicates a linear relationship with
increasing dosage.  These data suggest that although the 20 mg dose produced
the greater change in viscosity; the increase over that achieved by the 10 mg
is not clinically relevant.<P>

<B>ii.  Clearance Study</B><P>
The clearance rate of various doses of Equron was determined in a study
conducted between August 6 and August 24, 1984 at the Equine Gambit, Inc.,
Warwick, MD under the direction of
   Dr. Lawrence Cushing and
associate Dr. Clark Cushing.  Synovial fluid analyses were performed by
Chesapeake Biological Laboratories, Inc., Hunt Valley, MD.<P>
<B>a.  Study Design</B><P>
The purpose of this study was to determine the clearance rate of Equron
from the equine carpus and tibiotarsus as compared to an approved sodium
hyaluronate product for equine joint use.  Eight clinically normal thoroughbred
horses between 4 and 8 years of age were used in the study providing 16 carpal
and 16 tibiotarsal joints for evaluation.  The 16 bilateral radiocarpal and
tibiotarsal joints were randomly subdivided into 4 test groups per joint type
as shown in the Table 2.<P>

*  Equron(TM) - 5 mg/ml sodium hyaluronate in saline 

** Approved Product - 10 mg/ml sodium hyaluronate in phosphate 
   buffered saline. 

</PRE>
At the start of the study (T=0 hours) a volume of synovial fluid equivalent
to the volume of Equron to be injected was withdrawn from each test joint.
These samples were analyzed for hyaluronate concentration to establish the
pre-injection baseline values for this parameter.  Immediately following the
removal of this synovial fluid sample, the joint was injected with the assigned
test material.  Subsequently, synovial fluid samples were taken from each joint
at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-injection and analyzed for hyaluronate
concentration.<P>
<B>b.  Results</B><P>
For both the carpal and tibiotarsal joints the injection of saline produced
only slight changes in the endogenous hyaluronate levels at each of the
sampling intervals (Tables 3 and 4).  Elevations in synovial fluid hyaluronate
concentration were observed 24 hours after injection for the other dosage
groups with the increase being proportional to the amount of sodium hyaluronate
injected. By 48 hours the hyaluronate concentrations were decreasing and by
72-96 hours they had dropped to essentially pre-injection levels for both the
carpus and tibiotarsus.<P>

<B>c.  Statistical Analysis</B><P>
The first order rate constants for the clearance of sodium hyaluronate for
each dosage group for the carpus and tibiotarsus were calculated from the slope
of the line obtained from a plot of ln (hyaluronate concentration) versus time.
Listed in Tables 5 and 6 are the individual rate constants for the
intra-articular clearance of sodium hyaluronate from the synovial fluid of
normal equine carpal and tibiotarsal joints.  A one-way analysis of variance
revealed no significant difference among the dosage rate constants for the
carpal joints.  Similarly no significance was found between the rate constants
of the tibiotarsal joints.<P>

<B>d.  Conclusions:</B><P>
These data indicate that there is not significant difference between the
rates of clearance of 10 mg and 20 mg Equron from the equine carpus as compared
to 20 mg of the approved sodium hyaluronate product.  Similarly, the clearance
rates of 20 mg and 40 mg of Equron were comparable to 40 mg of the approved
product in the equine tibiotarsus.  Although the hyaluronate concentration of
the approved product was twice that of Equron, 10 mg/ml versus 5 mg/ml, there
was not evidence for an effect of product concentration on the rate constants
which govern clearance.  These data suggest that the appropriate frequency of
repeated sodium hyaluronate injections into the diseased or injured joints is
goverened by the kinetics of clearance.<P>
<B>iii.  Control Field Study</B><P>
A controlled field trial of Equron was conducted at Freestate Racetrack,
Laurel, MD between June 28 and September 9, 1985 under the direction of Dr.
Paul Plante, Mitchellville, MD and associate Dr. Peter Alvarez.  An approved
sodium hyaluronate product was used as a positive control.  Equron and control
injections were performed by Dr. Plante and clinical evaluations were done by
Dr. Alvarez.  Sunovial fluid analyses were done by Chesapeake Biological
Laboratories, Inc., Hunt Valley, MD.<P>
<B>a.  Study Design</B><P>
The purpose of the sudy was to compare the efficacy of Equron and an
approved sodium hyaluronate product in treating equine joint dysfunction due to
noninfectious synovitis associated with equine osteoarthritis.  Clinical cases
in training or racing demonstrating inflammation of the carpal or tibiotarsal
joint were selected by the directing veterinarian.  Selection criteria for the
clinical cases entered into the study were:  male or female, between 2 and 6
years of age, with inflammation of a carpus or tibiotarsus demonstrating
lameness, heat, effusion, or pain upon flexion.  Only one joint per animal was
treated.  Upon acceptance into the study each case was randomly assigned to one
of 2 treatment groups:  Equron or control.  Dosages for the Equron group were:
carpus 10 mg (5mg/ml x 2ml) and tibiotarsus 20 mg (5mg/ml x 4 ml).  For the
control group the dosages were: carpus 20 mg (10mg/ml x 2ml) and tibiotarsus 40
mg (10mg/ml x 4ml). Prior to treatment each case was graded for lameness, heat,
pain and swelling and a synovial fluid sample obtained for determination of
relative viscosity and protein concentration.  A single intra-articular
injection of either Equron or control was administered and at 6-8 days post-injection 
clinical evaluations and synovial fluid samplings were repeated.  
    If the animal was not sound a second injection of the original product (Equron
or control) could be given.  Up to 4 weekly injections of either product could
be given.  Both the clinical evaluations of the cases treated and the synovial
fluid analyses were conducted blind.<P>
<B>b.  Results:</B><P>
The 40 carpal cases evaluated in the study were characterized prior to
treatment and varying degrees of lameness, swelling, heat and pain in the
affected carpal joint.  Although not all of the clinical signs of inflammation
were present in all cases, each animal was judged by the evaluating
practitioner as exhibiting clinical inflammation of the carpus.<P> 

The study protocol allowed for a maximum of 4 weekly injections of either
product at the discretion of the evaluating veterinarian. In the Equon group of
20 clinical cases, 14 received one injection, 2 received 2 injections, 2
received 3 injections, and 2 received 4 injections.  By the end of treatment
regimen 14 of the 20 cases were judged to have shown maximum improvement (76-100%). 
In each case the lameness score was graded 0 at the end of the
treatment.  The other parameters, swelling, heat, and pain showed a general
decrease within the group, although in some cases not all three changed.  Six
of the 20 cases in the Equron group were judged to have improved 50-75% at the
end of their treatment regimen.  Similar to those cases with maximal
improvement, these cases showed an overall clinical reduction in lameness and
inflammation.  None of the cases in this group were considered treatment
failures.  In all cases Equron treatment resulted in substantial clinical
improvement and the injections were well tolerated with no post-injection
reactions observed.<P>
The changes observed in synovial fluid relative viscosity and protein
reflected the general clinical efficacy of Equron. Eighteen of the 20 cases
showed an increases in relative viscosity at the end of treatment.  In one case
the pretreament relative viscosity was very high and at the end of treatment it
had decreased but was still well above normal.  The post treatment changes in
protein value were somewhat more varable since some of the cases were normal in
this respect prior to treatment.  Of ten cases with elevated protein
(&gt;10mg/ml) prior to Equon injection seven showed a decrease in this
parameter at the end of treatment.<P>
Comparison of the effect of the control injection in the second group of 20
clinical cases showed a marked similarity in clinical efficacy to that achieved
with Equron.  Seventeen cases received one injection, 2 received 2 injections
and one reveived 4 injections.  At the end of the treatment eleven of the cases
were judged maximally improved (76-100%) and eight  were judged 50-75%
improved.  Only one case was considered a poor response and that was due to a
slab fracture which occurred during but unrelated to control treatment.
Similar to the Equron group, reductions in lameness, swelling, heat and pain,
paralleled the overall clinical improvement.<P>
Analysis of the synovial fluid of this group revealed a general increase in
relative viscosity throughout and a variable decrease in protein concentration.
Post treatment relative viscosity increased in seventeen of the 20 cases.  In
three cases it decreased.  Of the ten cases with elevated synovial protein
(&gt;10mg/ml) prior to treatment, five showed a decrease after
treatment.<P>
Comparison of the relative efficacy of Equron and control in the
tibiotarsal joint was conducted identically to the carpal evaluations but with
10 cases per group.  Because of the anatomical differences between the tarsus
and carpus, the principal clinical sign of inflammation was swelling with
little lameness, heat or pain.  These are typical of tibiotarsal problems in
racing horses.<P>
Comparing the clinical data for the Equron and control tibiotarsal groups
shows a striking similarity in resolution of swelling and lameness when
present.  In the Equron group eight of the 10 cases were judged 76-100%
improved after a single injection, and all 10 of the control treated cases were
maximally improved at the same period.<P>
The synovial fluid data for the Equron group revealed that relative
viscosity in seven of the 10 cases was increased after one injection.  Only two
of the cases had elevated protein (&gt;10mg/ml) prior to treatment and both had
decreased.  In the conrol group nine of the ten cases showed increases in
relative viscosity and all of the ten cases showed increases in relative
viscosity and all of the five cases with elevated protein showed a decrease at
one week post-treatment.<P>
Similar to the results fo the carpal data, there is no apparent difference
between the two products in resolving the typical tibiotarsal problems in these
animals.  All injections were well tolerated with no adverse reactions.<P>
A summary of the clinical and synovial fluid changes observed in this study
is given in Tables 7A and 7B.  These tables give the means and one standard
deviation for the summary clinical score, synovial fluid relative viscosity,and
protein content before and at the end of the treatment for the carpal and
tibiotarsal joints. As is evident form the data there is little difference
between products in the changes observed in any of the parameters.  For the
carpal joints (Table 7A), the summary clinical score for both groups (Equron
and control) were essentially equivalent at the end of the treatment.
Similarly the increase in synovial fluid viscosity achieved by either product
were the same.  The large standard deviation seen in this parameter reflect a
few cases in both groups which achieved extremely high post treatment values.
In both the Equron and control group little change in synovial protein
concentration was observed since the clinical cases were largely normal in this
respect prior to treatment.<P>
Changes in the summary clincal score and synovial fluid relative viscosity
and protein concentration over the treatment regimen for tibiotarsal joints
(Table 7B) are similar to that observed with the carpal joints.  In both groups
the clinical scores decreases markedly by the end of treatment.  Relative
viscosity increases in both groups were equivalent with considerable overlap
between the two.  Synovial fluid protein remained essentially
unchanged.<P>
From a qualitative standpoint, there appears to be no marked difference in
the clinical efficacy of the two products in resolving inflammation of the
carpal or tibiotarsal joints. Because to the relatively small numbers in both
groups, a difference of one or two cases achieving maximum improvement, no
lameness, etc. is probably not significant.<P>
The difference in the number of repeated treatments given (Equron 6 and
control 3) most likely reflects differences in the extent of chronic
involvement in some of the clinical cases.  This consideration however cannot
be quantitated adequately in this study to justify detailed comparison of the
frequency of repeat injections.<P>

<B>c.  Statistical Analysis</B><P>
The data from this study was statistically analyzed by Dr. Terri Beaty,
The Johns Hopkins University, by a two tailed T test at the .05 level.<P>
The hypothesis tested is the null hypothesis:  the control product is
different from Equron in its efficacy.  The two tailed T test employed would
detect a significant difference of measured efficacy between the two products
if the control is more or less effective than Equron.<P>
At pre- and post-treatment, swelling, heat, pain or pressure and lameness
were graded on an ordinal scale of 0 to 3.  Synovial fluid relative viscosity
and protein concentration were determined in centistokes and mg/ml
respectively.<P>
For the purpose of comparing the efficacy of the contol product relative to
Equron the four clinical measures (swelling, heat, pain and lameness) were
summed to give a single summary clinical score.  The outcome variables for
statistical analysis were the difference in 1 week post and pre-treatment for
summary clinical score and the log (ratio) of 1 week and pre-treatment for
relative viscostity and protein concentration.<P>
Since only a few clinical cases in each group (control and Equron) received
more than one injection; statistical  ananlysis taking into account the
frequency of repeated injections was not justified.  For this reason
statistical comparison of the two products was limited to the outcome variables
determined before and after 1  week of treatment.<P>
The results of the statistical analysis are shown in Table 8A for the 40
animals with tested carpal joints and in Table 8B for the 20 animals with
tested tibiotarsal joints.  There was no signififcant difference between the
two treatment groups (the Equron and the control groups) using the response to
treatment for these three measured in  either joint.<P>

<B>B.  Corroborative Studies</B><P>
Three uncontrolled field trials of Equron were conducted in support of the
pivotal studies:  two in the US and one in England and Ireland.  The names and
addresses of the participating investigators in these trials are given in the
appendix.<P>
<B>i. Preliminary Uncontrolled Field Trial</B><P>
A preliminary clinical evaluation of Equron was conducted between August 15
and October 30, 1982 to evaluate various methods of data collection and an
assessment of investigators who could participate in the large scale clinical
study.  The study was conducted with material produced in the laboratory for
testing purposes.  The clinical cases were chosen from horses having
degenerative or traumatic inflammation joint problems at the time of entry into
the study and were restricted to carpal, fetlock and tibiotarsal.  Only one
joint per case was treated.  Horses with known or suspected infections, known
or suspected acute fractures or chips, or any steriod injections in the joint
to be treated     within four weeks of entry into the study were not
included.<P>
Efficacy of the drug was evaluated throughtout the clinical evaluations by
the attending practitioner.  No synovial fluid analysis was performed.  The
product was administered intra-articularly as a single 10 mg injection.  The
clinical condition of the joint was evaluated at the time of Equron injection,
24 hours post-injection and subsequently at 7-10 days and 14-17 days post
injection.  In addition to evaluations of any decrease in lameness after
treatment, the practitioners were requested to report any side effects (post
injection reactions).<P>
Of approximately 200 cases selected, 135 completed the evaluation program.
Of the conditions treated the majority were 
chronic with an average pre-treatment lameness score of
 2 out of a possible 4 degrees.  The overall
response to treatemnt was judged as excellent in 77 of the 135 clinical cases.
Another 33 were graded as good and 12 as fair.  Poor response was indicated in
only 2 cases.  Six reported no change in pre-treatment condition.<P>
No significant adverse reactions were reproted.  In 16 cases slight 
post-injection swelling was recorded by the attending veterinarian.  
Ten of these
were from the same practitioner who reported some slight edema and pain after
injection yet considered the overall response to the drug in these cases as
excellent. None of the reported side effects were considered serious and all
resolved within 24 to 48 hrs.<P>
<B>ii.  Uncontrolled Field Trial</B> <P>
A large scale uncontrolled field trial was conducted in the summer and fall
of 1984 in the US involving 18 equine practices and 159 clinical cases.  The
results of this study have the most relevance to the clinical application of
Equron in that the investigators were required to evaluate, in extensive
detail, each case that was treated.  Names and addresses of the participating
veterinarians are listed in the appendix.  Equron was adminsitered  
intra-articularly into the affected joint in a treatment regimen of single
injections at two week intervals.  Up to four injections (10 mg/2 ml - carpus
and fetlock and 20 mg/4ml - tibiotarsus) were given at the discretion of the
attending veterinarian.  Clinical improvement was assessed by clincal
evaluations made at weekly intervals and changes in synovial fluid relative
viscosity and protein concentration were determined by a bi-weekly laboratory
analyses of synovial fluid samples.  Synovial fluid testing was performed by
Chesapeake Biological Laboratories, Hunt Valley, MD.<P>
The results of this study are summarized in the following tables. The
percent improvement achieved at the end of treatment for unilateral and
multilateral treated cases is given in Table 9. For unilaterally treated cases
63% displayed improvement of 76-100% while 79% fo the multilaterally treated
cases showed a similar improvement.  Table 10 shows the same data arranged by
joint type treated.  By the end of the study 83% and 84% respectively for
carpal and tibiotarsal joints had achieved 76-100% improvement.  Less
impressive but still highly positive results were observed with fetlock joints
of which 51% showed similar improvement.<P>

Similar to the percent improvements observed , there was a marked reduction
in lameness as a result of Equron treatment.  Table 11 shows the distribution
of lameness grading for unilaterally and multilaterally treated joints before
the start and at the end of the study.  As illustrated there were substantial
reductions in lameness over the course of the study with 71% of the combined
cases exhibiting no lameness at the end of the study.  Table 12 shows the same
results according to joint type.  The data suggest there is no relevant
difference in efficacy for the 3 joints.<P>

Measurements of changes in synovial fluid protein concentration and
relative viscosity substantiate the observed clinical efficacy.  Nineteen of
the treated joints (10 carpals, 5 fetlock, and 4 tibiotarsal) exibited elevated
synovial protein indicative of acute inflammation prior to treatment.  For
these cases the differences in synovial protein concentration at the start and
at the end of the study were determined and analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank test.
A statistically significant decrease in protein concentration (p&lt;0.005) was
associated with Equron treatment. Reduced relative viscosities of the synovial
fluid was observed in 51 cases at the beginning of the study (18 carpal and 33
fetlock). By the end of the study a Wilcoxon rank test revealed a significant
increase (p&lt;0.025) in relative viscosity for these cases.<P>
At the completion of the study the participating veterinarians graded the
overall clinical response of Equron treatment as excellent, good, fair, poor,
or none for each clinical case. Tables 13 and 14 give the percentage for each
grade for unilaterally and multilaterally treated cases and for joint types.
Table 15 gives the overall results of Equron treatment with regard to the
number of treatments per joint.  Of the 55 joints treated only once with Equron
52 joints (95%) received a final evaluation of an excellent or good response.
For those 51 joints receiving two injections of Equron a total of 43 (84%) were
given an excellent or good evaluation.  The corresponding numbers for joints
treated 3 and 4 times with Equron were 21 of 22 (95%) and 28 of 31 (90%),
respectively, which were rated excellent or good responses.  Overall 144 cases
out of 159 were judged as excellent to good response giving a total improvement
of 91%.<P>
These findings indicate that, when the number of Equron treatments is at
the discretion of the veterinarian, a high degree of clinical efficacy for the
drug pertains, irrespective of the final number of injections.<P>

 Overall the response to Equron treatment was considered excellent. Mild
post-injection swelling was noted in 7 (4%) of the 159 total joints treated.
In all cases these reactions were transient and resolved within 48
hours.<P>
<B>iii.  United Kingdom and Ireland Trials</B><P>
A study was conducted by the International Animal Health Division of E.R.
Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc. to confirm clinical efficacy for registration of Equron
in the U.K. and Ireland, during the spring of 1984.  Equron was administered to
24 clinical cases diagnosed as having equine joint disease by veterinarians in
six practices in the U.K. and Ireland during spring 1984.  The product was
administered as a single, 10 mg (2ml) dose injected into the stifle, carpal,
fetlock, or tibiotarsal joint.<P>
Each horse was assessed before treatment and twice after treatment using
the lameness score system from the U.S. trial.<P>

Final assessments of therapeutic response were given in 23 of 24 clinical
cases treated.  Of these 8 (35%) were judged as excellent; 6 (26%) as good; 5
(22%) as fair; 2 (9%) as poor; and 2 (9%) as no response.  Overall 19 cases
(83%) demonstrated positive clinical response to Equron treatment.  Based on
these and other relevant studies conducted in the U.S., Equron was granted
approval in both the U.K. and Ireland on October 10, 1984. (Registration

<B>5.  Animal Safety:</B><P>
<B>A.  Pivotal Studies</B><P>
<B>i.  Acute Toxicity Study</B><P>
An acute toxicity study was conducted between September 1 and November 14,
1983 at the Rochester Equine Clinic, Rochester, NH under the direction of Dr.
Grant Myhre, clinic director. Hematologies, blood and serum chemistries, and
urinalysis were done in duplicate by the Rochester Equine Clinic and Metpath
Laboratories, Teterboro, NJ.  Synovial fluid analyses were done by Chesapeake
Biological Laboratories, Inc., Hunt Valley, MD.<P>
<B>a.  Study Design</B><P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of acute
administration of Equron injected  
intra-articularly into the equine joint.  Six
mixed bred horses (5 geldings and 1 mare) between 5 and 11 years of age
received intra-articular injections of 4 sequential 100 mg/doses per animal.
Equron injections were given at 2 week intervals for 8 weeks.  Each animal
received 20 mg and 30 mg in both carpal and tibiotarsal joints respectively at
each injection period.  Each animal was acclimated for 14 days during which
physical examinations and blood urine and synovial samples wer collected to
establish base line values.  Upon commencing the Equron injections, physical
examinations, hematology, serum chemistries and urinalysis were performed on
days 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56.  Synovial fluid samples were obtained
prior to each injection at days 0, 14, 28, 42 and 2 weeks after the last
injection on day 56.<P>
The physical examinations consisted of clinical observations to detect
adverse reactions affecting the ocular, equilibrium, musculature, appetite,
integument, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiration and general behavior.
The injection site was monitored for 24 hours after each injection for signs of
local inflammation.  Clinical chemistries encompassed hematology - WBC, RBC,
differential WBC, PCV, MCV, MCHC, hemaglobin, prothrombin time, activated
clotting time, sedimentation rate, and platelet count; blood and serum
chemistries - CO2, SDH, BSP, creatinine, glucose, Ca, P, LDH, SGOT, total
protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilibrubin; urinalysis - color,
consistency, quantity, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, bilibrubin,
urobilinogen, WBC, RBC, epithelial cells and formed elements. Synovial fluid
analysis consisted of measurements of relative viscosity, protein and
hyaluronate concentration, "mucin clot" quality and WBC content.<P>
<B>b.  Results</B><P>
Over the course of the 8 week acute toxicity study no general adverse
effects of Equron administration were observed. Examination of the data from
this study gave no indication of adverse effects either systemically or locally
arising from repeated intra-articular injections of Equron.  The physical
examinations throughout the testing periods were unremarkable.  No significant
physical changes were observed in any of the animals which would indicate
systemic toxicity.  All animals remained in good health throughout the
study.<P>
The findings of the physical examinations were in agreement with the
results of hematology, blood and serum chemistry, and urinalysis testing.  No
significant changes were observed in any of the measured parameters which would
indicate systemic toxicity. Evaluations made during the pretreatment
acclimation period exhibited random variations which were present throughout
the study.   In general the variations between animals were consisently greater
than  that observed for any animal throughout the study.  When an animal was
outside the normal range in a specific test at one testing period it would
generally be within the normal range at the next testing interval.  No trends
in any of these laboratory analyses were observed which would indicate systemic
disorders.  At the completion of the study all animals were judged normal.
Post-injection joint effusions were noted in several cases but appeared random
and not consistent within either a particular animal or series of injections.
Considering the large number of intra-articular samplins and/or injections
these incidences of post-injectionost-injection effusions were not considered significant.
Of a total of 168 arthrocenteses and 256 post-injection examinations, 32 
post-injection swellings were observed. In all cases they were quite transient and
resolved within 24 to 48 hours.  There was no evidence of lameness and the
range of motion remained normal.  Due to the random occurrence of these post
injection effusion, they were considered to result form the arthrocentesis and
not directly related to the injection of sodium hyaluronate.<P>
The results of the repeated synovial fluid analyses were consistent with
those from the physical examination and clinical chemistries in that there was
no evidence for intra-articular inflammation arising from the repeated Equron
injections.  Some minor changes in synovial fluid properties relative to
pretreatment values were observed but these were not consistent with synovial
inflammation.  Figures 3 and 4 show the results of analysis of synovial fluid
protein and 1n relative viscosity form the tibiotarsus of the experimental
animals.  For both parameters the sequential evaluations reveal a minor change
relative to pretreatment values.  Synovial protein concentration showed a
slight rise following the first Equron injection and remained slightly elevated
throughout the study period.  Relative viscosity showed a minor decrease after
the first injection and thereafter remained essentially unchanged for the
remainder of the study. These small changes were not indicative of significant
synovial inflammation and probaby arose from the trauma of repeated
arthrocentesis.  Similar small changes were observed in the synovial fluid from
the carpal joint.<P>

immediately following synovial fluid sampling on days 0, 14, 28 and 42.  The
means are comprised of 12 values (right and left tibiotarsus of 6
horses).<P>

tibiotarsus of each of six animals was measured in centistokes and converted to
natural log for plotting.  The data is presented as described for protein

<B>c.  Statistical Analysis</B><P>
Statistical evaluation of the data was performed by Dr. Terri H. Beaty of
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.  Seven clinical
parametersss, WBC, MCV, sedimentation rate, SDH, glucose, total protein, and
globulin were analyzed for possible trends either over time or among individual
animals by examining box plots of the variables and using a robust two way
analysis of variance.  In general the variables among animals were greater than
any variation over time for each parameter.  No significant trends were
observed which would suggest any toxic effets of acute Equron
administration.<P>
Although the synovial fluid values did show some minor changes over the
couse of the study, they were not considered clinically relevant and thus no
statistical evaluation was warranted.<P>
<B>d.  Conclusions</B><P>
The data from this study demonstrate that repeated intra-articularly
administrered Equron is free from systemic toxicity.<P>
<B>e.  Adverse Reactions</B><P>
No adverse reactions were observed in any of the experimental animals
thoughout the study .<P>
<B>ii.  Chronic Toxicity Study </B><P>
A chronic toxicity study was conducted at the Rochester Equine Clinic,
Rochester, NH under the direction of Dr. Grant Myhre, clinic director between
November 28, 1983 and June 4, 1984. Hematologies, blood and serum chemistries,
and urinalyses were done in duplicate by the Rochester Equine Clinic and
Metpath Laboratories, Teterboro, NH.  Synovial fluid analysis was performed by
Chesapeake Biological Laboratories, Hunt Valley , MD. Histopathology was done
by Dr. Roger Wells,  board certified pathologist, Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH.<P>
<B>a.  Study design</B><P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of chronic
administration of Equron injected  
intra-articularly into the equine joint.  Six
mixed bred horses (3 geldings and 3 mares) between 6 and 10 years of age
received 12 sequential intra-articular injections at 2 week interval for 24
weeks.  Each experimental animal received 40 mg/4 ml Equron in the right
radiocarpus and 80 mg/10 ml Equron in the right tibiotarsus.  The left
radiocarpus and tibiotarsus received equivalent volumes of sterile, pyrogen
free saline as controls.  Physical examinations were conducted at days 0, 1, 2,
4, 7 and 14 and thereafter at 14 day intervals throughout the 168 day study.
Blood and urine samples were obtained for analysis at the same intervals.
Synovial fluid samples were obtained at days 0, 7 and 14 and thereafter at 14
day intervals throughout the study.<P>
At termination of the study, three of the six horses were euthanized for
gross and histopathological examination.  The entire animal was examined
grossly and specific tissues collected and examined microscopically.  The
injected joints, both Equron and control, were examined grossly and
representative tissue samples obtained for microscopic evaluation.  This latter
histopathology was conducted blind.<P>
Physical examinations, (hematology, blood and serum chemistries, urinalysis
and synovial fluid analyses) were identical to those performed in the acute
toxicity study.  Serum alkaline posphatase was included in the serum
chemistries as a measure of liver function.<P>
<B>b.  Results</B><P>
The results of the chronic toxicity evaluation are consistent with those of
the acute toxicity study.  The results fo hematology, blood and serum
chemistries and urinalyses gave no evidence of any toxic effect arising from
the chronic  administration of Equron. Some random variations in specific
parameters in each of these three test areas were present during the 
pre-treatment acclimation period, but in general all experimental animals were
considered normal prior to beginning the study.  Random variations persisted
throughout the study, but these variations were consistently greater between
animals than those observed for any individual animal.  Values outside the
normal range during a specific testing period for one laboratory were usually
within the normal range for the other laboratory or  within range of those
published by Veterinary Values.  If this was not the case, the animal usually
returned to normal by the next testing period.  No trends in any of the
laboratory analyses were observed which would inidcate systemic toxicity.  At
the completion of the study all animals were judged normal in this
respect.<P>

The results of the physical examinations conducted throughout the study
were consistent with the results of the hematology, blood and serum chemistries
and urinalyses.  No changes in overall physical condition were observed which
would suggest systemic toxicity arising from the chronic sodium hyaluronate
administration.<P>
Post-injection effusions were observed in the tibiotarsal joints soon after
the study began.  These were characterized as a diffuse enlargement of the
joint capsule noticeable within 24 hours after injection.  The degree of
enlargement was consistently greater in the hyaluronate treated side.  Any
swelling observed in the saline control joints subsided rapidly within 24 hours
after development. Resolution of the swelling in the treated side took somewhat
longer, requiring approximately 48 hours to return to normal. These swellings
were not accompanied generally by any heat or lameness.  In a few random cases,
any lameness present was quickly resolved within 48 hours of injection.  The
radiocarpal joints remained unremarkable.  These tarsal effusions were most
likely caused by the large volume of Equron injected and were not considered
evidence for inflammatory response.  At the end of the study, all joint
capsules exhibited some degree of thickening as a result of the repeated
arthrocentesis.<P>
Similar to the clinical examinations, the sequential synovial fluid
analyses gave no evidence of intra-articular inflammation over the treatment
period.  Minor changes in synovial fluid properties were observed as in the
acute toxicology study.  As illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 below for the
tibiotarsal joints, the protein concentration and relative viscosity of the
Equron and control joints varied randomly over the course of the study.  Mean
ln relative viscosities of the control joints were slightly higher than the
Equron treated joints although there was considerable overlap between the two
groups.  Mean protein concentration was slightly elevated in the treated group
relative to the controls throughout the study.  These differences were not
considered indicative of significant intra-articular inflammation.  Similar
results were observed in the carpal joints.  The remaining synovial fluid
parameters, hyaluronate concentration, mucin clot quality, and WBC content
showed some random variations but remained essentially within normal limits
throughout the study.<P>

The data shown for days -14, and 0 represent pretreatment values.  Twelve
Equron injections (80 mg/tibiotarsus) were given at 14 day intervals
immediately following synovial fluid sampling beginning on day 0.  The control
joint received equivalent volumes of sterile, pyrogen-free saline. The means in
each group are comprised of 6 values from six horses. Standard deviation error
bars were omitted for clarity.  There was, however, considerable overlap
between the two groups.<BR>

The relative viscosity of the synovial fluid from the treated and control
tibiotarsal joints of the six horses was measured in centistokes and converted
to the natural log for mean calculation and plotting.  The data is presented as
described in Figure 6.<P>

Gross and histopathological examination of three of the six horses showed
no drug related gross or microscopic lesions in any of the organs examined.
The radiocarpal and tibiotarsal joints were examined thoroughly both grossly
and microscopically.  None of the joints showed evidence of inflammation in the
internal structures and substances.  Synovial fluid was normal  in quantity and
quality the articular cartilage and subchondral bone were normal as were the
ligamentous structures.<P>

The peri-articular tissues and synovial membranes of the tibiotarsal joints
exibited some changes suggestive of reactive fibroplasia.  These changes were
evident in the saline treated joints but were more pronounced in the HA treated
joints.  From the description and comments of the pathologist, it is evident
that some of this reaction was associated with the chronic distention observed
largely in the study by the clinical veterinarians, as well as to the repeated
trauma of needle penetration for multiple injections and arthrocenteses which
contributed to inflammatory edema and healing fibrosis. <P>
The three ramaining animals were held for further evaluation to determine
if the fibroplasia of the peri-articular tissues of the tibiotarsal joint would
resolve once arthrocentesis was ceased. Arthroscopic examination and tissue
biopsy of the Equron treated joints showed a marked resolution of the
fibroplasia over a three month period.  By the end of this period the joints
were essentially normal.<P>
<B>c.  Statistical analysis</B><P>
Since the observations were similar to those in the acute toxicity study
and overall unremarkable, statistical analysis was not considered
appropriate.<P>
<B>d.  Adverse reactions</B><P>
No evidence of any systemic adverse reaction was observed in any of the
experimental animals.  The localized diffused swelling noted in the tibiotarsus
appeared to be related to repeated arthrocentesis and the osmotic effects of
large volumes of Equron rather than any adverse reaction to the product
itself.<P>
<B>e.  Conclusion</B><P>
The results of this study indicated that Equron does not produce systemic
adverse effects over long term chronic administration. Repeated injections of
the tibiotarsus with large volumes (10 ml) and the resulting chronic distention
of the joint may contribute to fibroplasia of the joint capsule. This condition
is reversible once arthrocentesis is ceased.<P>
<B>6.  Human Safety:</B><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA.  This drug is approved for use only
in horses that are not to be used for food and is to be labeled:<P>
Warning:  Not for use in horses intended for food.<P>
<B>Human safety relative to possession, handling and administration:</B><P>
Hyaluronate sodium is a naturally occurring substance in the connective
tissue and synovial fluid of both man and animals.  As such, there are no
special handling requirements for this drug.  As a prescription drug, there are
adequate directions in the labeling for the proper use of Equron Injection by
the veterinarian.<P>
<B>7.  Agency Conclusions:</B><P>
The data submitted in support of this New Animal Drug Application comply
with the requirements of Section 512 of the Act 514.11 of the implementing
regulations.  It demonstrates that Equron (hyaluronate sodium), when used under
its labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective.<P>
The safe and effective use of Equron (hyaluronate sodium) injected 
intra-articularly in horses requires a surgical technique and knowledge of the
anatomy of the specific joint.  Thus, the expertise of a veterinarian is
necessary for safe and effective administration.  Accordingly, labeling for
Equron must bear veterinary prescription legend.<P>

<i>Effect of Supplement</i>:<p>

Approval of this supplemental NADA expands the indications to include the
removal and control of adult roundworms <i>Toxascaris leonina</i>.  Laboratory
data support the efficacy of the drug against this species.  Additionally,
initial results of a national prevalence study showing the prevalence of this
parasite to be 0.74% of 6,458 specimens examined (specimens could have multiple
parasites), are contained in this submission.  Reference is also made to the
clinical field trials originally submitted in support of the <i>Toxocara
canis</i> indications (approved December, 1992). This supplemental application
does not propose any changes in the formulation, dosage forms, manufacturing
procedures, recommended dosages or monthly treatment regimen for Interceptor
(milbemycin oxime). <p>


<B>2.Indications for Use</B><p>

INTERCEPTOR FLAVOR TABS are indicated for use in the prevention of heartworm
disease caused by <i>Dirofilaria immitis</i>, the control of adult
<i>Ancylostoma caninum</i> (hookworm), and the removal and control of adult
<i>Toxocara canis and</i> <i>Toxascaris leonina</i> (roundworms), and
<i>Trichuris vulpis</i> (whipworm) infections in dogs and in puppies four weeks
of age or greater and two pounds of body weight or greater.<p>

<B>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</B><p>

The ingredients of INTERCEPTOR FLAVOR TABS are formulated into various sized
tablets to be administered orally (swallow or chew), as appropriate for the
weight of the dog (see below), at monthly dosing intervals.  The tablets supply
the recommended minimum dose level of 0.5 mg milbemycin oxime per kilogram
(0.23 mg/lb.) of body weight.<p>

<B>4. Effectiveness</B><p>

A. <i>Dose Establishment</i><p>
No additional dose establishment work was required.  The minimum target dose of
milbemycin oxime 0.5 mg/kg body weight was established in the original NADA
140-915 for the currently approved label indications.<p>

B.<i>Dose Confirmation</i><p>

One dose confirmation study (Trial AH-93-0045) was conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of milbemycin oxime in the removal and control of the adult
roundworm, <i>Toxascaris leonina</i>.  Twenty-four dogs were infected with eggs
of <i>Toxascaris leonina</i> by oral inoculation 75-77 days pre-treatment.
Twelve dogs were given a treatment of 0.5 mg/kg minimum dose of milbemycin
oxime one time and 12 were untreated.  All dogs were necropsied 7 days
post-treatment, and all intestinal parasites were recovered, identified and
counted.  <p>

<I>Results</I>:<p>

One adult worm was recovered from the 12 treated dogs compared to
159 worms from the 12 untreated control dogs.  The milbemycin oxime treatment
was calculated to be 99.4% efficacious.<p>

<I>Conclusion</I>:<p>

 This study demonstrated the efficacy of Interceptor Flavor Tabs
against <i>T</i>. <i>leonina</i>.<p>

C. <i>1989 Clinical Field Trial</i><p>

A clinical field trial (MT-147-00-89) was conducted during 1989-90 to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of monthly administration of milbemycin oxime for the
additional indications of removal and control of roundworms and whipworms when
used under typical veterinary conditions.  Safety and efficacy data from
animals infected with roundworms was extracted to support the label change for
this supplement to the NADA.  In this study, 100% (62 of 62) of the roundworm
cases were successfully treated by study completion (See Table 1).<p>

Meeting of the American Association of Veterinary Parasitologists/American
Society of Parasitologists, Pittsburg, PA.<p>

Fecal specimens (6,458 in total) were collected from dogs housed in animal
shelters and analyzed by Dr. Byron L. Blagburn, Auburn University.  The animal
shelters were selected from the largest cities in each state.  Fresh fecal
specimens, collected individually into 120 ml plastic specimen cups were
examined using the centrifugal sucrose flotation procedure.  Specimen cups were
placed in styrofoam shipping boxes containing "cold pack" inserts, and shipped
to Dr. Blagburn's laboratory at Auburn University via overnight courier.
Specimens could contain more than one type of parasite.  Thus, the percentages
presented below indicate the percent of specimens that contained the particular
parasite and do not add to 100 percent.<p>

Conclusion:  Based upon the 99.4% efficacy demonstrated in the dose
confirmation study, the 100% efficacy in the MT-147-00-89 Clinical Field Trial
(including the probability albeit low that some of the roundworms may have been
<i>Toxascaris leonina</i> cases), this data is adequate to support the
expansion of the roundworm claim.<p>

<B>5. Animal Safety</B><p>

This supplemental NADA does not require re-evaluation of target animal safety
data submitted in support of the initial NADA No. 140-915.  Please refer to the
original Freedom of Information Summary (NADA 140-915) for additional
information on target animal safety studies.<p>

<B>6. Human Safety</B><p>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this supplemental NADA.  The drug is to be labeled
for use in dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>

<B>7. Agency Conclusions</B><p>

The data in support of this supplemental NADA application complies with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing
regulations.  It demonstrates that Interceptor&#174; Flavor Tabs, when
used under the labeled conditions of use, are safe and effective.<p>

According to the Center's supplemental approval policy (21 CFR 514.106), this
is a category II change.  This supplement provides for an additional claim for
the removal and control of the adult roundworm, <i>Toxascaris leonina</i>.
This approval relied upon the safety and effectiveness data in the parent
application and evaluation of new efficacy data submitted in the supplemental
application.<p>

	Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FFDCA), this approval qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity
beginning on the date of approval because the supplemental application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence
studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or
sponsored by the applicant.  The three years of marketing exclusivity applies
only to the additional roundworm claim (<i>Toxascaris leonina</i>) for which
the supplemental application was approved.  This exclusivity period will expire
three years from the date of the approval letter.<p>

	The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because professional expertise is required to determine the existence of
hookworm roundworm and/or whipworm infection.  In addition, professional
expertise is required to determine the existence of heartworm infection, and
then properly treat existing heartworm infection prior to starting treatment
with Interceptor &#174; (milbemycin oxime) Flavor Tabs in a prevention
program.<p>

<b>Pioneer Product:</b><p> 
Rompun&#174; (xylazine) 100 mg/mL Injectable<br>
NADA 47-956 by Bayer Corporation<br> Agriculture
Division, Animal Health.<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>May 16, 1995<p>
<b>2.  Target Animal Safety and Drug Effectiveness:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new animal
drug (pioneer product). New target animal safety data and drug effectiveness
data, were not required for approval of this generic application as a
supplement to existing NADA 139-236. This application relies on the target
animal safety and drug effectiveness data in the pioneer's new animal drug
application as regards to deer and elk. Ordinarily, the sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer. Bioequivalence is usually
demonstrated through a blood level study.<p>
For certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA
Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990). Based upon the
formulation characteristics of  the  generic product, Vet-A-Mix, Inc. (now
known as Lloyd, Inc.) was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo
</i>&#160;bioequivalence study for xylazine hydrochloride solution. The generic and
pioneer products are solutions with the same active and inactive ingredients.
The generic and pioneer products also contain the same concentration of active
ingredient. The waiver was granted on December 11, 1991 (photocopy
attached).<p>
<b>3.  Human Food Safety:</b><p>
Data on human food safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this supplement. This drug is labeled for use
in horses, deer and elk and should not be administered to food-producing
animals.<p>
<b>4.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
This is a supplement to a New Animal Drug Application filed under Section
512(b)(2) of  the   Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act.<p>
Safety and effectiveness for this supplemental claim for the new animal drug,
AnaSed&#174; Injectable (xylazine hydrochloride, 100 mg/mL), were established by
demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer product, Rompun&#174;
(xylazine hydrochloride, 100 mg/mL, NADA 47-956).<p>
The supplement provides for identical labeling for both products. The route and
method of administration of the two drugs are identical. Both drugs are
administered intramuscularly. Although the formulation of the AnaSed&#174;
differs from that of Rompun&#174; in that the buffering system used in the
AnaSed&#174; employs slightly different ingredients at slightly different
concentrations, both products are buffered to approximately the same final pH.
The formulation differences are not anticipated to affect the bioavailability
of the active ingredient, xylazine. Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy
promulgated to implement Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional
safety, efficacy, or <i>in vivo </i>bioequivalency studies were necessary or
required.<p>
This supplement to an NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act
and demonstrates that AnaSed&#174; is safe and effective for its labeled indications
when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

CVM UPDATE
<P> Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
Issued by: Office of Management, Communications and Education Branch, HFV-12 Food
and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855<br>

<b>UPDATE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>BST</b><P>
FDA approved  Monsanto Company's recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST)
product, Posilac&#174;, in November 1993 after a comprehensive
review of the product's safety and efficacy, including human food safety.
Posilac&#174; is the only rbST product approved for increasing milk
production in dairy cattle.  The product has been commercially available since
February 4, 1994.  <P>
In a March 14, 1995 FDA TALK PAPER, the Agency stated that during the first
year of commercial use of  Posilac&#174;,  a total of 806 reports of
adverse effects were reported to Monsanto and submitted to FDA.  A CVM UPDATE
issued on October 12, 1995, included information on 509 reports of adverse
effects reported from February 1 to August 25, 1995.<P>
The following is an update on the adverse experiences to
Posilac&#174; reported to FDA from August 26, 1995 through February
3, 1996.  During this period, FDA received 144 adverse experience reports (See
table below.)  It is important to note that a report of an adverse effect in
relation to a drug does not itself establish that the effect was caused by the
drug.  FDA believes that 83 of the 144 reports were <b>possibly</b> associated
with the use of Posilac&#174;, and that the other 61 reports were
not  related to treatment with Posilac&#174;.  Also, <b>all</b>
<b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>manifestations</b>
<b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>dairy</b>
<b>cattle</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplemented</b> <b>with</b>
<b>Posilac</b>&#174;.<P>
Of the 83 reports possibly related to the use of Posilac&#174;, 18
included reproductive disorders, 10 involved digestive disorders, 23 included
mastitis, 19 included injection site reactions, 12 included swelling of the
udder or abnormal milk, 9 included foot or leg problems, and 17 involved
increased somatic cell counts.  In some cases, a single report contained
multiple conditions.<P>
The number and severity of the reported conditions raise no new animal health
concerns about the safety of Posilac&#174;.  There is no indication
that the drug is any less effective than labeled.  In addition, FDA and State
regulatory officials have found no indication of a change in the incidence of
violative drug residues in milk associated with the commercial use of
Posilac&#174;.<P>
Based on the these reports of adverse reactions to Posilac&#174;,
FDA finds no cause for concern.  However, it is important for dairy farmers to
continue to report all adverse reactions associated with the use of rbST.  They
may report such reactions to Monsanto, to FDA through their veterinarian, or
directly to FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.  CVM accepts collect calls
during working hours, and an answering machine is available to record
after-hours calls.  The telephone numbers are (301) 594-1751 for collect calls
during working hours, and (301) 594-0797 to leave a message on evenings and
weekends.<p>
<b>SUMMARY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ADVERSE</b> <b>REACTION</b> <b>REPORTS</b>
<b>ON</b> <b>POSILAC</b>&#174;<p>
August 26, 1995 through February 3, 1996<P>
The following table summarizes the important clinical manifestations (CM) from
the 83 adverse experience reports <b>possibly</b> related to the use of
Posilac&#174; from August 26, 1995 through February 3, 1996.  <P>
This summary is intended only as a general reference to the type of reactions
that veterinarians and dairy farmers have voluntarily reported to the
manufacturer or FDA.  Therefore, the summary is not by itself a basis for
determining drug association for a particular sign, safety or efficacy of the
drug, or determining the frequency or incidence rate of a clinical
manifestation.  Each of the reports may contain one or more CMs, and as a
result the number of CMs exceeds the number of reports.  All of the reported
clinical manifestations are known to occur in dairy cattle not supplemented
with Posilac&#174;.  <br>

   <b> Pioneer Product: </b><p>           Rompun&#174; (xylazine) 20 mg/mL Injectable, 
NADA 47-955 by Bayer Corporation, Agriculture Division, Animal Health.<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b> May 16, 1995<p>
 
 
<b>2.   Target Animal Safety and Drug Effectiveness:</b>  <p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New Animal Drug
Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the Agency grants a
waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i> &#160;  bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645,
June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of bioequivalence
testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are based on the
demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.<p>
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Vet-A-Mix
Animal Health was granted a waiver December 17, 1991, (photocopy attached) from
conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;  bioequivalence study with AnaSed&#174; 20 mg/mL for
the additional indication for use in cats.  The generic and pioneer products
are solutions with the same inactive ingredients and the same concentrations of
the active ingredient.<p>
<b>3.   Human Food Safety:</b>  <p>
Data on human food safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this supplement.  This drug is labeled for
use in dogs and cats and should not be administered to food-producing
animals.<p>
<b>4.   Agency Conclusions:</b>  <p>
This is a supplement to a New Animal Drug Application filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <p>
Safety and effectiveness for this supplemental claim for the new animal drug,
AnaSed&#174; Injectable (xylazine hydrochloride, 20 mg/mL), were established by
demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer product, Rompun&#174;
(xylazine hydrochloride, 20 mg/mL, NADA 47-955).<p>
The two products have identical labeling indications for use.  The route and
method of administration of the two drugs are identical.  Both drugs are
administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intravenously.  Although the
formulation of the AnaSed&#174; differs from that of Rompun&#174; in that the
buffering system used in the AnaSed&#174; employs slightly different ingredients
at slightly different concentrations, both products are buffered to
approximately the same final pH.  The formulation differences are not
anticipated to affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient, xylazine.
Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to implement Section
512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or <i>in vivo
</i>&#160;bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.<p>
This supplement to an NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act
and demonstrates that AnaSed&#174; is safe and effective for its labeled
indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

This NADA provides for over-the-counter (OTC) distribution.
The original approval for this NADA provided for the use of Type A Medicated 
Article in complete feeds for cattle for the removal and control of the listed 
parasites. The Type "C" medicated complete feed was fed as a single dose of 5 
mg fenbendazole per kilogram of body weight. This supplemental submission has 
been filed to provide for that same dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight to be fed 
free-choice in a vitamin/mineral supplement (Type C feed) administered over a 
three to six day period for the removal and control of the listed parasites.<p>

efficacy of fenbendazole in cattle included in the approved NADA 128-620
(Fenbendazole Suspension 10%, 48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983). One study was
conducted in cattle to demonstrate that the premix (Type A Medicated Article)
has comparable efficacy to the 10% suspension formulation when used at the same
dose of 5 mg fenbendazole/kg body weight. Four parasites indicated on the label
were tested. The suspension, premix and pellets are equally efficacious with
respect to those parasites, as indicated by the two confirmatory studies which
provide data to support and confirm the claim of efficacy.<P>Comparable 
efficacy was demonstrated in these pivotal studies:<P><b>Study #123-A,

identified and assigned to four groups of eleven cattle each. One group
remained unmedicated, one group was given a single dose of fenbendazole
suspension at a dose level of 5 mg/kg and one group each premix or top dress
pellets made from premix at the same dose. Sufficient numbers of parasites were
recovered from the control animals at postmortem to evaluate and compare the

All studies proved that fenbendazole premix and pellets made from premix have 
an efficacy comparable to that of the 10% suspension. The results were analyzed
statistically using a nonparametric procedure. The analysis confirmed the
comparable efficacy.<P>Well documented clinical studies were conducted in the 
United States according
to a uniform protocol which was only slightly modified to accomodate local
management conditions. Groups of cattle with a worm infection, as determined by
egg counts in their feces, were selected. Approximately the same number of
animals were treated with 5 mg fenbendazole/kg body weight or left untreated as
controls. Worm eggs in fecal samples were counted before and after treatment,
the animals were visually observed for side effects.<P>Three investigators 
studied fenbendazole premix 20% and top dress pellets
(0.5%) made from premix in 3 different states. They treated cattle of various
breeds (242 with premix, 243 with pellets) and compared their observations to
those in 242 untreated control animals, investigators, location and numbers of
animals in the trials are tabulated on the following page.<P>

<b>2. Clinical Trials:</b><P>
For this vitamin/mineral 20% protein supplement, the clinical trials were
conducted by adding the fenbendazole premix (Type A Article) to vitamin/mineral Free Choice feeds (Type C feeds) to confirm and verify
dosage consumption and efficacy under field-use conditions. These studies
were conducted as follows:<P>
Two hundred sixty-eight (268) cattle were used in these three studies. The
three treatments were control, 3-day fenbendazole treatment and 6-day
fenbendazole treatment. These three clinical trials were conducted using
fenbendazole at 5 mg/kg administered to cattle in medicated vitamin/mineral
mixes. The reduction in numbers of eggs per gram (EPG) of local material before
and after treatment were evaluated from these trials. The data from the trials
were combined and gave the following averages:<P>

<b>Conclusion/Recommendation</b><P>
The results from these three clinical trials (eggs per gram of fecal matter)
using medicated vitamin/mineral mixes were approximately 85% reduction, and the
necropsy results (worm counts) from the medicated block confirmation trial were
approximately 99% reduction. These data are acceptable and support the claim
that the medicated vitamin/mineral mixes are efficacious when consumed at the
recommended levels.<P>
The results from the clinical trials with medicated vitamin/mineral mixes for
cattle and the trial with the medicated feed block, all providing fenbendazole
for free choice consumption at 5 mg/kg body weight for periods of three to
six days are acceptable to support the same efficacy claims as approved for the
Type A Medicated Article (NADA 137-600) and the medicated feed block (NADA
139-189).<P>
<b>5. Target Animal Safety</b><P>
This NADA relies on safety studies included in the approved NADA
128-620 (Fenbendazole Suspension 10%, 48 FR 42809, September 20, 1983),
that indicated the maximum tolerance dose is greater than 2000 mg 
fenbendazole/kg body weight.<P>
No visible adverse reactions were observed in any of the laboratory efficacy or
clinical field trials conducted with fenbendazole premix and pellets in
cattle.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety<P>
a. Safe Concentration of Residues</b><P>
The safe concentration for total fenbendazole residues in the uncooked edible
tissues of cattle were established, based upon toxicology studies submitted
under NADA 128-620 as 5 ppm in muscle, 10 ppm in liver, 15 ppm in kidney and 20
ppm in fat.<P>
<b>b. Metabolism Studies</b><P>
Under NADA 128-620 metabolism studies in cattle were conducted to select a
marker substance and target tissue for fenbendazole. Cattle liver is the target
tissue with parent fenbendazole being the marker substance. The tolerance (Rm)
is 0.8 ppm parent fenbendazole for cattle receiving a single oral dose of 10 mg
fenbendazole/kg BW, i.e. when total fenbendazole residues are 10 ppm in liver,
there is 0.8 ppm parent fenbendazole as determined by the regulatory method.
Acceptable comparative metabolism studies were described under NADA 128-620.<P>
<b>c. Regulatory Method</b><P>
Under NADA 128-620, the method was developed for the determination of parent
fenbendazole at the tolerance of 0.8 ppm concentration and above in cattle
liver.<P>
<b>d. Withdrawal Time</b><P>
This supplemental NADA provides for no change in the oral dose of 5 mg
fenbendazole/kg BW.  The supplemental NADA provides for a change in a 3-day
medicated feed program to a 3 to 6-day medicated feed program.  The levels of
drug and metabolites in tissues at zero-hour withdrawal time are inversely
related to the duration of time for administration of the 5 mg/kg BW.  The
smaller daily dosage is continuously metabolized, excreted, and eliminated by
the target animal species.  We have assigned the longest withdrawal time for
fenbendazole, 13 days after the last day of the 3 to 6-day medicated feed
program.<P>
<b>e. Safety to Handler</b><P>
Under NADA 128-620, studies were conducted which demonstrated that the drug
would have no ill effects on persons handling it if the drug is used according
to label recommendations.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b><P>
The data submitted in this supplemental NADA satisfy the requirements of
section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that 4% and 20% fenbendazole premix
(Type A Medicated Article) for cattle when used under its proposed conditions
of use, is safe and effective for its labeled conditions.  The premix will be
used to manufacture vitamin/mineral supplements (Type C feed) to be fed free
choice to cattle in a 3 to 6 day feeding for removal and control of
parasites.<P>
The data submitted consisted of a Dose Confirmation trial using the feed blocks
medium which demonstrated that a 3-day or a 10-day feeding of a total dose of 5
mg/kg body weight of fenbendazole is effective in reduction of worms reported
at necropsy of approximately 100%.<P>
Clinical trials were conducted using various medicated free choice
vitamin/mineral mixes in 3-day and 6-day treatment.  Fenbendazole was
administered in the feeds at a total dose of 5 mg/kg body weight with a
resultant reduction in EPG (eggs per gram) of fecal material of approximately
85%.  This is adequate to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
treatments for cattle.<P>
This was a Category II supplemental application that required no reevaluation
of human food safety data.  The change in duration with no increase in the dose
of 5 mg fenbendazole/kg BW decreases the concentration at zero hour withdrawal
time without a change in the qualitative composition of the residues being
unlikely.  Additional residue depletion data were not required for approval of
this supplemental NADA as it poses no increased human risk from exposure to
residues of fenbendazole.  This Type C free choice vitamin-mineral mix will be
labeled with a 13 day withdrawal time, the longest withdrawal time for a
fenbendazole medicated feed use.  Currently, fenbendazole premix, feedblocks,
paste and suspension are marketed for use in cattle.<P>
Fenbendazole has previously been approved over the counter for control of the
same parasites at the same dosage level.  The agency is not aware of any
information suggesting that the over the counter status of the drug should be
changed.  The changes made in this supplemental application (different duration
of dosing and administration through a vitamin/mineral mix) are of the kind
that can be followed by the lay person.<P>

<TITLE>FEED MILL LICENSING NOW A REALITY</TITLE>


</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h1>FDA CVM Update</h1>
November 5, 1996

<H3>FEED MILL LICENSING NOW A REALITY</H3>

Medicated Feed Applications (MFA's), or 1900's, are now a thing of the 
past.  On October 9, 1996, the President signed the Animal Drug 
Availability Act of 1996 (ADAA), which amends Section 512(m) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a single facility license rather 
than multiple MFA's for each feed mill as previously required.  FDA intends 
to revise its regulations to clarify that a license will be required for 
the manufacture of feeds using Category II, Type A medicated articles, the 
manufacture of free choice feeds, and the manufacture of liquid Type B 
feeds where the formula or specifications are not published in the 21 CFR 
558 regulations.
<P>
This amendment streamlines the paperwork process for the approval to 
manufacture
medicated feeds.  Now, any feed manufacturing facility which currently 
holds one or more approved MFA's automatically holds a transitional 
license.  The transitional license is valid up to 18 months, and will only 
be converted by CVM to a permanent license upon receipt of a license 
application accompanied by a copy of an approved MFA.  Feed facilities that 
want to be licensed and do not hold a MFA will need to register with FDA, 
file a license application, and undergo a preapproval inspection.  
<P>
License applications will be accepted in letter form, and should include 
the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>full statement of the business name, address and FDA 
registration central file number (CFN) of the specific manufacturing 
site, 
<LI>the name and signature of the responsible individuals for that 
facility,
<LI>a statement that all medicated feed will be manufactured and 
labeled according to FDA regulations, and,
<LI>a certification that the firm is operating in compliance with 
current good            manufacturing practice regulations.
</UL>
Prior to shipment of a new animal drug intended for use in the manufacture 
of medicated animal feed, the seller must have a written statement from the 
buyer that the buyer has a feed mill license and possesses current approved 
Type B and/or C feed labeling for the drug, unless FDA has exempted by 
regulation manufacturers of animal feed bearing or containing such a drug 
from the requirement to hold a license.  In the event that the buyer is not 
the feed manufacturer, the buyer must provide the seller with a statement that the drug will be sold only to feed mill license holders.  
The source of the labeling is the approved labeling in the new animal drug 
application (NADA), and is available from the Type A article manufacturer 
or the distributor.
<P>
Licensees are required to establish and maintain all records and make such 
reports as required by regulation or order issued under 512 (m)(5)(A) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and as now published in 21 CFR 
510.301.  They are also required by good manufacturing practice regulations 
to establish and maintain a program of sampling and analysis consisting of 
an assay of the first batch manufactured, followed thereafter by two 
samples at periodic intervals during the calendar year.  If a medicated 
feed contains a combination of animal drugs, only one of  the drugs need be 
subject to analysis each time, provided the one tested is different from 
the one(s) previously tested.  Reports of assays shall be kept on the 
premises for not less than 1 year after the date of manufacture of the 
medicated feed.  Licensees will be subject to biennial inspections, the 
same as MFA holders, and if regulatory action is indicated, will be subject 
to the same regulatory procedures as MFA holders were.  Licensees are also 
required to register every year with the FDA.
<P>
CVM is working on regulations to implement the veterinary feed directive 
drug provisions of the ADAA.  In accordance with Congress' directive, FDA 
will not delay any approvals of veterinary feed directive drugs pending the 
publication of implementing regulations.
<P>
CVM is available to answer questions during the transition to a feed mill 
licensing system.  For additional information, please contact the Division 
of Animal Feeds, Office of Surveillance and Compliance, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, telephone 
301-594-1724.

<b> 		<i>"Helping man and animals by ensuring the availability </i></b><br>
<b><i>		of safe and effective animal health products."</i></b>< <P>
 
December 18, 1996<P>
<b>VMAC ENDORSES POST-APPROVAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR
POSILAC
</b><sup>&#174;</sup><P>
The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) met on November 20, 1996 to
consider the issue of bovine somatotropin (bST).  FDA approved Monsanto
Company's Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> in November 1993, following an extensive and
comprehensive review of the product's safety and efficacy, including human food
safety.   Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> is currently the only recombinant bovine
somatotropin product approved for increasing milk production in dairy cattle in
the U.S.  Prior to approval, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)
determined that use of Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> caused a small increase in the
incidence of mastitis and an increase in the use of medications for mastitis
and other health problems.  At a meeting held in March 1993, the VMAC concluded
that the increased potential for drug residue in milk could be managed by
practices currently in use by the dairy industry.  <P>
At the time of commercial introduction of Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup>, the
Monsanto Company initiated a Post-Approval Monitoring Program (PAMP) to
determine if mastitis incidence and antibiotic use was manageable under actual
use conditions and to determine if label directions were adequate.  The key
components of the PAMP were:<P>
1.	A proactive system of collecting Adverse Drug Experience Reports,<P>
2.	A program of tracking milk residues by key dairy States before and after the
approval of Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup>,<P>
3.	A 28-herd study to evaluate Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> under actual conditions
of use.<P>
This PAMP is the most extensive post-approval study ever conducted for any
animal product.  The herd component involved 28 herds representing 1213 cows in
key dairy producing States.  The results of this study reflect the general good
health of dairy cattle given Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> for a single lactation
under commercial conditions.  Stringent requirements were placed on the
participants regarding data collection, recordkeeping, veterinary consultation,
daily observations, etc.  Throughout the entire program, FDA closely monitored
all PAMP activities.  Special drug experience reports were submitted to CVM
every 90 days, including status reports, units of product sold, etc.  FDA  
conducted on-site inspections of the PAMP components five times during the
Program.  During these visits investigators reviewed raw data, interviewed
clinical investigators, reviewed the firm's Quality Assurance Standard
Operating Procedures for the herd study, and reviewed test article storage and
inventory.  In addition, CVM scientists conducted farm inspections of 10 herds
selected from the 28 herds.  They interviewed herd managers and veterinarians,
reviewed the recordkeeping systems, and observed drug administration and
inspected drug storage areas and inventories.  No significant problems were
found.  Data integrity was acceptable, and farm records from data entry to data
analysis showed excellent fidelity.  CVM concluded from data collected in the
PAMP that the effects of the use of Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> in this study were
in close agreement with the effects observed in the preclearance studies.  <P>
Monsanto officials presented information from their State tracking program
showing that there have been no changes in the percentage of milk discarded due
to violative residues attributable to the use of Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup>.<P>
The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee was asked to consider the following
two questions prior to the start of the meeting:<P>
1.	Does the proposed revised labeling for Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup> provide
adequate directions for actual conditions of use?<P>
2.	Do the results of the Post-Approval Monitoring Program adequately address
the safety of the milk supply as it relates to the use of
Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup>?<P>
At the end of the meeting each VMAC member affirmatively responded to these
questions.  The VMAC concluded that the labeling of Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup>
provides adequate directions for actual conditions of use.  In addition, the
VMAC endorsement of the final results of the PAMP confirms that bST is indeed
safe and has no adverse effect on the milk supply.<P>
FDA management also agrees that Monsanto Company's Post-Approval Monitoring
Program adequately addressed the safety of the milk supply as related to
Posilac<sup>&#174;</sup>.  Recently, Dr. Michael A. Friedman, FDA's Deputy
Commissioner for Operations, told the Monsanto Company, "The issues surrounding
this highly visible product are in many ways a microcosm of the science and
public policy challenges that industry and the Agency face in bringing new
products to the market place that offer potential benefits to society...I
believe the outstanding quality of your studies and your commitment to working
closely with the Agency in meeting your PAMP goals establish a model for
successfully dealing with challenging approval issues."<br>

<TITLE>UPDATE ON EXTRA-LABEL USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONES</TITLE>


</HEAD>
<BODY>
July 16, 1996
<P>
<h3>UPDATE ON EXTRA-LABEL USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONES</h3>

On August 18, 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sarafloxacin 
hydrochloride for use in broiler chickens and growing turkeys for the control of 
mortality associated with Escherichia coli organisms susceptible to sarafloxacin.  
This approval raised concerns about the effect of these uses on the development of 
resistance to fluoroquinolones in humans.  FDA addressed these concerns by asking 
veterinary practitioners to refrain from administering the fluoroquinolones for extra-
label uses in major food-producing animals.  
<P>
The FDA restriction on extra-label use of these drugs provides the Agency with an 
opportunity to assess changes in antimicrobial susceptibility from the labeled food-
animal uses of fluoroquinolones and helps to ensure the continued effectiveness of 
this antibiotic.  The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is committed to preserving 
the usefulness of the fluoroquinolones.  Prudent and judicious use of these 
compounds, only for label-approved use, will be an important factor in retaining their 
effectiveness for veterinary use.
<P>
Expert scientific groups such as the Institute of Medicine and the American Society for 
Microbiology have expressed concern about the national and global increase in 
antimicrobial resistance and the complex issues surrounding this increase both in 
community and institutional settings.  The rate of resistance development by human 
bacterial pathogens may be exceeding the rate of discovery and development of new 
antimicrobial drugs.  The development of resistance in human pathogens results 
from direct use of antimicrobials in man and possibly the acquisition of resistance 
from animal and environmental bacteria.
<P>
The use of fluoroquinolones in animals, even when limited to therapeutic use, may 
facilitate the emergence of bacterial resistance.  When this occurs in enteric 
pathogens, the potential for transfer to humans exists, especially through food.  
Cross-resistance occurs throughout this entire class of drugs; therefore, resistance to 
one fluoroquinolone will compromise the effectiveness of all fluoroquinolone drugs.  
Evidence from some European researchers indicates that quinolone-resistant 
bacteria, particularly Campylobacter jejuni and some strains of Salmonella, are 
emerging in treated animal populations.  The use of fluoroquinolones in food animals 
is of particular concern to the human medical community because these drugs are used to treat a 
variety of serious infectious conditions.  Food animal veterinarians, as part of the 
public health community, have a responsibility to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate 
treatment of animals with fluoroquinolones.  
<P>
CVM is committed to resolving these public health concerns in a manner that both 
maintains the integrity of the use of the fluoroquinolones and yet minimizes the 
possibility of transference of resistant zoonotic organisms from animals to humans.  
The FDA, CDC, and USDA have established a national surveillance program to 
monitor changes in antimicrobial susceptibilities of zoonotic pathogens from human 
and animal clinical specimens, from healthy farm animals, and from carcasses of 
food-producing animals at slaughter plants.  Veterinary testing is conducted at the 
USDA Agricultural Research Service National Animal Disease Center (NADC) in 
Ames, Iowa.  Salmonella was selected as a sentinel organism to monitor.  CDC's 
Foodborne Disease Laboratory in the National Center for Infectious Diseases will 
conduct the testing of human isolates, both Salmonella and Escherichia coli 
O157:H7, submitted by 14 State Public Health Laboratories.
<P>
The monitoring system will provide descriptive data on the extent and temporal trends 
of antimicrobial susceptibility in Salmonella from the human and animal populations.  
The goals of the monitoring program are to provide timely information to physicians 
and veterinarians in each arena; prolong the lifespan of approved drugs; facilitate the 
identification of resistance in either population as it arises; and identify areas for more 
detailed investigation.  Early identification of emerging resistance will allow agencies 
to focus educational efforts in the human and veterinary medical communities on the 
appropriate use of antimicrobial agents.
<P>
As part of the monitoring effort we intend to share our knowledge with practitioners.  
CVM is initiating an information and education campaign to assist practitioners in 
preserving the usefulness of fluoroquinolones and requesting their ideas and 
enlisting their aid in safeguarding the use of this class of drugs.  Our policy to restrict 
extra-label use of these drugs was initiated to minimize the emergence of resistance 
in animal species for which fluoroquinolones are not yet approved and to prolong 
drug effectiveness of approved uses by promoting use according to labels which have 
met the scientific rigors of the approval process.

BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY<br>
and<br>
CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE<br>
 </h2>
 
 <hr>
<b>Public Health Service Actions to Ensure Against Health Risks</b>
 </center>
<hr>
<I>OVERVIEW:</I> On March 20, 1996, the British government announced a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a chronic disease affecting the central nervous system of cattle, and ten cases of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a related disease among humans. At a World Health Organization consultation in April, a group of international experts concluded that there is no definite link between BSE and the new variant CJD, but that epidemiological evidence suggests exposure to BSE may be the most likely explanation for the ten cases of variant CJD in the United Kingdom.<p>

  In October 1996, John Collinge, one of the foremost British authorities on CJD, and his colleagues published results of their research on various strains of prions, which are thought to transmit BSE. Their results suggest that the new variant CJD resembles BSE rather than other forms of CJD.<p>

  No case of BSE has ever been reported among cattle in the United States, and, since 1989, no cattle have been imported from countries with confirmed cases of naturally occurring BSE. In addition, no beef has been imported from foreign countries with native cattle cases of BSE since 1985.<p>
 
  Although BSE remains a disease among cattle in some foreign countries, the U.S. government is taking steps to even further reduce the risk of BSE and enhance surveillance and study of CJD among humans. This fact sheet provides some background about CJD and BSE and summarizes U.S. efforts concerning the two diseases.<p>
  
<hr>
 
<B>BACKGROUND: Type of Disease and U.K. Outbreak</B><p>
 
BSE (sometimes referred to as "mad cow disease") and CJD belong to the unusual group of progressively degenerative neurological diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). These diseases are characterized by an incubation period of several months (among mink) to several years, during which there is no visible indication of the disease. The incubation period for BSE among cattle ranges from three to eight years; for CJD among humans, it is approximately 13 years.<p>
  
Following a relatively short clinical course of neurological signs, the disease is characterized by 100-percent mortality of its victims. There is no known treatment or cure.<p>
  
BSE among cattle was first described in the U.K. in November 1986. Epidemiological evidence established that it was an extended, common-source outbreak, one that occurred in many places at nearly the same time and was traced to the same source. It is believed that rendered feed ingredients contaminated with a TSE agent served as the common source of infection. The epidemic expanded when carcasses of BSE-infected cattle were rendered and used as feed ingredients, thereby further spreading the TSE agent.<p>
  
Through November 15, 1996, about 165,000 head of cattle in over 33,000 herds were diagnosed with BSE in the U.K. The disease has also been confirmed in domestic cattle in the Republic of Ireland, France, Portugal, Oman, and Switzerland. The epidemic peaked in January 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week; currently, fewer than 200 suspect cases are diagnosed every week.<p>

  
<b>U.S. ACTIONS:Steps to Minimize any Possible Risk</b><p> 
<hr>

<I>Dept. of Agriculture Import/Inspection Protections</I>

  <hr>
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for the health of U.S. livestock. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service operates a substantial program for inspecting animals intended for human consumption. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service enforces explicit import regulations covering animals and animal products offered for import into the U.S., to prevent the importation of foreign exotic diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, and African swine fever. USDA examines all cattle before they can be approved for use as human food. Cattle with undiagnosed diseases of the central nervous system are not allowed for human food. USDA examines over 33 million head of cattle each year.<p>
  
In 1989, the USDA issued restrictive import prohibitions designed to prevent the entry of BSE into U.S. livestock herds. Its aggressive BSE monitoring program has examined more than 5,100 brains of U.S. cattle exhibiting various abnormal behaviors, including neurological symptoms.<p>
  
USDA veterinary pathologists have performed histopathological examinations of brain tissue, as well as immunohistochemistry to detect possible spongiform encephalopathy. No evidence of BSE has ever been found in these U.S. cattle specimens.<p>

</center>
                   
Agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service have a long-standing commitment to research, epidemiological studies, and consumer protection involving BSE and CJD.<p>
  
<i>Cattle Feed Restrictions:</i> As recommended by the World Health Organization consultation in April, the Food and Drug Administration and the livestock industry are moving to ban the use of ruminant protein in all ruminant feeds.<p>
  
 While national livestock organizations and professional animal health groups have announced a voluntary ban on the use of ruminant and mink protein in feeds, the Food and Drug Administration is expediting regulations to codify the prohibition. This month, FDA proposed a regulation that would prohibit the use of nearly all protein sources of ruminant and mink protein in feed intended for ruminants. In addition to prohibiting tissues with the potential to spread TSEs, the proposed rule would establish a flexible system of controls to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain animal protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues. FDA's proposal also points out that the agency is considering alternatives to this ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition and that it is seeking comments on any such alternatives.<p>
  
For many years, FDA has carefully reviewed pharmaceutical products marketed in the U.S. for possible or potential contamination with conventional microorganisms (bacteria, yeast and mold) during their manufacture.<p>

In 1990, FDA intensified its microbiological review of new drug applications for human drug products derived from bovine sources. Manufacturers are required to document that: animal tissues used in the manufacture of these drug products did not originate in a country where native cattle have been diagnosed with BSE; the animals had been inspected by the source country's veterinary authorities, both before and after slaughter; and that the animals are suitable for food use.<p>
  
As a condition of approval, drug manufacturers of bovine-derived pharmaceuticals are required to report outbreaks of BSE in countries where the bovine materials originate.<p>
  
Beginning in 1992 and most recently in May 1996, FDA also issued a series of letters advising all manufacturers of FDA-regulated products derived from bovine tissue materials that source materials should not come from cattle that ever resided in a BSE country.<p>
  
<i>Research:</i> The National Institutes of Health has long been actively researching CJD and kuru, a related disease among humans, and BSE in animals. NIH research has independently confirmed findings to date from the Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<p>
  
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Nobel Prize-winning team at the NIH Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies conducted experiments on the oral transmission of CJD, kuru, and scrapie, a similar disease that affects sheep and goats.<p>
  
In the 1970s, scientists at the University of California in San Francisco used extracts of scrapie-infected brains to postulate that the infectious agent was a single protein, PrP. Naming this class of infectious proteins as "prions," scientists showed that prions were a variant of normal proteins. Further research in the 1990s linked three outbreaks of CJD in Europe and Israel to a genetic mutation in the victims. It is now known that about 10 percent of CJD can be inherited, although it is not known if the genetic defect causes the disease or if another agent, such as a prion, is required.<p>
  
Today, researchers in the United States and around the world are collaborating in the search for methods to detect, prevent and treat prion-linked diseases. NIH scientists are providing input to the current investigation of the ten cases in the U.K. and have developed a diagnostic test that can be performed before death. This collaboration between NIH and international experts fuels the ongoing search for clues that one day might lead to a treatment for this group of diseases.<p>
  
<i>Disease Surveillance:</i> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta conduct surveillance for CJD through examination of death certificate data for U.S. residents. Based on this surveillance, during the period 1979 to 1993, the annual incidence of CJD remained stable at approximately one case per million persons.<p>
  
In light of concern about the new variant CJD cases in the United Kingdom, CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to expand current CJD surveillance. CDC is piloting enhanced surveillance efforts, including an active search for variant CJD as described in the United Kingdom. This enhanced surveillance is coordinated through CDC's Emerging Infections Disease Programs in Minnesota, Oregon, Connecticut, and California.<p>

<h3>AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL 
INVESTIGATIONAL NEW ANIMAL DRUG (INAD) SPONSORS 
OR PROSPECTIVE SPONSORS</h3>

As we are all aware, the aquaculture industry is in critical need of
additional approved new animal drugs for a variety of species-specific or
general diseases (or other conditions which require drug intervention).  The
FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is attempting, in a number of ways,
to facilitate the process of new animal drug approvals (NADAs) for
aquaculture.<P>

The data requirements for drug approval are considerable.  In aquaculture,
where support from the pharmaceutical industry is limited, non-duplication of
effort is particularly important.  It would appear to be nearly imperative that
drug safety and effectiveness data, generated at different sites, be shared and
combined.  Consolidation of INAD exemption sponsorship may further optimize the
use of limited resources.  As an example, a consolidated INAD exemption would
define a uniform protocol design and data structure to be followed by all
participating investigators.  This, in turn, may allow data pooling for
statistical analyses.<P>

The regulations governing CVM's NADA process, of which the INAD exemption is a
part, do not inherently provide for cooperative data generation or data
sharing.  By law, CVM <b>cannot </b>release, to any third party, any
information about an existing INAD exemption.  CVM cannot even divulge the
INAD's existence.  Clearly, cooperative effort is not fostered by such
restriction.<P>

However, the sponsor of an existing INAD may provide <b>written permission
</b>to CVM to allow the disclosure of information related to its particular
INAD.  Such a disclosure can be granted at any of three basic levels.  CVM can,
in essence, be permitted by the INAD's sponsor to: a) disclose the existence of
its INAD, b) review the data in its INAD on behalf of an interested third party
without actual disclosure of the data and/or c) provide data in its INAD to any
or all interested third parties.<P>

We encourage your organization to provide CVM with permission to disclose
information regarding your INAD or INADs.  We believe that efforts to increase
the number of approved new animal drugs for aquaculture would be best served by
significant cooperation among interested parties.  Without permission to
disclose existing and future INAD information, such efforts would be severely
limited.<P>

To assist you in providing us with disclosure permission, two enclosures are
provided.  The first offers a suggested format that can be followed to provide
CVM with any of several levels of disclosure permission.  A letter, similar in
content to the attached suggested guide, must be provided to CVM before we may
disclose applicable information.  The second attachment is intended to provide
some insight into the consequences of providing disclosure permission at the
various levels noted.<P>

As an INAD sponsor, or prospective sponsor, who has provided (or is planning to
provide) CVM with some form of disclosure permission, you can add greater value
to your research efforts by giving the National Coordinator for Aquaculture
NADAs the same INAD information provided to CVM, or a subset thereof.  Rosalie
Schnick is the National Coordinator for Aquaculture NADAs and can be reached at
608-781-2205 by phone and ROZSCHNICK&#64;AOL.COM by E-mail.  She can best serve the
aquaculture community if INAD-related information is provided to her.  The type
of information that would be of value would include:  your assigned INAD
number, what investigational drug(s) you are working with, what type of
studies, the species being studied, what studies remain to be completed,
results of your studies, your plans for future investigations, potential
manufacturing sponsors of the NADA and any other information that you believe
to be of potential use to others who may have an interest in the drug being
approved.  Sharing INAD information with the National Coordinator for
Aquaculture NADAs implies that this information may be shared with any
interested third parties.  <P>

We hope that the information provided in this letter will assist you in making,
what we believe to be, an important decision relative to the general
aquaculture community.  If you have further questions regarding this issue, or
any other related issue, please feel free to contact CVM.  A list of CVM
contacts is provided below.<P>

On another note, some existing aquaculture INADs, probably for a variety of
legitimate reasons, appear to be in an inactive mode.  The efficiency of CVM's
aquaculture program could be substantially improved if the holders of such
INADs were to formally declare their INADs inactive. This would permit CVM to
move these INADs into our inactive files.  This option is included in the
enclosed suggested format and further explanation regarding the consequences of
this action is provided in the second enclosure.<P>

We sincerely appreciate any disclosure permission you may provide to CVM.  We
would also like to thank you, in advance, for INAD-related information you
choose to share with the National Coordinator for Aquaculture NADAs.  We are
confident that your decision to do so will result in a meaningful contribution
toward demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of aquatic animal drugs,
which in turn will benefit the aquaculture industry.<p>

<h3>CONSEQUENCES OF DISCLOSURE</h3>

With respect to providing CVM with a letter permitting our disclosure of
information related to your INAD, there are certain points of definition or
clarification which should be noted. 
<ul>
<li>   If you choose only the level of disclosure provided by Item &#35;1, you or your
organization's name will <b>not</b> be mentioned as being the sponsor, only
that an INAD exists for that particular drug/disease/species combination.
<P>
<li>   If you permit us to disclose only the fact that you are the holder of a
specific INAD (Item &#35;2),  more than likely you will then be receiving inquiries
from other interested parties about your INAD.  It will, of course, be your
decision as to what extent you divulge information to the inquiring party.
<P>
<li>   If you choose Items &#35;3, &#35;4, &#35;5 and/or &#35;6, the information reviewed will
<b>neither</b> become public information, <b>nor</b> will it actually be
released to the third party (or parties).  We will only review the specified
information on behalf of the third party as it pertains to <i>their</i> INAD
application.  
<P>
<li>   If you choose Item &#35;7 (public disclosure of any or all data), you will allow
for the most complete information dissemination.  It will permit the most
potentially valuable exchange and hence the greatest opportunity for the
compound to be carried forward to the final approval process (with the least
amount of research duplication).  Potential new animal aquaculture drugs rarely
fall into the category of those to be financially supported by pharmaceutical
firms.  Therefore, there is a real need for data sharing (and hence
consolidation and coordination of labors) to optimize the relationship between
expended effort and final outcome.  It is implicit that information allowed to
be publicly disclosed for purposes of INAD consolidation, is also publicly
available for inclusion within any applicable New Animal Drug Application
(NADA).
<P>
<li>   If you choose Item &#35;8 (disclosure of specific data only), there will be no
other data released to the inquiring party, nor will there be acknowledgment,
on our part, as to the existence of other non-disclosable information.
<P>
<li>   If you choose Item &#35;9 (inactivation of the INAD), you have merely provided
CVM with a tool to more efficiently manage aquaculture INADs.  You may decide
to inactivate the INAD based on your unwillingness or inability to fulfill the
current requirements of an INAD sponsor.  The INAD could be reactivated at a
later date by requesting an amendment to your INAD.  However, the request for
reactivation assumes your renewed willingness or ability to accept all of the
present responsibilities of INAD sponsorship.  </ul><P>
<P>
Your disclosure letter may contain any combination of listed options and/or you
may add additional disclosure stipulations.<br>

<h3>III. GUIDELINE FOR THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT </h3>
<P>
<b>A. INTRODUCTION</b><P>
This guideline describes how FDA uses information to determine whether chronic
bioassays are necessary to resolve questions concerning the potential
carcinogenicity of the sponsored compound. The threshold assessment assumes
that the potential of a sponsored compound to present a risk of cancer to
people is based on the potential carcinogenicity of the compound and the
exposure of people to its residues. The threshold assessment is not meant to
substitute for a quantitative risk assessment or a comprehensive safety
evaluation for the sponsored compound.<P>
Each substance for use in food-producing animals will be subjected to a
threshold assessment unless it is exempt. If not exempt, FDA recommends the
particular procedure outlined in this guideline unless an acceptable
alternative procedure is developed.<P>
A substance is exempt from a threshold assessment if the purpose of a threshold
assessment -- to determine whether chronic bioassays are needed -- does not
apply. FDA has determined that it will not assess the potential for
carcinogenicity for essential nutrients and endogenous substances. For
demonstrated carcinogens, a threshold assessment is obviously not needed.<P>
For certain other classes of substances, the purpose of a threshold  assessment
applies, but procedures and criteria other than those set forth in this
guideline are more appropriate. Thus, alternative threshold assessments are
appropriate. Such an alternative has been developed for biomass products (see
guideline VII of this document), and will be developed for "other complex
uncharacterized products" as needed. Other classes of substances may be
exempted, as appropriate. Further, alternative assessments may be developed for
classes not listed.<P>
<b>B. DEFINITIONS</b><P>
1.  Sponsored compound means any drug or additive proposed for use in or on
food-producing animals.<P>
2. Target animal means the production class of animals in which a sponsored
compound is proposed or intended for use.<P>
3. Essential nutrients mean compounds found in the tissues of untreated target
animals and not produced by the animal in sufficient quantity to support the
animal's growth, development, function, or reproduction. These compounds must
be supplied from: external sources (e.g., vitamins, essential amino acids,
essential fatty acids, and minerals).<P>
4. Total residue means all compounds present in edible tissues of the target
animal that result from the use of the sponsored compound, including the
sponsored compound, its metabolites, and any other substances formed in or on
food because of the sponsored compound's use.<P>
5. Residue of carcinogenic concern means all compounds in the total residue
minus any compounds shown not to be of carcinogenic concern.<P>
<b>C. POTENTIAL CARCINOGENICITY</b><P>
FDA will consider the structure of the parent compound, data from short-term
genetic toxicity tests predictive of carcinogenicity, data from subchronic or
chronic toxicity studies, and any other relevant information to assess
potential carcinogenicity. The sponsor should provide the results of a
literature search on the biological activity of the compound, including
relevant information on structurally related compounds. The sponsor should also
provide all relevant information pertaining to pharmacological and
physiological activity of the compound and its metabolism in target or
experimental animals. This information can provide clues regarding the toxicity
of the compound.<P>
<b>1. Structure</b><P>
Because of uncertainties in identifying potential carcinogens based on
molecular structure, FDA  will use the structure guide (see Appendix 1) as a
screening device. FDA scientists will consider all of the relevant structural
and biological information on a specific compound before assigning that
compound to a toxicity category based on its structure.<P>
<b>2. Genetic Toxicity Tests</b><P>
Because the field of genetic toxicity testing is undergoing rapid development,
sponsors are urged to seek guidance from FDA on the specific tests most
acceptable for the specific compound of interest. The sponsor should test the
compound in three test systems that have been demonstrated to have a high
correlation between positive results in chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity
and positive results in short-term genetic toxicity tests (see Appendix 2). The
sponsor should include tests for gene mutations in two test systems and may use
bacteria, <i>Drosophila, </i>or mammalian cells in culture. As the third test
in the battery, the sponsor should include a test for DNA repair synthesis in
mammalian cells. When a compound belongs to a structural class containing known
carcinogens and for which these short-term genetic toxicity tests are known to
be inadequate predictors of potential carcinogenicity, FDA will not use such
tests to reduce the concern for carcinogenicity.<P>
<b>3. Feeding Studies</b><P>
Data from subchronic feeding studies conducted on a sponsored compound may
frequently raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity. Examples of such data
include liver or kidney necrosis, biliary duct hyperplasia, endometrial changes
indicative of a preneoplastic condition, or any other biological effects
indicative of the development of cancer.<P>
<b>4. Other Information</b><P>
Other information on the compound may also raise a suspicion of
carcinogenicity. Examples of such information include evidence of covalent
binding to cellular macromolecules (protein or nucleic acids) or intercalation
into nucleic acids; evidence of non-endogenous gonadal steroid activity;
evidence of persistent stimulation or inhibition of synthetic activity of a
specific organ or cell type that may be a potential indicator of a
preneoplastic condition; evidence of toxic effects on rapidly dividing cell
populations.<P>
<b>5. Category Assignment</b><P>
FDA will evaluate the information submitted by the sponsor and will assign the
compound to a category (A, B, C, or D). FDA will assign compounds for which it
has the lowest suspicion of carcinogenicity to category A, and those for which
it has the highest suspicion to category D.<P>
If the compound or its metabolites are structurally related to a demonstrated
carcinogen, FDA will initially assign the compound to category D. If the
sponsor submits results from a battery of short-term genetic toxicity tests and
subchronic feeding studies that do not raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity,
FDA will re-assign the compound to category B; if the results from the battery
of short-term genetic toxicity tests, from subchronic feeding studies, or from
other sources raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity, the compound will remain
in category D.<P>
If the compound or its metabolites are not structurally related to a
demonstrated carcinogen, FDA will initially assign the compound to category C.
If the sponsor submits results from a battery of short-term genetic toxicity
tests and subchronic feeding studies that do not raise the suspicion of
carcinogenicity, FDA will re-assign the compound to category A; if the results
from the battery of short-term genetic toxicity tests, from subchronic feeding
studies, or from other sources raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity, FDA will
re-assign the compound to category D.<P>
Instead of the above procedure, the sponsor may develop a<b> </b>defensible
alternative procedure that is shown to be comparable or may elect to conduct
chronic feeding studies. If adequate chronic bioassays in two test species
demonstrate that the sponsored compound is not carcinogenic, FDA will re-assign
the compound to category A. The sponsor should provide information from test
and target species that demonstrates that the test animals will be exposed to a
spectrum of metabolites similar to those produced by the target species.
Discussion of factors to be considered in the conduct of adequate bioassays for
carcinogenicity may be found in the current literature (see for example,
"Long-term and short-term screening assays for carcinogens: A critical
appraisal," IARC Monograph Supplement 2, pp. 5-83, Lyon 1980; "Identification
of potential carcinogens and risk estimation," Report of the Interagency
Regulatory Liaison Group, J.N.C.I., 63, pp. 240-268, #2. July 1979).<P>
There may be cases where chronic testing of a compound has been performed, but
the data do not meet FDA standards for demonstrating that it is not
carcinogenic. These data, depending on their quality, may be of equal or
greater value than the evidence in the other areas considered in the threshold
assessment. In such a case, FDA will assign the compound to an appropriate
category after consideration of all the evidence.<P>
<b>D. EXPOSURE</b><P>
If a compound is assigned to category B, then FDA will consider the potential
exposure of people to its residues. When considering potential exposure, FDA
evaluates the proposed conditions of use of the compound in target animals and
the residue concentration under those conditions of use. <P>
<b>1. Proposed Use</b><P>
The frequency of human exposure to residues of the compound is related to the
extent of its use in food-producing animals. For example, if a large number of
food-producing animals are treated with the compound, then people would
frequently ingest its residues; conversely, if a small number of animals are
treated with the compound, then people would intermittently ingest its
residues. FDA will determine the use classification for each individual
sponsor's product from the labeling claim that has the greater potential for
human exposure to residues of the product. FDA will assign a sponsored compound
to category H or category L by the criteria described below.<P>
L - Administration on a selective basis for specific disease treatment or
prevention, for specific reproductive uses, or administration for minor uses
only.<P>
H - Administration on a non-selective basis to a herd or flock for production
improvement or prevention of common diseases.<P>
Category H includes products that claim growth promotion, improved feed
efficiency, or a increased rate of weight gain. Category H also includes
products used for prevention of common diseases as a standard practice without
waiting for the appearance of signs of disease in members of the group. This
situation may occur when disease is known to be prevalent in the particular
species, and there is a high likelihood of its occurrence. The potential for
frequent human exposure to residues of these compounds is high.<P>
Category L includes products used for treatment or prevention of specific
diseases where signs of a disease have occurred and a diagnosis has been made.
Category L will also include compounds intended for minor uses only, as defined
in 21 CFR 514.1(d)(1). The potential for frequent human exposure to residues of
these compounds is low.<P>
The following discussion provides examples of the application of the above use
categories. Coccidiosis in fowl and atrophic rhinitis in swine are common
conditions. These species often receive treatment to prevent  these conditions
in the absence of signs of disease. Accordingly, FDA would assign to category H
sponsor compounds used to prevent these conditions. FDA would also assign to
category H a sponsored compound used for the prevention of round worms in swine
because infection with round worms is a common condition in swine. However, FDA
would assign to category L an anthelmintic used for a specific worm condition
after diagnosis. Likewise, FDA would assign to category L a sponsored compound
used to treat a condition diagnosed as fowl cholera. FDA would assign to
category L a sponsored compound used to treat an individual animal diagnosed as
having signs of shipping fever or used to treat the remainder of the herd to
prevent shipping fever. Category H would not be appropriate for such a compound
because shipping fever is not a common condition that receives routine
treatment in the absence of signs of disease. FDA would assign to category L a
sponsored compound used to treat individual dairy cows showing signs of
mastitis.<P>
<b>2. Total Residue Factor</b><P>
The amount of total residue ingested in a single exposure is equal to
the amount of tissue consumed times the measured concentration of residue in
the tissue. FDA will estimate the amount of tissue consumed and calculate the
exposure as described in GUIDELINE FOR ESTABLISHING A TOLERANCE. The
concentration of residue in the tissue will usually be determined from a total
residue depletion study in target animals.<P>
Ordinarily, the sponsor performs the depletion study by administering a
radiolabeled compound to a sufficient number of previously unmedicated animals
to permit serial sacrifice of groups of animals at intervals after the last
treatment. The sponsor should use a dosing schedule consistent with the
intended use of the product. FDA will calculate the total residue factor using
the concentration of total residue in the tissue at the time the animals are
expected to be marketed as food as indicated by the label recommended
withdrawal period proposed by the sponsor, provided that the proposed
withdrawal period is consistent with normal husbandry practices and reasonably
certain to be followed in practice. If the sponsor changes the conditions of
intended use or the proposed withdrawal period, FDA will re-evaluate this
factor.<P>
In the absence of information about the composition of the total residue in the
edible tissue, FDA will assume that the entire residue is of carcinogenic
concern. However, if the sponsor submits information on the composition of the
residue, FDA will reduce the total residue factor by whatever amount has been
identified and shown not to be of carcinogenic concern. For example, a portion
of the radioactive residue may be a compound for which adequate studies have
already been conducted to show that its presence as a residue is not of
carcinogenic concern.<P>
If the total residue factor is used to decide that chronic bioassays for
carcinogenicity are not needed, the total residue factor will also establish
the maximum tolerance that can be assigned to that compound under the general
food safety requirements.<P>
<b>E. DECISION ELEMENTS</b><P>
1. After all relevant information is evaluated, FDA will ask for chronic
bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound assigned to category D or C.
However for a specific compound, if the half-life of its residues in edible
tissue is short and it is administered a long time before slaughter (for
example, several months), then FDA may not ask for chronic bioassays. Under
these circumstances, FDA can conclude that any potential risk to people will be
too low to Justify chronic testing. In reaching this conclusion, FDA will also
consider whether the proposed conditions of use are reasonably certain to be
followed in practice.<P>
2. FDA will not ask for chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound
assigned to category A.<P>
3. FDA will ask for chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound
assigned to category B if it is assigned to the high use category <i>and
</i>the total residue factor exceeds 0.25 micrograms/ kilogram body weight/day
(equivalent to a concentration of 10 parts per billion in the total diet of
people, assuming a 60 kilogram body weight and a total solid diet of 1500
grams).<P>
4. FDA will ask for chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound
assigned to category B if it is assigned to the low use category and the total
residue factor exceeds 6.25 micrograms/ kilogram body weight/day (equivalent to
a concentration of 250 parts per billion in the total diet of people).<P>
5. FDA will continue to evaluate each compound for other toxicological
endpoints under the general food safety provisions of the act. If, during that
testing, data are obtained that raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity, FDA
will apply the threshold assessment to determine if chronic bioassays for
carcinogenicity are needed.<br>

<h3> APPENDIX I </h3>
<P>
<b>CARCINOGEN STRUCTURE GUIDE</b><P>
Over the past fifty years of research in chemical carcinogenesis, it has become
apparent that the ability to induce cancer in laboratory animals and humans is
associated with the presence of certain structural features or functional
groups in molecules, and not with others. This was recognized empirically, and
for many years textbooks and monographs on the subject of carcinogenesis have
been organized according to structural classes of chemical carcinogens (1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 25). These empirical classifications helped stimulate the research
over these years which has demonstrated that reactive properties of specific
functional groups in chemical carcinogens toward critical biological targets,
either before or after host metabolism, are responsible for the initiation of
the carcinogenicity induced by these compounds. So, there has been established
a firm scientific basis that structure, and, in particular, the presence or
absence of certain functional groups, plays a dominant mechanistic role in
carcinogenesis by chemical compounds.<P>
The presence of a structural feature that is responsible for carcinogenicity in
other compounds greatly increases the probability that another compound with
the same features will also be carcinogenic. Unfortunately, there are many
little-understood subtleties in these structure-activity relationships and, in
spite of valiant attempts, structure-activity relationships or theoretical
models based on them never have been able to reliably replace experiment in
determining carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, it is sound to use the cumulative
knowledge about classes of chemical carcinogens to aid in setting priorities
for biological testing.<P>
<b>CLASSES OF CHEMICAL CARCINOGENS</b><P>
1. Aromatic Amino-, Amido-, Hydroxylamino-, Nitroso-, Azo-, Azoxy-, Nitro-<br>
(1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 22, 24)<P>

<IMG SRC="3-1-6.gif" ALT="4,4-Dimethylaminoazobenzene structure" ALIGN=top><P>

4,4-Dimethylaminoazobenzene<P>

<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
Cellular metabolism is necessary for activity. The best evidence indicates that
the hydroxylamino compounds are proximate carcinogenic forms. All of the above
functional groups are related by oxidation state and can be converted to
hydroxylamines by hydolases, oxidases or reductases endogenous to most
tissues.<P>
<b>Comments: </b><P>
Aromatic nucleus, Ar-, can potentially be any type, including heterocyclic
aromatics like furan, quinoline, etc. Carcinogenic potency depends dramatically
upon the number of fused or conjugated aromatics rings. Monocyclic derivatives
usually have lower activity. Recent testing indicates that ring substitution by
alkyl, hydroxyl-, alkoxyl-, or amino- groups enhances the potential
carcinogenic activity of monocyclic aromatic nitrogen compounds. But, even
aniline has now been demonstrated to be carcinogenic (26).<P>
2. N-Nitroso- (2, 3, 10, 16, 17, 18, 22, 25)<P>
<IMG SRC="3-2-1.gif" ALT="representative chemical structures" ALIGN=top><P>
<b>Examples:</b><P>

N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine<br> 
(MNNG)<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
For N-nitrosylated secondary amines, (a), metabolic activation is necessary.
The best evidence indicates that alpha-carbon atom hydroxylation of an alkyl
group is a prerequisite to the expression of carcinogenic potential.<P>
For N-nitroso compounds derived from ureas, urethanes, carbamates, carboxylic
amides and guanidines, (b), direct action without prior metabolism is the most
likely mode of action.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
There is a relatively high correlation between the presence of a N-nitroso
moiety and the capability of a compound to induce cancer. There may be
exceptions due to structural prevention of metabolic activation. But these are
likely to be few in number. All N-nitroso compounds should be viewed with
extreme suspicion.<P>
<b>3. 0rganohalogens</b>

d. <IMG SRC="3-3-11.gif" ALT="Vinyl chloride structure" ALIGN=top><P>

Vinyl chloride<P>

e. Polychlorinated Biphenyls<P>

<b>Mechanism:</b><P>

Mustards, haloethers and some haloalkanes are alkylating agents. They are
thought to be direct acting carcinogens and not need any metabolic alteration
for activity. The mechanisms of action for other subclasses of organohalogens
have not been well studied. Enzymic epoxidation has been suggested as required
for chlorinated alkenes and free radical pathways have been postulated for
1,1,1 trihaloalkanes<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
This is a very diverse group of compounds. Prediction of carcinogenic activity
is made difficult by the lack of knowledge of metabolism and mechanism of
action of some of these compounds.<P>

<b>Mechanisms:</b><P>
Metabolic activation is considered to be necessary. The best evidence indicates
that N-hydroxylation and further metabolic oxidations are prerequisite for
activity.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
This class of compounds, particularly the hydrazines, has many members which
are carcinogenic. The presence of these substructural moieties gives a compound
a high possibility of carcinogenic activity.<P>

<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
Classic alkylating agents. These are direct acting carcinogens requiring no
prior metabolism.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
Carcinogenic activity is greater for gamma-sultones than delta-sultones,
presumably due to more strain, and hence, higher reactivity of the 5-membered
ring compounds.<P>

7H-dibenzo (c, g) carbazole<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
The best evidence indicates that these aromatic compounds require metabolism
for activity. Epoxidation of aromatic ring double bonds is the best candidate
for the metabolic pathway leading to ultimate carcinogenic forms.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
Structure-activity is very subtle in this group of compounds. Even slight
changes in structure can dramatically change carcinogenic potency. In spite of
many years of study no simple reliable models of prediction are available. Any
compound that contains three or more fused aromatic rings must be considered
suspect, including those with nitrogen and even sulfur containing heterocyclic
aromatic residues. Compounds based on the phenanthrene substructure are more
often carcinogenic than those containing the linear anthracene moiety. The fact
that quinoline has been reported to be carcinogenic, and several derivatives
mutagenic, suggest that two fused rings are enough to produce an active
compound if N-heterocyclic aromatic rings are involved. Recent epidemiological
data indicate that benzene is carcinogenic to humans.<P>

<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
The purine-N-oxides are tautomeric forms of N-hydroxypurines. These
hydroxylamines are thought to act similarly to other aromatic hydroxylamines.
The mechanism of action of carcinogenic pyrimidine analogs is unknown. Most
speculation about their activity centers around their ability to inhibit
pyrimidine metabolism or perturb template function.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
The highest potency analogs are the purine-3-oxides. Some purine-l-oxides are
also active, but to lesser degrees.<P>

<b>APPENDIX 2</b><P>
A high positive correlation has been observed between the results of point
mutational and DNA repair tests with bioassays for carcinogenicity.
Unfortunately, negative test data in the mutagenicity assays do not correlate
as well. However, positive data from the less time consuming and less expensive
short-term tests are considered useful for determining the use of resources for
bioassays for carcinogenicity. The threshold assessment will use short-term
test data for this purpose. The following provides guidance to the types of
tests and acceptable protocols to be found in the literature as well as
considerations to be used by FDA in evaluating submitted test data.<P>
Many of the short-term tests that may be considered as screens for
carcinogenicity are, in fact, tests for mutagenicity. While the hypothesis that
the initiation of tumor growth results from mutations in somatic cells is a
reasonable one, the validity of using mutagenic tests as screens for
carcinogenicity does not depend upon the validity of this hypothesis. The fact
that most known carcinogens are mutagenic in at least some test systems and
that most mutagens that have been adequately tested are carcinogenic provides
the primary rationale for the inclusion of mutagenicity tests in the battery of
screening tests for carcinogenicity.<P>
The full mutagenic potential of a chemical is unlikely to be assessed in any
single test for either technical or design reasons. Therefore, the information
from a battery of short-term tests is required to evaluate as fully as possible
the mutagenic activity of a chemical. An ideal battery would contain tests that
would provide not only corroboration but also complementation so that all
classes of carcinogens would be detected. However, as yet there are
insufficient data both from the short-term tests and the rodent bioassay tests
to select such a battery with a high degree of confidence.<P>
FDA has considered a number of types of short-term tests that have been
developed and proposed for use as predictors of carcinogenicity. The criteria
used for recommending a particular assay include: (1) correlations of results
with known carcinogens and non-carcinogens; (2) reproducibility of results,
both within a laboratory and between laboratories; (3) relative ease of scoring
and interpreting test responses; and (4) availability or potential availability
of laboratory capability for performing the test.<P>
The battery of short-term tests generally recommended includes: (1) a bacterial
gene mutation assay, the Ames Salmonella assay is suggested; (2) a mammalian
cell gene mutation assay, the most widely employed are the L5178Y thymidine
kinase system and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) HGPRT assay, and, to a lesser
extent, the Chinese hamster lung cell (V79) HGPRT assay; and (3) a generalized
assay for DNA repair (unscheduled DNA synthesis, UDS) in mammalian cells, the
UDS rat hepatocyte system is suggested. There is evidence that some carcinogens
do not yield a positive response in a particular short-term test. Therefore,
when a compound is of a structural class for which there is reason to believe
that a particular short-term test is inadequate as a screen for
carcinogenicity, its use will not be accepted to reduce the concern for
carcinogenicity.<P>
The sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila is considered a suitable
alternative gene mutation test when circumstances preclude the use of either of
the above mentioned gene mutation assays. An example of such a situation is
when an antimicrobial or antifungal animal drug possesses such extreme toxicity
in the Ames test as to preclude the use of sufficiently high doses for negative
results in bacterial tests to be considered significant. Other tests or
batteries of tests, may be acceptable as supporting evidence to reduce the
potential carcinogenicity factor of the threshold assessment. Such
substitutions will be evaluated according to the criteria listed earlier in
this guideline. Sponsors are advised to consult with FDA prior to performing
the studies.<P>
In general, reproducible data indicating that a sponsored compound is positive
in one of the tests in the battery will result in a requirement for
carcinogenicity testing. Factors such as dosage, metabolism, test sensitivity
and reproducibility will be considered in FDA's evaluation of data submitted.
It is recommended that original data be included in all submissions.<P>
Bacterial mutagenicity tests are suggested because there is an extensive data
base on the correlation between results in such tests and carcinogenicity as
determined by long-term animal studies (McCann et at., 1975; McCann and Ames,
1976; Sugimura et al., 1976). These data indicate that mutagenicity in bacteria
is a generally reliable indication that a chemical is likely to be
carcinogenic. It appears, however, that there are chemical classes of
carcinogens that fail to be detected as mutagens in bacterial and other
mutational assays. In some instances the problems may be overcome by a change
in protocol (Prival et al., 1979).<P>
Although the published data for tests in mammalian cells and Drosophila are not
as extensive as those for bacterial mutagenicity tests, current indications are
that these tests are useful as carcinogenicity screens. The most widely used
test for gene mutations in cultured mammalian cells is probably the L5178Y
mouse lymphoma assay which measures mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK)
locus (Clive and Spector, 1975; Clive et el., 1979; Amacher et al., 1979,
1980). Two others assays for which the data bases are rapidly growing are
Chinese hamster CHO (O'Neill et al., 1979) and V79 (Chu and Mulling, 1968;
Huberman and Sachs, 1976). The marker commonly used in these assays is
resistance to 6-thioguanine which arises from a loss of the
hypoxanthine-guanine ribosyl transferase (HGPRT) activity.<P>
Drosophila is one of the most extensively studied species from a genetic
viewpoint and the sex-linked recessive lethal test is clearly the oldest assay
for detecting mutations. Correlative studies for oncogenic potential of sixty
chemicals have demonstrated that this assay has a high degree of detection
capability both for direct acting carcinogens and procarcinogens (Vogel, 1975,
1977; Sobels, 1974; Wurgler et al., 1977).<P>
A variety of techniques have been employed to measure DNA repair or unscheduled
DNA synthesis either by radioautography (Painter and Cleaver, 1969) or by
liquid scintillation counting (Stich and San, 1970). Only with radioautography
is it possible to unequivocally distinguish repair synthesis from replicative
synthesis and is, therefore, the preferred technique. Many types of cell lines
can be employed. However, their use  requires that replicative DNA synthesis be
inhibited by hydroxyurea treatment or arginine deprivation. Since the metabolic
capabilities of these cell lines are limited, the addition of an exogenous
system for metabolic activation is required for the assay to be valid. Both of
these problems are overcome in the UDS assay using primary rat hepatocytes
(Williams, 1976, 1977). The freshly isolated nondividing liver cells that are
used have the capacity to activate procarcinogens. The data base for this assay
is growing rapidly and its sensitivity and reliability are becoming well
documented (Williams, 1980; Probst et al., 1981).<P>
All tests used in this battery should be conducted with and without a
demonstrated metabolic activation system. While the cell systems used in
short-term tests do not possess the full metabolic capabilities of whole
animals, the incorporation of liver enzyme systems is considered the most
reliable means for overcoming this limitation for routine evaluation of
chemicals. Some test systems (Drosophila, rat hepatocyte) have these enzyme
systems; for others, the addition of an exogenous enzyme system is necessary.
The most commonly used exogenous enzyme system is that obtained using a 9,000 g
supernatant (S9) of a rat liver homogenate. Other approaches such as the
incorporation of cell feeder layers into the assay system have also been
successfully used.<P>
Due to continuing advances being made in the development of reliable short-term
tests, it is difficult to select precise protocols that would be most highly
recommended for each type of test. Among the references cited, the following

<b>FDA HOLDING OPEN PUBLIC FORUMS ON RENDERED PRODUCTS PROPOSED RULE</b><p>

FDA is holding two open public forums to discuss the notice of proposed
rulemaking to prohibit the use of rendered ruminant and mink protein products
in ruminant feeds.  The proposed rule provides that animal protein derived from
minks and from ruminants -

-

animals such as cows, sheep and goats -

-

is not generally recognized as safe for use in ruminant feeds and is a food
additive under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act).  As such,
without a food additive regulation or an exemption, its use in ruminant feeds
would be prohibited.<p>

The first open public forum is intended primarily for renderers, animal feed
manufacturers, and feedlot operators.  The Agency will be prepared to consider
questions related to the economic assessment at the forum.  This forum will be
held on Tuesday, February 4, 1997, from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the Henry
VIII Hotel and Conference Center, 4690 North Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63044 (telephone: 314-731-3040).<p>

The second open public forum, which will be held on Thursday, February 13,
1997, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon at the Holiday Inn - Capitol, 550 C Street,
S.W., Washington, DC  20024 (telephone: 202-479-4000), is intended primarily
for consumers and the general public.<p>

FDA's proposed regulation, published January 3, 1997, is the latest in a series
of preventive measures -

-

including a voluntary industry moratorium -

-

that FDA, other Federal agencies and industry have taken to protect animals
from transmissible degenerative neurological diseases, and to minimize any
potential risk that such diseases could be transmitted from animals to humans.
These animal diseases are known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(TSEs). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is among the more commonly known
of these diseases. <p>

FDA's proposed regulation would prohibit the use of rendered ruminant and mink
proteins in feed intended for ruminants.  In addition to prohibiting the use of
products with the potential to spread TSEs, the proposed rule requires process
and control systems to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain the
prohibited tissues.<p>

The Agency's proposal and related policy issues will be discussed at the
forums.  The forums are intended to provide an opportunity for feedback and
comments from industry and consumers.  Full transcripts of each open public
forum will be made.  The transcripts will be incorporated into the record of
the proposed rule and be placed on file in the public docket (Docket No. 96N-

0135)
for the proposal.  <p>

Persons submitting questions or making comments at the open public forums are
encouraged to submit their questions or comments in advance in writing.  Such
questions or comments will be placed in the public docket for the proposed rule
and be presented to the open public forums.  Persons unable to attend the open
public forums are also encouraged to submit questions or comments to the public
docket on the proposal and any such questions or comments submitted in advance
will be presented at the open public forums.  <p>

Persons making comments or posing questions at the open public forums should
limit their remarks to no more than two minutes to encourage back-and-forth
dialogue during the open public forum and to permit as many people as possible
to participate.  Persons may submit in writing to the docket expanded versions
of their oral comments. The deadline for written comments on the proposed rule
is February 18, 1997.<p>

There is no registration fee for these open public forums.  However, due to
space limitations, pre-registration is required and early registration is
recommended.  Persons wishing to register for the February 4 forum in St.
Louis, should send a fax to Charles M. Breen at 314-645-2969, or send a request
for registration by mail addressed to Mr. Breen at the Office of Regulatory
Affairs (HFR-SW400), Food and Drug Administration 12 Sunnen Drive, Suite 122,
St. Louis, MO 63143.  Persons unable to attend this forum, or those who wish to
submit their questions or comments in advance should do so to Mr. Breen at the
above addresses.  <p>

Persons wishing to register for the February 13 open public forum in
Washington, DC, should call Susan Mackie at 301-827-4407.  Registration will
also be accepted by fax at 301-443-9767, or by mail addressed to Ms. Mackie at
the Office of Consumer Affairs (HFE-3), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
Persons unable to attend the forum, or those who wish to submit their questions
or comments in advance of this forum, should do so to Ms. Mackie at the above
addresses.<br>

<H3><A NAME="g2"> </A>I. HOW MAY I USE DRUGS IN AQUACULTURE?</H3>
<B>1.  How may I legally use drugs in aquaculture?  </B> 
<P>
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act offers three options for drugs used to
treat animals, including fish.  These are that the drug: 
<OL>
    <LI>be generally recognized as effective (GRAE) and safe (GRAS), 
    <LI>have an approved new animal drug application (NADA), or 
 
    <LI>be subject of an investigational new animal drug (INAD) 
exemption.  
</OL>
The problem with the first condition, for a drug to be recognized as GRAE and
GRAS, is that the data requirements to demonstrate that the compound is
effective and safe are essentially the same as those necessary for approval of
an NADA.  In addition, all of the data must be published in the scientific
literature.  Presently, there are no drugs in aquaculture which have met the
requirements for recognition as GRAE and GRAS.  The end result is that approved
NADA's are required for routine commercial use of aquaculture drugs.  There are
currently five drugs which have approved NADA's for specific species and
therapeutic claims in aquaculture, but only four of these drugs are
commercially available at this time.  The approvals are limited to the drug
manufactured by a particular sponsor.  More drugs are being researched under
INAD exemptions to gather safety and efficacy data.<P>

<B>2.  Is there any other way that I can use drugs in aquaculture?</B><P>

Besides the INAD exemption, there are two circumstances which provide
for the use of unapproved drugs, or approved drugs for unapproved uses, in
animals.  Very few drug uses fall into these categories, and these policies
should not be relied upon as a way to use aquaculture drugs.  These  policies
are not a permanent solution to the scarcity of aquaculture drugs and can
actually reduce the incentive to work toward new animal drug approvals.
<P>
1) <A NAME="l2"> Low Regulatory Priority Drugs </A>- There are a few compounds for which the FDA
has set a very low regulatory priority.  If specified conditions of use are
followed, the FDA is unlikely to take regulatory action when these compounds
are used for certain drug purposes.  This decision is based on an assessment of
the nature of the drug, information regarding its metabolism and residues in
the treated animal, the toxicity of the drug residues to man, and other factors
including the manner in which it is generally used in practice.  Low regulatory
priority for a specific drug use of a compound does <B>NOT</B> mean that
the drug use is approved under an NADA and does <B>NOT</B> mean that FDA
has determined that the drug is safe and effective for the particular use.  The
FDA can and will revise the regulatory priority for these compounds as new
information becomes available regarding the safety or commercial use of these
compounds as drugs.  (See Question 3 for the current list.)
<P>
<A NAME="e6">2)  Extra-Label Use Policy for Veterinarians </A>- A second type of low regulatory
enforcement priority has become known as the extra-label use policy.  Under
this policy (documented in FDA's Compliance Policy Guide, 7125.06), FDA
recognizes the need for veterinarians to treat disease conditions in
food-producing animals for which there may not be an approved drug, or for
which the approved drug use may not be effective.  <B> THIS MECHANISM IS
AVAILABLE ONLY TO VETERINARIANS </B>. It allows a veterinarian to use or
prescribe an approved drug (except chloramphenicol, clenbuterol,
diethylstilbestrol [DES], dimetridazole, ipronidazole, other nitroimidazoles,
furazolidone, nitrofurazone, fluoroquinolones) in a manner different from that
specified on the label within a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship.
The veterinary practitioner then becomes responsible for the efficacy and
safety of the treatment to the treated animal, as well as assuring that there
are no unsafe drug residues in the edible tissues of food animals.  The
extra-label use policy does <B> NOT  </B>permit extra-label use of drugs
mixed in feed or extra-label use of drugs by the general public, including fish
producers, hatchery managers,  marine biologists, and fish pathologists.  In
addition, the extra-label use policy does <B> NOT </B> permit the use of
drugs to <I>&#160;prevent</I>&#160; disease or for production use (growth promotion,
induction of spawning, sex reversal, otolith marking, etc.).
<P>
<B>3.  What compounds can I use now, and under what constraints?</B> <P>
<A NAME="t1">  </A> 
Approved drugs can be obtained commercially and may be used according to the
label directions.  There are four drugs that are approved and commercially
available for <I>some</I>&#160; use in aquaculture:<P>

<P>
<B>HOWEVER</B>, these drugs are not approved for all purposes or all
species.  See Appendix A, "Drugs Approved for Use in Aquaculture
(Poikilothermic Food Animals)," for a detailed description of approved drug
uses.
<P>
Unapproved drug uses (use of an approved drug in a manner different from the
approved use and use of a drug that has never been approved for any use) may be
accomplished under an INAD exemption.  Such use must be truly investigational,
i.e., involve a scientific study to gain useful information about the drug to
be used in support of proving the drug safe and effective.  More details about
the requirements for INAD use are provided later in this handout.
<P>
Although unapproved new animal drug uses are not legally permitted except under
an INAD exemption, there are a few compounds that FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine (CVM) has decided are currently of "low regulatory priority" <B>if</B>
the products are of appropriate grade and are used according to good management
practices, and <B>if</B> the use will not likely have an adverse effect on the
environment.  In other words, for the time being, regulatory action will not be
taken if these drugs are used under certain conditions.  Compounds and
conditions of use may be added and/or deleted to the list of low regulatory
priorities as additional information becomes available.  Contact Mr. Richard
Geyer , Office of Surveillance and Compliance at FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine, (301) 594-1761 for additional information, including changes in the
list.

<P>
<B>4.  How are drugs assigned Low Regulatory Priority? </B><P>
The assignment of a compound to Low Regulatory Priority (LRP) originates
with a request from outside FDA.  A sponsor requests a ruling on the use of a
compound.  FDA first must determine whether the compound is a drug, a feed
additive, a color additive, a feed, or none of these.  This decision is based
on <I>the intended use</I>&#160; of the compound.  Once it is determined that the
compound is a drug, then its regulatory status can be determined.  Once a
compound is determined to be a drug, it must be decided whether it is a
<I>new</I> animal drug.  We are unaware of any drugs used in aquaculture which
would not be considered new animal drugs.<P>
New animal drugs that have a low level of concern in regard to public health,
target animal safety, and environmental effects may be assigned LRP for a given
use.  The agency may use enforcement discretion to allocate its resources to
violations representing greater threats to the public safety.  FDA makes the
determination that a compound will be assigned LRP based on literature searches
and scientific data.  LRP does not mean that a drug is approved.  It does not
guarantee that the compound will always be LRP.  It does not mean that the
compound is LRP for any use other than that stated.<P>
Specific questions concerning LRP should be directed to Mr. Richard Geyer, 
Office of Surveillance and Compliance at the FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine, (301) 594-1761.

<H3>II.   WHAT ARE INAD EXEMPTIONS?</H3>
<P>
<B><A NAME="c6">5.  What is an INAD exemption?</A></B><P>

An investigational new animal drug (INAD) exemption is an exception from the
requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) for
investigational use which allows:
<P>

    a)  the shipment of an approved drug for an unapproved use  
<P>
    b)  the shipment of a drug that has never been approved for any 
        purpose
        
<P>
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and corresponding regulations (21 Code
of Federal Regulations 511) state that shipment of a drug in interstate
commerce for a particular use is illegal unless the drug is the subject of an
approved new animal drug application (that is, the drug has been "approved")
for that use by FDA.  Typically, an INAD exemption provides a way for a
pharmaceutical company to do research on an unapproved drug in support of its
approval.  <P>

An INAD is <B>NOT</B> an exemption from having to submit INAD requests to CVM. 
An INAD exemption is <B>NOT</B> a drug approval.<P>
<B>6. Why are INAD exemptions necessary?</B>
<P>
An INAD exemption is required by law for any unapproved drug use.  
The INAD exemption is necessary to:
<P>
    a) allow collection of data (on the most appropriate dose, 
       efficacy, safety to the target species, human food safety, and  
       environmental impact) that will support a decision on drug 
       approval,
 <P>       
    b) allow legal shipment of the drug for an unapproved use, and 
<P>
    c) allow authorization to be obtained for the release or 
       slaughter of treated animals for human consumption. 

<P>

<B><A NAME="c4">7.  What is a compassionate INAD exemption? </A> </B><P>

The legal purpose of any INAD exemption (including compassionate INAD
exemptions) is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of an animal drug
for the purpose of supporting NADA approval.  Typically, drugs used in a
clinical setting under an INAD are administered to animals solely for the
purpose of gathering data on safety and efficacy, and relatively few animals
receive the drug.  This type of investigation is an experiment in the
traditional sense.  <P>
However, there are certain situations where no effective approved drugs are
available, e.g., when the only legal alternative to suffering or death is
treatment with an unapproved drug.  Under such circumstances, CVM is willing to
permit substantial use of unapproved drugs under INADs <B>provided certain
conditions</B> are met.  This is the purpose of a compassionate INAD exemption. 
Compassionate INAD exemptions are granted only if:
<OL>
    <LI>sufficient information is available to demonstrate that there 
will be no adverse effects on the public health or the 
environment as a consequence of investigational drug use  <P>

and, <P>
 
<LI>data supportive of NADA approval will be gathered in the process.  
</OL>
The compassionate INAD exemption is a key mechanism whereby the aquaculture
industry may overcome the scarcity of approved drugs.
<P>
<B>8.  What is the difference between a compassionate INAD
exemption and an emergency INAD exemption?</B>
<P>
An emergency INAD exemption is simply a special case of a compassionate INAD
exemption in which it is not possible to have reasonably planned for the
disease condition which is resulting in significant morbidity or mortality.  In
other words, it is truly a medical emergency.  Under these conditions, the
emphasis for the INAD exemption moves further towards the treatment of the
animals.  It is recognized that, because of insufficient time for study
organization, the data collected may not be of the quality needed to adequately
establish the safety and efficacy of the unapproved animal drug.  CVM will
attempt to review emergency requests as quickly as its workload permits. 
<P>
Please note that compassionate INAD exemptions will be granted on an emergency
basis <B>one time only</B>.
<P>
See Questions 33 and 34 for more information on emergencies.

 
<H3>III.   HOW DOES THE COMPASSIONATE INAD PROCESS WORK?</H3>
 
<B>9.  How do I obtain a compassionate INAD exemption?</B>
<P>
Here is a brief outline of the major steps in first obtaining a compassionate
INAD exemption:  
<OL>
<LI>organize (identify the sponsor, monitor, and potential 
investigators--see Question 15 for definitions), <P>

<LI>choose the drug <P>

<LI>gather available human food safety, environmental safety, 
target animal safety, and efficacy (especially dose) 
information, and design a study protocol, <P>

<LI>submit a supported request for a compassionate INAD 
exemption (and, if applicable, authorization for release or slaughter of fish
with reasonable withdrawal times) to CVM for review, and  <P>

<LI>wait for CVM's letter of response.  </OL>
 
For a diagram of how the compassionate INAD process can lead to drug approval,
refer to Appendix B.  For the steps involved in submitting compassionate INAD
requests, see Appendix C.
<P>
<B>10.  What happens after CVM grants a compassionate INAD exemption?</B>
<P>
After the sponsor receives notification that CVM has granted the exemption and,
if applicable, has authorized release of the treated animals for human
consumption, the sponsor and monitors should prepare to initiate clinical
trials (studies of the drug under field use conditions).  Monitors should visit
investigators and ensure that they have all needed equipment and understand the
protocol and their responsibilities.  The sponsor should notify CVM of each
drug shipment to be made and should ensure that the <A NAME="l1">investigational label is
</A> applied to drug containers before shipping to an investigator.  This label must
identify the drug by name, or code if in a blind study, and must include the
following text:<P>
<B><I>Caution.</I></B> Contains a new animal drug for use only in
investigational animals in clinical trials. Not for use in humans.  Edible
products of investigational animals are not to be used for food unless
authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<P>
The trial should be conducted according to the protocol.  The sponsor should
have the data analyzed at the end of the study, and should submit the
results/data, along with the disposition of the drug and treated animals, to
CVM.  At this point, the sponsor also should reevaluate what further data are
needed for approval of the drug and, accordingly, should design additional
study protocols and try to arrange for conduct of any necessary non-clinical
studies by another party (e.g., the NRSP-7 [described in question 32], a
university, a pharmaceutical/chemical company).  
<P>
Because CVM is granting compassionate INAD exemptions (and authorization for
release of the treated animals for food, if applicable) on an annual basis, the
sponsor should submit to CVM a request for reassessment of the exemption (and
amendment of the authorization for release of treated animals for food, if
applicable) if the drug is to be used in clinical trials the following year.
The same components should be addressed.
<P>
The data generated under the compassionate INAD exemption, along with those
generated by other parties, may eventually be used (either directly, or through
a public master file) to support approval of a new animal drug application.

<P>
For a diagram of how the compassionate INAD process can lead to drug approval,
refer to Appendix B.  For the steps involved in submitting compassionate INAD
requests, see Appendix C.
<P>
<H3>IV.  HOW DO I USE THE COMPASSIONATE INAD PROCESS?</H3>

<H4>IV-A.  Introductory information</H4>

<B>11.  What types of data are needed for drug approval?  Which
of these can be obtained by studies in the field under an INAD
exemption?</B>
<P>
The types of data needed for drug approval include: 
<P>

      a)  efficacy  
 <BR>
      b)  safety to the target species 
 <BR>
      c)  human food safety  
 <BR>
      d)  environmental  
  <BR>
      e)  manufacturing and controls information 
      
 <P>
Most of the studies conducted under a compassionate INAD in the field will
obtain efficacy data.   Data on safety to the target species under field use
conditions can also be obtained.  Hopefully, taken together, these studies will
meet the requirements for the efficacy portion of an NADA.  At least two
adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies are required for approval.
Traditionally, one of these studies is a dose titration study, which is used to
determine the best dosage regimen(s).  For therapeutic drugs, dose titration
studies are typically done in the laboratory, but may be done in the field.  At
least three non-zero doses (one above and one below the expected optimum dose)
and a non-medicated control group should be used.  At least one clinical field
trial, performed in at least 3 sites, typically must be performed to confirm
the efficacy and safety of the chosen dosage regimen under actual field
conditions of use.  However, CVM encourages sponsors to propose alternative
efficacy data packages for product development.  CVM is happy to meet with
sponsor to reach agreement on product development plans. 
<P>
For oral and injectable drugs, efficacy studies should be conducted under at
least two different water temperatures.  For water treatments, at least two
different levels of any water quality parameter likely to affect drug efficacy
and safety should be examined. 
<P>
Although efficacy data are the primary type of information that can be obtained
in the field, samples can be collected during field studies which may then be
used by a laboratory to generate data on human food and environmental safety.
 
<P>
For more information, see Section V, Protocols, which starts with Question
39.<P>
 
<B>12. What kinds of compounds may be used under a compassionate INAD exemption?</B><P>
 
Because compassionate INAD exemptions for aquatic species involve
widespread drug exposure to animals, the environment, and humans, a
compassionate INAD exemption will only be provided when it is possible to
establish safe conditions of use for the drug including human food,
occupational, and environmental safety.  There are no specific rules as to what
compounds would receive a compassionate INAD exemption.  In general, uses of
drugs which are already approved for use in a food animal are more likely to
receive an exemption because information already exists to support human food,
environmental, and occupational safety.  Drug uses for which there is an
inherently long withdrawal time are also more likely to receive an exemption.
Drugs for which there are known safety concerns, such as known carcinogens or
environmentally active toxicants, are much less likely to receive an exemption.
 
<P>
<B>13.  Does it matter where I get my test compound?</B><P>
 
Yes.  A drug made by one manufacturer is not necessarily identical to a
drug made by another manufacturer; for example, even if the active ingredients
are the same, the types and amounts of inactive ingredients, the purity,
strength, and consistency between batches  may be different.  The product
tested in the field should be the actual product which will (hopefully) be
approved and marketed.  Therefore, the drug should be obtained from
pharmaceutical or chemical firms (preferably a single source) which make the
product under current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and which you
believe are most likely to submit an NADA after some or all of the required
safety and efficacy data have been collected.  Source(s) and batch/lot
number(s) of all drug received for a study must be recorded. 

<H4>IV-B.  Responsibilities</H4>

<B><A NAME="i6">14.  What are the qualifications of an investigator </A> under a 
compassionate INAD exemption?  Can a producer be an investigator?</B><P>
 
As a clinical investigator, your training and/or experience, as well as
your facilities, must be sufficient to carry out the study protocol.  For
example, you must be able to make objective observations and evaluations
required by the protocol.  You also must be able to adequately obtain and
process any needed samples.  The extent and type of training/experience
required depends upon the level and type of expertise needed to implement the
protocol.  There is no universal requirement for a particular educational
degree.  Thus, a producer who is capable of carrying out the protocol could be
an investigator.  While clinical effectiveness data are the most obvious kind
of data to be collected in a clinical situation, environmental safety and
residue depletion data might also be generated.  Thus, several protocols might
be running on a particular drug in a particular species.  An
investigator/facility might qualify to participate in one of these studies but
not another.<P>
 
Other qualifications of an investigator include the ability to maintain strict
drug accountability and the ability to fulfill all record keeping
responsibilities.  See Question 15 below for details of these
responsibilities.<P>
 
<B>15. <A NAME="m2"> What step-by-step procedures do sponsors, monitors, </A> and 
investigators follow to perform their roles and responsibilities?
</B><P>
 
<B><I>Sponsors</I>:</B>  A sponsor is the holder of an INAD exemption and is
ultimately responsible for the shipment, use, and disposal of a drug and the
disposition of treated animals under that exemption.  Sponsors, either
themselves or through a designated agent, are responsible for all
communications with CVM, including submissions for establishing and maintaining
the exemption.  Sponsors must develop protocols of sufficient clarity and
scientific rigor that following them will produce valid data to support drug
approval.  The sponsor must ensure that the composition of the investigational
drug is known and remains consistent across studies and that the drug is
shipped only to investigators capable of following the protocols and accurately
recording the results of the investigation.  The sponsor should appoint a
scientifically qualified monitor to ensure that the investigators are meeting
their obligations.  The sponsor must also ensure that distribution of the drug
is not unduly prolonged.  The sponsor should notify CVM of each drug shipment
to be made and should ensure that the investigational label is applied to drug
containers before shipping to an investigator.  The trial should be conducted
according to the protocol.  The sponsor should have the data analyzed at the
end of the study, and should submit the results/data, along with the
disposition of the drug and treated animals, to CVM.  The sponsor should also
reevaluate what further data are needed for approval of the drug.  <P>
 
<B><I>Monitors</I>: </B> The role of the monitor is to provide quality control
of the data generated by the study.  The monitor must ensure that the study is
conducted according to the protocol so that useful data (i.e., meaningful to
CVM and directly related to the approval process) are generated.  Since the
monitors may not directly participate in the data collection process, they
provide an unbiased, objective assessment of the validity of the study.
Monitors, working on behalf of the sponsor, should personally visit the
facility of each investigator and ensure that the investigator understands and
accepts the responsibilities as an investigator and has adequate facilities,
resources, animals, and time to conduct the proposed study.  The monitors
should maintain personal contact with the investigators during the course of
the study and ensure during visits that data are being recorded properly.  They
should keep a complete record of all contacts with investigators.  Finally, the
monitors should certify that the results reported by the investigator
completely and accurately reflect the results of the study.<P>
 
<B><I>Investigators</I>: </B> An investigator conducts the trial, is
responsible for the daily management of the trial, directs the administration
of the new animal drug, and is responsible for the implementation of the study
protocol and for collecting study data.  Investigators must ensure that only
adequate and well-maintained facilities and equipment are used to conduct
studies and that the drug is stored properly to preserve its identity,
strength, and purity.  The investigator must maintain a signed (by both sponsor
and investigator) and dated copy of the protocol.  The investigator must
scrupulously follow that protocol during the study, collecting and reporting
all data accurately and completely.  The investigator must keep complete
records documenting drug receipt, use, inventory, and final disposition.  The
investigator must <B>NEVER</B> supply the drug to anyone not authorized
to receive it, or use the drug outside of the protocol.  The investigator must
ensure that all investigational animals are kept under control and released or
used for food only in accordance with the criteria specified in the INAD
exemption.  The investigator must permit duly authorized representatives of the
FDA or the sponsor to inspect the facilities used in the studies.  The
investigator must document any concomitant drug therapy or any significant
environmental changes noted during the study and immediately report any adverse
effects to the sponsor.  The investigator should retain all raw data and drug
inventory records.  A complete and accurate report of all observations required
by the protocol must be submitted to the sponsor upon completion of the study.
 
<P>
If an investigator fails to meet his/her responsibilities, the investigator may
be debarred, i.e., prohibited, through legal action, from acting as an
investigator and from receiving or using any investigational drugs in the
future. 
<P>
<B>16.  What alternatives exist for small farmers, relative to 
the standard sponsor/monitor/investigator roles previously defined?</B><P>
 
CVM understands and appreciates the diversity of aquaculture, and its
dissimilarities to the pharmaceutical industry.  Often prospective holders of
compassionate aquaculture INADs will not be large enough to allow the sponsor
to be someone different than the investigator, let alone support a quality
control group within their organization.  Hence, the ability to have designated
monitors assigned to INAD studies may be logistically difficult.  CVM may, on a
case-by-case basis, allow some studies conducted under compassionate INADs to be initiated
when the INAD sponsor demonstrates an inability to provide a designated
"investigator" and "monitor", each being a distinct person.<P>
 
The respective roles of the sponsor, monitor and investigator, as specified in
Answer 15, represent the standards defined for the pharmaceutical industry, for
whom the INAD/NADA process was originally formulated.  These standards should
be maintained for all participants in the INAD process.  The primary purpose of
defined duties, in particular that of the monitor, is to assure the highest
level of data quality and integrity.<P>
 
Prospective sponsors should provide in their INAD exemption requests, the
procedures they will follow to assure that the data generated will be of
acceptable quality and integrity.  For the purposes of compassionate INADs for
aquaculture, the lack of a monitor may not be automatic grounds for rejecting
study data and refusing to review an INAD request.  However, if the applicants
have not provided an adequate description of how they intend to ensure
acceptable quality and integrity of generated data, the requested exemption
will most likely not be allowed.  <P>
CVM is willing to exercise some flexibility to allow the requisite studies to
be completed.  The extent of our flexibility is limited by the absolute
requirement of data quality and integrity.  CVM encourages prospective INAD
sponsors, with questions, to discuss these and related matters with the
National INAD Coordinator and CVM.<P>
 
<B>17.  How does the holder of the compassionate INAD  exemption (the sponsor) deal with an investigator who doesn't provide
adequate data or maintain drug accountability?</B> 
<P>
The sponsor should terminate the investigation and notify CVM.  The sponsor
should no longer allow distribution of the drug to the investigator under the
sponsor's INAD exemption.  Please note that the failure of any party to meet
responsibilities may endanger the entire INAD exemption. 
<P>
<B>18.  Who should retain the data?</B><P>
 
Generally, CVM prefers that the investigator retain the raw data, i.e., the
original observations.  If this is not possible, the sponsor may assume this
responsibility. 
<P>
<B>19.  How long should an investigator keep records?</B>  <P>
 
As an investigator, you should retain all records for at least 2 years
following NADA approval.<P>
 
<B>20.  How do I obtain the experimental compounds?</B><P>
 
The sponsor contacts the pharmaceutical or chemical companies which manufacture
or distribute the compound, arranges for shipment to investigators, and
notifies CVM of the shipment.  The sponsor may need to provide a copy of CVM's
letter granting the INAD exemption to the supplier.<P>
 
<B>21.  How may the drug be distributed under an INAD exemption?</B>  <P>
 
The sponsor is responsible for distribution of the drug.  The drug may be
distributed only to qualified investigators designated by the sponsor.  The
drug may <B>NOT</B> be redistributed to anyone else.  Strict drug
accountability (and corresponding records) must be maintained.<P>
 
<B>22.  What do I do with leftover drug?</B><P>
 
Drugs that are leftover from clinical investigations must be returned to
the sponsor or destroyed in an environmentally sound manner in accordance with
any local, federal, and state laws and regulations.  They can not be used for
additional treatments outside the protocol under any circumstances.<P>

<H4>IV-C.   Assistance</H4>
 
<B>23.  Can my aquaculture association help with the INAD process, and, 
if so, how?</B><P>
 
Your aquaculture association (or other organization) can sponsor an INAD
exemption, for which you, the individual producer, could be an investigator.
Such an arrangement would relieve you of the responsibilities of a sponsor.  In
addition, the association might be better able to consult experts in the field
and design a good scientific study protocol.<P>
 
<B>24.  What happens if I choose not to participate under an INAD exemption sponsored by an organization?</B><P>
 
If you choose not to participate under an organization-sponsored INAD
exemption, you may try to establish your own INAD exemption.  However, you will
be expected to meet the same requirements (e.g., providing a scientific study
protocol and safety information), including all of the responsibilities of a
sponsor and investigator.  <B>If you do not or cannot obtain an INAD exemption
yourself, you may not legally use the drug</B>.  <P>
 
<B>25.  How can private, state, or federal aquaculture 
facilities consolidate their INAD requests?</B><P>
 
Most groups will be accepted under an INAD exemption, as long as adequate
assurance is provided that the involved members are willing to assume their
appropriate responsibilities as sponsors, monitors, or investigators.  The
responsibilities include conditions of drug use, conduct of the study, drug
accountability, and record keeping.  For further details on the
responsibilities of various parties, see Question 15. 
<P>
<B>26.  Will private producers and government hatcheries (state 
and federal) have the same requirements for an INAD exemption?</B><P>
 
Yes, except that additional effort is made to accommodate the needs of
threatened and endangered species.    
<P>
<B>27.  Who can I contact to learn of existing INAD exemptions?</B>  <P>
 
Rosalie Schnick is the<A NAME="n2"> National Coordinator for Aquaculture NADAs </A>
and she is
available to answer questions and give information about INADs.  She can be
reached at 608-781-2205 by phone and ROZSCHNICK&#64;AOL.COM by E-mail.  Also, you
can ask other members of your aquaculture association if they know of any INAD
exemptions related to your needs.<P>
 
Unless the sponsor has granted CVM permission to admit the existence of an INAD
exemption, the law provides that no one at CVM can disclose this information.
Therefore, we encourage sponsors of aquaculture INAD exemptions to give CVM
permission to admit the existence of their INAD exemptions.  Unfortunately, CVM
does not have the resources to handle individual requests for this information.
However, CVM can then provide this information to the National Coordinator.
The form to allow CVM permission to disclose the existence of an INAD exemption
and data generated by the sponsor can be found in Appendix F.  <P>
 
<B>28.  How can I learn what data are available from other INAD exemptions, 
and how can I gain access to that data?</B> <P>
 
You can learn about available data in one of two ways: <P> <OL>
<LI>contact the National Coordinator for Aquaculture NADAs to learn if any data
are available or,  <P>
<LI>if you know of the existence of a relevant INAD exemption, 
you can ask the sponsor of the INAD exemption to either release the data to you
or to authorize CVM to review the data on your behalf.   
</OL> 
The latter situation would be useful if, for example, you need to provide
evidence that release of a drug in your effluent would not be expected to have
a significant effect on the environment.  With authorization, we could review
available data, and, without telling you what the data are, tell you whether or
not the proposed use would qualify for a categorical exclusion from the
requirement to prepare an environmental assessment.  As another example,
residue depletion data from another investigation may support a shorter
withdrawal time.<P>
 
<B>29.  What assistance can CVM provide during development of an INAD application?</B><P>
 
CVM provides assistance through participation in sponsor meetings and
distribution of training aids.  CVM also routinely provides suggestions to you
after reviewing your protocols and INAD exemption requests.  CVM's primary
review staff and the liaison to the NRSP-7 (defined in question 32) can provide
some assistance over the telephone.  However, CVM's resources are limited, and
frequent telephone calls may overwhelm CVM's ability to review and process your
submissions in a timely fashion.  CVM understands that the various aquaculture
groups have or are considering designating individuals to coordinate their
compassionate INAD exemptions and suggests that these individuals serve as
central contacts rather than having many people asking CVM staff the same
questions at different times.  <P>
 
CVM should not be considered the only or even the primary source of assistance
during the INAD process.  Other sources of assistance could include scientific
aquaculture experts, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, the National
Coordinator for Aquaculture NADAs, and the NRSP-7.<P>
 
<B><A NAME="f1">30.  Can the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Data Bank 
(FARAD) </A> provide information to support data requirements of INAD
exemptions?</B><P>
 
FARAD can be used in the same way as any other data source.  As with other
sources, CVM has the right to determine the adequacy of those data when used in
support of INAD exemptions or NADA approvals.  Phone numbers for the FARAD
Regional Access Centers are 916-725-7507 (California), 217-333-6731 (Illinois),
and 904-392-4085 (Florida). 
<P>
<B>31.  What is the role of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
company in the compassionate INAD process?</B><P>
 
While CVM does not speak for the pharmaceutical/chemical companies, we can
point out their typical role.  For animal drugs other than for aquaculture, a
pharmaceutical company usually acts as the sponsor, financially and
administratively supporting the drug approval process.  However, pharmaceutical
companies have been hesitant to commit research funds for aquaculture drugs
because of the small size of the industry at this time.  Some drug companies
have allowed their proprietary data to be referenced by CVM to support a
request for a compassionate INAD exemption.  A drug or chemical company may be
a source of the drug to the investigator.  <P>
 
Once all the efficacy and safety data requirements have been met, it would
generally be up to the pharmaceutical or chemical company to sponsor the NADA.
The reason for this is that an NADA must contain a section containing detailed
information on the procedures and controls for manufacturing the drug, and the
drug must ultimately be manufactured in a facility capable of performing those
procedures by a validated manufacturing process.<P>
 
<B><A NAME="i7">32.  What is the role of the NRSP-7 Minor Use Animal Drug 
Program in the compassionate INAD process?</A> </B><P>
 
NRSP stands for National Research Support Project Number 7.  This
program (formerly known as part of the Inter-Regional Research Project No. 4,
or IR-4 Project) has limited funding to conduct safety, efficacy, and residue
depletion studies needed for approval of drugs for various minor animal
species, including aquatic species.  <P>
 
The program is not designed to sponsor compassionate INAD exemptions.  However,
it is possible that the NRSP-7 Minor Use Animal Drug Program may be able to
help you obtain the data needed for eventual drug approval (i.e., approval of
an NADA) by doing some of the studies that you can't do, particularly safety
studies requiring compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice regulations
(described in 21 CFR 58).  The program may also be able to help you locate and
communicate with a pharmaceutical/chemical company that will be willing to
submit an NADA.  If you would like more information on this program, contact
Dr. Robert Ringer, National Coordinator of the NRSP-7 Minor Use Animal Drug
Program, at 616-947-9287 (or 904-383-2589 during winter), or Dr. Linda Kahn,
FDA Liaison to the NRSP-7 Minor Use Animal Drug Program, at 301-594-1658. <P>

<B>Editor's note:</B> the NRSP-7 contact has changed  from Linda Kahn to:
Dr. Meg Oeller, FDA Liaison to the NRSP-7 Minor Use Animal Drug Program, at
301-594-1650<P>
<H4>IV-D.  Medical Emergencies</H4>
 
<B><A NAME="e1">33.  How do I avoid emergencies? What do I do in an 
emergency?</A></B><P>
 
<B>PLAN AHEAD</B>.  Seasonal outbreaks are not an emergency and should
be anticipated by having an INAD exemption in place.  Good planning and close
interaction with such organizations as your professional societies will allow
for you to be identified as a potential clinical investigator in an established
INAD exemption for drugs which may be used during an outbreak.  When an
outbreak occurs, a protocol will already have been established for the
treatment of the fish and the collection of data for submission to CVM.  The
sponsor may then ship the drug to you and the clinical study initiated which
will allow you to deal with the disease outbreak.<P>
 
<B>34.  What if I am not currently participating under an INAD 
exemption and have an emergency or compassionate need?</B><P>
 
Contact the sponsor of an existing INAD exemption and request to be considered
as a clinical investigator under the INAD exemption.  (See Question 27 on who
to contact to find out about existing INAD exemptions.)  Provide any needed
environmental information to the sponsor.  The sponsor will need to provide
this information to CVM.  The sponsor will have to ensure that you have
adequate qualifications and facilities to conduct the study.  The sponsor may
then request an emergency amendment to include you in the INAD exemption.  Upon
receipt of that amended INAD exemption from CVM, the sponsor may then ship the
drug to you and allow you to treat the animals and collect data under the
protocols established for that INAD.  <P>
 
The principal advantage to obtaining emergency permission to use an
investigational drug as a clinical investigator under an existing INAD is that
CVM may use the knowledge already gained under that INAD to evaluate your
request.  Otherwise, it may be difficult or impossible for CVM to establish the
safe conditions of use in time to allow you to treat the emergency (and, if
applicable, safely slaughter the fish for food).  Reasons for this include: 
<UL>
    <LI>You may not be aware of necessary safety data which CVM  
        could use to evaluate your request. 
 
   <LI>You may not have obtained permission for CVM to 
        reference safety data from an existing INAD or 
        pharmaceutical firm for the drug.  It is important to 
        realize that any data developed under an INAD or NADA 
        belongs to the sponsor of that application and cannot be 
        released (or even referenced) by CVM without the 
        sponsor's permission. 
 
  <LI>Very little may be known about the drug and CVM must 
        take more time to investigate the safe conditions. 
</UL>
Under unusual conditions, CVM <B>might</B> establish an emergency INAD
exemption directly with you as the sponsor of the exemption (see Appendix D, a
format you can use to request an emergency INAD exemption).  However,
responding to an emergency request where you are the sponsor of the INAD is
particularly difficult for food animals.  This is because CVM must
determine: 
 
   <UL>
   <LI>the toxicity of the investigational drug and what 
        concentration may safely remain in the food product, 
 
    <LI>how long after the last administration of the drug until 
        the food animal is safe to eat (the investigational 
        withdrawal time), and 
 
   <LI>whether the proposed use of the drug will have an adverse 
        effect on the environment. 
</UL>
Finally, remember that <B>you will be granted an emergency INAD exemption one
time only--for one disease outbreak.</B> 
<P>
If you anticipate further need for the investigational drug on a nonemergency
basis, you should file a routine compassionate INAD request.  This request, if
granted, will be provided under the same INAD number as was used for the
emergency request. 
<P>
<H4><A NAME="t0">IV-E.   Time Frames </A> </H4>
 
<B>35.  How much time is required for FDA to review and decide 
on the status of an application for an INAD exemption?</B><P>
 
By statute, CVM has 180 days to review NADA submissions.  There is no time
frame for INAD review specified in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  CVM
attempts to complete INAD reviews within 100 days.  Time is measured beginning
when the CVM's Document Unit receives and stamps the submission.  
<P>
We attempt to review INAD requests for medical emergencies as quickly as
possible   The amount of time required will depend on the compound and our
workload.  To date, CVM's responses to emergency INAD requests have generally
required several days to 2 weeks. 
<P>
CVM must evaluate the investigational drug and its proposed use in order
to assure that there will be no adverse impact on the environment and to
determine the appropriate investigational withdrawal time to assure that there
are no unsafe residues in the edible tissue of the treated fish.<P>
 
<B>36.  Under a compassionate INAD exemption, when do I  actually have authorization to use the drug and to release or slaughter
treated fish for human consumption?</B><P>
 
You have such authorization when the INAD sponsor receives a letter, signed
either by CVM's Director of the Division of Therapeutic Drugs for Food Animals
or CVM's Director of the Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation, specifically
granting the INAD exemption and/or authorizing release or slaughter.  The
sponsor will receive a letter from CVM's Document Control Unit shortly after
the request for the INAD exemption is submitted; however, this letter merely
acknowledges receipt of the submission, and is <B>NOT</B> an answer to
the request. 
<P>
<B>37.  Once a compassionate INAD exemption is granted, how 
long does it remain in effect?</B><P>
 
CVM is granting nonemergency compassionate INAD exemptions on an annual basis.
The exemption will specify a maximum number of animals allowed to be treated
that year.  If you want to use the drug the following year, or in additional
animals the same year, you will need to submit to CVM a request to reassess and
extend the exemption.  Extension of the exemption will depend, in part, on a
demonstration of past adherence to the conditions of the exemption.  Please
note that a request for reassessment and extension of a compassionate INAD
exemption will <B>NOT</B> be reviewed on an emergency basis.
<P>
Emergency compassionate exemptions will be granted for a single use only to
treat one disease outbreak.   <P>
<B>38.  How long can clinical field use continue under a 
compassionate INAD exemption?</B>  
<P>
CVM will allow clinical field use to continue under the conditions specified
for a compassionate INAD exemption as long as useful data are being generated
and progress is being made toward approval.  Keep in mind that your INAD
exemption is only a temporary means of drug use until sufficient data have been
gathered to support approval of the drug.   
 
 
<H3>V.   PROTOCOL QUESTIONS</H3>

<B>39.  What is the purpose of a study protocol?</B><P>
 
A study protocol provides a research plan and specifies objectives of the
study, materials required, and scientific methods for obtaining and evaluating
the data.   
<P>
<B>40.  How extensive should the protocols for a compassionate INAD be?</B><P>
 
The protocols for compassionate INAD's should be <B>VERY</B> detailed.
The less the scientific and regulatory background of the investigator(s) and
the more individuals involved, the more detailed the protocol should be.  A
highly detailed protocol ensures consistency among investigators by providing
step-by-step instruction.  It may also be a way to guide the investigator
through the steps needed to meet the requirements of a compassionate INAD
exemption.  See Appendix E, a detailed protocol outline, with suggested areas
to be covered under a compassionate INAD exemption.<P>
 
<B>41.  Who should design the study protocol?</B><P>
 
Designing a protocol requires expertise in basic principles of research.  CVM
suggests that a scientist with expertise in the aquaculture field be consulted
for help in designing the protocol.  Also, it is highly recommended that you
consult a statistician to make sure that the trial design will provide proper
"answers" to the questions proposed in the protocol.<P>
 
<B><A NAME="c5">42.  What is a well-controlled study?  What is a control 
group?</A></B><P>
 
A well-controlled study takes into consideration factors which may
affect the outcome of the study.  These factors are controlled by the study
design in such a manner that each experimental groups is affected by these
factors in the same way.  Having an appropriate control groups allows for
appropriate comparisons to be made in order to determine:<P>
 
       a) whether the drug really made a difference, and/or <BR>  
 
       b) whether the test system was adequate.   <P>


<B>43.  Do I need to maintain control groups?</B><P>
 
Yes, except in some specific cases, the requirement for control groups
may be waived.  The type of control will usually be either a negative control
or a placebo control, i.e., the control animals either will be untreated or
will receive an inactive (unmedicated) substitute preparation, e.g., the drug
vehicle.  An active treatment control, or "positive" control, where the control
animals receive another therapy which has been proved effective (e.g., an
already approved drug use), may be used sometimes.  Rarely, an historical
control may be used, i.e., the animals receiving the INAD may be compared
quantitatively with well-documented historical information gathered from
comparable animals receiving no treatment or a regimen whose effectiveness is
established.  In order for an historical control to be used, the involved
disease should have high and predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of
predictable duration and severity; or, if the drug is to be used
prophylactically, the incidence of the condition to be prevented should be
highly predictable.<P>

You are encouraged to consult with CVM and/or a statistician to
determine the appropriate size of the control groups for your particular
study.<P>
 
<B><A NAME="e5">44.  What is an experimental unit?</A></B><P>
 
An experimental unit is the unit which is to be evaluated during data
analysis.  It can be either the individual animal or a specified group of
animals (e.g., a pond, tank, or cage within a pond).  The determination of the
experimental unit is made before the study begins and is based on a number of
factors.  These include whether the treatment will be administered individually
to the animals, whether the animals will be evaluated individually, and whether
differences in the environment of various groups of animals may significantly
affect the results.  In aquatic species, the experimental unit is typically a
group of animals, rather than the individual animal, except in <I>some</I>
cases where the animals will be medicated and evaluated individually (e.g.
spawning).  <P>
 
<B>45.  What dosage regimen should I use?  Why should I study 
several different doses?</B><P>
 
Although you may believe that you know an effective dose, dosing interval, and
duration of treatment, this may not be the <B>optimal</B> dosage regimen.  For
approval of a drug, you generally need to demonstrate that the dose to go on
the label is the optimal dose, or for prescription drugs, the best dose range.
 
<P>
You (or another party, such as the NRSP-7) should determine the best dosage
regimen(s), either in the field or in the laboratory, as soon as possible.  The
dosage regimens used in all other studies required for approval of the drug
will be based on the dosage regimen determined in the dose titration
study(ies).<P>
 
An advantage of examining several doses in your field studies is that you may,
in effect, reduce the number of nonmedicated controls by having more groups,
each of smaller size. <P>
 
<B>46.  What primary parameters should be used to evaluate efficacy?</B><P>
 
The primary parameters selected will depend upon the objective of the
study, the purpose of the drug, and practical limitations.  An example of a
primary parameter might be the percent mortality 5 days after the last drug
treatment.  You must specify <B>in detail</B> how and when all parameters will
be evaluated, so the evaluation can be conducted properly and consistently
among all of the investigators.  Collection of reliable data presents unique
challenges in aquaculture.  Areas which you may need to consider include the
ability to gather baseline data and to quantitatively evaluate the study
population before and after treatment.  Representative and reliable sampling
procedures may need to be developed to determine parameters such as pond
density and population and to make evaluations when you cannot observe or count
every animal in the experimental unit (e.g., a pond).  For example, if
mortality 5 days after treatment is the primary parameter, you must be able to
accurately estimate the population size before treatment and after
treatment.<P>
 
<B>47.  What other parameters should be evaluated?</B><P>
 
There are several other types of parameters you might want to examine.
You might want to look at secondary efficacy criteria, such as weight gain or
feed efficiency.  You should measure and record environmental conditions that
may affect the apparent efficacy (and safety) of the drug.   These could
include water conditions such as temperature, hardness, salinity, pH, organic
matter load, levels of dissolved gases, and ammonia concentration.   Adverse
reactions and any signs of toxicity should always be recorded.<P>
 
<B>48.  How should the data be analyzed?</B><P>
 
There are many ways that data can be analyzed.  You should choose
criteria and a method for determining whether the drug is effective or for
determining the most effective dosage regimen <B>BEFORE </B>the study has been
conducted. This choice will be influenced by your study design,
especially in assignment of animals to treatment or control groups and housing.
We recommend that a statistician be consulted.  <P>
 
<B>49. <A NAME="t4"> Should I collect tissue samples </A> during a field study for 
subsequent residue analysis at a laboratory?  What should be included in the
protocol for such a study?  </B><P>
 
You may want to collect tissue samples during clinical field trials for residue
analysis at a laboratory.  The results could help to determine the rate of
depletion of drug residues from the edible tissue of the fish.  The results
could be used to support (or shorten) an investigational withdrawal time and to
determine appropriate sampling times for a subsequent study which would be
pivotal for the drug's approval.  We recommend submitting a protocol for the
residue study for review before initiating the study or meeting with us to
discuss experimental parameters.  General points to consider when collecting
tissue samples during clinical field trials are: 
<OL>
<LI>Collect tissue samples from fish of the age, weight, sex, and 
species for which the drug will be used.  Use market size fish, if
appropriate. <P>
<LI>When grouping fish by size, the range should be as narrow as 
possible. <P>
 
<LI>The highest intended dose level (identified in dose 
determination studies), or even a slightly higher dose, should be used. <P>
 
<LI>The intended route of administration should be used. <P>
 
<LI>A pilot study usually is suggested to determine when to take 
tissue samples. <P>
<LI>Sample fish so that there are a minimum of 4 points with 
residue levels in the edible tissue above the limit of detection for the method
used to analyze the samples. <P>
<LI>The analytical method should be validated.  The performance 
of the method should be demonstrated by measuring precision, accuracy, etc.
The CVM handout entitled, "NRSP-7:  Recommendations for Evaluating Analytical
Methods" that describes the purpose and process of validating a method is
available from us. <P>
<LI>The raw data should be submitted, not just mean values and  
standard deviations. <P>
<LI>If samples are stored over 1 week, a stability study is 
required. 
</OL>
<B><A NAME="e3">50.  Are there any environmental data that can be 
collected from field studies?</A></B><P>
 
Yes.  Examples of information that can be obtained from samples
collected in the field for laboratory analysis include:  
<P>
    a) a determination of how much drug is left in the water 
and/or sediment after the fish are treated, <P>
   b) how much drug remains in the water after filtration (if  
filtration is used), and <P>
    c) how much drug is excreted in the feces. 
<P>
This information could be used for an 
environmental assessment  or to support a
request for a categorical exclusion (see question 53).  Proper scientific
sampling procedures need to be followed.  Advance planning is extremely
important.  If you intend to perform these kinds of studies (and CVM thinks
they would be useful), get advice from a professional aquatic ecologist 
or limnologist and include details of the sampling and analysis
plans in your protocol. 
 
<H3>VI.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</H3>
 
<B>51.  What data regarding the safety of the drug to the target 
species are needed to obtain an INAD exemption?</B> 
<P>
You should provide documentation from the literature and from your past
experience with the drug (if any) on the safety of the dosage regimen(s) you
propose to use in your clinical field studies. 
<P>
<B>52.  What target animal safety data are required for approval?</B><P>
 
In addition to observations on the safety of the drug in a clinical
field trial, data from a laboratory target animal safety study are required.
This laboratory study examines the effect of doses several times higher than
the effective dose.  It is used to determine whether there is an adequate
margin of safety for use of the drug.  If the drug is to be used in breeding
animals, reproductive safety may also be required.
<H3><A NAME="e4">VII.  ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONS </A></H3>
 
<B>53.  How does an investigational facility demonstrate that 
it is capable of using a drug so that the drug residues are not a risk to
the environment?</B><P>
 
Most facilities are capable of using a drug so that it is not a risk to
the environment.  Sometimes this requires modifications in the handling of the
drug or its waste.  <P>
 
Requests for INADs and renewals of INADs should include answers to
"<B>Environmental Information</B>" for each facility (the questions can be
found in Appendix C, page C2-C3).  Please provide complete answers to these
questions.  CVM is required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
to consider the environmental consequences of its actions; therefore, CVM must
have sufficient information to make an informed decision and to provide
documentation that the decision was sound.  <P>
 
Sponsors should pay special attention to the question concerning National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) compliance.  Please provide
brief answers to all the parts of the question. Early in 1994, CVM required
considerable evidence that aquaculture facilities were in compliance with their
NPDES permitting agencies' requirements. However, since then, CVM's resources
have been reduced, and it is no longer possible for the Center to conduct such
extensive oversight. Therefore, CVM now relies on a statement of compliance
from the INAD sponsor. This change in policy <B>DOES NOT</B> relieve the
aquaculture facility of the responsibility of complying with NPDES
requirements.  CVM expects statements of compliance to be true and will take
appropriate action if a facility is found not to be in compliance.<P>
 
As part of Vice President Gore's reinvent government initiative, FDA's
regulations implementing NEPA are being re-evaluated and may be revised.
Revisions will not affect a sponsor's obligation to comply with environmental
pollution laws.  Revisions may affect, however, the extent of oversight that
CVM exercises over sponsor compliance.  Sponsors and investigators should
contact CVM for an update on this issue.<P>
 
CVM encourages aquaculture facilities to maintain communication with their
NPDES permitting agencies.  In some cases, increased communication has led to
compromises that meet the needs of both parties.  You may also find that
providing the permitting agencies with standard environmental fate and effects
data will help your case.  You might be able to obtain this information from
the literature or from other facilities.  Public (federal or state) facilities
may be willing to share data with others.  Examples of fate and effects
information that many agencies use in making decisions about environmental
impacts of chemicals include the following (most agencies would not require all
of these):<PRE>
     a. photolysis/hydrolysis
     b. aerobic/anaerobic metabolism or biodegradation
     c. adsorption/desorption
     d. sediment toxicity
     e. fish LC50
     f. aquatic invertebrate LC50
     g. chronic fish toxicity
     h. chronic aquatic invertebrate toxicity
     </PRE>
It is our understanding that some permits (including general permits)
contain language that allows the use of drugs that are approved for use in
aquaculture by FDA.  INAD exemptions are not synonymous with approvals;
therefore, it is possible that the discharge of investigational drugs would not
be covered under a permit with this language.  The sponsor should check with
the permitting agency.<P>
 
Additional environmental information, including the means of assuring
occupational safety and compliance with solid waste disposal laws and
regulations, is also considered in the decision to grant categorical exclusions
(see questions f) and g) of "Environmental Questions for Aquaculture INADs" in
Appendix C on page C3).  <P>
 
<B>54. <A NAME="n4"> Do production operations that do not require any type of  
discharge permit (NPDES) </A>have to notify state regulatory authorities of use
of any compound used under an INAD exemption?  Does this include all drug
delivery routes--injection, oral, water treatment?</B><P>
 
First, make sure your facility is not required to have a permit.  CVM
currently requires you to contact your permitting agency to confirm that you
don't need a permit.  Sponsors should ensure that discharges of investigational
drugs do not constitute violations of the Clean Water Act even if permits are
not required for the facilities in question.  <P>
 
Even if a NPDES permit is not required for your operation, you should find out
whether any other Federal, state, or local laws or regulations apply to your
situation.  If other laws or regulations apply, and if they require you to
notify some authority of drug discharges, you should notify the appropriate
authority of your proposed drug use.  For example, if your effluent enters a
wastewater treatment plant, you may be required to notify the officials at the
plant of your proposed drug use.  <P>
 
Our request that you notify appropriate agencies applies to all forms of
treatment that will result in any drug or metabolite entering the water, either
directly, through water treatment, or indirectly, through excreta.  <P>
 
We are aware of the difficulties some facilities face in
notifying other agencies of their discharges.  We are aware that states vary in
their policies concerning aquaculture effluents.  However, our main concern is
that discharges from aquaculture facilities do not pollute receiving water
bodies.  It appears that the U.S. public is keenly concerned about the
cleanliness of its water bodies and that discharges will be regulated even more
stringently in the future.  Efforts spent in keeping NPDES permitting agencies
informed and educated about aquaculture discharges and in obeying the
regulations regarding discharges, although difficult now, may result in less
distrust later.<P>
 
CVM intends to cooperate with Federal, state, and local agencies as much as we
can to help prevent potentially harmful substances from entering the
environment.  <P>
 
We understand that obtaining new permits and the modification of an existing
NPDES permit can take a long time.  It is not our intent to impede new animal
drug investigations by causing time delays.  We currently are discussing with
NPDES representatives in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ways in
which the two agencies might coordinate their efforts to prevent time delays
for the investigational use of new animal drugs.  <P>
 
If you have problems with notifying other agencies, please explain your problem
to CVM.  CVM would be willing to talk to other agencies about the drug product
that you intend to use <I>(See also question 53, above)</I>. <P>
 
<B>55.  Can special criteria concerning notification be 
developed for cases where municipal water supplies might be an issue?  Might
other cases then be exempted?</B><P>
 
No.  We think that this question arose out of the perception that the
major environmental risk from aquaculture drug use is drinking water
contamination.  There are many other areas of environmental concern.  For
example, drugs or their metabolites may kill or harm aquatic invertebrates,
plants, or microorganisms that are necessary for proper ecosystem functioning.
They may also pollute water used for swimming or other recreational purposes
and be harmful to people who come in contact with the water.  

<H3>VIII.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY QUESTIONS</H3>
 
<B><A NAME="i5">56.  What is an investigational withdrawal time?</A></B><P>
 
An investigational withdrawal time is the interval between the last
treatment of the animal and when it can be safely slaughtered for food.  It is
a conservative period of time assigned for use during the studies conducted
under an INAD exemption.  For aquatic species where the exact slaughter time is
not known, the withdrawal time may be based on the release of the treated
animals into public waters where they are available for human consumption.
 
<P>
<B><A NAME="i5">57.  What factors are considered when assigning an 
investigational withdrawal time? </A></B><P>
 
When assigning an investigational withdrawal time, CVM considers:<OL>
 
   <LI>the species of animals to be treated<P>

    <LI>the dose, duration, and route of administration of the drug<P>

    <LI>the disposition of the treated fish<P>

   <LI>if applicable, the amount of time between last treatment and <PRE>
  a) growth to market size or slaughter, or
  b) release into public waters and growth to legally 
     harvestable size </PRE>

    <LI>the toxicological profile of the drug<P>

   <LI>any knowledge about how quickly the drug depletes from 
edible tissue<P>

    <LI>any published studies that address the toxicological profile 
of the drug or its metabolism in fish.  
</OL>
All of the above information should be submitted when requesting an
investigational withdrawal time.   
<P>
An investigational withdrawal time is not needed if the fish will never be used
for food.  The method of disposal of the treated fish (burial, slaughter)
should be stated in the INAD request. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="h1">58.  What information do I need for a drug approval to show 
that the treated animals are safe for human consumption?</A></B><P>
 
The human food safety evaluation is one aspect of the drug approval process
(NADA package).  A complete human food safety evaluation could include:<OL>
 
   <LI>toxicological studies in which the toxicity of the drug is 
evaluated in laboratory animals. <P>
   <LI>residue chemistry studies where the quantity and 
composition of the products of metabolism are measured, and analytical methods
and safe conditions of use are developed. </OL><P>
<A NAME="t5">Toxicological testing  </A> may include:<PRE>
      a)  90 day oral toxicity study in a rodent and nonrodent 
          mammalian species 
 
      b)  in vivo and in vitro genetic toxicology studies 
 
      c)  developmental and reproductive studies in the rat 
 
      d)  chronic and carcinogenicity studies 
       
      e)  special studies when required.       
</PRE>
Due to the wide range of toxicological concerns for the various potential new
animal drugs that might be used for aquatic species, the sponsor of the new
drug is always advised to consult with CVM prior to the initiation of a new
drug toxicological program.<P>
 
<A NAME="r1">Residue chemistry testing can include: </A>
<PRE>

      a)  total residue depletion and metabolism study
    
      b)  comparative metabolism study
    
      c)  withdrawal study
    
      d)  method validation    
    </PRE>
If the drug is already approved in a major food species, the requirements may
be much less.  Most of the above studies are quite complex and expensive to
perform.  In addition, these studies must be performed in compliance with good
laboratory practices (GLPs as described in 21 CFR 58).  The typical
aquaculturist will not have the research facilities to perform the necessary
experiments.  However, aquaculturists can participate in collecting human food
safety data by coordinating with university or industry researchers.
Aquaculturists would treat the animals and collect samples to be analyzed as
their contribution toward human food safety evaluation.<P>
 
<B><A NAME="i4">59.  Why doesn't CVM consider the inherent withdrawal period </A>
(the time that it takes the fish to grow to mature size) when evaluating
human food safety of aquaculture drugs?</B><P>
 
The amount of time between treatment and possible human consumption (by
slaughter or by release into public waters) <B>IS</B> considered
in our evaluation of human food safety.  However, this is just one factor that
we use to evaluate human food safety.  A long grow out period is useful to
support a withdrawal time when we have information on the toxicological profile
of the drug, the amount of residues remaining in edible tissue, or assurance
that the drug can only be used on very young fish.  For drugs for which we have
very little toxicological information or for which there is evidence to suggest
mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or teratogenicity, little residue depletion
data, or knowledge that the drug can be used on mature fish, the inherent
withdrawal period may be less useful for the human food safety evaluation.<P>
 
<B>60. <A NAME="n3"> Why doesn't CVM consider early life stages of aquatic animals
to be nonfood species? </A> </B><P>

CVM will not consider an across-the-board designation of nonfood status for all
immature aquatic species because of <PRE>
      a) the lack of information about the types, levels, and 
         duration of residues remaining after use of all drugs 
         in all species and  

      b) the potential for drugs to be diverted for use in later life 
         stages.            
         </PRE>
However, CVM does consider the life stage on a case-by-case basis when
determining the human food safety data requirements for a specific compound,
use level, and indication.<P>

<B><A NAME="c7">61.  Do I need human food safety information for every 
species?  What is happening to the crop grouping efforts?</A></B><P>

While CVM would like to be able to categorize fish into groups to minimize
human food safety data requirements, at this point we are unable to since:
<OL>
<LI>very little drug metabolism data exist for fish<P>

<LI>the available data are for just a few species<P>

<LI>the available data suggest that each species differs in its
metabolic profile<P>

<LI>the effects of different environmental conditions such as
salinity are unknown.<P>
</OL>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Biological Survey (NBS), in
cooperation with CVM, are exploring the crop grouping concept by gathering
information on as many species as possible.
<H3>IX.  MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS</H3> 

<B>62.  What should I do if information I receive from CVM is not clear? </B><P>

Don't give up.  We do want to answer your questions, but sometimes we: <PRE>

     a) don't understand your question--try phrasing it in another
        way, leaving out jargon, or giving us an example.  

     b) are using jargon--if you don't understand a word, acronym,
        or phrasing, don't be afraid to ask what we mean.

     c) cannot answer your question because we are constrained by
        regulations which don't permit us to release proprietary 
        information

      d) may be in the process of developing a policy and simply 
         can't give you the answer at that time--ask again later.
</PRE>
The simplest way to clear up miscommunications may be to arrange a telephone
conference with us.  Sometimes, it may be more direct to discuss issues on the
phone than in letters.
<P>
<B><A NAME="c6">63.  Will it cost me anything to participate as a clinical 
investigator or be a sponsor of a compassionate INAD exemption?</A></B><P>

There are some costs for time/labor associated with required data collection
and record keeping.  You may or may not need to pay for the drug.  It also is
possible that an association sponsoring an INAD exemption may impose a fee to
recoup administrative costs (but CVM has no control over this).  CVM charges no
fee for review of INAD submissions.  <P>

Please note that the study protocol will most likely require control (e.g.,
untreated) animals.  However, the cost associated with the potential loss of
these animals should be considered in the context of losses resulting from the
inability to treat any of the fish at all, now and in the future.  <P>

<B><A NAME="t3">64.  How long will it take to get a drug approved? </A></B><P>

Because of the complexity of the drug approval process, there is a lot
of variability in the length of time that it takes to get a drug approved.  The
amount of time from first submission to final drug approval is influenced by
the choice of compound and how well the required studies are designed and
conducted.  To get a drug approved for aquaculture that has no prior approval
in a food species takes a significantly long time.  None of the efficacy and
safety studies would be waived since there are no data from which to
extrapolate to the minor species.<P>

The most ideal and fastest route to drug approval is to choose a drug that has:<PRE>
        a) already been approved for use in a food species,  
        
        b) a minimal effect on the environment, and 
        
        c) a willing NADA sponsor. 
        
</PRE>
Completing the required efficacy and target animal, human food, and
environmental safety data adequately and simultaneously, would most likely take
longer than a year.

<h3>Procedures and Requirements
for 
Requesting and Maintaining a Compassionate  
Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) Exemption 
(Aquatic Food Species)</h3>
<p>
A.  How to obtain a compassionate INAD exemption<p>

    Submit a request for a compassionate investigational new animal drug (INAD)
exemption.  The request should include, at a minimum, the following
information:  
  <p> <ol>
<li>  <b>A letter, addressed to Dr. Steve Vaughn, Director,
Division of Therapeutic Drugs for Food Animals, specifying the identity,
source, strength, quality, purity, and proposed purpose of the drug</b>.  The
Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) should be informed of the product
composition, type of formulation (e.g., a powdered feed premix), original
source and all intermediaries involved in delivery of the investigational drug
to you.  When drug studies are conducted, adequate methods of drug preparation,
analysis, and control should be utilized to assure proper identification of the
test substance.  Standards of identity, strength, quality, purity, and
stability should be sufficient to assure a reproducible product.<p>
 
<li> <b>Disclosure letter</b> (see Appendix F) allowing CVM to disclose publicly
the existence of your INAD exemption and to share data generated under the
INAD.<p>
 
<li>  <b>A study protocol (or study protocols) describing the design of
each study</b>.  See the attached example protocol outline for suggested areas
to be covered.<p>
 
<li><b>A summary of the qualifications of participating investigators</b>.  An
investigator must be qualified by scientific training and/or experience to
evaluate an investigational new animal drug.  This summary may be a resume or
CV.<p>
 
<li> <b>A discussion of human food safety considerations</b>. Medicated
animals and their edible products may not be used for human consumption or
released for possible human consumption until you receive a letter from us
authorizing such use or release after an investigational withdrawal time.  In
order for us to evaluate the human food safety of a request, the disposition of
the treated fish (e.g., slaughter, rendering, release into the wild,
incineration, burial) must be specified.  If the medicated animals may at some
point be used for food, CVM will need to further evaluate the human food safety
of the request and assign an investigational withdrawal time.   The following
types of information should be provided so that an investigational withdrawal
time can be determined:  <p>
 
a) the number and species of animals to be treated<br>
b) the dose, duration, and route of administration of the drug<br>
c) the amount of time between last treatment and <ul>
    <li> growth to market size or slaughter, or  
    <li> release into public waters and growth to legally harvestable size</ul>
d) toxicological profile of the drug<br>
e) any knowledge about how quickly the drug depletes from edible tissue<br>
f) any published studies that address the toxicological profile.  
          <p>
    The number of animals used or released for human consumption may not exceed
the number of animals specified in the authorization letter without our
reassessment of the exemption provided by such an authorization.   
<p>
<li> <b>A discussion of environmental considerations</b>.  The potential
environmental impacts of laboratory and clinical investigations conducted under
an INAD are subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) and FDA's rules for implementing NEPA contained in 21 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 25.  To address environmental impact for INAD's, 21 CFR
511.1(b)(10) requires that the sponsor submit either a claim for categorical
exclusion or an environmental assessment (EA) addressing the potential
environmental impacts of the investigation.  The criteria for categorical
exclusion are contained in 21 CFR 25.24(d)(4) and the information required for
an EA are contained in 21 CFR 25.31(a).  We anticipate that most investigations
will qualify for categorical exclusion from the requirement to prepare an
EA. 
<p>
    Investigational activities conducted under an INAD may qualify for categorical
exclusion from the requirement to prepare an EA if it can be documented that
waste will be controlled <i>or</i>&#160; that the amount of waste expected to enter
the environment may reasonably be expected to be nontoxic. 
<p>
    In order to support a request for a categorical exclusion for aquaculture
investigations, you must provide answers to the following questions: 
<p>
a)  Please indicate whether the animals are to be treated in an enclosed
environment (such as a tank) that is not in contact with soil or a body of
water, or in an open environment (such as a net pen or raceway), with release
into a body of water or on to land.<p>
 
b)  What is the maximum concentration of the investigational drug that may be
contained in the discharge from the facilities?  Please provide calculations
and assumptions used to determine this concentration.  How often will this
concentration be released?  Describe the body(ies) of  water that will receive
the effluent.<p>
 
c)  Is there any mechanism for treating water containing the drug and its
metabolites?  If so, please explain.  If not, describe how the water containing
the drug will be handled (whether it will recirculate, go to a municipal sewage
treatment plant, enter a body of water, etc.).  If water containing the drug
goes to a sewage treatment plant, will the management at the plant be notified
of the discharge?<p>
 
d)  A schematic layout of the aquaculture facility may be included if it will be
useful in explaining  <p> <ol>
      <li>) calculations used to determine the maximum concentration of  
         the drug in the facility's discharge, or  
      <li>) the mechanism of wastewater treatment. 
 </ol> <p>
e)  Does the facility (hatchery or other) have a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit?<p> If so,  <ul>
     
   
      <li>What is the permit number? 
      <li>What is the name of the office responsible for issuing the 
        permit? 
      <li>What are the telephone number and name of the contact person 
        in the responsible office? 
      <li>Has the facility obtained clearance for the use and discharge 
        of the drug from the responsible office?  (CVM will not grant 
        a categorical exclusi on unless there is no discharge or the 
        discharge is allowed by the NPDES permitting agency).  If 
        not, explain why. 
</ul><P>
f)  Is a material safety data sheet (MSDS) available for the compound?  Submit a
copy of the MSDS with your INAD request.  What procedures are followed for
handling the drug or medicated feed to protect employees from the drug?<p>
 
g)  Describe the method of disposal of solid waste (e.g., sediment, containers,
excess drug product) that contains drug residues.  Certify compliance with
federal, state, and local regulations concerning disposal of such wastes.<p>
     
<li> <b>Three copies of the investigational labeling.  </b>Each container
of an investigational new animal drug for use in a clinical field trial must
have a label with the following statements: 
<pre>
      "Caution.  Contains a new animal drug for investigational use 
       in clinical trials.  Not for use in humans.  Edible products of 
       investigational animals are not to be used for food unless 
       authorization has been granted by U.S. Food and Drug 
       Administration or by U.S. Department of Agriculture." 
</pre>
CVM will send a letter responding to the request, usually within 100 
days of the date of its receipt of your submission.  Compassionate INAD
exemptions and authorizations to slaughter or release the treated animals for
possible human consumption should be amended or renewed on an annual basis.<p>
     
</ol>
B.  What to do before you may ship the drug<p>
 
    If CVM grants the compassionate INAD exemption, you may ship the drug for
clinical field studies.  However, the following must be submitted <i>prior</i>&#160;
to drug shipment:<ol>
 
<li> <b>Prior notification to CVM of each drug shipment</b>.  Prior to
<i>each</i>&#160; drug shipment, the sponsor must submit a notice of claimed
investigational exemption for drug shipment.  To achieve this, a copy of the
format,<b> "Guide for Reporting Shipments for Investigational New Animal Drugs
in Poikilothermal Food Animals</b>," should be completed and submitted for each
shipment (format is found at the end of this attachment).  <p>
 
<li><b>Prior import notification to CVM.  </b>If the drug is to be imported, the
sponsor must provide, in addition to the information required for a domestic
drug shipment, prior notification of the name and address of the foreign
manufacturer, the origin and destination of shipment, and approximate date and
port of entry.<p>
</ol>
<p>
C.  The following information should be submitted to the INAD file, generally
upon completion of the study:<ol>
 
<li>  <b>A report of the study results</b> (efficacy of treatment, adverse
reactions, depletion rates, effluent concentrations, etc.).  These should be
submitted immediately following completion of the study or upon request.
However, life threatening adverse reactions should be reported immediately.
<i>Submission of study results is required before CVM will consider extending
the compassionate INAD exemption for use of the drug in future studies. </i>&#160;<p>
 
<li> <b>The disposition of drug and medicated animals:  </b>The disposition of
unused drug and of medicated animals should be submitted upon completion of the
study.  Inappropriate drug accountability or disposition of treated animals
will endanger the continued existence of the compassionate INAD exemption.  <p>
</ol>

D.  How to retain the exemption the following year<p>
 
    If use of the drug in clinical field studies is desired the following year, a
request for reassessment of the exemption should be submitted.  The same
components described in the original request should be addressed, including a
new protocol(s) and updated environmental and human food safety considerations.
If the scope of your investigations will change the environmental factors
significantly, either another claim for categorical exclusion or an EA that
reflects these changes should be submitted.  <p>
 
    CVM will respond usually within 100 days of its receipt of your submission.
In order for CVM to extend the exemption, you must a) have demonstrated
adequate accountability for the drug and the treated animals, b) have generated
useful data, and c) have plans that will continue to generate useful data.<p>

Approval applies only to the specific drug which is the subject of a new animal
drug application (NADA); active ingredients from other sources (e.g. bulk drug
from a chemical company or similar compounds made by companies other than those
specified in the NADA) are <b>not</b> approved new animals drugs.<p>
 
Approval applies only to use of the drug for the indications and manner
specified on the label.<p>
 
An INAD exemption is not the same as approval; it merely temporarily permits
research (under specific conditions)    
on an unapproved compound. <p><HR>

As such, without a food additive regulation or an exemption, its use in ruminant feeds would be prohibited. While the proposed rule is a preventive measure, the public forums are not preventive measures. Issuance of the proposed rule is part of a series of preventive measures that the agency has taken to protect animals from transmissible degenerative neurological diseases and to minimize any potential risk that such diseases could be transmitted from animal to humans. The agency's proposal and related policy issues will be discussed at the forums. The forums are intended to provide an opportunity for comments from industry and consumers.DATES: The public forums are scheduled as follows:1. Tuesday, February 4, 1997, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., St. Louis, MO. 2. Thursday, February 13, 1997, from 9 a.m. to 12 m., Washington, DC.ADDRESSES: The open public forums will be held at the following locations:    St. Louis--Henry VIII Hotel and Conference Center, 4690 North Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 314-731-3040.    Washington--Holiday Inn--Capitol, 550 C St. SW., Washington, DC, 202-479-4000.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:    Regarding the St. Louis, MO, open public forum: Charles M. Breen, Office of Regulatory Affairs (HFR-SW400), Food and Drug Administration, 12 Sunnen Dr., suite 122, St. Louis, MO 63143, 314-645-1167, FAX 314-645-2969.    Regarding the Washington, DC, open public forum: Susan Mackie, Office of Consumer Affairs (HFE-3), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-827-4407, FAX 301-443-9767.    Those persons interested in attending the St. Louis, MO, open public forum, should register by faxing their name(s), firm name/affiliation, address, telephone and facsimile numbers to Charles M. Breen at 314-645-2969, or send a request for registration by mail to Charles Breen (address above).    Those persons interested in attending the Washington, DC, open public forum, should register by calling Susan Mackie at 301-827-4407 or by faxing or mailing their name(s), firm name/affiliation, address, telephone and facsimile numbers to Susan Mackie (address above).    Persons unable to attend this open public forum, or those who wish to submit their questions or comments in advance of this open public forum, should submit them to the appropriate contact person listed above.    There is no registration fee for these open public forums. However, due to space limitations, preregistration is required and early registration is recommended.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of January 3, 1997 (62 FR 552), FDA published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit using rendered animal protein from mink and from ruminants, animals such as cows, sheep, and goats, in the manufacture of ruminant feeds. FDA will hold two open public forums to discuss its proposal, which is the latest in a series of preventive measures, including a voluntary industry moratorium, that FDA, other Federal agencies, and industry have taken to protect animals from transmissible degenerative neurological diseases and to minimize any potential risk that such diseases could be transmitted from animals to humans. These animal diseases are known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is among the more commonly known of these diseases.    FDA's proposed regulation would prohibit the use of rendered ruminant and mink proteins in feed intended for ruminants. In addition to prohibiting products with the potential to spread TSE's, the proposed rule also requires process and control systems to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain the prohibited tissues.    The agency's proposal and related policy issues will be discussed at the forums. The forums are intended to provide an opportunity for feedback and comments from industry and consumers.    The St. Louis, MO, open public forum is intended primarily to discuss the interests of renderers, animal feed manufacturers, and feedlot operators. The agency will be prepared to consider questions related to the economic assessment. The Washington, DC, open public forum is intended primarily to discuss the interests of consumers and the general public.    Full transcripts of each open public forum will be made. The transcripts will be incorporated into the administrative record of the proposed rule and placed on file in the public docket (Docket No. 96N-0135) for the proposal.    Persons submitting comments or (questions) at the open public forums are encouraged to submit their comments in advance in writing. Such comments will be placed in the public docket for the proposed rule and presented at the open public forums. Persons unable to attend the forums are also encouraged to submit comments on the proposal to the public docket, and any such questions or comments submitted in advance will be presented at the forums.    Persons making comments at the forums should limit their remarks to a few minutes and if possible to fewer than 5 minutes to encourage dialogue during the forum and to permit as many people as possible to participate. Persons may submit expanded versions of their oral comments in writing to the public docket.    Dated: January 22, 1997.William K. Hubbard,Associate Commissioner for Policy Coordination.[FR Doc. 97-1987 Filed 1-23-97; 11:31 am]BILLING CODE 4160-01-F</pre><HR><A HREF="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/"> <IMG SRC="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/fda/home1.gif">FDA CVM Home page</A> <P></body></html>

</pre>
<b>FORMS FOR DATA COLLECTION </b>(e.g., entrance criteria, daily treatment
records,observations and measurements, sample collection; Attach)
<p>
<b>OTHER FORMS</b> (e.g., drug accountability, consent of animal owner; Attach)
<p>
<b>RECORDKEEPING PROCEDURES</b><p>
    Recordkeeping procedures should be specified.  For example, you should
probably specify at least the following:<p>
    The data should be recorded in a permanent medium (e.g., ink).  The data
should be recorded on the official data record forms at the time the
observations are made.  The raw data should be original, i.e., they should be
the first recording of the observations, rather than a transcription of
original observations to another data sheet.  Each original data sheet should
be signed and dated by the person making the observation and recording the
entry.  If more than one person makes and records the observations, entries
should be properly attributable to each person.  Of course, the data should be
accurate and legible.  If a mistake is made, it should be crossed out using a
single strike-through, and the correct data should be recorded next to it; each
change to the raw data should be initialed and dated by the person making the
change, and a statement should be provided explaining why the change(s) were
made.  If an original data sheet needs to be recopied, all data should be
transferred, including the properly noted changes; the original record should
be retained and submitted with the revised copy, along with a memo explaining
the reason for the recopying.<p>
<p>
<b>DISPOSITION OF INVESTIGATIONAL ANIMALS </b><p>
<p>
    What are the allowed dispositions of treated animals?  Will the animals have
to be destroyed and buried?  Will the animals be allowed to enter the food
chain?  If so, in what ways and after what proposed withdrawal time?  You may
request a withdrawal time but CVM will determine the withdrawal time.<p>
<b>DISPOSITION OF INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG</b><p>
<p>
    State that the investigational drug should be used only in the manner and by
the individuals specified in the protocol.  Any investigational drug remaining
at the end of the study must be returned to the sponsor.  The investigational
drug may not be redistributed to others not specified by the protocol and may
not be retained by the investigator after completion of the study.      <p>
<b>DATA HANDLING, QUALITY CONTROL/MONITORING, ADMINISTRATIVE
RESPONSIBILITIES</b><p>
Who is responsible for drug distribution?<p>
Who will be the study monitor(s)?<p>
Who will provide materials, special equipment (e.g., for sample collection and
transport?)<p>
(For the following, if the investigator will be allowed to designate other
individuals he supervises, you may want to leave blanks to be filled in by the
investigator)<p>
Who may administer the drug?  Who else will have access to the drug?<p>
Who will record drug accountability information?<p>
Who will make observations?  Who will collect samples? Who will record the
data?<p>
Who will be responsible for retaining the source data?<p>
To whom should the investigator send copies of the data, and when?<p>
Who will analyze the data?<p>
<b>PLANS FOR DATA ANALYSIS</b><p>
<b>PROTOCOL AND PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS </b><p>
State that a signed copy of the protocol must be retained by the
investigator.  Describe procedures to be followed if a change in the protocol
is desired.  (A written description of the amendment with the reason for the
change should be signed by the sponsor and investigator.)<p>
<b>PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS</b><p>
Protocol deviations occasionally cannot be avoided.  Procedures to be
followed when a deviation occurs should be described.  (For example:  The
monitor should be contacted for advice when a deviation occurs.   Protocol
deviations should always be documented and should be accompanied by a written
explanation. These should be forwarded to the sponsor with the data.)  <p>

<h3>III. GUIDELINE FOR THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT </h3>
<P>
<b>A. INTRODUCTION</b><P>
This guideline describes how FDA uses information to determine whether chronic
bioassays are necessary to resolve questions concerning the potential
carcinogenicity of the sponsored compound. The threshold assessment assumes
that the potential of a sponsored compound to present a risk of cancer to
people is based on the potential carcinogenicity of the compound and the
exposure of people to its residues. The threshold assessment is not meant to
substitute for a quantitative risk assessment or a comprehensive safety
evaluation for the sponsored compound.<P>
Each substance for use in food-producing animals will be subjected to a
threshold assessment unless it is exempt. If not exempt, FDA recommends the
particular procedure outlined in this guideline unless an acceptable
alternative procedure is developed.<P>
A substance is exempt from a threshold assessment if the purpose of a threshold
assessment -- to determine whether chronic bioassays are needed -- does not
apply. FDA has determined that it will not assess the potential for
carcinogenicity for essential nutrients and endogenous substances. For
demonstrated carcinogens, a threshold assessment is obviously not needed.<P>
For certain other classes of substances, the purpose of a threshold  assessment
applies, but procedures and criteria other than those set forth in this
guideline are more appropriate. Thus, alternative threshold assessments are
appropriate. Such an alternative has been developed for biomass products (see
guideline VII of this document), and will be developed for "other complex
uncharacterized products" as needed. Other classes of substances may be
exempted, as appropriate. Further, alternative assessments may be developed for
classes not listed.<P>
<b>B. DEFINITIONS</b><P>
1.  Sponsored compound means any drug or additive proposed for use in or on
food-producing animals.<P>
2. Target animal means the production class of animals in which a sponsored
compound is proposed or intended for use.<P>
3. Essential nutrients mean compounds found in the tissues of untreated target
animals and not produced by the animal in sufficient quantity to support the
animal's growth, development, function, or reproduction. These compounds must
be supplied from: external sources (e.g., vitamins, essential amino acids,
essential fatty acids, and minerals).<P>
4. Total residue means all compounds present in edible tissues of the target
animal that result from the use of the sponsored compound, including the
sponsored compound, its metabolites, and any other substances formed in or on
food because of the sponsored compound's use.<P>
5. Residue of carcinogenic concern means all compounds in the total residue
minus any compounds shown not to be of carcinogenic concern.<P>
<b>C. POTENTIAL CARCINOGENICITY</b><P>
FDA will consider the structure of the parent compound, data from short-term
genetic toxicity tests predictive of carcinogenicity, data from subchronic or
chronic toxicity studies, and any other relevant information to assess
potential carcinogenicity. The sponsor should provide the results of a
literature search on the biological activity of the compound, including
relevant information on structurally related compounds. The sponsor should also
provide all relevant information pertaining to pharmacological and
physiological activity of the compound and its metabolism in target or
experimental animals. This information can provide clues regarding the toxicity
of the compound.<P>
<b>1. Structure</b><P>
Because of uncertainties in identifying potential carcinogens based on
molecular structure, FDA  will use the structure guide (see Appendix 1) as a
screening device. FDA scientists will consider all of the relevant structural
and biological information on a specific compound before assigning that
compound to a toxicity category based on its structure.<P>
<b>2. Genetic Toxicity Tests</b><P>
Because the field of genetic toxicity testing is undergoing rapid development,
sponsors are urged to seek guidance from FDA on the specific tests most
acceptable for the specific compound of interest. The sponsor should test the
compound in three test systems that have been demonstrated to have a high
correlation between positive results in chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity
and positive results in short-term genetic toxicity tests (see Appendix 2). The
sponsor should include tests for gene mutations in two test systems and may use
bacteria, <i>Drosophila, </i>or mammalian cells in culture. As the third test
in the battery, the sponsor should include a test for DNA repair synthesis in
mammalian cells. When a compound belongs to a structural class containing known
carcinogens and for which these short-term genetic toxicity tests are known to
be inadequate predictors of potential carcinogenicity, FDA will not use such
tests to reduce the concern for carcinogenicity.<P>
<b>3. Feeding Studies</b><P>
Data from subchronic feeding studies conducted on a sponsored compound may
frequently raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity. Examples of such data
include liver or kidney necrosis, biliary duct hyperplasia, endometrial changes
indicative of a preneoplastic condition, or any other biological effects
indicative of the development of cancer.<P>
<b>4. Other Information</b><P>
Other information on the compound may also raise a suspicion of
carcinogenicity. Examples of such information include evidence of covalent
binding to cellular macromolecules (protein or nucleic acids) or intercalation
into nucleic acids; evidence of non-endogenous gonadal steroid activity;
evidence of persistent stimulation or inhibition of synthetic activity of a
specific organ or cell type that may be a potential indicator of a
preneoplastic condition; evidence of toxic effects on rapidly dividing cell
populations.<P>
<b>5. Category Assignment</b><P>
FDA will evaluate the information submitted by the sponsor and will assign the
compound to a category (A, B, C, or D). FDA will assign compounds for which it
has the lowest suspicion of carcinogenicity to category A, and those for which
it has the highest suspicion to category D.<P>
If the compound or its metabolites are structurally related to a demonstrated
carcinogen, FDA will initially assign the compound to category D. If the
sponsor submits results from a battery of short-term genetic toxicity tests and
subchronic feeding studies that do not raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity,
FDA will re-assign the compound to category B; if the results from the battery
of short-term genetic toxicity tests, from subchronic feeding studies, or from
other sources raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity, the compound will remain
in category D.<P>
If the compound or its metabolites are not structurally related to a
demonstrated carcinogen, FDA will initially assign the compound to category C.
If the sponsor submits results from a battery of short-term genetic toxicity
tests and subchronic feeding studies that do not raise the suspicion of
carcinogenicity, FDA will re-assign the compound to category A; if the results
from the battery of short-term genetic toxicity tests, from subchronic feeding
studies, or from other sources raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity, FDA will
re-assign the compound to category D.<P>
Instead of the above procedure, the sponsor may develop a<b> </b>defensible
alternative procedure that is shown to be comparable or may elect to conduct
chronic feeding studies. If adequate chronic bioassays in two test species
demonstrate that the sponsored compound is not carcinogenic, FDA will re-assign
the compound to category A. The sponsor should provide information from test
and target species that demonstrates that the test animals will be exposed to a
spectrum of metabolites similar to those produced by the target species.
Discussion of factors to be considered in the conduct of adequate bioassays for
carcinogenicity may be found in the current literature (see for example,
"Long-term and short-term screening assays for carcinogens: A critical
appraisal," IARC Monograph Supplement 2, pp. 5-83, Lyon 1980; "Identification
of potential carcinogens and risk estimation," Report of the Interagency
Regulatory Liaison Group, J.N.C.I., 63, pp. 240-268, #2. July 1979).<P>
There may be cases where chronic testing of a compound has been performed, but
the data do not meet FDA standards for demonstrating that it is not
carcinogenic. These data, depending on their quality, may be of equal or
greater value than the evidence in the other areas considered in the threshold
assessment. In such a case, FDA will assign the compound to an appropriate
category after consideration of all the evidence.<P>
<b>D. EXPOSURE</b><P>
If a compound is assigned to category B, then FDA will consider the potential
exposure of people to its residues. When considering potential exposure, FDA
evaluates the proposed conditions of use of the compound in target animals and
the residue concentration under those conditions of use. <P>
<b>1. Proposed Use</b><P>
The frequency of human exposure to residues of the compound is related to the
extent of its use in food-producing animals. For example, if a large number of
food-producing animals are treated with the compound, then people would
frequently ingest its residues; conversely, if a small number of animals are
treated with the compound, then people would intermittently ingest its
residues. FDA will determine the use classification for each individual
sponsor's product from the labeling claim that has the greater potential for
human exposure to residues of the product. FDA will assign a sponsored compound
to category H or category L by the criteria described below.<P>
L - Administration on a selective basis for specific disease treatment or
prevention, for specific reproductive uses, or administration for minor uses
only.<P>
H - Administration on a non-selective basis to a herd or flock for production
improvement or prevention of common diseases.<P>
Category H includes products that claim growth promotion, improved feed
efficiency, or a increased rate of weight gain. Category H also includes
products used for prevention of common diseases as a standard practice without
waiting for the appearance of signs of disease in members of the group. This
situation may occur when disease is known to be prevalent in the particular
species, and there is a high likelihood of its occurrence. The potential for
frequent human exposure to residues of these compounds is high.<P>
Category L includes products used for treatment or prevention of specific
diseases where signs of a disease have occurred and a diagnosis has been made.
Category L will also include compounds intended for minor uses only, as defined
in 21 CFR 514.1(d)(1). The potential for frequent human exposure to residues of
these compounds is low.<P>
The following discussion provides examples of the application of the above use
categories. Coccidiosis in fowl and atrophic rhinitis in swine are common
conditions. These species often receive treatment to prevent  these conditions
in the absence of signs of disease. Accordingly, FDA would assign to category H
sponsor compounds used to prevent these conditions. FDA would also assign to
category H a sponsored compound used for the prevention of round worms in swine
because infection with round worms is a common condition in swine. However, FDA
would assign to category L an anthelmintic used for a specific worm condition
after diagnosis. Likewise, FDA would assign to category L a sponsored compound
used to treat a condition diagnosed as fowl cholera. FDA would assign to
category L a sponsored compound used to treat an individual animal diagnosed as
having signs of shipping fever or used to treat the remainder of the herd to
prevent shipping fever. Category H would not be appropriate for such a compound
because shipping fever is not a common condition that receives routine
treatment in the absence of signs of disease. FDA would assign to category L a
sponsored compound used to treat individual dairy cows showing signs of
mastitis.<P>
<b>2. Total Residue Factor</b><P>
The amount of total residue ingested in a single exposure is equal to
the amount of tissue consumed times the measured concentration of residue in
the tissue. FDA will estimate the amount of tissue consumed and calculate the
exposure as described in GUIDELINE FOR ESTABLISHING A TOLERANCE. The
concentration of residue in the tissue will usually be determined from a total
residue depletion study in target animals.<P>
Ordinarily, the sponsor performs the depletion study by administering a
radiolabeled compound to a sufficient number of previously unmedicated animals
to permit serial sacrifice of groups of animals at intervals after the last
treatment. The sponsor should use a dosing schedule consistent with the
intended use of the product. FDA will calculate the total residue factor using
the concentration of total residue in the tissue at the time the animals are
expected to be marketed as food as indicated by the label recommended
withdrawal period proposed by the sponsor, provided that the proposed
withdrawal period is consistent with normal husbandry practices and reasonably
certain to be followed in practice. If the sponsor changes the conditions of
intended use or the proposed withdrawal period, FDA will re-evaluate this
factor.<P>
In the absence of information about the composition of the total residue in the
edible tissue, FDA will assume that the entire residue is of carcinogenic
concern. However, if the sponsor submits information on the composition of the
residue, FDA will reduce the total residue factor by whatever amount has been
identified and shown not to be of carcinogenic concern. For example, a portion
of the radioactive residue may be a compound for which adequate studies have
already been conducted to show that its presence as a residue is not of
carcinogenic concern.<P>
If the total residue factor is used to decide that chronic bioassays for
carcinogenicity are not needed, the total residue factor will also establish
the maximum tolerance that can be assigned to that compound under the general
food safety requirements.<P>
<b>E. DECISION ELEMENTS</b><P>
1. After all relevant information is evaluated, FDA will ask for chronic
bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound assigned to category D or C.
However for a specific compound, if the half-life of its residues in edible
tissue is short and it is administered a long time before slaughter (for
example, several months), then FDA may not ask for chronic bioassays. Under
these circumstances, FDA can conclude that any potential risk to people will be
too low to Justify chronic testing. In reaching this conclusion, FDA will also
consider whether the proposed conditions of use are reasonably certain to be
followed in practice.<P>
2. FDA will not ask for chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound
assigned to category A.<P>
3. FDA will ask for chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound
assigned to category B if it is assigned to the high use category <i>and
</i>the total residue factor exceeds 0.25 micrograms/ kilogram body weight/day
(equivalent to a concentration of 10 parts per billion in the total diet of
people, assuming a 60 kilogram body weight and a total solid diet of 1500
grams).<P>
4. FDA will ask for chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity for a compound
assigned to category B if it is assigned to the low use category and the total
residue factor exceeds 6.25 micrograms/ kilogram body weight/day (equivalent to
a concentration of 250 parts per billion in the total diet of people).<P>
5. FDA will continue to evaluate each compound for other toxicological
endpoints under the general food safety provisions of the act. If, during that
testing, data are obtained that raise the suspicion of carcinogenicity, FDA
will apply the threshold assessment to determine if chronic bioassays for
carcinogenicity are needed.<br>

<h3> APPENDIX I </h3>
<P>
<b>CARCINOGEN STRUCTURE GUIDE</b><P>
Over the past fifty years of research in chemical carcinogenesis, it has become
apparent that the ability to induce cancer in laboratory animals and humans is
associated with the presence of certain structural features or functional
groups in molecules, and not with others. This was recognized empirically, and
for many years textbooks and monographs on the subject of carcinogenesis have
been organized according to structural classes of chemical carcinogens (1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 25). These empirical classifications helped stimulate the research
over these years which has demonstrated that reactive properties of specific
functional groups in chemical carcinogens toward critical biological targets,
either before or after host metabolism, are responsible for the initiation of
the carcinogenicity induced by these compounds. So, there has been established
a firm scientific basis that structure, and, in particular, the presence or
absence of certain functional groups, plays a dominant mechanistic role in
carcinogenesis by chemical compounds.<P>
The presence of a structural feature that is responsible for carcinogenicity in
other compounds greatly increases the probability that another compound with
the same features will also be carcinogenic. Unfortunately, there are many
little-understood subtleties in these structure-activity relationships and, in
spite of valiant attempts, structure-activity relationships or theoretical
models based on them never have been able to reliably replace experiment in
determining carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, it is sound to use the cumulative
knowledge about classes of chemical carcinogens to aid in setting priorities
for biological testing.<P>
<b>CLASSES OF CHEMICAL CARCINOGENS</b><P>
1. Aromatic Amino-, Amido-, Hydroxylamino-, Nitroso-, Azo-, Azoxy-, Nitro-<br>
(1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 22, 24)<P>

 
<P>
Typical Examples:<P>

 

2-Naphthylamine<P>

 
4-Hydroxylaminoquinoline-l-oxide<P>

 

2-Acetylaminofluorene <P>

 

4-Amino-2-nitrophenol<P>

 
4,4-Dimethylaminoazobenzene<P>

<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
Cellular metabolism is necessary for activity. The best evidence indicates that
the hydroxylamino compounds are proximate carcinogenic forms. All of the above
functional groups are related by oxidation state and can be converted to
hydroxylamines by hydolases, oxidases or reductases endogenous to most
tissues.<P>
<b>Comments: </b><P>
Aromatic nucleus, Ar-, can potentially be any type, including heterocyclic
aromatics like furan, quinoline, etc. Carcinogenic potency depends dramatically
upon the number of fused or conjugated aromatics rings. Monocyclic derivatives
usually have lower activity. Recent testing indicates that ring substitution by
alkyl, hydroxyl-, alkoxyl-, or amino- groups enhances the potential
carcinogenic activity of monocyclic aromatic nitrogen compounds. But, even
aniline has now been demonstrated to be carcinogenic (26).<P>
2. N-Nitroso- (2, 3, 10, 16, 17, 18, 22, 25)<P>

<b>Examples:</b><P>

 
N-nitrosodimethylamine<br>(DMN) <P>

 

N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine<br> 
(MNNG)<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
For N-nitrosylated secondary amines, (a), metabolic activation is necessary.
The best evidence indicates that alpha-carbon atom hydroxylation of an alkyl
group is a prerequisite to the expression of carcinogenic potential.<P>
For N-nitroso compounds derived from ureas, urethanes, carbamates, carboxylic
amides and guanidines, (b), direct action without prior metabolism is the most
likely mode of action.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
There is a relatively high correlation between the presence of a N-nitroso
moiety and the capability of a compound to induce cancer. There may be
exceptions due to structural prevention of metabolic activation. But these are
likely to be few in number. All N-nitroso compounds should be viewed with
extreme suspicion.<P>
<b>3. 0rganohalogens</b> 
<P>
a. Mustards (6, 15, 22)<p>
                                                               
b. Di-to poly-halogenated alkanes and cycloalkanes (6, 12, 20, 22, 25)<P>
 
c. Alpha-halogenated ethers (6, 16, 22)<P>
 
d. Halogenated alkenes (6, 13, 20, 22, 25)<P>

 
<P>
e. Polyhalogenated aromatics (19, 22)<P>
 
 
<b>Typical Examples:</b><P>
 
 
Di(2-chloroethyl)methlamine<P>

 

Carbon Tetrachloride<P>

Mirex  <P>

 

1,2-Dibromoethane<P>

 

Bis(2-chloromethyl)ether<P>

 

Vinyl chloride<P>

e. Polychlorinated Biphenyls<P>

<b>Mechanism:</b><P>

Mustards, haloethers and some haloalkanes are alkylating agents. They are
thought to be direct acting carcinogens and not need any metabolic alteration
for activity. The mechanisms of action for other subclasses of organohalogens
have not been well studied. Enzymic epoxidation has been suggested as required
for chlorinated alkenes and free radical pathways have been postulated for
1,1,1 trihaloalkanes<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
This is a very diverse group of compounds. Prediction of carcinogenic activity
is made difficult by the lack of knowledge of metabolism and mechanism of
action of some of these compounds.<P>
<B>4. Hydrazo-(Hydrazines), Azoxy-, and Azo- (2, 10, 16, 22)</B><P>
 
<b>Typical Examples:</b> 
<P>
 

1-methyl-2-benzylhydrazine<P>

 

Azoethane<P>

 

Elaiomycin<P>

<b>Mechanisms:</b><P>
Metabolic activation is considered to be necessary. The best evidence indicates
that N-hydroxylation and further metabolic oxidations are prerequisite for
activity.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
This class of compounds, particularly the hydrazines, has many members which
are carcinogenic. The presence of these substructural moieties gives a compound
a high possibility of carcinogenic activity.<P>
<b>5. Alkyl (Aryl) Sulfates, Sulfonates, and Sultones (1, 2, 6, 13, 16,
22)</b><P>
     
<b>Specific Examples:</b><P>
 
Diethylsulfate<P>
 
1,3 propanesultone<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
Classic alkylating agents. These are direct acting carcinogens requiring no
prior metabolism.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
Carcinogenic activity is greater for gamma-sultones than delta-sultones,
presumably due to more strain, and hence, higher reactivity of the 5-membered
ring compounds.<P>
<b>6. Strained Ring Heterocycles</b><P>
a. Epoxides (1, 2, 6, 21, 22, 25)<P>
b. Aziridines (1, 2, 6, 15, 22)<P>
c. Beta-Lactones (1, 2, 6, 16, 21, 22)<P>
<b>Typical Examples:</b><P>
 
Glycidaldehye<P>
 
Aziridine Ethanol<P>
 
beta-Butyrolactone<P>
<b>7. Fused Polynuclear Aromatic (1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 22, 25)</b><P>
 
Examples:<P>
 
7,12 Dimethylbenz (a) anthracene<P>
 
4, 11-Diazadibenzo(b, d, e, f) chrysene<P>
 
7H-dibenzo (c, g) carbazole<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
The best evidence indicates that these aromatic compounds require metabolism
for activity. Epoxidation of aromatic ring double bonds is the best candidate
for the metabolic pathway leading to ultimate carcinogenic forms.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
Structure-activity is very subtle in this group of compounds. Even slight
changes in structure can dramatically change carcinogenic potency. In spite of
many years of study no simple reliable models of prediction are available. Any
compound that contains three or more fused aromatic rings must be considered
suspect, including those with nitrogen and even sulfur containing heterocyclic
aromatic residues. Compounds based on the phenanthrene substructure are more
often carcinogenic than those containing the linear anthracene moiety. The fact
that quinoline has been reported to be carcinogenic, and several derivatives
mutagenic, suggest that two fused rings are enough to produce an active
compound if N-heterocyclic aromatic rings are involved. Recent epidemiological
data indicate that benzene is carcinogenic to humans.<P>
<b>8. Aryldialkyltriazenes (10, 22, 27)</b><P>
 
<b>Example:</b><P>
 
1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -3,3-dimethyltriazine<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
Both non-metabolic and metabolic pathways have been proposed for the critical
reactions responsible for inducing cancer.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
The Ar- can be either substituted phenyl or pyridine rings. Other aromatics may
also be active.<P>
<b>9. Purine and Pyrimidine Analogues (5, 8)</b><P>
 
Putine N-Oxides<br>
or N-Hydroxides<P>
 
Substituted Pyrimidines<P>
Examples:<P>
 
Xanthine-3-oxide<P>
 
1-Beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine<P>
<b>Mechanism:</b><P>
The purine-N-oxides are tautomeric forms of N-hydroxypurines. These
hydroxylamines are thought to act similarly to other aromatic hydroxylamines.
The mechanism of action of carcinogenic pyrimidine analogs is unknown. Most
speculation about their activity centers around their ability to inhibit
pyrimidine metabolism or perturb template function.<P>
<b>Comments:</b><P>
The highest potency analogs are the purine-3-oxides. Some purine-l-oxides are
also active, but to lesser degrees.<P>
<b>10. Thioamides (1, 2, 13, 22)</b><P>

Thioacetamide<P>

<b>APPENDIX 2</b><P>
A high positive correlation has been observed between the results of point
mutational and DNA repair tests with bioassays for carcinogenicity.
Unfortunately, negative test data in the mutagenicity assays do not correlate
as well. However, positive data from the less time consuming and less expensive
short-term tests are considered useful for determining the use of resources for
bioassays for carcinogenicity. The threshold assessment will use short-term
test data for this purpose. The following provides guidance to the types of
tests and acceptable protocols to be found in the literature as well as
considerations to be used by FDA in evaluating submitted test data.<P>
Many of the short-term tests that may be considered as screens for
carcinogenicity are, in fact, tests for mutagenicity. While the hypothesis that
the initiation of tumor growth results from mutations in somatic cells is a
reasonable one, the validity of using mutagenic tests as screens for
carcinogenicity does not depend upon the validity of this hypothesis. The fact
that most known carcinogens are mutagenic in at least some test systems and
that most mutagens that have been adequately tested are carcinogenic provides
the primary rationale for the inclusion of mutagenicity tests in the battery of
screening tests for carcinogenicity.<P>
The full mutagenic potential of a chemical is unlikely to be assessed in any
single test for either technical or design reasons. Therefore, the information
from a battery of short-term tests is required to evaluate as fully as possible
the mutagenic activity of a chemical. An ideal battery would contain tests that
would provide not only corroboration but also complementation so that all
classes of carcinogens would be detected. However, as yet there are
insufficient data both from the short-term tests and the rodent bioassay tests
to select such a battery with a high degree of confidence.<P>
FDA has considered a number of types of short-term tests that have been
developed and proposed for use as predictors of carcinogenicity. The criteria
used for recommending a particular assay include: (1) correlations of results
with known carcinogens and non-carcinogens; (2) reproducibility of results,
both within a laboratory and between laboratories; (3) relative ease of scoring
and interpreting test responses; and (4) availability or potential availability
of laboratory capability for performing the test.<P>
The battery of short-term tests generally recommended includes: (1) a bacterial
gene mutation assay, the Ames Salmonella assay is suggested; (2) a mammalian
cell gene mutation assay, the most widely employed are the L5178Y thymidine
kinase system and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) HGPRT assay, and, to a lesser
extent, the Chinese hamster lung cell (V79) HGPRT assay; and (3) a generalized
assay for DNA repair (unscheduled DNA synthesis, UDS) in mammalian cells, the
UDS rat hepatocyte system is suggested. There is evidence that some carcinogens
do not yield a positive response in a particular short-term test. Therefore,
when a compound is of a structural class for which there is reason to believe
that a particular short-term test is inadequate as a screen for
carcinogenicity, its use will not be accepted to reduce the concern for
carcinogenicity.<P>
The sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila is considered a suitable
alternative gene mutation test when circumstances preclude the use of either of
the above mentioned gene mutation assays. An example of such a situation is
when an antimicrobial or antifungal animal drug possesses such extreme toxicity
in the Ames test as to preclude the use of sufficiently high doses for negative
results in bacterial tests to be considered significant. Other tests or
batteries of tests, may be acceptable as supporting evidence to reduce the
potential carcinogenicity factor of the threshold assessment. Such
substitutions will be evaluated according to the criteria listed earlier in
this guideline. Sponsors are advised to consult with FDA prior to performing
the studies.<P>
In general, reproducible data indicating that a sponsored compound is positive
in one of the tests in the battery will result in a requirement for
carcinogenicity testing. Factors such as dosage, metabolism, test sensitivity
and reproducibility will be considered in FDA's evaluation of data submitted.
It is recommended that original data be included in all submissions.<P>
Bacterial mutagenicity tests are suggested because there is an extensive data
base on the correlation between results in such tests and carcinogenicity as
determined by long-term animal studies (McCann et at., 1975; McCann and Ames,
1976; Sugimura et al., 1976). These data indicate that mutagenicity in bacteria
is a generally reliable indication that a chemical is likely to be
carcinogenic. It appears, however, that there are chemical classes of
carcinogens that fail to be detected as mutagens in bacterial and other
mutational assays. In some instances the problems may be overcome by a change
in protocol (Prival et al., 1979).<P>
Although the published data for tests in mammalian cells and Drosophila are not
as extensive as those for bacterial mutagenicity tests, current indications are
that these tests are useful as carcinogenicity screens. The most widely used
test for gene mutations in cultured mammalian cells is probably the L5178Y
mouse lymphoma assay which measures mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK)
locus (Clive and Spector, 1975; Clive et el., 1979; Amacher et al., 1979,
1980). Two others assays for which the data bases are rapidly growing are
Chinese hamster CHO (O'Neill et al., 1979) and V79 (Chu and Mulling, 1968;
Huberman and Sachs, 1976). The marker commonly used in these assays is
resistance to 6-thioguanine which arises from a loss of the
hypoxanthine-guanine ribosyl transferase (HGPRT) activity.<P>
Drosophila is one of the most extensively studied species from a genetic
viewpoint and the sex-linked recessive lethal test is clearly the oldest assay
for detecting mutations. Correlative studies for oncogenic potential of sixty
chemicals have demonstrated that this assay has a high degree of detection
capability both for direct acting carcinogens and procarcinogens (Vogel, 1975,
1977; Sobels, 1974; Wurgler et al., 1977).<P>
A variety of techniques have been employed to measure DNA repair or unscheduled
DNA synthesis either by radioautography (Painter and Cleaver, 1969) or by
liquid scintillation counting (Stich and San, 1970). Only with radioautography
is it possible to unequivocally distinguish repair synthesis from replicative
synthesis and is, therefore, the preferred technique. Many types of cell lines
can be employed. However, their use  requires that replicative DNA synthesis be
inhibited by hydroxyurea treatment or arginine deprivation. Since the metabolic
capabilities of these cell lines are limited, the addition of an exogenous
system for metabolic activation is required for the assay to be valid. Both of
these problems are overcome in the UDS assay using primary rat hepatocytes
(Williams, 1976, 1977). The freshly isolated nondividing liver cells that are
used have the capacity to activate procarcinogens. The data base for this assay
is growing rapidly and its sensitivity and reliability are becoming well
documented (Williams, 1980; Probst et al., 1981).<P>
All tests used in this battery should be conducted with and without a
demonstrated metabolic activation system. While the cell systems used in
short-term tests do not possess the full metabolic capabilities of whole
animals, the incorporation of liver enzyme systems is considered the most
reliable means for overcoming this limitation for routine evaluation of
chemicals. Some test systems (Drosophila, rat hepatocyte) have these enzyme
systems; for others, the addition of an exogenous enzyme system is necessary.
The most commonly used exogenous enzyme system is that obtained using a 9,000 g
supernatant (S9) of a rat liver homogenate. Other approaches such as the
incorporation of cell feeder layers into the assay system have also been
successfully used.<P>
Due to continuing advances being made in the development of reliable short-term
tests, it is difficult to select precise protocols that would be most highly
recommended for each type of test. Among the references cited, the following
contain useful considerations:  <P>

program. Additional papers on other assay systems will be published in Mutation
Research. These reports are useful not only for their content but also for
their extensive lists of references.<P>

<html><head> <title>Poisonous Plants and Your Pets</title></head><body><b>POISONOUS
PLANTS AND YOUR PETS</b><P>
Poisonous plants of some variety are indigenous to most places in the United
States.  Poisonous plants also are commonly kept as houseplants or used to
landscape properties.  Luckily, most  pets are exposed to only a limited number
of poisonous plants and problems can be prevented by avoiding these plants.<P>
Always ask at the nursery if the plants you are considering buying would be
toxic if eaten by your dog or cat.  If the employees cannot answer your
questions, don't purchase the plant.  Other sources of information in your area
are your local veterinarian, your county extension officer, the local library
or bookstore, and your poison control center.<P>
If you take your pets on nature walks, a plant identification book small enough
to carry with you can be invaluable.  Most cases of plant poisoning can only be
diagnosed by identifying the plants eaten.  This is done by examining the
remains of partially eaten plants or by examining stomach contents.  Plant
poisons can act rapidly with some causing convulsions and death in as little as
15 minutes.  There is no universal antidote for plant poisonings, so rapid
identification and prompt veterinary medical treatment is always indicated.
<P>
The following is a list of commonly encountered poisonous plants:<P>
<b>House Plants</b><P>
	Dumb Cane<br>
	Casto bean plants<br>
	Mistletoe<br>
	Poinsettia<br>
	Cut-leaf Philodendron<br>
	Japanese Yew<P>
<b>Landscaping Plants</b><P>
	Azalea<br>
	Rhododendron<br>
	Tulip<br>
	Iris<br>
	Amaryllis<br>
	English Ivy<P>
<b>Wild Plants</b><P>
	Poison Ivy<br>
	Poison Oak<br>
	Poison Sumac<br>
	Death Cap (wild mushroom)<br>
	Destroying Angel (wild mushroom)<br>
	Climbing Nightshade<P>
<b>Illicit Drug Plants</b><P>
	Marijuana<br>
	Hemp<br>
	Hashish<br>
	Peyote<P>
You should be able to recognize poisonous plants at various stages of growth
and to identify which portion or portions of the plants are toxic.  Plant
identification books that include color pictures are more helpful than those
that contain only written descriptions or black and white pictures or drawings.
Provide your pet with safe plants such as lettuce, tomatoes, green beans, or
carrots to eat; this should decrease the consumption of undesirable plants.
Walk pets on a leash and observe them carefully to prevent consumption of wild
unidentified plants.  Finally, landscape your yard with pet safe flowers and
shrubs.  Your dog or cat will be safer if you prevent plant poisonings rather
than try to treat them.<P>

<p>
Docket No. #92D-0039<br>
<p>
OBJECTIVE:<p>
CVM believes that data and information contained in chemistry/manufacturing
submissions in ANADA's for evaluation of generic pharmaceutical dosage forms
should be consistent as appropriate with the information being used by the
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) for the evaluation of
abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's). This consistency will help ensure
that marketed generic veterinary pharmaceutical dosage forms meet the same
criteria of quality, strength and purity as similar human dosage forms; that
FDA can harmonize the review process for veterinary and human pharmaceutical
dosage forms; and that FDA district offices can apply the same interpretation
of CGMP's to both veterinary and human pharmaceutical dosage form drug
products.<p>
There are a number of differences in the type and extent of data necessary for
ANADA's and NADA's. For this reason, and to provide consistent recommendations
for the different types of submissions, the guidelines describe not only the
manufacturing data and information necessary for ANADA's and supplemental
ANADA's, but also data and information to support the manufacturing and
chemistry sections of NADA's and supplemental NADA's.<p>
These guidelines apply only to pharmaceutical dosage forms (tablets, capsules,
ointments, creams, implants, parenterals, etc.). Medicated Articles will be
addressed in separate guidelines.<p>
Guidelines are presented to cover the following areas:<p>
I. Pilot Batch Manufacture<p>
II. Tentative Expiration Dates<p>
III. Manufacturing Sites<p>
IV. New Animal Drug Substance Sources<p>
These guidelines are not intended to be individual stand-alone documents. Much
of the information presented in one guideline may be equally important to the
correct interpretation of the other guidelines. Therefore, all four guidelines
are being issued concurrently.<p>

Guidelines state procedures or practices that may be useful to the persons to
whom they are directed, but are not legal requirements. Guidelines represent
the agency's position on a procedure or a practice at the time of their
issuance. A person may follow the guidelines or may choose to follow alternate
procedures. If a person chooses to use alternate procedures, that person may
wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of
money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable
to FDA. A guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer
any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. Where a guideline
states a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, the requirement is law
and its force and effect are not changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion
in the guideline.<p>
Interested persons may submit written comments on these guidelines to the
Dockets Management Branch (address below). Comments will be considered in
evaluating the need to amend the guidelines. Comments are available for public
examination between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the Dockets
Management Branch.<p>

<H3><A Name="Rtftoc2">A.Introduction:</a></h3>

The information included in this document is intended to provide guidance for
the submission of appropriate manufacturing data and information to support the
approval of NADA's, ANADA's, and their supplements. This guideline deals with
the minimal acceptable batch size, the number of batches, and the batch
manufacturing process.<p>
Since changes in production methods and batch size are known to have the
potential to affect a product's bioavailability and stability, the Center has
concluded that there needs to be a guideline on batch size and production
conditions of test batches. Previously, sponsors have sometimes developed data
to support applications using pilot batches that are significantly smaller than
the proposed production batch size. Subsequently, these initial pilot batch
sizes are scaled-up. As part of this scale-up, both quantitative and
qualitative changes in the excipients included in the formulation are sometimes
necessary along with changes in the equipment to manufacture the
commercial-size batches. These manufacturing changes may raise questions
regarding the bioavailability and stability profile of the drug products made
in the production batches when compared with the pilot batch of drug product
used for the pivotal target animal studies.<p>

This document addresses the relationship between the size of pre-approval test
batches and production batches. Also included in this document are
recommendations for post-approval demonstration batch size to support requests
for the approval of alternate manufacturing sites and alternate sources of new
animal drug substance. The batch sizes recommended in this document may be used
to support an NADA, ANADA, or their supplements and not cause significant
concern regarding differences in bioavailability or stability between the test
batch and production batch.<p>

It is necessary for applicants to understand what is meant by a "batch".
According to 21 CFR 210.3(b)(2):<p>

"Batch" means a specific quantity of a drug or other material that is intended
to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits, and is produced
according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of
manufacture.<p>

In this document, the terms pilot batch, test batch and demonstration batch are
interchangeable.<p>
<p>
Validated, full production batches are the standard for fulfilling current good
manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. However, the Center recognizes that
this is not a practicable situation to use full production batches to support
pending applications.
<p>
For sterile and nonsterile drug products, validation and documentation of the
manufacture of complete production batches of actual product generally takes
place after approval of an NADA or ANADA, but must be completed prior to
marketing the drug product. Validation of the efficacy of a sterilization
process, however, is necessary prior to approval of NADA's and ANADA's.
Validation of a sterilization process, in most cases, is not dependent on the
manufacture of production batches of actual product. Whether drug products are
sterilized by terminal sterilization, or whether parts of the drug product are
independently sterilized and aseptically assembled (e.g. aseptic fill),
manufacture of actual production batches of product is not usually necessary to
scientifically validate the efficacy of the sterilization process(es).
Validation of a sterilization process, as distinguished from total
manufacturing process validation, may therefore be carried out independently of
the manufacture of production batches of actual drug product.

<h3><a name="RTFToC3">B.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NADA's AND ANADA's:</a></h3>

<h3><a name="RTFToC4">1.GENERAL:</a></h3>

The following batch recommendations apply to the manufacture of new animal drug
and abbreviated new animal drug pharmaceutical dosage form products:<p>
NADA's - A total of three test batches of drug product should be
manufactured.<p>
ANADA's - One test batch of drug product should be manufactured.<p>
The test batch is the source from which finished dosage materials should be
taken for use in the following:<p>
a. Pivotal Target Animal Studies<p>

1.) Clinical/bioequivalence studies.<p>

2.) Residue depletion (withdrawal time) studies.<p>

3.) Target animal safety studies.<p>

b. Stability studies to support the proposed expiration dating period.<p>

c. Samples submitted to FDA laboratories for methods validation.<p>

d. Sample retention.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC5">2.BATCH SIZE:</a></h3>
<p>
Test batches should ordinarily be a minimum of 10 percent of the largest
proposed production batch size. This applies to antibiotic and non-antibiotic
dosage forms and includes tablets, capsules, ointments, creams, implants, etc..
True solutions may ordinarily be manufactured in pilot batch sizes smaller than
10 percent of the largest proposed production batch size. In these instances,
we recommend a protocol be submitted.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC6">3.EQUIPMENT AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES:</a></h3>
<p>
The test batch should be produced using comparable equipment (similar operating
principles) to the production equipment proposed in the application. The
equipment used to manufacture the test batch may have a different (smaller)
capacity than the equipment used for the manufacture of a production lot. The
production equipment proposed to be used to produce larger scale production
batches must be identified and described in the application. If different
pieces of equipment were used to produce the test lot than are to be used to
produce the full production lot, then a rationale of how the pieces of
equipment are believed to be comparable should be developed. This information
will normally be assessed by the FDA field investigational staff. In instances
where changes in equipment are determined to significantly impact on the
process used for the manufacture of the pilot lots, additional bridging data
may be requested by the Center.<p>

The equipment should be operated by individuals qualified by training and
experience who otherwise meet the firms standards for personnel qualified to
produce marketed pharmaceutical products in full compliance with CGMP's. The
standard operating procedures (SOP's) and controls, formulation and
manufacturing procedures used on the test batch should be comparable to those
used for the full-scale production batches.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC7">4.PRODUCTION FACILITY:</a></h3>
<p>
The test batch should be manufactured at the proposed production facility when
possible. The facility must be in compliance with CGMP's. When there is a
change in facilities between that used for the test batch and that proposed for
the manufacture of production lots an assessment will be made to determine if
the processes differ significantly. This assessment will normally be performed
by the FDA field investigational staff. In instances where the processes are
determined to differ significantly additional bridging data may be requested by
the Center. <p>

A non-GMP pilot plant or development laboratory facility should not be used for
production of the test batch. These facilities may be used in formulation
development work or other developmental activities leading up to production of
the test batch.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC8">5.SCALE-UP:</a></h3>
<p>
There should not be any significant changes in the SOP's, controls, and
formulation between the test batch and the maximum production batch except: 1)
to use larger amounts of each ingredient which are proportional to the test
batch, 2) to add the ingredients by automated or mechanical equipment, 3) to
adjust mixing and operating speed and times based upon operating
recommendations for the size of equipment and appropriate quality controls, or
4) to use alternative equipment of comparable operating principles but of
different capacity. Any significant changes should be explained and
justified.<p>

It remains the responsibility of the sponsor to ensure that any scale up does
not result in a material change in the method of manufacture. One or more
increases in batch size that do not cumulatively result in a proposed
production batch size exceeding ten-times the size of the test batch will
ordinarily be acceptable to the Center. It is the responsibility of the sponsor
to validate the change in batch size. The sponsor must also report the batch
size change in the next DER.<p>

Following approval, a sponsor wishing to increase a batch size beyond the
maximum allowable batch size covered in the application (ie., ten-times the
size of the test batch) must submit a supplement.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC9">6.BRIDGING DATA:</a></h3>
<p>
The Center recognizes that the manufacture of full scale production batches to
meet filing requirements may be impractical. Therefore, the Center has
generally taken the approach that pilot batch sizes meeting the recommendations
specified above are generally satisfactory. There are, however, some instances
where the recommendations for batch size, production facility, equipment and
standard operating procedures described above may not be practicable. In these
cases, sponsors may create an alternative plan to demonstrate that the test
batches possess bioavailability and stability characteristics comparable to
production batches. This plan should be discussed with the Center prior to
implementation. For example, if a sponsor does not meet the batch size
recommendation, or if the sponsor makes a significant change in SOP's,
controls, or formulation between the test batch and production batch; then, the
sponsor may provide information (bridging data) to support that the scale up
process or the significant change did not impact the products bioavailability
or stability. In some cases this may require a bioequivalence bridging study.
However, in many cases other data (i.e., dissolution studies, accelerated
stability data, etc.) may be deemed adequate to support the change.<p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC10">C.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL NADA's AND ANADA's:</a></h3>
<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC11">1.GENERAL:</a></h3><p>
The batch size recommendations in this section apply to the approval of an
alternate manufacturing site and alternate source of the new animal drug
substance. These changes must be submitted in a supplement to an approved
application.<p>

One test batch of drug product should be manufactured to support alternate
manufacturing sites and alternate sources of new animal drug substance.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC12">2.BATCH SIZE:</a></h3>
<p>
Test batches should ordinarily be a minimum of 10 percent of the largest
proposed production batch size. This applies to antibiotic and non-antibiotic
dosage forms and includes tablets, capsules, ointments, creams, parenterals,
implants, etc..<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC13">3.EQUIPMENT AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES:</a></h3>
<p>
The test batch should be produced using production equipment specified in the
application for the production of the marketed lot at the proposed production
facility. <p>

The equipment should be operated by individuals qualified by training and
experience who otherwise meet the firm's standards for personnel qualified to
produce marketed pharmaceutical products in full compliance with CGMP's.
Comparable standard operating procedures and controls as well as comparable
formulation and manufacturing procedures should be used on the test batch and
on the full-scale production batches. <p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC14">4.SCALE-UP:</a></h3>
<p>
There should not be any significant changes in the SOP's, controls, and
formulation between the test batch and the maximum production batch except: 1)
to use larger amounts of each ingredient which are proportional to the test
batch, 2) to add the ingredients by automated or mechanical equipment, or 3) to
adjust mixing and operating speed and times based upon operating
recommendations for the size of equipment and appropriate quality controls. Any
significant change should be explained and justified.<p>
<p>
It remains the responsibility of the sponsor to ensure that any scale up does
not result in a material change in the method of manufacture.<p>

CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE
<h3><a name="RTFToC16">A.INTRODUCTION:</a></h3>
 <p>

Guidance for establishing a suitable tentative expiration date for NADA's is
contained in the current issue of the Center for Veterinary Medicine's Drug
Stability Guidelines. This document supplements the guidelines. It is intended
to provide guidance for the submission to abbreviated new animal drug
applications of appropriate data and information to support the assignment of
tentative expiration dating periods. In addition, this guideline contains
recommendations for extending tentative expiration dating periods. <p>

The information in this document is applicable to the request for a tentative
expiration date for a drug product manufactured at an alternate site (NADA's
and ANADA's) when supported by three month accelerated stability data.
Ordinarily, the expiration dating established in the application will apply to
all manufacturing sites for that drug product. <p>
 
The design of the stability study is intended to establish, based on testing a
batch of drug product, a tentative expiration dating period applicable to
future batches of the drug product manufactured under similar circumstances.
The test batch should, therefore, be representative in all respects (e.g.,
formulation, container-closure system, manufacturing process, source and
quality of bulk material) to the production batches (refer to I.B. and I.C.) of
that drug product and should conform to all product specifications. <p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC17">B.DEFINITIONS:</a></h3>
 <p>

<u>Accelerated Testing</u>: Testing designed to increase the rate of chemical
or physical degradation of a drug product by using exaggerated storage
conditions.  <p>

<u>Exaggerated Storage Conditions</u>: These conditions include 37 -
40<sup>o</sup> C and 75% relative humidity for dosage forms proposed for
controlled room temperature storage, and 25<sup>o</sup> C and ambient humidity
for the dosage forms proposed for refrigerated storage. Non-isothermal and
higher temperature studies may also be utilized where advisable. <p>

<u>Expiration Dating Period</u>: The interval that a drug product is expected
to remain within the approved registration specifications, in the proposed
market container, following the date of manufacture. The expiration dating
period is used to establish the expiration date of individual batches.  <p>

<u>Tentative Expiration Dating Period</u>: A provisional expiration dating
period determined by projecting results from less than full-term data (such as,
accelerated studies) using the drug product stored in the proposed
container/closure system. <p>

<u>Primary Stability Data</u>: Data on the product stored in the proposed
container-closure for marketing under storage conditions that support the
proposed tentative expiration date, as well as data produced post-approval
during on-going stability studies. <p>

<u>Supportive Stability Data</u>: Data other than primary stability data, e.g.,
data on investigational formulations not proposed for marketing, references to
other submissions on file with the agency with appropriate letters of
authorization. Supportive stability data may include data for an identical
product approved and manufactured in a foreign country. <p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC18">C.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ESTABLISHING A TENTATIVE 
EXPIRATION DATE FOR ANADA's:</a></h3>
 <p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC19">1.GENERAL:</a></h3>
 <p>
Primary stability data for ANADA products should be generated on a drug product
batch which meets batch size requirements (refer to I. B.). <p>
 <p>
Tentative expiration dates based on three month accelerated (exaggerated)
stability data will normally be assigned to generic animal drug pharmaceutical
dosage forms. This reduced requirement for obtaining tentative expiration
dating periods for generic animal drugs is possible since the stability profile
of the new animal drug substance and pioneer drug product are known to CVM.
 <p>
The proposed generic product will not be assigned the same expiration dating
period as the pioneer product on the basis of three month accelerated stability
data. <p>

Accelerated stability testing and long-term room temperature stability testing
should be initiated at the time of manufacture of the pilot lot. This lot
should be the same batch of drug product on which bioequivalence studies are
conducted. Long-term room temperature stability testing should be conducted as
recommended in the CVM Drug Stability Guidelines. In the absence of full-term
stability data for the drug product, adequate accelerated stability data will
be acceptable to establish a tentative expiration dating period. <p>

Accelerated stability data should be generated at initial, 1, 2, and 3 month
test stations. Under certain circumstances, accelerated stability data may be
inadequate to support an expiration date. An example of this might be for
dosage forms not previously marketed (e.g., those for which FDA approved a
suitability petition). Under these circumstances, full term stability data may
be required to support the labeled storage conditions. Likewise, generic copies
of pioneer products that have a demonstrated history of stability-related
problems may be required to place additional pilot lots into the stability
program and/or provide extended stability data to support a tentative
expiration date. <p>

A maximum twenty-four month tentative expiration dating period will be
considered for generic animal drug pharmaceutical dosage forms submitted with
satisfactory 3 month accelerated stability data. These tentative expiration
dating periods should also be supported by the results of the long-term room
temperature stability testing. The results of long-term stability testing
should continue to be submitted throughout the review of the ANADA.  <p>

An expiration date longer than twenty-four months may be proposed. However,
requests for expiration dates which are longer than twenty-four months should
be supported by additional primary stability data similar to that necessary to
support proposed expiration dates for NADA submissions. These data are
described in the CVM Drug Stability Guidelines and may include one-year
accelerated stability data and shelf-life data approximating the proposed
expiration date for three batches of drug product. <p>

A written stability program, stability commitments, and specific stability
testing should be provided. These recommendations are the same for new animal
drug applications and abbreviated new animal drug applications. The current
issue of the Center for Veterinary Medicine's Drug Stability Guidelines should
be referred to for further guidance. <p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC20">2.EXPIRATION DATE EXTENSION:</a></h3>
 <p>
All requests for the extension of a tentative expiration date for an NADA and
ANADA should be supported by a minimum of three production size batches
manufactured post-approval and meet the data recommendations described in the
CVM Drug Stability Guidelines. <p>

Statistical evaluation of these data should be performed as recommended
below. <p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC21">3.STATISTICAL EVALUATION:</a></h3>
<p>
Statistical evaluation data should be provided for both the accelerated
and long-term room temperature stability studies on the demonstration batches
of drug product (NADA and ANADA).<p>

When establishing the tentative expiration dating period for a drug
product (NADA or ANADA), supporting data are obtained from the observed pattern
of degradation for the quantitative drug product characteristic under study
(e.g., strength, percent of label claim).<p>

An acceptable approach for drug characteristics that are expected to decrease
with time is to determine the time at which the 95% one-sided lower confidence
limit for the mean degradation curve intersects the acceptable lower
specification (e.g., strength) limit. If this approach is used, there is a 95%
confidence that the average drug product characteristic (e.g., strength) will
remain within specifications up to the end of the tentative expiration period.
It is not acceptable to determine the allowable expiration dating period by
determining where the fitted least-square line intersects the appropriate
specification limit. This approach is as likely to overestimate the expiration
dating period as to underestimate it, and only provides a 50% confidence that
the product characteristic will remain within specification at the tentative
expiration date.<p>

The accelerated data from a generic product will be compared with the
degradation profile of the pioneer (on file with the Center). Alternatively,
the applicant may wish to provide accelerated stability data for both the
pioneer and proposed generic product. The accelerated stability data for the
generic product should have a profile similar to that observed for the pioneer
product. Furthermore, the long-term stability data, when appropriately
analysed, should also support the tentative expiration date.<p>

There may be cases where the data show so little degradation and variability
that it is readily apparent that the tentative expiration dating period can be
confirmed. Under these circumstances, it would not be necessary to go through
formal calculations. However, this case is the exception rather than the rule,
and the final judgment on whether the calculations are necessary lies with the
Center. Therefore, it is recommended that the analysis be carried out routinely
and that the newest long-term stability data for the pilot batch be submitted
throughout the review process.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC23">A.INTRODUCTION:</a></h3>
<p>

The information included in this document is intended to provide guidance for
the submission of appropriate data and information to support the approval of
primary and alternate manufacturing sites in NADA's, ANADA's, and their
supplements. <p>

Sponsors may propose alternate manufacturing sites in their NADA or ANADA
submissions. However, it is suggested that a single (primary) manufacturing
site be proposed in the original application and that additional alternate
manufacturing sites be provided for through the supplemental approval process.
<p>

The data and information needed for primary and alternate manufacturing
facilities that meet the criteria of a new manufacturing site, as defined
below, will be more than for a facility where the same dosage forms as the
proposed drug are already being manufactured. For example, it may be necessary
to place additional pilot lots into the stability program and/or provide
extended stability data to support the proposed expiration date.<p>

All proposed manufacturing facilities in an application should be identified as
primary (NADA's and ANADA's) or alternate (NADA's, ANADA's, supplemental NADA's
and ANADA's) manufacturing sites. Additionally, a proposed primary or alternate
facility should be identified as a new manufacturing site, as defined below; or
as a facility where the manufacture of the same dosage form as the proposed
drug is already being performed.<p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC24">B.DEFINITIONS:</a></h3>
<p>

<u>Primary Manufacturing Site</u>: The primary manufacturing site is the
facility designated for the manufacture of the product in the original
application. <p>

<u>Alternate Manufacturing Site</u>: The alternate manufacturing site is an
additional facility designated for the manufacture of the drug product. An
alternate manufacturing site may be designated in an original submission or may
be proposed as an additional facility/facilities after approval of the original
application.<p>

<u>New Manufacturing Site</u>: A new manufacturing site is a facility where the
manufacturer has no experience with the same dosage form or process for the
manufacture of the product <p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC25">C. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SUBMISSION OF APPROPRIATE DATA 
AND INFORMATION:</a></h3>
<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC26">1.TEST BATCH:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="RTFToC27">a.NADA's:</a></h4>
<p>
A total of three batches of drug product (refer to I.B.) should be manufactured
for NADA's. The test batches should be manufactured at the proposed production
facility when possible. Alternatively, the pilot batches may be manufactured at
either the sponsors clinical supplies facility or at a facility under contract
to the sponsor. The facility must be in compliance with CGMP's. When there is a
change in facility between that used for the test batch and that proposed for
the manufacture of production lots an assessment will be made to determine if
the processes differ significantly. This assessment will normally be performed
by the FDA field investigational staff. In instances where the processes are
determined to differ significantly additional bridging studies may be requested
by the Center.<p>
 
If the sponsor manufactures the pilot lots at the proposed production
facilities, then, at least two of the batches should be manufactured at the
primary facility. The third batch may be manufactured at a proposed alternate
site. With the exception of true solutions, each additional alternate facility
should manufacture a batch of drug product.<p>

A completed batch record should be provided. Additional batch records
may be requested.<p>


<h4><a name="RTFToC28">b.ANADA's, Supplemental NADA's and ANADA's </a>
<a name="fn1back">Footnote/</a><a href="admguide.html#fn1">1</a></h4>

<p>
A completed batch record for one batch of drug product meeting minimum batch
size requirements, manufactured under production conditions, in the primary
facility (ANADA's) and each alternate facility (ANADA's, supplemental NADA's
and ANADA's) should be provided. Ordinarily, for true solutions it will not be
necessary to manufacture batches at each alternate facility.<p>

In the case where approval is sought for multiple strengths of a product to be
manufactured at an alternate site, and where at least one batch of product has
previously been prepared in support of each strength at the primary site, then
only one batch of one strength needs to be made at the alternate manufacturing
site. This batch should be prepared for the same strength product as would be
used in the bioequivalence study.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC29">2.STABILITY DATA:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="RTFToC30">a.NADA's:</a></h4>
<p>
Stability data obtained in accordance with the current issue of the Center for
Veterinary Medicine's Drug Stability Guidelines should be included in the new
animal drug application. <p>

<h4><a name="RTFToC31">b.ANADA's, Supplemental NADA's and ANADA's:</a></h4>
<p>
Three month accelerated (37 - 40deg.C, 75% RH) stability data is recommended
for the batch manufactured at the primary (ANADA's) and alternate facility
(ANADA's, supplemental NADA's and ANADA's). <p>

The stability data should be generated on product stored in the market
container and should include all appropriate testing as specified in the NADA
or ANADA. Accelerated stability data will ordinarily not be requested for the
manufacture of true solutions at alternate facilities. Rather, a commitment to
place the first three production batches at the alternate facility into the
approved stability program will generally be acceptable.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC32">3.VALIDATION OF STERILIZATION PROCESSES:</a></h3>
<p>
Information and data in support of the efficacy of sterilization processes will
be necessary for the primary manufacturing facility (NADA's and ANADA's) and
alternate manufacturing facility (NADA's, ANADA's, supplemental NADA's and
ANADA's). Validation of sterilization processes should be completed at each
manufacturing site prior to the approval of the application.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC33">4.DISSOLUTION DATA:</a></h3>
<p>
Comparative dissolution data should be submitted where appropriate <p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC34">5.BIOEQUIVALENCE DATA:</a></h3>
<p>
Bioequivalence data may be requested where applicable. The Center does not
anticipate that bioequivalence studies will be requested unless there are
specific concerns regarding the effects that a change 
to an alternate manufacturing site will have on the bioavailability of the drug
product. This assessment will be made on the basis of whether the manufacture
of the product at the proposed alternate manufacturing site also involves a
change in production equipment, production procedure, and the extent of the
total change.<p>

Milk-out studies (for mastitis products manufactured at the alternate sites)
will generally not be necessary. Ordinarily, bridging data may be provided by a
comparison of physiochemical data (particle size, viscosity, crystalline
structure, etc.). However, when milk out studies are necessary, the submission
of protocols prior to the initiation of the studies is strongly recommended.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC35">6.ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION:</a></h3><p>

This information should include:<p>

An environmental assessment (EA) according to 21 CFR 25.31a which addresses the
manufacturing at each site should be submitted. The type of information
necessary for each manufacturing site is specified in the draft guidance
document entitled Environmental Review of Generic Animal Drugs. This guidance
document was provided as an attachment to the Center's generic policy letter,
dated June 7, 1989. A complete copy of the policy letter and guidance document
is available upon written request from the Industry Information Staff (HFV-12),
Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish
Place, Rockville MD 20855.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC36">7.GENERAL INFORMATION:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="RTFToC37">a.Stability Program/Commitment:</a></h4>
<p>
A stability commitment consistent with the current issue of the Center for
Veterinary Medicine's Drug Stability Guidelines, should be submitted for each
facility. The generation of stability data should be as specified in the NADA
or ANADA. A commitment to place the first three production lots manufactured at
each facility into the approved stability program and to generate stability
data at the intervals specified in the approved Stability Protocol in the
application, should be provided. The stability commitment should also provide
for 3-10% (minimum of one per annum) of the lots manufactured at each facility
to be placed into the stability testing program.<p>

<h4><a name="RTFToC38">b.Expiration Date:</a></h4>
<p>
An expiration date for product manufactured at the primary and alternate
facilities should be proposed. Presumably, for NADA's and ANADA's the initial
expiration date will be the same for both primary and alternate facilities
since both should be based on equivalent stability data.<p>

A request for an expiration date for product manufactured at the alternate
facility that is based solely on three-month accelerated data should take into
consideration that the accelerated stability data required for one batch of
drug product manufactured at the alternate facility is the most relevant
information supporting the proposed expiration date. Therefore, a request for a
tentative 24 month expiration date based on the accelerated stability data for
product manufactured at the alternate facility may be appropriate (refer to II.
C.).<p>

These expiration periods may be extended to the previously approved expiration
date for product manufactured at the primary facility on the basis of
additional stability data generated on product manufactured at the alternate
facility. Whether an already approved expiration date can be granted for an
alternate site depends on whether there is a change in production equipment,
production procedure, and the extent of the total change. Extensions in
expiration dating may be considered separately for each site based on stability
data generated on product manufactured at the primary and alternate
facilities.<p>

<h4><a name="RTFToC39">c.Manufacturing Information:</a></h4>
<p>
Information should be submitted for the manufacture of the product at each
facility, such as: 1) complete name/address of the actual site of manufacture
(the address of the administrative headquarters of the firm may not be
substituted), 2) authorization to reference Master Files, 3) name/address of
the U.S. agent if a foreign manufacturer is proposed, and a letter of
appointment from the manufacturer, 4) facilities, 5) equipment (laboratory and
manufacturing), 6) general/specific operations, 7) manufacturing process
instructions, 8) sterilization process(es) validation, 9) labels (product and
shipping), and 10) certification of compliance with CGMPs.<p>

This information may be submitted in the application or by reference to a
master file provided to the Agency.<p>

<h4><a name="RTFToC40">d.CGMP Compliance:</a></h4>
<p>
Satisfactory compliance with CGMP requirements for the primary and alternate
sites will be determined by making a CGMP inspection request to the appropriate
FDA District Offices. CGMP inspections may include verification of the
information provided in the EA. <p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC41">8.NEW MANUFACTURING SITE:</a></h3>
<p>
In addition to the recommendations noted above, the sponsor of an application
proposing a primary manufacturing facility (NADA's and ANADA's) or alternate
manufacturing facility (NADA's, ANADA's, supplemental NADA's and ANADA's) that
meets the criteria of a new manufacturing site, as defined above, may be
requested to submit additional data (e.g., 2-3 batches meeting minimum batch
size requirements, extended accelerated and RT stability data). The submission
of protocols for new manufacturing sites is recommended prior to the submission
of the application.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC43">A.INTRODUCTION:</a></h3>

The information included in this document is intended to provide guidance for
the submission of appropriate data and information to support the approval of
alternate sources of a new animal drug substance (NADS) in NADA's, ANADA's and
their supplements.<p>

Sponsors may propose multiple sources of new animal drug substance in their
NADA or ANADA submissions. However, it is suggested that NADA's and ANADA's
propose a single (primary) source of the NADS and that additional sources of
NADS be provided for through the supplemental approval process. <p>

The terms new animal drug substance supplier and new animal drug substance
source are interchangeable in this document. The terms refer to the actual
source/supplier and not the vendor.<p>

The approval of an NADA or ANADA is usually based on clinical/bioequivalence
data from drug product manufactured with a single source of the new animal drug
substance. There is no assurance that other sources of the NADS will produce a
product with the same stability characteristics and bioavailability profile. In
order to establish confidence that use of alternate sources of the NADS will
not result in a difference in product shelf-life or bioavailability, the
following recommendations for supporting data and information are being
made.<p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC44">B.DEFINITIONS:</a></h3>
<p>

<u>New Animal Drug Substance</u>: Any substance that when used in the
manufacture, processing, or packing of a drug causes that drug to be a new
animal drug, but does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of such
substances.<p>

<u>Primary Source of New Animal Drug Substance</u>: The primary source of the
new animal drug substance is the source designated for the manufacture of the
product in the application. <p>

<u>Alternate Source of New Animal Drug Substance:</u> The alternate source of
the new animal drug substance is an additional source of the NADS designated
for the manufacture of the drug product in a submission or after approval of
the application. <p>


<h3><a name="RTFToC45">C.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SUBMISSION OF APPROPRIATE 
DATA AND INFORMATION:</a></h3>
<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC46">1.TEST BATCH:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="RTFToC47">a.NADA's:</a></h4>
<p>
A total of three batches of drug product (refer to I. B.) should be
manufactured for NADA's. The test batches should be manufactured with the
proposed source of NADS when possible. However, the Center recognizes that
innovator companies frequently manufacture new chemical entities in small
quantities and at facilities other than those that will be used for the supply
of NADS for the approved drug product; and that this is the material used for
the formulation of drug product for pivotal target animal and stability studies
in the application. This practice is acceptable. The facility used for the
manufacture of NADS should be in compliance with CGMP's. When there is a change
in the source of NADS between that used for the test batch and that proposed as
a source for the approved drug product an assessment will be made to determine
if the processes differ significantly. This assessment will normally be
performed by both Center review staff and FDA field investigational staff. In
instances where the processes are determined to differ significantly additional
bridging studies may be requested by the Center.<p>

If the NADS is available from the proposed source(s), then, at least two of the
batches should be manufactured with the primary source of the NADS. The third
batch may be manufactured with an alternate source of the NADS. With the
exception of true solutions, each alternate source of the NADS should be used
in the manufacture of a batch of drug product.<p>


<h4><a name="RTFToC48">b.ANADA's, Supplemental NADA's and ANADA's:</a>
<a name="fn2back">Footnote/</a><a href="admguide.html#fn2">2</a></h4>

<p>
A completed batch record for one batch of drug product meeting minimum batch
size requirements, manufactured under production conditions, with the primary
source of the NADS (ANADA's) and each alternate source of the NADS (ANADA's,
supplemental NADA's and ANADA's) should be provided. Ordinarily, for true
solutions it will not be necessary to manufacture additional batches with each
alternate source of NADS.<p>

Where in an ANADA or supplement approval is sought for multiple strengths of a
product to be manufactured with a subsequent source of the NADS and, using the
first source of the NADS, at least one batch of product has previously been
prepared in support of each strength, then only one batch of one strength needs
to be made for the subsequent source of the NADS. The batch should be prepared
for the same strength product as the batch that would be used in the
bioequivalence study.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC49">2.STABILITY DATA:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="RTFToC50">a. NADA's:</a></h4>
<p>

<p>
Three month accelerated (37 - 40<sup>o </sup>C, 75% RH) stability data should
be provided for the batch manufactured with the primary source of NADS
(ANADA's) and for each alternate source of NADS (ANADA's, supplemental NADA's
and ANADA's). The stability data should be 
generated on product stored in the approved market container and should include
all appropriate testing as specified in the NADA or ANADA. For true solutions,
accelerated stability data will not ordinarily be requested for alternate

<h3><a name="RTFToC52">3.DISSOLUTION DATA:</a></h3>
<p>
Comparative dissolution data should be submitted where appropriate.<p>

<h3><a name="RTFToC53">4.BIOEQUIVALENCE DATA:</a></h3>
<p>
A request for waiver of in vivo bioequivalence requirements for drug product
manufactured with the alternate source of the NADS should be made. The Center
does not anticipate difficulties concerning the bioavailability for alternate
sources of the NADS for products that are eligible for a waiver of in vivo
bioequivalence study requirements (i.e., parenterals and oral solutions).
However, where there are concerns regarding particle size, isomeric forms,
solubility, narrow therapeutic window, etc., a bioequivalence study may be
requested. <p>

Milk-out studies (for mastitis products manufactured with the alternate NADS)
will generally not be necessary. Ordinarily, bridging data may be provided by a

site of manufacture (the address of the administrative headquarters of the firm
may not be substituted), 2) authorization to reference master files, 3)
name/address of the U.S. agent; if a foreign manufacturer is proposed, a letter
of appointment from the manufacturer, 4) facilities, 5) equipment (laboratory
and manufacturing), 6) raw materials, 7) impurity profile and limits, 8)
general/specific operations (ingredients, specifications, tests, methods,
synthesis, fermentation process), 9) manufacturing process and batch record,
10) analytical controls, 11) stability data, 12) information for the
container/closure, 13) labels (product and shipping), and 14) certificate of
compliance with CGMPs. <p>

This information may be submitted in the application or by reference to a
master file provided to the agency.<p>

Satisfactory compliance with CGMP requirements for the primary and alternate
sources of the NADS will be determined by making a CGMP inspection request to
the appropriate FDA, District Office (domestic source) or International

<H3>Bioequivalence Guideline (Draft) 1994</H3>


<B>Preamble</B> <P> The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is revising the
April 1990 Bioequivalence Guideline.  Many of the changes in the guideline are
based upon consensus reports from panel presentations at the 1993 Veterinary Drug
Bioequivalence Workshop in Rockville, Maryland, sponsored by the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM), the Animal Health Institute (AHI), the American
Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics (AAVPT), and the Animal Drug
Alliance <B>(footnote 1)</B>.  Some new topics have been introduced into the guideline as a result
of issues identified in the review of bioequivalence protocols and studies.  The
Center welcomes comments on the proposed guideline from all interested parties.
<P> The major new topics in the guideline are as follows: <P> 1.	Overdose
bioequivalence studies. <P> 2.	Bioequivalence testing for multiple strength
solid oral dosage forms. <P> 3.	Assay considerations for bioequivalence
studies. <P> 4.	AUC and Cmax as the pivotal parameters for bioequivalence
determination. <P> 5.	Blood level bioequivalence studies to be accompanied by
GLP tissue residue depletion studies for generic products for food-producing
animals.

<P>
<H3>

<A NAME="RTFToC1">I.
INTRODUCTION
</A> </H3>
<P>
	This document is intended to provide guidance for the design and analysis of
in-vivo bioequivalence studies.  The guideline is an update of the April 12,
1990 Bioequivalence Guideline.  Many of the changes in the guideline are based
upon consensus reports from panel presentations at the 1993 Veterinary Drug
Bioequivalence Workshop<B>1.</B><P>
Two products are considered to be bioequivalent when they are equally
bioavailable; that is, equal in the rate and extent to which the active
ingredient(s) or therapeutic ingredient(s) is (are) absorbed and become(s)
available at the site(s) of drug action.   <P>
The Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA, S.2843)
signed into law on November 16, 1988, permits sponsors to submit an Abbreviated
New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) for a generic version of any off-patent
approved animal drug (with certain exceptions noted in the law) regardless of
whether the drug was approved prior to 1962 and subject to the NAS/NRC/DESI
review.  <P>
Bioequivalence studies are used in a variety of situations, most often when a
sponsor proposes manufacturing a generic version of an approved off-patent
product.  A bioequivalence study may also be part of a new animal drug
application (NADA) or supplemental NADA for approval of an alternative dosage
form, new route of administration, or a significant manufacturing change which
may affect drug bioavailability.<P>
The Center has concluded that the tissue residue depletion of 
the generic product is not adequately addressed through bioequivalence studies.
Therefore, ANADA's for drug products for food-producing animals will generally
be required to include bioequivalence and tissue residue studies.<P>
Bioequivalence studies (<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; blood level, pharmacologic end-point, and
clinical end-point studies) and tissue residue depletion studies should be
conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations [21 CFR
Part 58].<P>
Whereas the focus of the Guideline is bioequivalence testing for 
ANADA approval, the general principles also apply to relative bioavailability
studies conducted for NADA's.<P>
Sponsors should consult with the Center early in the product development
process to facilitate the design of studies adequate for drug approval.  The
Center urges sponsors to submit protocols 
for review prior to conducting studies.<P>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC2">II.
General Considerations
</A></H3>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC3">A.
Selection of Reference Product for Bioequivalence Testing
</A></B>
	<P>
As a general rule, the proposed generic product should be  tested against the
original pioneer product.<P>
If the original pioneer product is no longer marketed, but remains eligible to
be copied, then the first approved generic copy of the pioneer should be used
as the reference product for bioequivalence testing against the proposed new
generic product.<P>
If several approved NADA's exist for the same drug product, and each approved
product is labeled differently (<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; different species and/or claims),
then the generic sponsor must clearly identify which product label is the
intended pioneer.  Bioequivalence testing should be conducted against the
single approved product which bears the labeling that the generic sponsor
intends to copy.<P>
The generic sponsor should consult with CVM regarding selection of the
appropriate reference product before conducting the bioequivalence study.<P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC4">B.
Criteria for Waiver of In Vivo Bioequivalence Study
</A></B>
<P>
The requirement for the <I>in vivo</I> &#32; bioequivalence study may be waived for
certain generic products.  Categories of products which may be eligible for
waivers include, but are not limited to, the following: <P>
1.	Parenteral solutions intended for injection by the intravenous,
subcutaneous, or intramuscular routes of administration.<P>
2.	Oral solutions or other solubilized forms.<P>
3.	Topically applied solutions intended for local therapeutic effects.  Other
topically applied dosage forms intended for local therapeutic effects for
non-food animals only.<P>
4.	Inhalant volatile anesthetic solutions.<P>
In general, the generic product being considered for a waiver contains the same
active and inactive ingredients in the same dosage form and concentration and
has the same pH and physico-chemical characteristics as an approved pioneer
product.<P>
However, the Center will consider bioequivalence waivers for non-food animal
topical products with certain differences in the inactive ingredients of the
pioneer and generic products.<P>
If a waiver of the <I>in vivo </I> &#32; bioequivalence and/or the tissue residue
study/studies is granted for a food animal drug product, then the withdrawal
period established for the pioneer product will be assigned to the generic
product.<P>
Sponsors may apply for waivers of <I>in vivo</I> &#32; bioequivalence studies prior
to submission of the ANADA's.<P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC5">C.
Selection of Blood Level, Pharmacologic End-point, or Clinical End-point Study   
</A></B>
<P>
<I>In vivo</I> &#32; bioequivalence may be determined by one of several direct or
indirect methods.  Selection of the method depends upon the purpose of the
study, the analytical method available, and the nature of the drug product.
Bioequivalence testing should be conducted using the most appropriate method
available for the specific use of the product.   <P>
The preferred hierarchy of bioequivalence studies (in descending order of
sensitivity) is the blood level study, pharmacologic end-point study, and
clinical end-point study.  When absorption of the drug is sufficient to measure
drug concentration <I>directly</I> &#32; in the blood (or other appropriate
biological fluids or tissues) and systemic absorption is relevant to the drug
action, then a blood (or other biological fluid or tissue) level bioequivalence
study should be conducted.  The blood level study is generally preferred above
all others as the most sensitive measure of bioequivalence.  The sponsor should
provide justification for choosing either a pharmacologic or clinical end-point
study over a blood-level (or other biological fluids or tissues) study.<P>
When the measurement of the rate and extent of absorption of the drug in
biological fluids cannot be achieved or is unrelated to drug action, a
pharmacologic end-point (<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; drug induced physiologic change) study
may be conducted.  Lastly, in order of preference, if drug concentrations in
blood (or fluids or tissues) are not measurable or are inappropriate, and there
are no appropriate pharmacologic effects that can be monitored, then a clinical
end-point study may be conducted, comparing the test (generic) product to the
reference (pioneer) product and a placebo (or negative) control.   <P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC6">D.
Species Selection
</A></B>
<P>
A bioequivalence study is generally required for each species 
for which the pioneer product is approved.  However,
bioequivalence testing may not be required for every "minor" species on the
label. <P>
	
<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC7">E.
Dose Selection
</A></B>
<P>
Dose selection will depend upon the label claims, consideration of assay
sensitivity, and relevance to the practical use conditions of the reference
product.  A blood level bioequivalence study should generally be conducted at
the highest dose approved for the pioneer product.  <P>
However, the Center will consider a bioequivalence study conducted at a higher
than approved dose (an overdose bioequivalence study) in certain cases.  An
overdose study may be appropriate when a multiple of the highest approved dose
achieves measurable blood levels, but the highest approved dose does not.  In
general, the overdose study would be limited to 2-3x the highest dose approved
for the pioneer product.  To be suitable for an overdose study, the pioneer
product must have an adequate margin of safety at the overdose level.<P>
The generic sponsor must also confirm (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; through literature) that the
drug follows linear kinetics.  An overdose bioequivalence study in food animal
species would be accompanied by a tissue residue withdrawal study conducted at
the highest approved dose for the pioneer product.<P>
For products labeled for multiple claims which may involve very different
pharmacologic actions (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; therapeutic and production claims),
multiple bioequivalence studies at different doses may be required.<P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC8">F.
Multiple Strengths of Solid Oral Dosage Forms 
</A></B>
<P>
To obtain approval for 2 or 3 solid oral dosage form strengths (or
concentrations), a single bioequivalence study using the highest strength
product would generally suffice, if the 2 or 3 product strengths have the same
ratio of active to inactive ingredients and are otherwise identical in
formulation.<P>
To obtain approval for more than 3 strengths with the same ratio of active to
inactive ingredients, 2 bioequivalence studies, using the highest and lowest
strength products may be necessary.  <P>
Separate bioequivalence studies will be required for different product
strengths which have different ratios of active to inactive ingredients.<P>
<I>In vitro </I> &#32;dissolution testing should be conducted, using an FDA approved
method, to compare each strength of the generic product to the corresponding
strength of the reference product.<P>

<B> G. Manufacturing of Pilot Batch ("Biobatch") </B>
	<P>
A pilot batch or "biobatch" should be the source of the finished drug product
used in the pivotal studies (<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; bioequivalence studies and tissue
residue studies), stability studies and the validation studies for the proposed
analytical and stability indicating methods (refer to CVM's "Animal Drug
Manufacturing Guidelines, 1992").<P>
	
<H3>
  III.
Blood Level Studies 
  </H3>
<P>
Blood level bioequivalence studies compare a test (generic) product to a
reference (pioneer) product using parameters derived from the concentrations of
the drug moiety and/or its metabolites, as a function of time, in whole blood,
plasma, serum (or in other appropriate biological fluids or tissues).  This
approach is particularly applicable to dosage forms intended to deliver the
active drug ingredient(s) to the  systemic circulation (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; injectable
drugs and most oral dosage forms).  Generally, the study should encompass both
the absorption, distribution, and depletion (elimination) phases of the drug
concentration <I>vs</I> &#32; time profiles.  <P>

<B>
 A.
Assay Considerations
 </B>
<P>
	A properly validated assay method is pivotal to the acceptability of any
pharmacokinetic study.  Sponsors should discuss any questions or problems
concerning the analytical methodology with CVM before undertaking the
bioequivalence studies.  The ANADA submission must contain adequate information
necessary for the CVM reviewer to determine the validity of the analytical
method used to quantitate the level of drug in the biological matrix
(<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; blood).<P>
	The following aspects should be addressed in assessing method performance:<P>
1.	Concentration Range and Linearity<P>
The quantitative relationship between concentration and response should be
adequately characterized over the entire range of expected sample
concentrations. For linear relationships, a standard curve should be defined by
at least 5-8 concentrations.  If the concentration response function is
non-linear, additional points would be necessary to define the non-linear
portions of the curve. Extrapolation beyond a standard curve is not acceptable.
<P>
2.	Limit of Detection (LOD)<P>
The standard deviation of the background signal and LOD should be determined.
The LOD is estimated as the response value calculated by adding 3 times the
standard deviation of the background response to the average background
response. <P>
3.	Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)<P>
The initial determination of LOQ should involve the addition of 10 times the
standard deviation of the background response to the average background
response. The second step in determining LOQ is assessing the precision
(reproducibility) and accuracy (recovery) of the method at the LOQ. The LOQ
will generally be the lowest concentration on the standard curve that can be
quantified with acceptable accuracy and precision (see items 5. and 6. below).
<P>
4.	Specificity<P>
	The absence of matrix interferences should be demonstrated by the analysis of
six independent sources of control matrix. The effect of environmental,
physiological, or procedural variables on the matrix should be assessed.  Each
independent control matrix will be used to produce a standard curve, which will
be compared to a standard curve produced under chemically defined conditions.
The comparison of curves should exhibit parallelism and superimposability
within the limits of analytical variation established for the chemically
defined standard curve.<P>
5.	Accuracy (Recovery)<P>
	This parameter should be evaluated using at least three known concentrations
of analyte freshly spiked in control matrix, one being the LOQ, one in the
middle of the range of the standard curve ("mid-range") and one at the high end
of the standard curve ("high"). The accuracy of the method, based upon the mean
value of six replicate injections, at each concentration level, should be
within 80-120% of the nominal concentration at each level (high, mid-range, and
LOQ). <P>
6.	Precision (Reproducibility)<P>
	This parameter should be evaluated using at least three known concentrations
of analyte freshly spiked in control matrix, at the LOQ, mid-range, and high
end of the standard curve. The coefficient of variation (CV) of six replicate
injections should be  &#177; 10% for concentrations at or above 0.1 ppm (0.1
 &#181;  g/mL).  A CV of  &#177; 20% is acceptable for concentrations below 0.1 ppm.
<P>
7.	Analyte Stability<P>
	Stability of the analyte in the biological matrix under the conditions of the
experiment (including any period for which samples are stored before analyses)
should be established. It is recommended that the stability be determined with
incurred analyte in the matrix of dosed animals in addition to, or instead of,
control matrix spiked with pure analyte. Also, the influence of three
freeze-thaw cycles at 2 concentrations should be determined. <P>
	Stability samples at 3 concentrations should be stored with the study samples
and analyzed through the period of time in which study samples are analyzed.
These analyses will establish whether or not analyte levels have decreased
during the time of analysis.<P>
8.	Analytical System Stability<P>
	To assure that the analytical system remains stable over the time course of
the assay, standards will be repetitively run.  A minimal design would be to
run analytical standards at the beginning and at the end of the analytical
run.<P>
9.	Other Recommendations<P>
Quality Control (QC) Samples<P>
Freshly spiked standards should be analyzed contemporaneously with test
samples, evenly dispersed throughout each analytical run.  QC samples
(standards) should be run at the LOQ, mid-range, and high concentrations used
in the method validation work.  The QC data set should consist of 18 samples, 6
at the LOQ, 6 at mid-range, and 6 at the high value.  The QC samples may be run
as 3 separate determinations, with each determination consisting of duplicate
determinations at each level.  The mean and standard deviation for each level
are calculated and compared to the standard values of the standard material.
The mean should agree to within  &#177; 20%, and the standard deviation should
agree to within established precision.<P>
Replicate and Repeat Analyses<P>
Single rather than replicate analyses are recommended, unless the
reproducibility and/or accuracy of the method are borderline. Criteria for
repeat analyses should be determined prior to running the study and recorded in
the method SOP. <P>

<B>
 B.
General Experimental Design Considerations 
 </B>
<P>
1.	Dosing by Labeled Concentration<P>
	 <P>
	The potency of the pioneer and generic products should be assayed prior to
conducting the bioequivalence study to ensure that FDA or compendial
specifications are met.   The Center recommends that the potency of the pioneer
and generic lots should differ by no more than 5% for dosage form products.<P>
The animals should be dosed according to the labeled concentration or strength
of the product, rather than the assayed potency of the individual batch
(<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; the dose should not be corrected for the assayed potency of the
product).  The bioequivalence data or derived parameters should not be
normalized to account for any potency differences between the pioneer and
generic product lots.<P>
	2.	Single Dose vs Multiple Dose Studies<P>
A single dose study at the highest approved dose will generally be adequate for
the demonstration of bioequivalence.  <P>
However, a multiple dose study may be required when there are concerns
regarding poorly predictable drug accumulation, <I>e.g.,</I> &#32; a drug with
nonlinear kinetics or a narrow therapeutic window.  A multiple dose study may
also be required when assay sensitivity is inadequate to permit drug
quantification out to 3 terminal elimination half-lives beyond the time when
maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) are achieved or in cases where flip-flop
kinetics<B>2</B> are believed to exist.<P>
3.	Subject Characteristics<P>
Ordinarily, studies should be conducted with healthy animals representative of
the species, class, gender, 
and physiological maturity for which the drug is approved.  The bioequivalence
study may be conducted with a single gender for which the pioneer product is
approved, unless there is a known interaction of formulation with gender. <P>
			 
An attempt should be made to restrict the weight of the test animals to a
narrow range in order to maintain the same total dose.  <P>
The animals should not receive any medication prior to testing for a period of
two weeks or more, depending upon the biological half-life of the ancillary
drug.  <P>
4.	Fed vs Fasted State<P>
Feeding may either enhance or interfere with drug absorption, depending upon
the characteristics of the drug and the formulation.  Feeding may also increase
the inter- and intrasubject variability in the rate and extent of drug
absorption.  The rationale for conducting each bioequivalence study under
fasting or fed conditions should be provided in the protocol.<P>
Fasting conditions, if used, should be fully described, giving careful
consideration to the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the humane treatment of
the test animals.  <P>
The protocol should describe the diet and feeding regime which will be used in
the study.    
 <P>
 For certain product classifications or drug entities, such as enteric
coated and oral sustained release products, demonstration of bioequivalence in
both the fasted and the fed states may be necessary.  Sponsors should consult
with CVM during the development of the protocols for the studies.<P>

<B>
 C.
Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Considerations in Study Design
 </B>
	<P>
1.	Sampling Time Considerations		<P>
 <P>
The total number of sampling times necessary to  characterize the blood 
level profiles  will depend upon the curvature of the profiles and the 
magnitude of variability associated with the bioavailability data 
(including pharmacokinetic variability, assay error and interproduct 
differences in absorption kinetics).  <P>
 The sampling times should adequately define peak concentration(s) and the
extent of absorption.  The  sampling times should extend to at least 3
terminal elimination half-lives beyond Tmax.  The sponsor should  consult
with CVM prior to conducting the pivotal bioequivalence study if the assay
is unable to quantify samples to 3 half-lives.<P>
Maximum sampling time efficiency may be achieved by conducting a pilot
investigation.  The pilot study should identify the general shapes of the test
and reference curves, the magnitude of the difference in product profiles, and
the noise associated with each blood sampling time (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; variability
attributable to assay error and the variability between subjects, for parallel
study designs, or within subjects, for crossover study designs).  This
information should be applied to the determination of an optimum blood sampling
schedule.  Depending upon these variability estimates, it may be more efficient
to cluster several blood samples rather than to have samples which are
periodically dispersed throughout the duration of blood
sampling.<B>3</B><P>
 
2.	Protein Binding<P>
	 
	In general, product bioequivalence should be based upon total (free plus
protein bound) concentrations of the parent drug (or metabolite, when
applicable).  However, if nonlinear protein binding is known to occur within
the therapeutic dosing range, sponsors may be required to submit data both on
the free and total drug concentrations for the test and pioneer products.
 
	<P>
	Similarly, if the drug is known to enter blood erythrocytes, the protocol
should address the issue of potential nonlinearity in erythrocyte uptake of the
drug  administered within the labeled therapeutic dosing range.  <P>
	The bioequivalence protocol or completed study report should provide any
information available from the literature regarding erythrocyte uptake and
protein binding characteristics of the drug or drug class, including the
magnitude of protein binding and the type of blood protein to which it
binds.<P>
3.	Subject Number<P>
Pilot studies are recommended as a means of estimating the appropriate sample
size for the pivotal bioequivalence study.  Estimated sample size will vary
depending upon whether the data are analyzed on a log or linear scale.  Useful
references for sample size estimates include Westlake<B>4</B>,
Hauschke<B>5,</B> and Steinijans.<B>6</B><P>
		4.	Cross-over and Parallel Design Considerations<P>
A two-period cross-over design is commonly used in blood level studies.  The
use of cross-over designs eliminates a major source of study variability:
between subject differences in the rates of drug absorption, drug clearance,
and the volume of drug distribution.  <P>
In a typical two-period cross-over design, subjects are randomly assigned to
either sequence A or sequence B with the restriction that equal numbers of
subjects are initially assigned to each sequence.  The design is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
			<I>Sequence A</I>      <I>Sequence B </I> 
Period 1		Test            Reference 
Period 2		Reference       Test 
</PRE>
A crucial assumption in the two-period cross-over 
design is that of equal residual effects.  Unequal residual effects may result,
for example, from an inadequate washout period.  Another assumption of the
cross-over (or extended period) design is that there is no subject by
formulation interaction.  In other words, the assumption is that all subjects
are from a relatively homogeneous population and will exhibit similar relative
bioavailability of the test and reference products.  If there are
subpopulations of subjects, such that the relationship between product
bioavailability is a function of the subpopulation within which they are being
tested, then a subject by formulation interaction is said to exist.  <P>
A one-period parallel design may be preferable in the following situations:<P>
a.	The drug induces physiological changes in the animal (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; liver microsomal
enzyme induction) which persist after total drug clearance and alter the
bioavailability of the product administered in the second period.<P>
b.	The drug has a very long terminal elimination half-life, creating a risk of
residual drug present in the animal at the time of the second period dosing.<P>
c.	The duration of the washout time for the two-period cross-over study is so
long as to result in significant maturational changes in the study subjects.<P>
d.	The drug follows flip-flop kinetics<B>2</B>, where the slope of the
[[beta]]-elimination phase is dictated by the rate of drug absorption rather
than the rate of drug elimination from one or both products.<P>
Other designs, such as the two-period design with four treatment sequences
(Test/Test, Reference/Reference, Test/Reference and Reference/Test) or the
extended period design may be appropriate depending on the circumstances.  The
use of alternative study designs should be discussed with CVM prior to
conducting the bioequivalence study.<P>
	5.	Duration of Washout Time for Cross-over Study<P>
For drugs which follow a one or two compartment open body model, the duration
of the washout time should  
be approximately 10x the plasma apparent terminal elimination half-life, to
provide for 99.9% of the administered dose to be eliminated from the body.<P>
If more highly complex kinetic models are anticipated (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; drugs for
which long withdrawal times have been assigned due to prolonged tissue
binding), or for drugs  with the potential for physiologic carryover effects,
the washout time should be adjusted accordingly.<P>
	6.	Pivotal Parameters for Blood Level Bioequivalence<P>
The sponsor is encouraged to calculate parameters using formulas which involve
only the raw data (<I>i.e.</I> &#32;, so-called model independent methods). 
 <P>
 a.	Area Under the Curve (AUC) Estimates<P>
	The extent of product bioavailability is estimated by the area under the blood
concentration <I>vs</I> &#32; time curve (AUC).  AUC is most frequently estimated
using the linear trapezoidal rule.  Other methods for AUC estimation may be
proposed by the sponsor during protocol development.<P>
	 
	For a single dose bioequivalence study, AUC should be calculated from time 0
(predose) to the last sampling time associated with quantifiable drug
concentration AUC(time = 0-LOQ).  The ratio of the test and reference product value
for this noninfinity estimate provides the closest approximation of the measure
of uncertainty (variance) and the relative bioavailability estimate associated
with AUC(time = 0-INF), the full extent of product bioavailability.<B>7</B><P>
	The relative AUC values generally change very little once the absorption of
both products has been  completed.<B>8,9  </B>However, because of the possibility of
multifunctional absorption kinetics, it can not always be determined when the
available drug has been completely absorbed.  Therefore, CVM recommends
extending the duration of sampling until such time that AUC(time = 0-LOQ) / AUC(time = 0-INF)
 &#62; or &#61; 0.80.  Generally, the sampling times should extend to at least 3
multiples of the drug's apparent terminal elimination half-life, beyond the
time when maximum blood concentrations are achieved.<P>
	AUC(time = 0-INF) should be used to demonstrate that the concentration-time curve can
be quantitated such that AUC(time = 0-LOQ) / AUC(time = 0-INF) &#62; 0.80.  The sponsor should
consult with CVM if AUC(time = 0-LOQ) / AUC(time = 0-INF) is determined to be &#60; 0.80.  If
AUC(time = 0-LOQ) / AUC(time = 0-INF) is &#60; 0.80, then a multiple dose study to steady state may
be needed to allow an accurate assessment of AUC(time = 0-INF) (where AUC(time = 0-INF) = AUC(time =  0-tau) 
at steady state and [[tau]] is the dosing interval).<P>
	In a multiple dose study, the AUC should be calculated over one complete
dosing interval AUC(time =  0-tau).  Under steady state conditions, AUC(time =  0-tau) 
equals the full extent of bioavailability of the individual dose  (AUC(time = 0-INF)).   <P>
b.	Rate of Absorption <P>
 	 
	The rate of absorption will be estimated by the maximum observed drug
concentration (Cmax) and the corresponding time to reach this maximum
concentration (Tmax).    <P>
	When conducting a steady-state investigation, data on the minimum drug
concentration observed during a single dosing interval (Cmin) should also be
collected.  Generally, three successive Cmin values should be provided to
verify that steady-state conditions have been achieved.  Cmin may or may not
occur immediately prior to dosing.  <P>
c.	Determination of Product Bioequivalence<P>
	Unless otherwise indicated by CVM during the protocol development for a given
application, the pivotal bioequivalence parameters will be Cmax and  AUC(time = 0-LOQ)
(for a single dose study) or AUC(time =  0-tau)  (for a multiple dose
study).  To be indicative of product bioequivalence, the pivotal metrics must
be associated with confidence intervals which fall within a set of
acceptability limits (see Statistical Analysis section of this Guideline).  <P>
	Tmax in single dose studies and Cmin in multiple dose studies will be assessed
by clinical judgment.   <P>

<B> D. Statistical Analysis  </B>
<P>
CVM advocates the use of 90% confidence intervals, as the best available method
for evaluating bioequivalence study data.  Papers by Schuirmann<B>10</B>
and Westlake<B>4 </B>compare various methodologies for assessing drug
product equivalence and describe the confidence interval approach. <P>
The confidence interval approach should be applied to the individual parameters
of interest (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; AUC and Cmax.  The sponsor may use untransformed or
log transformed data.  However, the choice of untransformed or log transformed
data should be made by the sponsor with concurrence by the Center prior to
conducting the study.<P>
  
 A discussion of how the confidence interval approach should be applied
to (normally distributed) data from a two-period crossover design is given
below.  The example uses untransformed data. <P>


If we let  <IMG SRC=XT1.GIF ALT="the mean of X(T1)"> be the mean for the test
drug in period 1, <IMG SRC=XT2.GIF ALT="the mean of X(T2)"> the mean for the test
drug in period 2, and <IMG SRC=XR1.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R1)"> and 
<IMG SRC=XR2.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R2)"> the respective means for the reference drug,
then the estimates for the drugs averaged over both periods are 
<IMG SRC=B17E1.GIF ALT = "the mean of X (T) equals (1/2) (the mean of X (T1)
plus the mean of X (T2)0"> for the test drug and <IMG SRC=B17E2.GIF ALT
= "the mean of X (R) equals (1/2) (the mean of X (R1) plus the mean of
X (R2))"> for the reference drug.  Although both sequence groups
usually start with the same number of animals, the number of animals in each
sequence group (n(A)) and (n(B)) that successfully finish the
study may not be equal.  The formulas above utilize the marginal or least squares
estimates of X(T) and X(R).  These means are not a function
of the sample size in each sequence.<P> An analysis of variance is required to obtain the estimate of
[[sigma]](squared), the error variance.  The estimator, s(squared), which
will be used in the calculation of the 90% confidence interval should be
obtained from the "error" mean square term found in the following ANOVA table.
<P>
<PRE><I>

        Total                           2n(A)+2n(B)-1 
     	</PRE>
<P>
Lower and upper 90% confidence intervals are then found by  formulas based on
Student's t-distribution. <P> <IMG SRC=B18E1.GIF ALT="L=(mean of X(T) - mean of X(R) - (t (for n(A)+n(B)-2 DF at .05) X s X SQRT (1/2 X (1/n(A)+1/n(B)))">
<P>
 <IMG SRC=B18E2.GIF ALT="L=(mean of X(T) - mean of X(R) - (t (for n(A)+n(B)-2 DF at .05) X s X SQRT (1/2 X (1/n(A)+1/n(B)))"><P>
The procedure of declaring two formulations bioequivalent if the 90% confidence
interval is completely contained in some fixed interval, is statistically
equivalent to performing two one-sided statistical tests (alpha = .05) at
the end-points of the interval. <P>Consider the following example with L = 3, U = 17, <IMG SRC=XT.GIF ALT="the mean of X(T)"> = 110 and
<IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)"> = 100.  By the traditional hypothesis testing approach, the
result would be considered statistically significant since the confidence
interval does not include 0.  Using the confidence interval approach, the entire
confidence interval lies within 17% of <IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">.  (The lower end of the
confidence interval lies within <IMG SRC=LXR.GIF ALT="L/the mean of X(R)"> = 3/100 
= 3% of
<IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">, while the upper end of the confidence
 interval lies within
<IMG SRC=UXR.GIF ALT="U/the mean of X(R)"> = 17/100 = 17% 
of <IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">.  If it were determined
by CVM that only differences larger than 20% were biomedically important, then
using the confidence interval approach the results of this study would be
considered adequate to demonstrate bioequivalence.

Now consider an example with L = -4, U = 24, <IMG SRC=XT.GIF ALT="the mean of X(T)"> = 110 and
<IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)"> = 100.  In this case, by the traditional hypothesis testing
approach the result would not be considered statistically significant since the
confidence interval includes 0.  However, the confidence interval extends as far
as 24% from <IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">.  (The lower end of the 
confidence interval lies
within <IMG SRC=LXR.GIF ALT="L/the mean of X(R)"> = -4/100 = -4% of <IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">
, while the upper
end of the confidence interval extends to <IMG SRC=LXR.GIF ALT="U/the mean of X(R)">
 = 24/100 = 24% of
<IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">.)   If it were determined by 
CVM that only differences larger
than 20% were biomedically important, then the results of this study would be
considered inadequate to demonstrate bioequivalence, since the entire confidence
interval is not within 20% of <IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the mean of X(R)">.

The width of the confidence interval is determined by the within subject variance
(between subject variance for parallel group studies) and the number of subjects
in the study.  In general, the confidence interval for untransformed data should
be 80-120 (the confidence interval should lie within 20% of  <IMG SRC=XR.GIF ALT="the 
mean of X(R)">). 
For logarithmically transformed data, the confidence interval is generally
80-125.  The sponsor and CVM should determine the acceptable bounds for
confidence limits for the particular drug and formulation during protocol
development.

  PHARMACOLOGIC END-POINT STUDIES 
</A></H3>
<P>
Where the direct measurement of the rate and extent of absorption of the new
animal drug in biological fluids is inappropriate or impractical, the
evaluation of an appropriate pharmacologic end-point will be acceptable.   <P> 
<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC16">A.
General Design Aspects 
</A></B>
<P>
Typically the design of a pharmacologic end-point study should follow the same
general considerations as the blood level studies.  However, specifics such as
the number of subjects or sampling times will depend on the pharmacologic
end-point monitored.  The parameters to be measured will also depend upon the
pharmacologic end-points and may differ from those used in blood level studies.
As with blood level studies, when pharmacologic end-point studies are used to
demonstrate bioequivalence, a tissue residue study will also be required in
food-producing animals.<P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC17">B.
Statistical Analysis 
</A></B>
<P>
Even though the parameters of interest for pharmacologic end-points may differ
from those of a blood level bioequivalence study, the method of statistical
analysis is essentially the same as discussed in the blood level section.  For
most pharmacologic end-points, it may be necessary to show, for both the test
and reference products separately, that the means of the parameter of interest
at a specified post-treatment time are significantly different from baseline.
Prior to conducting the study, a time such as two hours post-treatment should
be selected and the observed values compared to baseline values.  If the means
are not significantly different ([[alpha]] = .05), then the study is invalid.
<P>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC18">V.
CLINICAL END-POINT STUDIES  
</A></H3>
<P>
If measurement of the drug or its metabolites in blood, biological fluids or
tissues is inappropriate or impractical, and there are no appropriate
pharmacologic end-points to monitor (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; most production drugs and
some coccidiostats and anthelmintics), then well-controlled clinical end-point
studies are acceptable for the demonstration of bioequivalence.   <P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC19">A.
General Design Aspects 
</A></B>
<P>
Generally, a parallel group design with three treatment groups should be used.
The groups should be a placebo (or negative)  control, a positive control
(reference/pioneer product) and the test (generic) product.  The purpose of the
placebo (or negative) control is to confirm the sensitivity or validity<B>
</B>of the study. <P>
Dosage(s) approved for the pioneer product should be used in the study.
Dosage(s) should be selected following consultation with CVM and should reflect
consideration for experimental sensitivity and relevance to the common use of
the pioneer product.<P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC20">B.
Subject Characteristics and Data Collection 
</A></B>
<P>
Studies should generally be conducted using the target animal species, with
consideration for the sex, class, body weight, age, health status, and feeding
and husbandry conditions, as described on the pioneer product labeling.  In
general, the length of time that the study is conducted should be consistent
with the duration of use on the pioneer product labeling. <P>
In general, the response(s) to be measured in a clinical end-point study should
be based upon the labeling claims of the pioneer product and selected in
consultation with CVM.  It may not be necessary to collect data on some
overlapping claims (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; for a production drug which is added at the
same amount per ton of feed for both growth rate and feed efficiency, data from
only one of the two responses need be collected).   <P>

<B>
<A NAME="RTFToC21">C.
Statistical Analysis 
</A></B>
	<P>
When considering sample size, it is important to note that the pen, not the
individual animal, is often the experimental unit. <P>
As with blood level bioequivalence studies, CVM is advocating the use of 90%
confidence intervals as the best method for evaluating clinical end-point
studies.  The bounds for confidence limits (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32;  &#177; 20% of the
improvement over placebo [or negative] control) for the particular drug should
be agreed upon with CVM prior to initiation of the study. <P>
The analysis should be used to compare the test product and the reference
product.  In addition, a traditional hypothesis test should be performed
comparing both the test and reference products separately to the placebo (or
negative) control.  The hypothesis test is conducted to ensure that the study
has adequate sensitivity to detect differences when they actually occur.  If no
significant improvement ([[alpha]] = .05) is seen in the parameter
(<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; the mean of the test and the mean of the reference products are
each not significantly better than the mean of the placebo [or negative]
control), generally, the study will be considered inadequate to evaluate
bioequivalence.  Assuming that the test and reference products have been shown
to be superior to the placebo (or negative) control, the determination of
bioequivalence is based upon the confidence interval of the difference between
the two products. <P>
In some clinical end-point studies, the requirement for a placebo (or negative)
control may be waived for ethical and/or practical considerations.  If such a
waiver is granted, then the response(s) to the test and reference products
should each provide a statistically significant improvement over baseline.<P>
If the results are ordered categorical data (<I>e.g.,</I> &#32; excellent, good, fair
or poor), a non-parametric hypothesis test of no difference between test
product and placebo (or negative) control and between the reference product and
placebo (or negative) control should be performed.  As above, if these tests
result in significant differences between the test product and control and the
reference product and control, then a non-parametric confidence interval on the
difference between the test and reference products is calculated. <P>
Another acceptable approach for categorical data is to calculate the confidence
interval on the odds ratio between the test and reference products after
showing that the test and reference products are significantly better than the
control.<B>11</B><P>

 HUMAN FOOD SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
</A></H3>
<P>
The toxicology and tolerance developed for the pioneer animal drug are applied
to generic copies of the drug.<P>
		<P>
The Center has adopted the recommendation of the Panel on Human Food Safety at
the 1993 Veterinary Drug Bioequivalence Workshop.  The consensus of the panel
was that the Center should generally require a tissue residue depletion study
for approval of a generic animal drug product in a food-producing
species.<B>1  </B>Two drug products may have the same plasma disposition
profile at the concentrations used to assess product bioequivalence, but may
have very different tissue disposition kinetics when followed out to the
withdrawal time for the pioneer product.  Therefore, to show the withdrawal
period at which residues of the generic product will be consistent with the
tolerance for the pioneer product, a tissue residue depletion study is
necessary.<P>
The results of a bioequivalence study or tissue residue depletion study in one
animal species can not generally be extrapolated to another species.  Possible
species differences in drug partitioning or binding in tissues could magnify a
small difference in the rate or extent of drug absorbed into a large difference
in marker residue concentrations in the target tissue.  Therefore, for a
pioneer product labeled for more than one food-producing species, a
bioequivalence study and a tissue residue depletion study would be required for
each major food-producing species on the label.<P>
 <P>
 A traditional withdrawal study, as described in CVM's "General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing
Animals," September 1986, is considered the best design for collecting data
useful for the calculation of a preslaughter withdrawal period for drugs used
in food-producing animals.  In the traditional withdrawal study, twenty animals
are divided into four or five groups of four to five animals each.  Groups of
animals are slaughtered at carefully preselected time points following the last
administration of the test product and the edible tissues are collected for
residue analysis.  A statistical tolerance limit approach is used to determine
when, with 95% confidence, 99% of treated animals would have tissue residues
below the codified limits.  <P>
For purposes of calculating a withdrawal period for a generic animal drug, only
the generic product would be tested (i.e., not the pioneer product), and only
the marker residue in the target tissue would be analyzed.  <P>
Other study designs will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Sponsors are
encouraged to submit the proposed tissue residue depletion protocol for CVM
concurrence before proceeding with the withdrawal study.<P>
The generic animal drug will be assigned the withdrawal time supported by the
residue depletion data, or the withdrawal  time currently assigned to the
pioneer product, whichever is the longer.  <P>
The generic animal drug sponsor may request a shorter withdrawal period for the
generic product by supplementing the ANADA and providing tissue residue data
necessary to support the shorter withdrawal period request.  Such a supplement
will be reviewed under the agency's policy for Category II supplements.  For a
Category II supplement, a reevaluation of the safety (or effectiveness) data in
the parent application (<I>i.e.,</I> &#32; the pioneer NADA) may be required.  The
Center will ordinarily approve a request for a shorter withdrawal period when
the residue data are adequate <I>and</I> &#32; when no other human food safety
concerns for the drug are evident.<P>
Certain drug products may be exempt from the requirement to conduct a tissue
residue depletion study.  Exemptions include products for which a waiver of
<I>in vivo</I> &#32; bioequivalence testing is granted, and products for which the
assay method used in the blood level bioequivalence study is sensitive enough
to measure blood levels of the drug for the entire withdrawal period assigned
to the reference product.  Other requests for waiver of the tissue residue
study will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<P>
 CVM will not require that the assay methodology used to determine the
withdrawal period for the generic product be more rigorous than the approved
methodology used to determine the existing withdrawal period for the pioneer
product.  If an analytical method other than the approved method of analysis is
used, the generic sponsor must provide data comparing the alternate method to
the approved method.<P>

lavage (BAL), then to compare this dose in blinded trials with xylazine and
xylazine plus morphine.<P><B>2)  Test Animals:</B><P>In part 1 (dose confirmation), five healthy, mature horses
were given three different doses with a ten day washout between treatments. In
part 2 (efficacy vs. xylazine and xylazine plus morphine for BAL), 99 horses
presented to the clinic for respiratory disease and requiring BAL were randomly
divided into three groups of 33 animals each. These groups were then randomly
assigned to one of the three treatments.<P><B>3)  Type of Control:</B><P>Since part 1 was a dose confirmation trial, no controls
were necessary and none were used. In part 2, saline solution was used as
negative treatment control while xylazine and xylazine plus morphine were used
as positive treatment controls. In addition, investigators were blinded to the
identity of the treatments being given. Injections were prepared in three
syringes by the study director, in accordance with the randomization schedule
provided by the sponsor, and were labelled A, B, and C, respectively. Syringe
A contained the appropriate amount of either saline or detomidine
hydrochloride, syringe B contained saline or xylazine and syringe e C contained
either the appropriate amount of morphine or an equal amount of saline
solution. Proper groups of three syringes were set up by the study director.
The clinician, unaware of the drugs to be used, administered the contents of
syringes A and B, followed four to five minutes later by C. these procedures
assured the blinding of the clinician who performed the lavage and who made the
assessment of the degree of sedation achieved.<P><B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>Candidate horses for BAL were admitted to this study based on
the individual investigator's assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of
respiratory disease.<P><B>5)  Dosage Form:</B>  All treatments were injectable solutions.<P><B>6)  Route of Administration:</B><P>All treatments were administered by intravenous injection.<P><B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>In part 1, detomidine hydrochloride was administered at 20,
40 or 80 mcg/kg body weight. In part 2, detomidine hydrochloride was
administered at 30 mcg/kg body weight (based on the results of part 
1). Xylazine was administered at 1.1 mg/kg body weight while morphine was
administered at 0.75 mg/kg body weight (but not exceeding 300 mg in any one
animal).<P><B>8)  Test Duration:</B><P>The overall clinical portion of the study (part 2) lasted for 260 days.<P><B>9)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>a)  General Health Status: <BR>1) good, fair, poor; <BR>2) concomitant use of medications (yes, no); <BR>3) severity of respiratory tract disease (mild, moderate,severe).<P>b)  Temperament (easy to handle, somewhat difficult, very difficult,

degree of sedation and production of arrhythmias at the time of the procedure.
The majority of animals were rated by the investigator to have achieved
excellent or satisfactory sedation for the procedure required (xylazine 89&#37;,
xylazine/morphine 85&#37;, detomidine hydrochloride 91&#37;). One horse failed to
become sedated with xylazine and then on a different day with
xylazine/morphine. On both occasions the lavage procedure was impossible to
begin. Detomidine hydrochloride was used the third time in this animal and
satisfactory sedation resulted.<BR>All investigators felt that the level of
sedation produced by all three sedatives was greater than necessary for the
average horse requiring bronco-alveolar lavage. Considering the variability of
the investigators, there was no substantive difference in their comments on
sedation. There was a tendency, however, to classify the drugs differently.
Xylazine sedated horses were rated at a "good" level more often than detomidine
hydrochloride and xylazine/morphine was rated "good" the least (33%, 21%, 9%
respectively). A comment of "too deep" was less frequently applied to xylazine
than the other two treatments (24%, 40%, 40%, respectively).<BR>Examination of the
electrocardiograms on these horses revealed that heart rates of
xylazine/morphine sedated animals increased towards normal before xylazine or
detomidine hydrochloride sedated horses. The groups were similar with respect
to age, weight, medical status, medication at the time of study, disease state,
temperament and breed. No differences were noted in the assessments by various
clinicians which would bias the evaluation of drugs. Clinicians did rate
degree of coordination differently and were also variable on their comments on
sedation. However, these two parameters were judged to be similar between
drugs.<BR>Drug response with xylazine/morphine was different from xylazine and
detomidine hydrochloride. Excitement with or without treatment required
(acepromazine or naloxone) was primarily observed with xylazine/morphine.
Xylazine/morphine sedated animals exhibited excitement after 10-45 minutes in
42&#37; of the cases receiving treatment. Excitement varied from circling and
twitching to severe head pressing. Only one horse receiving xylazine was rated
as excited during recovery and none of the detomidine hydrochloride horses
showed signs of excitation.
<BR>The frequency of producing sinus block or arrest and
severe 2&#176; atrioventricular blocks was greater with detomidine hydrochloride at
5, 10, 30 and 60 minutes than with either xylazine or xylazine/morphine. This
did not adversely influence heart rate and appeared to cause no problem
clinically for the horse.<BR>There were differences in the degree of sedation at
the time of lavage and at 30 minutes and 60 minutes after. At 90 and 120
minutes there was also a difference in the level of sedation between the three
drugs. Detomidine hydrochloride horses were more deeply sedated at these time
intervals. It was concluded that, although there is a tendency for horses to
remain sedated longer with detomidine hydrochloride, xylazine and
xylazine/morphine sedated animals are not less sedated by 90
minutes.<BR>Respiratory rate was similar for all drugs (Fig. 1).<BR>Heart rates were lower in one group before testing (Fig. 2). The heart rate of
horses receiving xylazine/morphine was higher than that observed in horses
given xylazine alone or detomidine hydrochloride. There was no difference
between xylazine, xylazien/morphine and detomidine hydrochloride in the
following parameters:  clinician evaluation as to acceptability for the
procedure, comments on the type of sedation, requirement of twitch,
coordination at the time of procedure, response to lidocaine spray in the
ventral meatus, response to endoscope passage, laryngeal passage elicited
cough, carina stimulation elicited cough, required use of lidocaine, noise
sensitivity, sweating, penile prolapse, difference in heart rate at 5, 10
and 30 minutes post injection as compared to pretreatment heart rates,
respiratory rate throughout the study.<P><B>f)  Conclusions:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride provided sedation and analgesia
suitable for standing restraint and the performance of bronco-alveolar lavage
(BAL) in horses with respiratory disease. Depth of sedation provided by 30 mcg
detomidine hydrochloride per kg body weight, however, may exceed that needed
for BAL.<P><B>g)  Adverse Reactions:</B><P>No adverse reactions to detomidine hydrochloride were
noted. As to side effects, the occurrence of sinus block or arrest and severe
2&#176; atrioventricular blocks was greater in detomidine hydrochloride treated
animals than in animals receiving the other treatments. This did not adversely
affect heart rate and appeared to cause no problem clinically to the animals.

<P><B>6. Sixth Pivotal Study:</B><P><B>a)  Type of Study:</B>  Field efficacy trials in horses.<P><B>b)  Investigator:</B><P>Gordon L. Woods, D.V.M., Ph.D.<BR>New York State College of Veterinary Medicine<BR>Cornell University<BR>Ithaca, NY 14853-6401.<P><B>c)  General Design:</B><P><B>1)  Purpose:</B><P>The objective and purpose of this study was to determine in a
blinded trial whether detomidine hydrochloride at the dose of 20 mcg/kg body
weight is as effective as the combination of xylazine plus morphine for the
degree of sedation and analgesia required to safely perform a flank laparotomy
and ovary removal in the standing mare.<P><B>2)  Test Animals:</B><P>Twenty-six mature, healthy, Standardbred mares aged three to
25 years and weighing 420 to 579 kg were used in this study. Mares within old
(age&#62;10 yrs; n&#61;14) and young (age&#60; 10 yrs; n&#61;12) age groups were assigned
by a computer generated randomization scheme to receive either detomidine
hydrochloride (D) or xylazine plus morphine (X&#43;M).<P><B>3)  Type of Control:</B><P>Xylazine plus morphine (X&#43;M) was used as positive
treatment control. In addition, the investigator was blinded to the identity
of the treatments being administered. For blinding, each treatment was
prepared in two syringes by an individual assigned to this duty (assistant 1 to
the study director) in accordance with the randomization procedure.<BR>The first syringe, labeled I, contained the appropriate amount of either
xylazine or detomidine hydrochloride. The second syringe, labeled II,
contained the appropriate amount of either morphine or an equal amount of
saline solution. Both syringes were also labeled with an additional number in
accordance with the randomization scheme. Another individual (assistant 2 to
the study director), unaware of the drugs to be used, administered the contents
of syringes I and II, as specified and provided by assistant 1, five minutes
apart. The same assistant administered drugs in each instance.<BR>These
procedures assured blinding of the clinician who performed the laparotomy and
oviduct removal and who also made the assessment of the degree of analgesia
achieved. The same clinician did all surgeries.<P><B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>All animals were at day 2 postovulation of the estrous cycle
and were teased every other day to determine standing heat. Animals in heat
were examined rectally every other day on the same day of teasing, or daily if
the follicle was &#62;25mm, to determine the exact date of ovulation.<P><B>5)  Dosage Form:</B>  All drugs were injectable solutions.<P><B>6)  Route of Administration:</B><P>All drugs were given intravenously except
lidocaine (2&#37; without epinephrine) which was administered for inverted lumbar
block.<P><B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride was given at a rate of 20 mcg/kg
body weight, xylazine at 0.67 mg/kg body weight and morphine at 0.67 mg/kg body
weight. About 100 mL of lidocaine were given per animal.<P><B>8)  Test Duration:</B>  Overall the study lasted for 31 days.<P><B>9)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>a)  Animal Information:<BR>1)  Breed, weight, age;<BR>2)  General health status (good, fair, poor);<BR>3)  Concomitant use of medications and description.<P>b)  Dose of detomidine hydrochloride selected (20 mcg/kg body weight).<P>c)  Animal temperament (easy to handle, somewhat difficult, very

hours;<BR>5)  Sedation for intended procedure (unsatisfactory,
satisfactory, excellent).<P><B>e)  Results:</B>  Results are presented by parameter in Table 1.<P><B>f)  Conclusions:</B><P>In this study, detomidine hydrochloride was a safe and
efficacious sedative/analgesic for purposes of the surgical
procedures to which test animals were exposed.<P><B>g)  Adverse Reactions:</B><P>None were noted. Side effects included sweating and piloerection.<P><b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 6 columns.)</b><P><pre><b>

<B>7. Seventh Pivotal Study:</B><P><B>a)  Type of Study:</B>  Clinical efficacy study in horses<P><B>b)  Investigator:</B><P>Doyne Hamm, D.V.M.<BR>Research for Animal Health, Inc.<BR>Route 13, Hunt Lane<BR>Fayetteville, AR  72701.<P><B>c)  General Design of Investigation:</B><P><B>1)  Purpose:</B><P>The purpose of this controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the
effectiveness of detomidine hydrochloride for sedation and analgesia in mares
tranquilized for the purpose of suturing vulval lips (conventional Caslick's
operation) in comparison with an approved sedative drug, acepromazine
maleate.<P><B>2)  Test Animals:</B><P>Suitable animals (39 mares) were randomly allocated to
treatment with either 20 mcg/kg body weight (12 mares) or 40 mcg/kg body weight
detomidine hydrochloride (14 mares), or acepromazine maleate (13 mares). In
the first replicate, 21 mares were treated. In the second replicate, 18 mares
were treated.<P><B>3)  Type of control:</B><P>Acepromazine maleate was used as positive treatment
control. Use of negative treatment control was not appropriate. In addition,
this was a blinded study. animals were assigned to treatment groups in
accordance with a randomization chart. Treatments were applied by a separate
clinician who, alone, had access to the randomization chart. The investigator
was unaware of the treatment administered and did the scoring and rating
without knowing which drug was used for the individual patient.<P><B>4)  Diagnosis:</B><P>Diagnostic procedures were not used since the need for suturing
the vulvar lips of mares is most often self-evident, especially after
foaling.<P><B>5)  Dosage Form:</B>  All treatments were injectable solutions.<P><B>6)  Routes of Administration:</B><P>All treatments were administered intravenously
except lidocaine.<P><B>7)  Dosages Used:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride was administered
at either 20 or 40 mcg/kg body weight. Acepromazine maleate was administered
at .066 mg/kg body weight (3 mg/100 lbs. body weight). Lidocaine (2&#37;) was
administered in all horses in  amounts sufficient to provide adequate local
anesthesia.<P><B>8)  Test Duration:</B><P>The first replicate (21 mares) was conducted in July, 1986
and the second replicate (18 mares) in January, 1987.<P><B>9)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>a)  Analgesia:<BR>
Reaction to surgical preparation, to the injection of lidocaine
and to the initiation of surgery were used for assessing intensity of
analgesia. Analgesic intensity was rated very strong, strong, moderate or
slight. Duration of analgesia was determined by the pin prick method applied
at 10 minute intervals. Overall analgesic effects were rated very satisfactory,
satisfactory or unsatisfactory.<P>b)  Sedation:<BR>
Sedation was assessed by clinical observation of the following
parameters:  The lowering of the head; the widened distance between ear tips;
the reduction in response to sensorial stimuli, and the initial instability.
Onset and duration of effects were timed in minutes. Depth was rated slight,
moderate, deep, or very deep. Overall sedative effects were rated very
satisfactory, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory.<P>c)  Calming effects on fractious animals:<BR>
Handling before treatment was rated
easy, somewhat difficult, very difficult, or impossible.<P>d)  Side effects.<P><B>d)  Results:</B><P>Results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Although the average
time to onset of clinical signs of sedation after detomidine hydrochloride
injection was less after 40 mcg/kg than after 20 mcg/kg (1.96 min. vs 2.42
min.) (Table 1), the time period for signs to become fully established was the
same (4.07 min. vs 4.08 min.). As expected, duration of sedative effects was
greater after the 40 mcg/kg dose (62.14 min. vs 46.0 min.). Similarly,
analgesic effects appeared more rapidly after 40 mcg/kg than after 20 mcg/kg
(3.82 min. vs 4.0 min.), and duration was greater (43.21 min. vs 31.25
min.).<BR>Scores for both doses of detomidine hydrochloride were rated very satisfactory
with regard to their suitability for the intended procedure (Table 2). The 40
mcg/kg dose provided a deeper sedative effect than 20 mcg/kg (2.93 vs 2.0) and
a more intense analgesic effect (3.21 vs 2.42).<P><B>e)  Conclusions:</B><P>Both dose levels of detomidine hydrochloride provided the
level of sedation required for the intended purpose. A higher percentage of
very difficult to handle horses in the 40 mcg/kg detomidine hydrochloride dose
group did not reflect negatively on the capability of detomidine  hydrochloride
to induce sedation quickly and prolong it for a full hour.<BR>The combined sedative and analgesic effects of detomidine hydrochloride made
this drug suitable for the intended purpose and may have added an additional
measure of safety for the investigator suturing the vulvar lips.<BR>An assessment
of all data indicated that 20 mcg/kg detomidine hydrochloride sufficed for the
intended purpose, although 40 mcg/kg detomidine hydrochloride provided a more
rapid and deeper sedation. <P><B>f)  Adverse Reactions:</B><P>No adverse reactions were noted in this study.<P><b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 4 columns.)</b><P><pre><b>

White II<BR>Professor<BR>Marion du Pont Scott Equine Medical Center at Morven Park<BR>P.O.B.1938<BR>Leesburg, VA 22075.<P><B>b)  Test Animals:</B><P>A total of 165 horses, 1 mule and 1 donkey were treated;
121 horses, 1 mule and 1 donkey were treated once with the low dose (20
mcg/kg body weight) and 42 horses were treated once with the high dose (40
mcg/kg body weight) of detomidine hydrochloride intravenously. Two cases had
to be removed due to non-adherence to the protocol (one foal; one case treated
intramuscularly not intravenously). This left 165 cases for evaluation. Mares
were represented with 50.3&#37; of all cases, 15.5&#37; were stallions and 34.2&#37;
geldings. All animals were older than 12 months of age and pregnant mares were
excluded from this study. The following breeds were represented:
Thoroughbreds (34.1&#37;); Quarter-horses (26.3&#37;); Arabs (10.8&#37;); Standardbreds
(5.4&#37;); all ponies (3.6&#37;); Appaloosas (3.0&#37;). With less than 3&#37; of the total,
the following breeds were entered:  Belgian, Grade, Tennessee Walking Horse,
Morgan, Peruvian Paso, Anglo Arabs, Miniature Horses, Paint, American Saddle
Bred. Mixed breeds totaled 4.2&#37;. One female mule and one female donkey were
admitted.<P><B>c)  Type of Control:</B><P>This was an open clinical trial in which each animal
served as its own control by virtue of its response to treatment for colic.
The severity of abdominal pain accompanying colic was determined prior to (time
0) and after drug administration (15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes) using a
standardized subjective scoring system designed to describe the following
clinical parameters common to equine colic:  sweating, kicking, pawing, head
and body movements, attitude and appetite. In addition, time of onset and
duration of analgesia and sedation were determined, and the strength of the
drug effects rated. The investigators were asked to evaluated the drug
response regarding analgesia and sedation on a scale ranging form "highly
satisfactory" to "not satisfactory".<P><B>d)  Dosage Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>The clinician was advised to
select from two doses, 20 or 40 mcg/kg, in accordance with the strength and
duration of the drug effect desired. Instruction was given to administer
detomidine hydrochloride intravenously.<P><B>e)  Other Information:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride has analgesic and sedative
properties. Both effects increase in strength and duration with increased dose
levels. Producing temporary relief of abdominal pain in horses showing the
clinical signs of colic could serve as a clinical demonstration of the drug's
effectiveness.<P><B>f)  Results and Conclusions:</B><P>Of the 167 cases of colic admitted to this study,
165 could be evaluated. Detomidine hydrochloride was given intravenously once
to 123 cases (121 horses, one mule, one donkey) at the dose of 20 mcg/kg body
weight, and to 42 horses
at the dose of 40 mcg/kg body weight. The higher dose was used predominantly
in horses with severe pain (40 mcg/kg vs 20 mcg/kg: 52&#37; vs 24&#37;) which were more
often in poor health (25.6&#37; vs 12.2&#37;) and were more frequently given a poor
prognosis (30&#37; vs 19&#37;). The investigators gave the following diagnosis and/or
explanation for the cause of abdominal pain:  impaction (19.7&#37;); spastic or
spasmodic colic (17.9&#37;); bowel displacement, mostly of the colon (16.2&#37;);
intestinal obstruction (12.1&#37;), including cases with enteroliths (2.3&#37;);
tympanic colic (5.8&#37;); ileus due to gastritis and/or enteritis (5.2&#37;);
verminous arteritis and thromboembolic colic (4.0&#37;); ileus, without further
symptoms (3.5&#37;); postoperative intestinal adhesions (1.7&#37;); small intestine
volvulus and incarceration (92.3&#37;); and individual cases of acute gastric
dilatation; one scrotal and one inguinal hernia; herniation after accident;
cecocolic; intussusception; postoperative ileus due to peritonitis; ruptured
large bowel; hypervolemia; renal disease; excitement and trauma; and one case
of a cervical fracture mimicking a terminal colic. In 5.8&#37; of all cases the
correct diagnosis or the cause for abdominal pain remained unknown. Sedation
and analgesia, rated as satisfactory or highly satisfactory, was achieved in
95.2&#37; and 90.4&#37; of all cases, respectively, without obvious differences between
doses, sex, breed and species.<P><B>2. Second Corroborative Study:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride for surgical embryo
transfers, laparoscopies, and aspiration of oocytes in horses.<P><B>a)  Investigator:</B><P>A.O. McKinnon, B.V.Sc.<BR>Veterinary Teaching Hospital<BR>College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences<BR>Colorado State University<BR>Fort Collins, CO  80523.<P><B>b)  Test Animals:</B><P>A total of 211 mature, healthy, light-horse-breed mares (125
Quarter horses, 48 Quarter horse crosses, 7 Thoroughbreds, 6 Thoroughbred
crosses, 3 Arabs, 8 Appaloosas, 4 Paint horses,6 Grade horses,
3 Morgans, 1 undescriptive crossbred) were entered into this study. Of
these, 17 cases were omitted from the study for having received a different
dose of detomidine hydrochloride (six cases received 30 mcg/kg) or because
surgical procedures differed form those specified in the protocol (11 cases,
e.g., ovariectomy, oviduct catheterization, oocyte transfer into follicles or
tying of the oviduct.)  For this analysis, 194 cases were used:  104 as
recipients of embryos, 69 for oocyte collection and 22 for oviduct removal.<P><B>c)  Type of Control:</B><P>With regard to a horse's predictable response without
sedation and analgesia to the evaluation and surgical procedures used in this
study, each animal served as its own physiological control. Results of the use
of detomidine hydrochloride were evaluated on the basis of the investigator's
prior experience with these procedures using other widely accepted drug
treatments, with the well-known physiological responses of horses to noxious
stimuli, and in light of the results of the similar, well controlled trials
summarized in preceding pivotal study number six.<P><B>d)  Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride was
administered at 20 mcg/kg body weight or, in animals initially regarded by the
investigator as fractious, at 40 mcg/kg body weight. About 20 mL of lidocaine
were administered for oocyte collection while about 100 mL were given for
embryo transfers. Detomidine hydrochloride was administered intravenously.
Lidocaine (2&#37; without epinephrine ) was administered by infiltration (line
block) for embryo transfers and by subcutaneous and intramuscular injections
for oocyte collection.<P><B>e)  Other Information:</B><P>The following parameters were measured in this study:<P><B>1)  Animal Information:</B><P>a)  Breed, weight, age;<BR>b)  General health status (good, fair, poor);<BR>c)  Concomitant use of medications and description.<P><B>2)  Dose of detomidine hydrochloride selected</B> (20 or 40 mcg/kg body weight).<P><B>3)  Animal temperament</B> (easy to handle, somewhat difficult, very difficult,
violent, twitch necessary - yes/no).<P><B>4)  Sedation:</B><P>a)  Time from injection to first effects (minutes);<BR>b)  Coordination (stable, slight ataxia, ataxic, very ataxic, went down);<BR>c)  Depth of sedation during procedure (slight, moderate, deep, very deep);<BR>d)  Describe depth of sedation at 30, 60, 90 minutes, two hours, four hours;<BR>e)  Sedation for intended procedure (unsatisfactory, satisfactory,
excellent).<P><B>5)  Analgesia:</B><P>a)  Response to exteriorization of ovary/oviduct (none, slight, moderate,
violent, unable to continue);<BR>b)  Detailed pain related response to manipulating oviduct:<BR>1)  Movements away - forward/backward (none, slight, moderate, severe);<BR>2)  Movement up or down (none, slight, moderate, severe);<BR>3)  Reaction of ipsilateral hind leg (none, lifting only, kick attempted,
full kick).<P>c)  Twitch required (yes, no);<P>d)  Analgesia for oviduct manipulation (unsatisfactory, satisfactory,
excellent).<P><B>6)  Side effects</B> (sweating, piloerection, describe others) The information
obtained from these parameters provides corroborative support for the efficacy
of detomidine hydrochloride for the indications tested. <P><B>f)  Results and Conclusions:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride  produced a satisfactory
or excellent rating for sedation in 97.9&#37; of cases
and for analgesia in 98.4&#37; of cases. Neither the sedation rating nor the
analgesia rating differed between the 20 and 40 mcg/kg dose levels. The mean
time to first effect - 39.4 seconds - was similar for the two dose levels.
Depth of sedation was higher at 15 minutes through two hours following
injection for 40 mcg/kg, but not at four hours following injection. The
pregnancy rate (75&#37;) after transfer procedures done under the influence of
detomidine hydrochloride was rated very satisfactory. No adverse reactions
were clinically observed during this study. Sweating was the only side effect
observed with the exception of some piloerection in four animals. Although
sweating occurred in approximately twice as many of the cases at the higher
dose than at the lower dose (43&#37; and 23&#37;, respectively), the duration did not
differ.<P><B>3. Third Corroborative Study:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride for Standing Castration of Stallions.<P><B>a)  Investigator:</B><P>A.O. McKinnon, B.V.Sc., M.Sc.<BR>Veterinary Teaching Hospital<BR>College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences<BR>Colorado State University<BR>Fort Collins, CO  80523.<P><B>b)  Animal Species and Number per Group:</B><P>A total of 17 stallions were randomly
assigned to receive 25 mcg/kg detomidine hydrochloride (n &#61; 2), 30 or 35 mcg/kg
(n &#61; 9) and 40 or 50 mcg/kg (n &#61; 6).<P><B>c)  Type of Control:</B><P>No treatment control. Each animal served as its own
control with regard to treatment responses.<P><B>d)  Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>Dosages used are given in b)
above. Drug was administered intravenously except for 2&#37; lidocaine which was
used for local anesthesia in all but one case.<P><B>e)  Other Information:</B><P>This was a range-finding study for the purpose of
determining a suitable dose for standing castration of stallions.<P><B>f)  Results and Conclusions:</B><P>Sedation occurred within less than one minute
(0.66 minutes over all animals) and was fully established by 2.6 minutes
(ranges 0.3 to 1 minute for 25 to 35 mcg/kg and two to four minutes for 40 to
50 mcg/kg). Sedation was regarded as moderate (25 to 35 mcg/kg) to deep (40 to
50 mcg/kg) and lasted 90 minutes (20-25 mcg/kg) to 96.6 and 110 minutes for
the 30 to 35 mcg/kg and the 40 to 50 mcg/kg dose groups, respectively.
Sedation was rated satisfactory for the two lower dose groups and more than
satisfactory for the highest dose group. Analgesia was regarded as between
slight and moderate for all animals, but was rated very satisfactory across
dose groups. Instability was seen in six
horses and sweating occurred in four animals. One  animal having received the
highest dose (50 mcg/kg) showed respiratory abnormalities. Overall, side
effects lasted about one hour (range:30 to 90 minutes). No side effects were
seen with the lowest dose group but instability and/or sweating were observed
in five of nine and five of six animals in the 30-35 mcg/kg and the 40-50
mcg/kg dose groups, respectively. These side effects were characterized as
between slight and modest.<P>Conclusion:<P>Detomidine hydrochloride at doses of 30 mcg/kg and higher provided
sufficient sedation and analgesia to allow for castration of the mature
stallion in the standing position, but additional local anesthesia was needed.
Observations made with the only animal castrated without local anesthesia,
which had received 50 mcg/kg, indicated that the analgesia provided by
detomidine hydrochloride was not deep enough to make the procedure completely
painless. For this humaneness consideration and for the safety of the surgeon
and by-standers, the use of additional local anesthesia with detomidine
hydrochloride for castration of the stallion is mandatory.<P><B>4. Fourth Corroborative Study:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride in Open Cases of Minor Surgery of Horses. <P><B>a)  Investigator:</B><P>Dr. J. E. Lowe, (79 cases, 80 treatments)<BR>Assoc.

Hamm (6 cases)<BR>Research for Animal Health, Inc.<BR>Route #13, Hunt Lane<BR>Fayetteville, AR 72701.<P><B>b)  Test Animals:</B><P>A total of 103 horses were used with 104 treatments
administered. Breeds involved:  Quarter horses and Quarter horse mixes:  23;
ponies and mixes: 27; Thoroughbreds and mixes:  28; Standardbred:  13;
Trakhenen:  4; Arabs and mixes:  3; nondescript mixes:  3; one Morgan and one
warm blooded horse. Sex: 74 mares; 25 geldings; 5 stallions. Animals were
treated
(1) for the development of disease models, or models of minor surgery, e.g., a
colic model or flank incisions for flank incisions for ovariectomy, embryo
transfer or oviduct removal (34 cases); (2) for minor or major surgeries,
dentistry or pain relief, e.g., ovariectomy per vaginam, suturing of
lacerations, attendance of wounds, repair of chronic rectal-vaginal cloaca,
removal of a sarcoid tumor, cases of abdominal pain due to colic or enteritis
and others (29 cases); (3) diagnostic procedures to which these animals were
known to react adversely, like rectal or vaginal
examinations, stomach tubing and others (9 cases); and (4) sedation for
behavioral control in animals with undesirable behavioral traits, for example
mares not allowing the foal to suckle; mares not standing for natural breeding;
animals difficult to load on a trailer and others (32 cases).<P><B>c)  Type of Control:</B><P>These were studies of individual cases, using each animal
as its own control with regard to responses to treatment.<P><B>d)  Dosage Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>Animals were treated
intravenously with detomidine hydrochloride (10 mg/mL). Since much of this
work was exploratory in nature, a wide range of doses was used; but the
majority of cases were treated with either 20 mcg/kg or 40 mcg/kg body weight,
43.35 and 27.9&#37;, respectively. The following additional doses were used:
&#60;10 mcg/kg:  3.85&#37;; 10 mcg/kg:  2.9&#37;; 30 mcg/kg:  7.7&#37;; 50 mcg/kg:  3.85&#37;;
60, 70 and 80 mcg/kg:  2.9&#37; each; 160 and 247 mcg/kg:  0.97&#37; each.<P><B>e)  Other Information:</B><P>Before treatments, animals were classified as easy to
handle (20.8&#37;), somewhat difficult to handle (50.5&#37;), very difficult to handle
(24.8&#37;) and impossible to handle (too dangerous in general) (3.9&#37;).<P><B>f) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>Sedation for the intended purpose was rated as very
satisfactory in 77.9&#37;, satisfactory in 17.3&#37; and unsatisfactory in 4.8&#37; of all
cases. Analgesia was evaluated in 64 cases, and was rated as very
satisfactory, satisfactory or unsatisfactory in 75.4&#37;, 21.5&#37; and 3.1&#37;,
respectively. With increasing dose, duration of the drug effect increased.<BR>Side effects were seen with 17.3&#37; of all treatments, with instability and
sweating seen most often (together 72&#37;). At doses of 20 or 40 mcg/kg, most
side effects were rated as slight or moderate. Diureses was evident with
higher doses (80 and 160 mcg/kg).<BR>Doses below 10 mcg/kg were used to evaluate the effect of such doses in riding
horses under the saddle. Doses between 5 and 10 mcg/kg seem to be too heavy to
allow the animal to perform well. Doses below 5 mcg/kg appeared to make
fractious horses easier to handle and to ride. Side effects were minor and
minimal. In this heterogenous population with a wide spectrum of indications,
the 20 and 40 mcg/kg body weight doses were shown to be the most suitable and
widely used for all intended purposes.<P><B>5. Fifth Corroborative Study:</B> Detomidine Hydrochloride in Fractious Horses.<P><B>a) Investigator:</B><P>Dr. R.M. Miller<BR>Conejo Valley Veterinary Clinic<BR>1850 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd.<BR>Thousand Oaks, CA 91362.<P><B>b) Test Animals:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride was used in 19 animals (7 mares,
4 stallions, 5 geldings, and 3 mules: 2 females and 1 gelding).
Breeds involved were: Unbroken mustangs (3); Thoroughbreds (7); Peruvian Paso
(2); Morgan (1); Arabian (1); Hanoverian (1) and Grade Horse (1). In addition,
three mules, owned by the investigator were treated.<P><B>c) Type of Control:</B><P>In this open study each animal was used as its own control
with regard to responses to treatment.<P><B>d) Dosage Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>Detomidine hydrochloride was used
with doses of 20 (n&#61;13) or 40 mcg/kg (n&#61;6). Seventeen animals were treated
intravenously; one unbroken mustang intramuscularly, and one unbroken mustang
was, after 20 mcg/kg intramuscularly, sedated enough to receive quickly
thereafter another 20 mcg/kg intravenously.<P><B>e) Other Information:</B><P>In this study, animal were classified prior to treatment
as: Easy to handle (n&#61;2); somewhat difficult to handle (n&#61;4); very difficult to
handle (n&#61;6) and impossible to handle (too dangerous in general or did not
tolerate the intended procedure) (n&#61;7). Of the two easy to handle horses, one
needed sedation for cast removal. the other was a case requiring emergency
preanesthesia. Of the seven horses too difficult to handle, three were
unbroken mustangs.<BR>
Indications were as follows: change of wound dressing, bandage removal (3);
attending fresh injuries (3); cast removal (1); radiography (1); for tube
deworming (1); removal of an in-grown halter in a mustang (1); difficult
injections (face; injured legs (2); horse shoeing (1); body clipping (1);
dentistry (2) and a combination of dentistry and vaccinations in mules (3).<BR>Time until first signs of drug effect as well as time deep sedation had
occurred were recorded. Sedation, and if possible, analgesia, were evaluated
and rated on a scale from "Not satisfactory" (1) to "Very satisfactory" (4).<P><B>f) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>Sedation after administration of 20 mcg/kg or 40
mcg/kg detomidine hydrochloride intravenously was evident within two and one
minute, respectively, and was rated as deep within four and three minutes,
respectively. In all six animals treated with 40 mcg/kg, and in 10 of 12
animals treated with 20 mcg/kg, sedation was rated as "very satisfactory". The
remaining two animals were sedated satisfactorily. Attention to analgesia was
paid only in five horses and was rated "very satisfactory" in all animals.<BR>In mules, the onset of sedation and of analgesia occurred, as seen in horses,
in two and three to four minutes, respectively. Sedation was rated "very
satisfactory" in two animals and "satisfactory" in one animal. Analgesia was
"very satisfactory" in one mare and was "unsatisfactory" in another mare and a
gelding.<BR>Only instability as a side effect was recorded in horses and mules, lasting
five to 30 minutes. It was rated moderate in six animals, and strong in one
animal.<BR>All fractious or unbroken horses and mules evaluated responded to detomidine
hydrochloride (20 or 40 mcg/kg intravenously) with sedation which was suitable
for a variety of clinical procedures. Analgesia, whenever evaluated, was rated
very satisfactory. In mules, analgesia was less well developed and therefore
rated unsatisfactory in two out of three animals treated.<P><B>V. Animal Safety:</B><P>Three pivotal and four corroborative studies have shown that, at the two doses
tested clinically, detomidine hydrochloride is a safe drug. Like other alpha
2-agonists, it causes an initial rise in blood pressure, followed by bradycardia
and episodes of heart block. Cardiovascular studies revealed that these
effects are not centrally mediated, but are peripheral baroreceptor responses.
The full cardiovascular effect of the drug is evident with a dose of 20 mcg/kg.
Higher doses only prolong the period of hypertension and bradycardia. From the
combination of factors involved, it was concluded that myocardial oxygen
demands are being met and no direct ischemic effects are experienced. Doses up
to 200 mcg/kg, given three times with a one day interval between doses, were
well tolerated.<P><B>A. Pivotal Studies:</B><P><B>1.

e)  Gross Pathology on Necropsy:<BR>All eight horses receiving the highest dose
of 3 x 400 mcg/kg, all animals in the 3 x 200 mcg/kg and all animals in the 3 x
120 mcg/kg treatment groups were sacrificed by pentobarbital injection six to
seven hours after the last treatment. Four of the eight placebo treated horses
and four horses treated with 40 mcg/kg in replicates 1 to 4 were similarly
sacrificed six to seven hours after the last drug administration (day 3 of
the 3-day treatment period).<P>f)  Histopathology:<BR>Histopathological examinations were performed by a board
certified pathologist on all organs found affected and on all target
tissues.<P><B>d)  Results:</B><P>Degree of Sedation:<BR>Full drug effects were seen by 15 minutes
after treatment. Return to sedation score 1 or below was similar in all groups
on days one and two, but on day three this decline was recorded sooner with all
doses. This seemed to indicate that drug tolerance may occur over time when
the drug is given repeatedly at short intervals. This tolerance did not
influence the depth of drug effect, but only its duration.<P>Behavior (mental attitude):<BR>The change in behavior toward "depressed"
and "sedated" (conditions which were fully established within 15 minutes),
their dose dependency and duration, were closely tied to the "degree of
sedation". Return to baseline levels clearly took longer as dosage increased:
for 40, 120, 200 and 400 mcg/kg return times were 3, 4 to 5, 5 to
6 and &#62;6 hours, respectively. For this parameter, no evidence of drug
tolerance was discernible.<P>Equilibrium:<BR>Effects were at their maximum within 15 minutes. Higher
scores were seen with higher doses and their duration was greatly extended
accordingly. Return to baseline levels took almost three hours for the 1x dose
and five, five to six and &gt;six hours for the 3x, 5x and 10x doses,
respectively. No drug tolerance seemed to develop with this parameter over
time.<P>Muscular disturbances:<BR>No muscle tremors were seen during the study.<P>Sweating:<BR>Sweating occurred in a dose related manner with sweating
scores increasing with dose and the persistence of sweating prolonged. This is
one of the few parameters where the peak of action with all doses was reached
at about one hour after treatment. A plateau was reached and with increasing
dose, the drop in scores occurred after 2, 4, 5 and 5 hours for the
1x, 3x, 5x and 10x doses, respectively. There was a clear diminution in
sweating with 3x, 5x and 10x over time:  less sweating was seen after the
second treatment and even less after the third treatment.<P>Temperature:<BR>Body temperature responded to treatments in a dose related
manner. Temperature initially rose, reaching peak levels uniformly after one
hour, with increases of about 0.5&#176; F, 1&#176; F, 2&#176; F and
2&#176; F for the 1x, 3x, 5x and 10x doses, respectively. With the 5x and
10x dose a short plateau was attained and temperatures dropped steadily
thereafter. Baseline temperatures were reached approximately 2, 3, 4
and 5 hours after treatment for the 1x, 3x, 5x and 10x doses, respectively.
With the two highest doses, the increases were slightly less pronounced on days
2 and 3 of treatment.<P>Heart Rate:<BR>With all doses of detomidine hydrochloride, heart rate
dropped to its lowest value (about 50&#37; of normal) within 15 minutes. Even with
the higher doses, the value at 15 minutes was the lowest achieved. The time of
return to normal values was extended with increasing dose:  with 1x to the
second observation hour, with 3x to the fourth hour, and with 5x and 10x to the
fifth and sixth hour after treatment, respectively. Duration of bradycardia
seemed to closely reflect the duration of sedation in a dose related fashion.
With the 3x and the 5x doses, return to normal was slightly shorter on the
third treatment day.<P>Heart Rhythm:<BR>Frequency and duration of irregularities in heart beats
increased with dose. In general, the return to normal heart rhythm occurred
earlier than did the return to normal heart rate. This occurred with 1x after
about 1 hour and 3x, 5x and 10x after 2, 2 to 5, and 3 to 5
hours, respectively. During the entire study, none of the horses appeared to
be seriously compromised regarding their cardiovascular functions. With the 1x
dose the incidence of irregularities seemed to be higher on the third day while
with the 3x and 5x dose, the return to normal took longer during the second
hour of observations.<P>Color of Mucous Membranes of the Lip:<BR>The change form normal to blue or
cyanotic was dose related in intensity and duration. Peak levels (score 1 with
1x; score 3 with 3x, 5x and 10x) were reached within 15 to 30 minutes. The
decline in scores over time was similar and parallel to those for heart rate.
There were no differences between treatment days. Return to baseline occurred
within about 1 hour with 1x and within 2 to 3, 4 to 5 and &#62;6 hours with 3x,
5x and 10x doses, respectively.<P>Respiratory Rate:<BR>All treatments caused an initial drop of about 30&#37; in
the respiratory rate which lasted about 30 minutes with no dose relationship
evident in its magnitude. Thereafter, respiratory rates rose in the 3x, 5x and
10x group, reaching maximum levels within the second hour and drifting back to
normal levels thereafter.<P>Respiratory System:<BR>Additional Observations:  No additional
observations were made in animals receiving the placebo treatment of the 1x
dose treatment. Dyspnea was seen occasionally (&#60;5&#37; of the observation
periods) with the horses receiving the 3x dose, but was seen more frequently
(about 15-16&#37; of the observation periods) and over extended time periods (from
15 minutes to 2 hours) in the 5x and 10x dose groups. Dyspnea seemed to have
occurred less frequently on the third treatment day. Abnormal respiratory
sounds were heard once each with the 3x and 5x dose, and twice with the 10x
dose, i.e., in less than 1&#37; and less than 2&#37; of all observation periods,
respectively. Panting was never seen with the placebo and the 1x dose group;
however, it was seen during six observation periods with the 3x group (about
4&#37;) and during 23 observation periods (16&#37;) with the 5x and with the 10x dose
groups. Most episodes of panting (about 85&#37;) occurred during the first three
hours. There were no clear differences between treatment days. Nasal discharge
was seen twice with the 3x and the 10x dose but never with the placebo, 1x of
5x dose. No abnormal color of mucous membranes was seen nor any incidence of
apnea observed.<P>Gastrointestinal Functions:<BR>No abnormalities were seen with any of the
treatments during or after the observation periods.<P>Urination:<BR>Frequency of urination was increased in a dose related
manner. While only two episodes were recorded with the placebo during 3 x 3
hours of observation, 11 were seen with 1x, 17 with 3x, 14 with 5x and 21 with
the 10x dose. Over 3 x 6 hours, 25, 28 and 41 episodes of urination were seen with
the 3x, 5x and 10x dose treatments, respectively. With increasing frequency of
urination, the urine became more pale and less turbid. Most episodes were seen
during the second, third, fourth and sixth hour after treatment with the higher
doses. There were few differences between treatment days.<P>Salivation:<BR>An increase in salivation (frequency of occurrence and
duration) was clearly dose related. It was recorded in 1.3&#37; of the observation
periods with the placebo and in about 26&#37;, 55.5&#37;, 60&#37; and 64&#37; of all
observation periods with the 1x, 3x, 5x, and 10x doses, respectively. Duration
of salivation was clearly linked to the duration of sedation. In the
investigator's judgement, there was a clear relationship between the "hanging
head", typical for sedation, and the occurrence and duration of salivation.
There was little difference between treatment  days 1 and 2, but on treatment
day salivation was obviously reduced.<P>Ocular Conditions:<BR>Nystagnus was recorded once, in the 5x dose group,
occurring in the sixth hour of observation. Pupillary dilation was seen
frequently and in a dose related manner. It was observed in 12&#37; of the
observation periods with the 1x dose and in 26&#37;, 38&#37; and 36&#37; with the 3x, 5x
and 10x doses, respectively. These dilations occurred mostly within 30 to 45
minutes after treatment  and were seen almost exclusively (95&#37;) during the
first, second and third hour of observation. There were no obvious differences
between treatment groups. Blepharospasms were seen occasionally, in 5&#37;, 1.3&#37;,
and 6&#37; of the observation periods with the 3x, 5x and 10x doses respectively.
Periocular edema, especially eyelid edema, was observed in 3&#37; of the
observation periods with the 1x dose, in 15&#37; with the 3x dose and in 19&#37; and
22&#37; with the 5x and 10x doses, respectively. Its occurrence was equally spread
over the second to the sixth observation hour. there was an obvious trend to
develop less edema, and of shorter duration, in some of the animals by the
third treatment day. This may have been a result of the prolonged "hanging
head" period in the higher dose groups. The reduction in edema on day 3 may
reflect the loss of fluid via the increased frequency of urination and sweating
seen on prior treatment days.<P>Penis Prolapse:<BR>In the 15 geldings used in this study, penis prolapse
was seen during four post treatment periods:  after three consecutive
treatments in the same animal of the 1x dose treatment group (each time over
several hours) and once in one animal in the 3x dose group at about five hours
after treatment during one observation period only. This is corroborated by
previous observations the investigator made during dose response trials. Penis
prolapse is difficult to predict and may occur only sporadically.<P>Food and Water Consumption:<BR>All animals returned to normal eating and
drinking patterns as sedative drug effect diminished. This was reflected in
the amount of food consumed.<P>Body Weight:<BR>Body weight losses occurred with the 3x, 5x and 10x dose
in an almost dose related manner, with means (ranges) of 4.75&#37; (1.9-8.2 kg).
3.66&#37; (&#43; 2.1 to 11.0 kg) and 6.4&#37; (4.9&#37;-10.7 kg), respectively. Since animals
did not change in their appetite, fluid loss by sweating and increased
urination may, in part, be responsible for the weight loss seen with the three
higher doses.<P>Laboratory Data:<BR>The evaluation of laboratory data provided by two
contract laboratories (Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and Whitbeck
Laboratories, Springdale, AR 72764) allowed for the breakdown of blood
chemistry data into five distinct groups.<P><DL>
<DT>1)  Values which had increased after the third treatment but such increases
were within the physiological range:
<DD>a)  Total and Direct Bilirubin: With higher dose, levels increased in a dose
related fashion;
<DD>b)  BUN and SGOT (AST): Increase only with the 10x dose;
<DD>c) Creatinine (serum): The baseline was very low, actually below the range
given by the laboratory. The 1x and 10x treatments were followed by a slight
increase.<P><DT>2) Values which had increased above the physiological range after the third
treatment:
<DD>a) Glucose: There was a sharp, dose related increase; highest levels were seen
with 10x.<P><DT>3) Values which had decreased after the third treatment but remained within the
physiological range:<BR><DD>a) Calcium: This decrease was clearly dose dependent, with the highest levels
seen with the 10x dose;
<DD>b) Total Protein and Albumin: The 10x dose caused a drop in values.
<DD>c) Sodium: Only the 10x dose caused a decrease;
<DD>d) Chloride: The 3x and the 5x dose caused some decline in values.<P><DT>4) Values which decreased below the physiological range:<BR><DD>a) Chloride: Only the 10x dose resulted in such a decrease.<P><DT>5) Values which remained unchanged:<BR><DD>a) Potassium, Globulin, SDH and Amylase;<BR><DD>b) Globulin baseline levels in this population were higher than the
physiological range.<P><DT>6) Enzyme and isoenzyme analysis:<BR>
<DD>Only the 10x dose had any effect on these parameters compared to other groups.
The 10x dose increased values for &#37; CPK isoenzyme MB, International Units of
LDH F1 and F2, and the ratio of LDH F1 and F2 over all other groups, and for &#37;
LDH isoenzyme F1 over placebo. The percent CPK isoenzyme BB was decreased at
the 10x dose compared to placebo and 1x dose. Differences in six other
parameters were removed by correcting parameters were similar across doses.<P><DT>7) Observations with hematology data:<BR><DD>No apparent differences were seen between values before and after treatments in
WBC, RBC, platelets, partial prothrombin time, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, polynucleated neutrophiles, banded
neutrophiles, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophiles and basophiles.<P><DT>8) Observations with urine analysis:<BR><DD>Treatments caused no apparent changes in urine pH but treatments with the 3x,
5x and 10x dose caused a rather uniform drop in specific gravity to levels
below the physiological range, reflecting the uncontrolled loss of electrolytes
via sweating.<P></DL>
Post-mortem:<BR>One of eight horses in the highest (10x) dose group showed
drug related microscopic lesions of myocardial necrosis. No significant gross
or histopathological changes were seen in the other seven horses.<P><B>e) Conclusions drawn from the study:</B><P>Based on these results, it was concluded that dosages of 20 or 40 micrograms of
detomidine hydrochloride per kilogram of body weight are safe for use in
horses. Dosages of 400 mcg/kg of body weight may cause microscopic lesions of
myocardial necrosis in some animals.<P><A HREF="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/fda/infores/foi/140862/140862part3.html>Continue to Part 3</A>

<B>2. Second Pivotal Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B> Target animal safety in horses: cardiac effects.<P>

<B>b) The Investigators for this Study were:</B><P>
Harold E. Garner, DVM, PhD, and R. Dustan Sarazan, DVM<BR>
Dalton Research Center and Equine Center at Middlebush Farm<BR>
Dept. of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery<BR>
College of Veterinary Medicine<BR>
Universiy of Missouri-Columbia<BR>
Columbia, MO 65211.<P>

<B>c) General Design of the Study:</B><P>

<B>1)Purpose:</B><P>

To use the chronically instrumented, conscious pony model to
evaluate the effects of detomidine on cardiac function; to determine if
detomidine has an effect on coronary blood flow and therefore on the nutrient
and oxygen supply to the myocardium; to explore the mechanism responsible for
the hypertension and bradycardia characteristic of this class of drug.<P>

<B>2) Test Animals:</B><P>

Six healthy domestic ponies, body weight 170&#177; 14 kg. Each
animal was surgically instrumented with a micromanometer to measure left
ventricular pressure, a Doppler flow probe to measure coronary arterial flow
velocity, and sonimicrometer crystals in the left ventricular subendocardium to
measure myocardial segment length.<P>

<B>3) Dosage Form:</B><P>

The injectable dosage form used in this study is identical in
composition to the drug which is to be marketed.<P>

<B>4) Dosages Used:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride was administered at dosages of 10,
20, 40 or 60 micrograms per kilogram
of body weight and were compared to xylazine administered
at a level of 1.1 milligrams per kg of body weight or saline placebo.<P>

<B>5) Route of Administration:</B> All dosages were administered intravenously.<P>

<B>6) Test Duration:</B><P>

Each pony received a series of seven injections at
approximately three day intervals.<P>

<B>7) Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>

a) Heart rate<P>
b) Peak ventricular pressure<P>
c) End diastolic pressure<P>
d) dP/dt max<P>
e) Myocardial segment shortening<P>
f) Myocardial stroke work<P>
g) Minute work<P>
h) Coronary arterial flow velocity<P>
i) Double product<P>
j) Bradycardia vs. hypertension<P>

<B>d) Statistical Analysis:</B><P>

This study proceeded according to a 6x7 extra period
Latin square design created to correct for residual drug effects. Tests for
residual effects were performed by analysis of variance for repeated measures
with residual effects. A balanced set of data for repeated measures analyses
was obtained by discarding the data from the seventh (extra) period. When
residual effects were not found to be significant by this method, the data were
analyzed by analysis of variance for repeated measures using the SAS computer
program. Mean comparisons were performed by the method of least significant
difference. Significance tests were performed at the p&#60;0.05 level. <P>

<B>e) Results:</B><P>

<B>1) Heart Rate:</B><P>

Average heart rate prior to injection in all 36 experiments was
56.6&#177; 1.2 per minute. Heart rate was slightly reduced at the 4-hour sample
following the saline treatments (53 per minute). This reduction was attributed
to the acclimation of the animals to the laboratory over the duration of an
experiment. Heart rates measured at 1 minute following injections were lowest
with the 40 and 60 mcg/kg doses of detomidine (18.3 and 19.5 per minute,
respectively). These values are significantly less than the value for xylazine
(29.2 per minute). Heart rates at 1 minute for the 10 and 20 mcg/kg doses of
detomidine were intermediate between xylazine and the higher detomidine doses
but were not significantly different from either group. Heart rates had
recovered by approximately 60&#37; and were not significantly different from each
other at 5 minutes following xylazine or detomidine treatment at all doses
tested. The duration of significant bradycardia produced by detomidine at 10
and 20 mcg/kg and xylazine at 1.1 mg/kg was 120 minutes. The decrease in heart
rate following detomidine dosages of 40 and 60 mcg/kg persisted for the entire
240 minutes of the experiment.<P>

<B>2) Peak Ventricular Pressure:</B><P>

Average peak systolic ventricular pressure prior
to injection in all 36 experiments was 113.7 &#177; 2.3 mmHg. There were no
significant differences in peak pressure in the saline experiments over the
4-hour period. At 1 minute following injection there were significant
differences in the systolic pressure values among saline, xylazine and the
detomidine 10 and 20 mcg/kg doses (110, 150, 177 and 198 mmHg, respectively).
There were no significant differences in systolic pressure at 1 minute among
the 20, 40 and 60 mcg/kg detomidine dosage groups (199.2 &#177; 5.0 mmHg).
Although no differences were observed in the maximum pressure with all but the
lowest detomidine dose, the duration of the hypertension demonstrated a dose
dependent response. Peak ventricular pressure returned to control values by 10
minutes following xylazine and the 10 mcg/kg dose of detomidine, by 60 minutes
following the 20 mcg/kg dose and by 120 minutes following the 40 and 60 mcg/kg
doses of detomidine. The only significant decrease in peak ventricular
pressure occurred with the 10 mcg/kg dose of detomidine at 45, 60 and 120
minutes post injection.<P>

<B>3) End Diastolic Pressure (EDP):</B><P>

Average left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure prior to injection in all 36 experiments was 27.44 &#177; 1.7 mmHg.
There were no significant differences in EDP in the saline experiments over the
4 hour period. EDP was significantly higher than the pre injection value at 1
minute following injection of xylazine and all four doses of detomidine. EDP
appeared to continue to increase beyond the 1 minute sample with the 60 mcg/kg
dose of detomidine although the values were not statistically different. The
duration of the increase in EDP was 5 minutes with xylazine and 1, 30, 60 and
60 minutes with detomidine at 10, 20, 40 and 60 mcg/kg, respectively.<P>

<B>4) dP/dt max:</B><P>

Average dP/dt max prior to injection in all 36 experiments was
1332.8 &#177; 39 mmHg/sec. dP/dt max was never significantly different from the
pre-injection value during the 4-hour period following saline injection. Of
all drug treatments tested, dP/dt max was lowest during the 1 minute sample
following xylazine treatment (831.3 mmHg/sec). This was significantly lower
than the values for all of the detomidine doses. The detomidine doses were not
significantly different from each other (1007 &#177;30 mmHg/sec). The duration
of the decrease in dP/dt max was 60 minutes for xylazine and the 10 mcg/kg dose
of detomidine, 120 minutes for the 20 and 40 mcg/kg doses and at least 240
minutes for the 60 mcg/kg dose of detomidine.<P>

<B>5) Myocardial Segment Shortening (%SS):</B><P>

Average segment shortening prior to
injection in all 36 experiments was 27.0 &#177; 0.6%. There were no significant
differences in %SS from the pre injection value during the 4-hour period
following saline injection. At 1 minute post injection with xylazine and all
doses of detomidine tested, the values for %SS were significantly less than pre
treatment values although not significantly different from each other (14.8 &#177;
0.6%). The duration of the reduction in %SS compared to pre-injection values
was 15 minutes for xylazine, 30 minutes for detomidine at 10 and 20 mcg/kg and
60 minutes for detomidine at 40 and 60 mcg/kg.<P>

<B>6) Myocardial Stroke Work (SW):</B><P>

Average stroke work prior to injection in all
36 experiments was 137.7 &#177; 4.7 mmHg*mm. There were no significant
differences in SW from the pre injection values during the 4-hour period
following saline injections. At 1 minute post injection with xylazine and all
doses of detomidine tested, the values for SW were significantly different from
each other (99.0 &#177; 8.1 mmHg*mm). The duration of the reduction in SW was 10
minutes for detomidine at 20 and 40 mcg/kg, 15 minutes for xylazine and
detomidine at 60 mcg/kg and 60 minutes for detomidine at 10 mcg/kg. SW was
reduced below pretreatment values again at 240 minutes in the 60 mcg/kg
studies.<P>

<B>7) Minute Work (MW):</B><P>

Average minute work prior to injection in all 36
experiments was 7378 &#177; 270 mmHg*mm/minute. There were no significant
differences in MW from the pre injection values during the 4-hour period
following saline injections. At 1 minute post-injection, MW was reduced in all
xylazine and detomidine experiments, however MW values in these cases were not
significantly different from each other (2174 &#177; 176 mmHg*mm/minute). The
pattern of recovery of MW was similar in all drug treatments through 60 minutes
post-injection. The duration of the depression in MW was 60 minutes for
xylazine, 120 minutes for detomidine at 20 mcg/kg and 240 minutes for
detomidine at 10, 40 and 60 mcg/kg. MW was not significantly less than pre
injection values at the 60 and 120 minute samples in the 60 mcg/kg detomidine
experiments.<P>

<B>8) Coronary Arterial Flow Velocity:</B><P>

Average coronary blood flow velocity at the
site of the Doppler flow probe prior to injection in 35 experiments was 19.8
&#177; 1.0 cm/sec. There were no significant differences in flow from the saline
injections. At 1 minute post injection, coronary flow was significantly reduced
in all xylazine and detomidine experiments, however these values were not
significantly different from each other (12.4 &#177; 0.7 cm/sec). Flow had
recovered to pre treatment values by 45 minutes in the xylazine and the
detomidine 10 mcg/kg experiments. In the 20, 40 and 60 mcg/kg detomidine
experiments, coronary flow was still significantly less than pre-treatment
values at 4 hours although the 60 mcg/kg values was not significantly lower at
120 minutes.<P>

<B>9) Double Product:</B><P>
Although not subjected to statistical analysis, the product
of heart rates and peak ventricular pressures were plotted to provide a
different index of myocardial oxygen consumption. Since wall tension is the
most important determination of oxygen consumption, it was felt that the double
product may have some advantage over minute work at the very high after loads
encountered in these experiments.<P>

<B>10) Bradycardia vs Hypertension:</B><P>

Peak ventricular pressure and the period
between systoles (60 divided by heart rate) were plotted for all 42 experiments during
the first 45 seconds following injection. In nearly all of the non-saline
experiments, the rise in ventricular pressure clearly preceded the increase in
intersystolic period (bradycardia) by several cardiac cycles. This pattern is
consistent with a baroreceptor response to hypertension. In order to test the
validity of using peak ventricular pressure to draw conclusions about the
baroreceptor response, a catheter tipped pressure transducer was placed in the
aorta of one pony during three experiments. Mean aortic pressure and peak
ventricular pressure were plotted during the first 5 minutes post injection.
Although pressure variations tended to become out of phase during the paired
contractions which typically occurred during the first minute, the two variable
correlate fairly well (R^2=0.67).<P>

<B>f) Conclusions Drawn from the Study:</B><P>

1) The duration of hypertension caused by detomidine is dose dependent but the
degree is not; all doses tested resulted in a similar degree of
hypertension.<P>

2) All doses tested produced similar heart rate reductions at one minute post
injection.<P>

3) The dP/dt max data were indicative of decreased cardiac contractile force
while segment shortening data were consistent with a response to increased
afterload and not necessarily to decreased cardiac contractile force.<P>

4) The minute work variable uniformly decreased with all doses tested except
for an exceptional decrease in the 60 mcg/kg group, possibly indicating reduced
myocardial oxygen consumption.<P>

5) Coronary blood flow velocity decreased with all doses tested; however,
minute work and dP/dt max data indicated myocardial oxygen consumption may also
be reduced. It thus seems reasonable that myocardial oxygen demands are being
met and there are no significant, direct ischemic effects of detomidine on the
heart.<P>

6) The relationship between hypertension and bradycardia was found to be
consistent with an adaptive baroreceptor response to the increased pressure and
inconsistent with a primary drug induced bradycardia.<P>

7) No evidence of drug related acute or chronic life threatening complications
were observed.<P>

8) Detomidine hydrochloride is safe for use in horses, with regard to cardiac
function parameters, at the recommended dosages.<P>

<B>c) General Design of Investigation:</B><P>

<B>1) Purpose:</B><P>

This study was to determine the effects of detomidine hydrochloride
on cardiovascular functions.<P>

<B>2) Test System:</B> Eight mature female horses.<P>

<B>3) Dosage Form:</B><P>

Injectable dosage form used was identical in composition to the
product which is to be marketed.<P>

<B>4) Dosages Used:</B><P>

Dosages of 20, 80 and 160 mcg/kg of body weight were
administered to each of the eight horses. A two week clearance time was
allowed between treatments.<P>

<B>5) Route of Administration:</B> Intravenous injection<P>

<B>6) Test Duration:</B> Seven weeks.<P>

<B>7) Pertinent Parameters Measured:</B><P>

The parameters evaluated included:
electrocardiogram, blood pressure (systolic, mean, diastolic), heart rate, rate
pressure product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure as an index to
myocardial O2 demand), and respiratory rates. These parameters were evaluated
at 5 minute intervals during the first hour and then at 30 minute intervals
until the completion of each experiment. Clinical pathological data included:
blood, serum and urine analysis. Each horse had a pre trial evaluation of
packed cell volume, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, blood gases
and pH, liver enzymes and electrolyte values. At 15 and 30 minutes after the
administration of the drug, blood glucose, blood gases and pH values were
determined. One hour after the start of the procedure, BUN, blood glucose,
blood gases, pH and urinalysis were completed, and at four hours, BUN, blood
glucose, blood gases, pH, urinalysis, liver enzymes and electrolytes were
evaluated.<P>

<B>d) Results:</B><P>

Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate responses of each
dosage are presented in tabular form in the following three tables. Arterial
pO2, pH and pCO2 responses are presented in Figures I, II and III. Respiratory
responses included an initial slowing of respiration within a few seconds to
1-2 minutes after the administration of the drug. At the 160 mcg/kg dosage
level, slow respiration lasted up to 5 minutes after the administration of the
drug. After this, respiratory rates increased to control values or higher as
shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3. There was an initial decrease followed by an
increase in tidal volume. The respiratory pattern frequently could be
described as pauses of up to 30 seconds between breaths which might be followed
by 3-8 breaths in a close pattern. Mucous membrane color, as an index to
tissue level oxygenation, deteriorated primarily at the 160 mcg/kg dosage
level. This was confirmed by reduced arterial blood oxygen levels. At the
deepest level of analgesia and sedation, usually 15 minutes post injection,
arterial blood gas analysis indicated the lowest level for oxygen available
also occurred as shown in Figure I. The arterial pH stayed normal or slightly
elevated (Figure II) and in some horses there was evidence of increased
ventilation reflected by lower CO2 values than in controls (Figure III).
Acidosis was not evident in these studies (Figure II).<BR>
Tables 1, 2 and 3 illustrate the cardiovascular responses to varying levels of
detomidine hydrochloride administration. Table 1 indicates an initial drop in
blood pressure at the 20 mcg/kg dosage level and a drop in heart rate. Tables
2 and 3 show heart rates also dropped with the 80 and 160 mcg/kg
administrations. At the 80 mcg/kg level systolic blood pressures increased
within five minutes of administration of the drug. The heart rates dropped
within 30 to 60 seconds after the administration of detomidine hydrochloride
and in some instances dropped to as low as 10-15 beats per minute. Heart block
occurred in several instances. Compensation for drops in heart rates  was
exemplified in these horses by an increase in systemic blood pressures as shown
in Tables 1, 2 and 3 at the 20, 80 and 160 mcg/kg dosage levels. In some
horses, the heart block or bradycardia that was present was very transient and
in others the bradycardia lasted for up to 60 minutes. All horses made
uneventful recoveries.<BR>
Arterial blood gases and pH were analyzed as were the blood glucose levels.
Detailed analysis of the urine values, serum electrolytes and enzymes and CBC's
was not completed. The values for these parameters were within normal ranges
for the horse. Thus, it was concluded that they were not adversely affected by
the administration of detomidine hydrochloride.<P>

<B>e) Conclusions:</B><P>

The effects of detomidine hydrochloride on cardiovascular
function appear to be minimal and are not medically significant. Bradycardia
was present in some horses but in most cases was very transient and did not
last for more than 60 minutes. Blood and serum chemistry parameters were within
normal ranges for the horse. Accordingly, it is concluded that blood and serum
chemistries are not adversely affected by the administration of detomidine
hydrochloride.<P>

<B>B. Corroborative Studies:</B><P>

<B>1. First Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B><P>

This study was intended to investigate the safety margin of
detomidine hydrochloride in the horse.<P>

<B>b) Investigator:</B><P>

I. Alitalo<BR>
Dept. of Surgery<BR>
College of Veterinary Medicine<BR>
University of Helsinki<BR>
Helsinki, Finland.<P>

<B>c) Test Animals:</B><P>

Two healthy mature mares and two healthy mature stallions were
used with one animal used for each dosage administered.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B> Each animal served as its own control.<P>

<B>e) Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

Each horse was administered
intravenously a single dose of 1600, 800, 600 or 400 micrograms of detomidine
hydrochloride per kilogram of body weight. The horses were clinically healthy
prior to the study. After the administration of detomidine hydrochloride,
their heart rate and respiratory frequency were measured at 5 minute intervals
during the first 30 minutes, thereafter at 15 minute intervals for one hour,
and finally at 1 hour intervals. Other clinical observations were made at the
same intervals. Blood samples were taken prior to the administration of
detomidine hydrochloride, 30 minutes thereafter and in connection with
euthanasia. The samples were studied for hemoglobin, PCV and leukocytes, which
were also differentiated. The following parameters were studied from serum:
Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Cl, Gluc., Urea, Prot., ASAT, ALAT, AFOS, CK, GT, BIL. The
horses were euthanized by administering an anesthetic dose of thiobarbiturate
followed by T 61 preparation. Autopsy was performed on the following day on
horses receiving the two highest doses.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

This study is considered to be corroborative because the
effects of extreme overdosage with detomidine hydrochloride are reported.<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Heart
rates are presented in Table 1. At the highest dosage (1600 mcg/kg), the heart
rate remained at the same level as before the injection for the first 60
minutes and only after that decreased considerably. At smaller dosages, the
heart rate decreased immediately after the injection. At the smallest dose, it
started to rise again 40 minutes after the injection.<BR>
The respiratory frequency is presented in Table 2. The frequency remained
about the same irrespective of the dose, even though there were temporary
variations. All dosages caused difficulties in respiration. This was
connected with snoring side tones both in inhaling and exhaling, as well as
respiratory arrests. At the final stage, strong fluidity could be heard in the
lungs. At the same time, horses 2-4 suffered from excretion of blood flecked
froth from the nostrils.<BR>
In all horses, hemoglobin and hematocrit values rose considerably towards the
end of the trial.<BR>
Serum potassium, glucose and protein values rose in all horses except No. 1
(1600 mcg/kg), in which urea increased. Of serum enzymes, ASAT, ALAT, AFOS and
CK rose in horse No. 1, in which the trial lasted longest. The increase in
values occurred at the end of the trial. A pathological anatomical examination
performed after euthanasia revealed a general stasis of the body and edema,
which was particularly prominent in the eyelids and conjunctiva, as well as
elsewhere in the head and pharynx region.<BR>
Dosages from 10 to 40 times the maximum recommended dosage of detomidine
hydrochloride cause severe cardiovascular and respiratory changes which may
become irreversible and fatal in one to seven hours if steps are not taken to
reverse the effects. Studies at 10 times the maximum recommended dose and lower
are summarized under "pivotal" animal safety studies in this FOI Summary.<P>

<B>2. Second Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B><P>

Evaluation of cardiovascular and respiratory effects in horses.<P>

<B>b) Investigator:</B><P>

Farmos Group Ltd.<BR>
Research Center<BR>
Laboratory of Pharmacology<BR>
SF-20101 Turku, Finland and<BR>
Farm Animal Center, Masku, Finland.<P>

<B>c) Test Animals:</B><P>

Three mature healthy horses (two geldings and one stallion)
were used in this study. One gelding was a cold-blooded horses, the others
were warm-blooded. No groups were formed. Each animal received all of the
treatments given below.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B><P>

Each animal was used as its own control. Response to
detomidine hydrochloride was compared to that of xylazine (positive control) or
with placebo (negative control). This was a randomized, blinded study, in which
the investigators' assistants knew only if the animal was treated intravenously
or intramuscularly.<P>

<B>e) Dosage Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride: 100, 200
and 300 mcg/kg of body weight intravenously and intramuscularly. Xylazine:
400, 800, 1200 mcg/kg intravenously only. Placebo (saline solution):
intravenously only. All treatments were given once to each animal.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

The following parameters were evaluated after each
treatment:<P>
<DL>
<DD>1. Direct arterial blood pressure via a permanent catheter placed in the left
carotid artery connected to a blood pressure meter.
<DD>2. Respiratory rate
<DD>3. Heart beat rate
<DD>4. Electrocardiogram
</DL>
Parameters 2 to 4 were obtained via disposable electrodes placed on the rump at
the correct positions.<BR>
After each injection, parameters 1 to 3 were measured in one minute intervals
for 15 minutes; thereafter at 20,25,30,40,50,75,90 and 120 minutes after
injection. Measurements were continued in hourly intervals until values had
returned to starting levels.<BR>
Electrocardiograms were recorded continuously for the first 10 minutes, and
thereafter at 15,20,30,40,50 and 60 minutes. Further measurements were
conducted hourly until values had returned to normal.<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride decreased heart rate to
43-66 percent of the initial values depending on dose level and route of
administration. After intramuscular administration the drop was less
pronounced and slower than after intravenous administration. The lowest levels
were reached within five minutes after intramuscular administration and within
two minutes after intravenous administration. Recovery to normal values was
similar with both routes f administration and took two to five hours. Xylazine
depressed heart rate to 70-81 percent of the initial levels depending on dose
level. The lowest levels were reached within approximately two minutes.
Recovery to initial values took 20-60 minutes.<BR>
The PR interval on electrocardiograms seemed to be prolonged slightly both with
detomidine hydrochloride and xylazine, but no systematic difference was
observed.<BR>
Second degree atrioventricular and sinoauricular blocks were encountered after
administration of detomidine hydrochloride given intramuscularly within six to
eight minutes. Second degree atrioventricular blocks lasted for one to three
hours. Individual variations were great. After intravenous injection, the
second degree atrioventricular blocks started immediately and continued equally
long. At the lowest dose the second degree atrioventricular blocks showed the
latest onset and the shortest duration. Sinoauricular blocks were much less
frequent than second degree atrioventricular blocks. They started with six
minutes and continued for four to 40 minutes depending on dose level and route
of administration. With xylazine second degree atrioventricular and
sinoauricular blocks appeared during the first one to two minutes and
disappeared after five minutes. Mild, quickly passing arrhythmias were
observed with both agents.<BR>
After administration of detomidine hydrochloride, mean blood pressure initially
increased quickly to 143-164 percent of the starting levels; thereafter it
returned gradually to normal values in three to seven hours. Blood pressure
increased more rapidly and to higher levels after intravenous administration
than after intramuscular administration. Maximal values were reached after
60-90 minutes (intramuscular) and 25-30 minutes (intravenous), respectively.
Xylazine increased blood pressure quickly initially; thereafter it caused a
fall in blood pressure to 79-86 percent of the initial values. Maximal levels
were reached in one minute and the minimum in 15-90 minutes. Recovery to
normal values took 90-120 minutes. In general, detomidine hydrochloride caused
slight stimulation of respiration. After intravenous administration, however,
a transient respiratory depression appeared at first but was followed by an
increase of respiratory rates above initial levels. Xylazine initially
produced a slight stimulation of respiration and thereafter slight
depression.<BR>
Detomidine hydrochloride, administered intravenously and intramuscularly, at
doses far above therapeutic doses, induced a rapid and dose dependent increase
in arterial blood pressure and a consistent bradycardia in horses which were
accompanied by atrioventricular blocks. No serious arrhythmias were detected.
Respiratory rate was slightly increased. Xylazine was found to decrease blood
pressure and depress the respiration rate at recommended therapeutic doses.<P>

<B>3. Third Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B><P>

Use of atropine to control heart rate responses.<P>

<B>b) Investigator:</B><P>
Charles E. Short, DVM, MS, DACVA<BR>
New York State College of Veterinary Medicine<BR>
Cornell University<BR>
Ithaca, NY 14853<P>

<B>c) Animal Species and Number per Group:</B><P>

Four female horses were used in each of
two groups.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B> Each animal served as its own control.<P>

<B>e) Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

The experimental design consisted
of administration of 20 mcg/kg intravenously of detomidine hydrochloride to
each of four horses to determine if bradycardia, with or without heart block,
would occur. Following the development of bradycardia, 0.02 mg/kg intravenous
atropine was administered to correct the bradycardia. After a minimum time
delay of one week, the same four horses were used with the administration of
0.02 mg/kg intravenous atropine administered prior to detomidine hydrochloride
to determine if the atropine would prevent the occurrence of bradycardia and/or
heart block in the same four horses. Four additional horses were used with 40
mcg/kg intravenous detomidine hydrochloride administered in a similar manner as
with the previous four horses.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

Dosages used and the route of administration were as
described above. This study is supportive because it illustrates the
usefulness of atropine in preventing bradycardia and heart block in horses
treated with detomidine hydrochloride. <P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Results of the study are summarized in Figures 1
through 4. This study illustrated that atropine may be effectively utilized to
prevent or correct bradycardia heart block when detomidine hydrochloride is
used in horses at dosages of 20 or 40 micrograms per kilogram of body weight.<P>

<B>4. Fourth Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B><P>

Evaluation of the interaction of detomidine hydrochloride and
a cholinesterase inhibiting anthelmintic in horses.<P>

<B>c) Test Animals:</B><P>

Three Standardbred, clinically healthy horses were used in the
study: one two year old mare (horse 2), and two stallions, five and seven years
old (horses 1 and 3).<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B><P>

Each animal served as its own control with regard to
physiological responses to treatments. Post treatment values for each horse
were compared with values obtained immediately prior to treatment.<P>

<B>e) Dosage Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

Thirty mcg/kg body weight of
detomidine hydrochloride were given intravenously to all three horses on days
0, 6 and 13 at 8:00 A.M. On day 5, 3.5g/100kg body weight Neguvon (trichlorfon;
dimethyl (2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl) phosphonate) were administered by
nasogastric tubing at 8:00 P.M., to all three animals.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride is a potent alpha2-receptor
agonist. It has been shown to have typical sympathomimetic effects: the blood
pressure rises initially, the heart rate decreases, transient atrioventricular
and sinoatrial blocks may occur. Higher doses result in an elevated blood
glucose level, piloerection, sweating and diuresis. Anticholinesterase agents
inactivate or inhibit acetylcholinesterase and thereby intensify the activity
of endogenous acetylcholine. The effects of cholinesterase inhibitors are
mainly parasympathomimetic, such as increased salivation, vomiting,
hypermotility of the gastrointestinal tract, urination, bradycardia and
hypotension.<BR>
The study was undertaken to investigate the possible interactions between a
co-administered cholinesterase inhibiting anthelmintic and detomidine
hydrochloride in the horse.<BR>
The following clinical observations were recorded: sedation (dropping of the
head), analgesia (pin-prick response), body temperature, heart rate,
respiratory rate and side effects every 10 minutes for two hours after each
treatment, thereafter in 60 minute intervals for four more hours, and in 120
minute intervals for the next six hours.<BR>
Blood samples were taken on days -1, +1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12 and 14 and analyzed for Na,
K, Ca, Mg, P, Cl, glucose, urea, protein, ASAT, ALAT, AFOS, Hgb, PCV, leucocyte
count.<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

All horses responded to each treatment with
detomidine hydrochloride with deep sedation and clear indications of analgesia.
No differences were seen in the depth and duration of response between
treatment days with individual animals, but there were differences, especially
with analgesia, between animals. Body temperatures varied within physiological
ranges. The extent of bradycardia and of sinoatrial heart blocks, and their
duration, did not differ between treatment days. Influences on respiratory rate
were the same for each horse on each treatment day. Staggering was the only
side effect recorded, without differences between treatment groups. All blood
values corresponded with reference values for horses. No abnormalities were
observed. It was concluded that no interactions occurred between the two
drugs.<P>

<B>5. Fifth Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B><P>

Ocular irritation study of detomidine hydrochloride in rabbit.<P>

<B>b) Investigators:</B><P>

Dr. Lauri Nieminen, Tuulikki Vuorijarvi, and Sinikka Laine<BR>
Farmos Group Ltd. Research Center<BR>
Toxicology Laboratory<BR>
Turku, Finland.<P>

<B>c) Test Animals:</B> Six adult female New Zealand white rabbits.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B><P>

Each animal served as its own control. The right eye of
each test animal received 0.1 mL of sterile, pyrogen free physiological
saline.<P>

<B>e) Dosage Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

The rabbits received a single 0.1
mL dose of the proposed market formulation (10 mg/mL) instilled into the
conjunctival sac of the left eye. The eyelids were held together for one
second following instillation.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

Eyes of all rabbits were examined at 24, 48 and 72 hours
after instillation of the test and control articles.<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Neither detomidine hydrochloride solution
administered at a clinically used dosage, nor an equal volume of control
solution caused any changes in the cornea or iris of any treated rabbit. No
redness, swelling or discharge were observed in conjunctivae. The ocular
irritation potential of the proposed market formulation is therefore considered
to be very weak.<P>

<B>6. Sixth Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B> Primary skin irritation in guinea pig.<P>

<B>b) Investigators:</B><P>

Dr. Lauri Nieminen, Tuulikki Vuorijarvi, and Sinikka Laine<BR>
Farmos Group Ltd. Research Center<BR>
Toxicology Laboratory<BR>
Turku, Finland.<P>

<B>c) Test Animals:</B><P>

Twelve outbred female Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B><P>

Three of the 12 animals received applications of saline
solution only.<P>

<B>e) Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride was
dissolved in sterile, pyrogen-free physiological saline to produce
concentrations of 10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL. Each of three groups of
three animals received one of the test solutions. One half mL of the
appropriate solution was placed on each of two gauze pads (2x2 cm) and the pads
were applied to shaved, and both abraded and intact, areas of dorsal skin on
each animal. The two pads on each animal were held in place with adhesive
tape.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

Dorsal hair was shaved from each animal and the shaved
area divided into two 4x4 cm areas. One are was parallel grossly abraded using
an 18 gauge needle while the other area was left intact. Four hours after
application of the test solutions, initial observations of the treated areas
were made. The areas were then cleansed with sterile, pyrogen free distilled
water. Additional observations were made daily thereafter for eight
consecutive days. Evaluations of skin reactions (erythema, edema) were scored
as follows: none (score 0), very slight (score 1), well defined (score 2),
moderate to severe (score 3), severe (score 4).<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Neither erythema (score 0) or edema (score 0) was
observed in any animal of any test group during the study for either intact or
abraded skin. Behavior and appearance of all test animals remained normal.
The dermal sensitization potential of detomidine is therefore considered to be
very weak.<P>

<B>7. Seventh Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B> Acute oral toxicity.<P>

<B>b) Investigator:</B><P>

Dr. Lauri Nieminen<BR>
Farmos Group Ltd., Research Center<BR>
Toxicology Laboratory<BR>
Turku, Finland.<P>

c<B>) Test Animals:</B> Sixteen outbred adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing
from 194 to 209 grams each, divided into four groups of four animals each.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B> None.<P>

<B>e) Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride was
dissolved in sterile pyrogen-free water to produce concentrations of 3 mg/mL
and 18 mg/mL. Dose volumes were either 3.4 or 10 mL/kg body weight. Dose
groups received either 10, 30, 60 or 180 mg/kg body weight one time by gavage.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>

Behavior, appearance and mortality were observed for two
weeks after dosing. Animals which died during this period or were sacrificed
at study termination were subjected to autopsies for macroscopic organ
examinations.<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride induced sedation,
piloerection and exophthalmos at all dose levels. These effects disappeared
within one and two days in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively.
In the remaining two groups, sedation disappeared two days
after dosing, but piloerection was still observed two
weeks after dosing. No mortalities were observed in the 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg
groups. Two of four animals in the 60 mg/kg group died and all in the 180
mg/kg group died. The estimated LD 50 value was 60 mg/kg. According to
macroscopic findings at autopsy, the cause of death was detomidine induced
acute gastric dilatation. These results indicate that detomidine hydrochloride
is well absorbed when administered orally.<P>

<B>8. Eighth Corroborative Study:</B><P>

<B>a) Type of Study:</B> Subacute oral toxicity.<P>

<B>b) Investigator:</B><P>

Dr. Lauri Nieminen<BR>
Farmos Group Ltd., Research Center<BR>
Toxicology Laboratory<BR>
Turku, Finland.<P>

<B>c) Test Animals:</B><P>
Sixty outbred Sprague-Dawley rats (30 males, 30 females).
Males ranged in weight from 171 to 266 grams and females ranged in weight from
146 to 184 grams. Six rats of each sex were used in each of five dose
groups.<P>

<B>d) Type of Control:</B><P>
Twelve animals received tap water as negative control and
12 animals received a solution of clonidine hydrochloride as positive
control.<P>

<B>e) Dosages Used and Route of Administration:</B><P>

Detomidine hydrochloride was
dissolved in tap water to produce dosing solutions containing 20 mcg/mL, 200
mcg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Clonidine hydrochloride was dissolved in tap water to
produce a dosing solution containing 200 mcg/mL. Dosages of detomidine
hydrochloride were 100 mcg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, and 10 mg/kg
body weight. Clonidine hydrochloride was dosed at 1 mg/kg body weight. All
doses were administered orally by gavage daily for three and one-half weeks at
a dose volume of 5 mL/kg body weight.<P>

<B>f) Other Information:</B><P>
Behavior, appearance and mortality were observed daily.
Animals were weighed twice per week and food and water consumption of each cage
of six animals was measured once per week. Autopsies and related tests were
performed on animals which died during the study and on animals which were
sacrificed at study termination. The following parameters were evaluated:
hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte count, leucocyte and differential leucocyte
counts, thrombocyte count, red blood cell indices (MCH, MCHC, MCV), ASAT,
creatinine, macroscopic and microscopic organ examinations, actual and relative
organ weights.<P>

<B>g) Results and Conclusions:</B><P>

Mortalities were as follows: water control group:
one male died due to dosing error; clonidine control group: all six females
died, no males died; detomidine hydrochloride (100 mcg/kg): no deaths;
detomidine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg): no deaths; detomidine hydrochloride (10
mg/kg): all six females and three of six males died. Autopsies indicated that
damage to gastric mucosa was a contributing factor in these deaths. Results of
evaluations of other parameters were as follows: behavior: in all clonidine and
detomidine groups irritability was observed in connection with dosing, after
which sedation and piloerection were observed. Appearance: weight loss was
observed in clonidine treated females and in both sexes of the 10 mg/kg
detomidine group. Diarrhea was noted in males of the 10 mg/kg detomidine group
and to a lesser extent in some females of this group. Weight gains for males
were slightly inhibited in the clonidine group and in the 1 mg/kg detomidine
group, but actual weight losses were observed in males of the 10 mg/kg
detomidine group. Females in the clonidine and 10 mg/kg detomidine groups
exhibited an almost linear decrease in body weight during the first week.
Slight inhibition of weight gain was noted in both sexes of the 1 mg/kg
detomidine group. Food consumption was inhibited in both sexes of the 10 mg/kg
detomidine group during the first week but was less marked during the second
and third weeks. Water consumption in animals of this group was slightly
inhibited throughout the study. Hematocrit for males in the 1 mg/kg detomidine
group showed a decreasing tendency, and in males in the 10 mg/kg detomidine
group a marked decrease was noted. Brain and adrenal weights tended to
increase in males of the 1 and 10 mg/kg detomidine groups and a definite
increase in brain weights was seen in females of the 1 mg/kg detomidine group.
Spleen weights for males in the lowest detomidine group tended to decrease.
Testes weights of males in the 1 and 10 mg/kg detomidine groups showed marked
increases. No other significant effects were noted. Microscopic examinations
revealed no effects attributable to detomidine treatment. These results
indicate that detomidine hydrochloride is well absorbed when administered
orally.<P>

<B>VI. Human Safety</B><P>

<B>C. Drugs for Use in Non-Food Animal:</B><P>

<B>2. Drugs for Use in Horses:</B><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of
drug residues in food, were not required for approval of this NADA. The drug
is approved for use only in horses that are not to be used for food and is to
be labeled: "Warning: Not for use in horses intended for food."<P>

<B>D. Human Safety Considerations Other Than Food Safety:</B><P>
Care should be taken to
assure that detomidine hydrochloride is not inadvertently ingested as safety
studies have indicated that the drug is well absorbed when administered orally.
Standard ocular irritation tests in rabbits using the proposed market
formulation have shown detomidine hydrochloride to be non-irritating to eyes.
Primary dermal irritation tests in guinea pigs using up to five times the
proposed market concentration of detomidine hydrochloride on intact and abraded
skin have demonstrated that the drug is non-irritating to skin and is
apparently poorly absorbed dermally. However, in accordance with prudent
clinical procedures, exposure of eyes or skin should be avoided and affected
areas should be washed immediately if exposure does occur. As with all
injectable drugs causing profound physiological effects, routine precautions
should be employed by practitioners when handling and using syringes to prevent
accidental self injection.<P>

The labeling contains the following human warning: Not for human use. Keep out
of reach of children.<P>

<B>VII. Agency Conclusions:</B><P>

The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
They demonstrate that Dormosedan (detomidine hydrochloride) when used under its
labeled conditions of use is safe and effective.<P>

For the safe and effective use of Dormosedan (detomidine hydrochloride) it is
necessary to provide a differential diagnosis of the pain causing pathology
which only a trained professional can accomplish. Additionally, the expertise
of a trained professional is required to determine the level of sedation
required for the various veterinary techniques that may be employed with the
use of this drug. Accordingly, we have classified Dormosedan (detomidine
hydrochloride) as a prescription item. <P>

<b>General Principles For Evaluating The Safety Of Compounds Used In
Food-Producing Animals</b><p>
Revised July 1994<P>
U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services Public Health Service<BR>
Food And Drug Administration Center For Veterinary Medicine<P>

FDA is required by the general safety provisions of sections 409, 512, and 706
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to determine whether each
food additive, new animal drug, or color additive proposed for use in
food-producing animals is safe for those animals and whether the edible
products derived from treated animals are safe. The pertinent regulations
implementing the statutory provisions are found at 21 CFR part 70, 21 CFR
514.1, and 21 CFR Part 570.<P>
The sponsor of the compound is required to furnish to FDA the scientific data
necessary for demonstrating that the residues of the sponsored compound in the
edible products of treated animals are safe. FDA has developed a series of
guidelines to inform sponsors of the scientific data that FDA believes will
provide an acceptable basis for determining the safety of the compound. The
individual guidelines are listed below.<p>

A guideline represents the agency's position on a procedure or practice at the
time of its issuance. A guideline is not a legal requirement. A person may
follow the guideline or may choose to follow alternate procedures or practices.
If a person chooses to use alternate procedures or practices, that person may
wish to discuss the matter further with FDA/CVM to prevent an expenditure of
money and effort on activities that might later be determined to be
unacceptable. The guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or
confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or benefits for or on any person.
When a guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or regulation,
however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not changed in any
way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.<P>
Although sections 409, 512, and 706 of the act and their implementing
regulation vary slightly in wording, they have a common purpose- assuring the
safety of the residues that people will consume from tissues of treated
animals. Therefore, FDA believes that the same testing requirements should
apply to a new animal drug or a food or color additive used in food-producing
animals. When evaluating the safety of a new animal drug, section 512(d)(2) of
the act directs that FDA:<P>
"shall consider, among other relevant factors, (A) the probable consumption of
such drug and of any substance formed in or on food because of the use of such
drug, (B) the cumulative effect on man or animal of such drug, taking into
account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance, (C) safety
factors which in the opinion of experts, qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety of such drugs, and (D) whether the conditions
of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling are
reasonably certain to be followed in practice."<P>
The guidelines describe studies that the sponsor may conduct to meet these
statutory provisions. FDA describes in guidelines I and IV appropriate
scientific studies for obtaining information on the probable consumption of the
sponsored compound and its residues. FDA describes in guidelines II and III
appropriate scientific studies for obtaining information on the toxicity
(cumulative effect) of the sponsored compound and its residues and the safety
factors normally used. FDA describes in guideline VII appropriate studies for
showing the safety of "biomass" products. Finally, FDA describes in guideline
VIII the studies necessary to perform the risk assessment on bound residues of
carcinogenic veterinary drugs.<P><hr>

<H3>I. GUIDELINE FOR
METABOLISM STUDIES AND FOR SELECTION OF RESIDUES FOR TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING</H3><p>
<B>A. INTRODUCTION</B><P>
Section 512(d)(2) of the act explicitly provides that FDA consider the safety
of any substance formed in or on food by a sponsored compound before approving
its use. The compound administered to food-producing animals (target animals)
is not necessarily the substance present in the edible products from these
target animals. The enzymatic systems or physiological fluids of an animal can
act upon a compound administered to the animal and produce new substances
(metabolites and degradation products of the sponsored compound). The amount of
these substances in edible animal products will be a complex function of the
rate and extent of absorption of the parent compound, the rate and extent of
the metabolism of the absorbed parent compound, and the rate of excretion of
parent compound and metabolites.<P>
The total residue of a sponsored compound in treated animals will consist of
parent compound, free metabolites, and metabolites that are covalently bound to
endogenous molecules. The relative and absolute amounts of each residue will
vary among the tissues with the amount of the compound given and the time
following the last administration of the sponsored compound to the animal.
Because different components of the total residue may possess dissimilar
toxicological potentials, the sponsor should develop information on the amount,
persistence, and chemical nature of the-total residue in the edible products of
treated target animals. The sponsor should also develop information on the
metabolism of the compound in the species of laboratory animal used for the
toxicological testing.<P>
FDA needs the same type of information on metabolism of the sponsored compound
in target and laboratory animals for both suspect and non-suspect carcinogens.
However, after a chronic bioassay demonstrates that a compound is a carcinogen,
FDA may ask the sponsor to obtain more information on the carcinogenic
potential of individual metabolites. Such information could include more
complete structural elucidation, <i>in vitro</i> genetic toxicity testing, and
chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity.<P>
<B>B. TOTAL RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDY</B><P>
The sponsor should measure the depletion of total drug-related residue in
edible tissues of target animals at times after the last administration of the
compound. For large animals, the edible tissues are muscle, liver, kidney, fat,
and, where appropriate, milk. For poultry, the edible tissues are muscle,
liver, skin with adhering fat, and, where appropriate, eggs. For an injectable
compound, the sponsor should also measure the depletion of residues remaining
at the injection site. To facilitate this determination, the sponsor should
shave and permanently mark a circular area on the hide and inject the compound
at the center of this area. At sacrifice, the sponsor should homogenize
approximately 500 g of tissue from the area and measure its residue
concentration. (The dimensions for a cylinder containing 500 g of tissue are,
for an intramuscular injection, 10 cm in diameter and 6 cm in depth, and, for a
subcutaneous injection, 15 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm in depth.)<P>
The sponsor may use these tissues for the identification and quantification of
parent drug and individual metabolites as described in Section C below. FDA may
use these data to establish a withdrawal period for INAD purposes. FDA will use
other experimental data, as discussed in another guideline, to establish a
withdrawal period for NADA purposes.<P>
Radiotracer methodology is currently the most useful technique for determining
the total drug-related residue. Carbon-14  is the isotope most widely used
because there is usually no problem with intermolecular exchange of the label.
Ordinarily, the sponsor performs the depletion study by administering
radiolabeled drug to a sufficient number of previously unmedicated animals to
permit the serial sacrifice of groups of animals at intervals after the last
treatment.<P>
The administered compound should have a high radiopurity because radiolabeled
contaminants may result in artifacts that could give the appearance of
persistent drug residues. The sponsor should choose the site(s) of the
radiolabel to assure that portions of the parent compound that are likely to be
of toxicological concern are adequately labeled. For example, in the situation
where two chemical moieties of the parent compound are likely to be of
toxicological concern and a metabolic process may chemically separate the two
moieties, then the sponsor should determine the depletion of both moieties.
The sponsor could conduct a single study by administering equimolar amounts of
the compound with each moiety individually labeled, two studies by separately
administering the compound with each moiety individually labeled, or a single
study by administering a dual-labeled (for example, Carbon-14 and Tritium)
compound.<P>
The sponsor should choose the specific activity for the radiolabeled compound
high enough to demonstrate that the concentration of total residue at the last
sacrifice time is below the expected permitted concentration. Ordinarily for
non-carcinogens, this concentration is near 100 parts per billion (ppb), but
for a carcinogen, the concentration may be below 1 ppb. The sponsor is urged to
consult with FDA on the appropriate specific activity before designing a total
residue depletion study. The specific activity of the administered compound
need not be the same for each time point. For example, the sponsor could use
low specific activity material in animals sacrificed at short withdrawal times
and higher specific activity material in animals sacrificed at long withdrawal
times.<P>
The sponsor should conduct the total residue depletion study in previously
unmedicated animals that are representative of the proposed target population.
The metabolism of a compound may vary according to a number of parameters
including species, sex, age, dose, and duration of treatment. The differences
observed due to these parameters any include the rate of production and
excretion of metabolites and their chemical nature. For this reason FDA will
generally require a radiotracer study in each distinct species for which the
sponsor is seeking approval. If a product is intended for use in both male and
female animals, then the sponsor should use animals of both sexes in the study
because males and females of a species can metabolize chemicals at a different
rate. Because the enzyme type and concentration in young animals may not be
representative of the adult animal, the sponsor should conduct the study in
animals that are representative of the target population, that is, in neonates,
prepubertal animals, or sexually mature animals. In those instances when a
drug's use will be extended from one production class to another within a
species, FDA generally will accept an abbreviated total residue depletion study
to support approval in the new production class. Sponsors should discuss plans
for the abbreviated study with FDA.<P>
The dose should be the highest intended treatment level and should model
exposure received by target animals. For example, if a drug is given once to an
animal for a specific therapeutic effect, then a single dose of radiolabeled
drug is appropriate exposure. When the sponsor is requesting prolonged
treatment and is also requesting a zero withdrawal period, the sponsor should
supply data to demonstrate that the residue concentration has approximately
reached steady state. In other cases, FDA will generally accept that a seven
day dosing regimen is adequate for the purposes of the residue depletion
studies. However, the sponsor should use a twelve day dosing regimen for laying
hens to approximate the time required for complete development of the yolk.
Where the data do not demonstrate that a steady state concentration is
attained, the sponsor should show that there is no new metabolite being formed
as a result of prolonged treatment. For example, the sponsor could demonstrate
that the metabolite pattern and relative proportions of metabolites in tissues
have stabilized.<P>
When measuring the depletion of the total residue in edible tissue, the sponsor
should sacrifice groups of at least three animals at zero withdrawal and
usually at three later times. If the sponsor is requesting a zero withdrawal
period, the sponsor should 'dose six animals for a sufficient time previously
demonstrated to achieve a steady state concentration of residue and then
sacrifice the animals at zero time. For other special cases, the sponsor is
urged to consult with FDA before designing a study. If the sponsor intends to
use the dosed tissue for metabolite identification, the sponsor may wish to
include additional animals in the study. For purposes of the residue depletion
study, zero withdrawal for tissues of large animals is considered eight to
twelve hours after the last treatment; for lactating animals, zero withdrawal
for milk is considered twelve hours after the last treatment. For tissues of
poultry, zero withdrawal is considered six hours after the last treatment.<P>
The sponsor should present the results of these experiments in a format that
will facilitate FDA review and should include supporting raw data. The sponsor
should provide:<P>
<ul>
<li>The specific activity of parent drug.<P>
<li>The radiopurity of parent drug (98% or greater is recommended) with supporting
chromatograms from at least two different chromatographic systems and a
determination of microbiological activity if appropriate.<P>
<li>A full description of methodology and of the statistical and/or mathematical
approach including sample calculations.<P>
<li>A practical demonstration of the limit of detection of parent drug through
fortification of each of the edible tissues. In the absence of this
demonstration, FDA will use twice the background counting rate as a nominal
limit of detection.<P>
<li>The sampling procedure and sample size. FDA recommends that the whole organ or
representative portions be homogenized and the analysis be done on an
aliquot.<P>
<li>Data from duplicate analyses of each tissue sample derived from treated
animals. For each experimentally derived data point, results should be
identified with an individual male or female animal and be presented in CPM, in
DPM, and in parent drug equivalents per gram of wet tissue.   
</ul> <P>
<B>C.	METABOLISM STUDIES IN TARGET ANIMALS</B><P>
The sponsor should provide information on the metabolic fate of the compound in
the edible tissues of the target animal dosed at the maximum use level
requested. Often the published literature contains information on the
metabolism of a closely related chemical. Such information is useful but
usually cannot replace the experimental observation of the metabolic fate of
the sponsored chemical in target<P>
The sponsor may use the tissues from the total residue depletion study for
these studies. If the tissues are stored frozen for long periods of time, FDA
may ask the sponsor to demonstrate that the metabolites are stable in the
frozen state, such as by demonstrating that metabolite profiles do not change.
If suitable tissue is not available, the sponsor should conduct a total residue
depletion study as discussed above in Section B. The sponsor should develop
procedures for extraction, fractionation, separation, and isolation of
metabolites that will facilitate the comparison of metabolite profiles for each
tissue and for later comparison of these profiles with the metabolite profiles
derived from laboratory animals. Unless human food safety questions arise
requiring examination of the other edible tissues, the sponsor will need to
collect data only in the target tissue.<P>
<B>1. Structural Identification of Metabolites</B><P>
Structural identification of major metabolites may be necessary depending on
the degree of toxicological concern for the parent compound and its potential
metabolites. FDA will consider a metabolite to be a major metabolite if, at the
time the concentration of total residue peaks (normally zero withdrawal),
either (a) it is present in an amount greater than 10% of the total residue in
an edible tissue, or (b) its concentration exceeds 0.1 ppm. In some cases,
chemical characterization rather than unequivocal structural identification for
a major metabolite will be sufficient. For example, if chromatographic evidence
demonstrates that a metabolite and its conjugate are present in tissue, then
FDA will not consider structural identification of the particular conjugate to
be necessary for evaluating the safety of the compound. Similarly, the sponsor
may use chromatographic evidence to demonstrate that the same major metabolite
occurs in more than one tissue. FDA will normally not require structural
identification or chemical characterization of minor metabolites.<P>
The sponsor may isolate sufficient quantities of metabolites for structural
identification by a variety of techniques. The sponsor may isolate metabolites
from excreta. Another example of an acceptable approach is the research
procedure described by Paulson and Struble (Ref. 1) and Bakke <i>et al.</i>
Ref. 2), summarized below.<P>
The sponsor treats a group of animals with cold drug at or near the use level
for a period of time, then administers from one to several large doses (5x to
20x) of radiolabeled drug, and slaughters the animals six to twelve hours after
the final dose. The sponsor then uses purification and separation techniques to
obtain individual metabolites for structural determination.<P>
<B>2. Persistence of Metabolites</B><P>
The sponsor should determine the concentration and relative percent of the
parent compound and individual metabolites in edible tissue(s) at a series of
times after the last administration of the compound. Because the residues that
persist to the expected withdrawal period will be consumed by people, these are
the residues of toxicological concern. FDA will normally require an evaluation
of their toxicological potentials in laboratory animals (see sections D and E
below).<P>
<B>3. Covalently Bound Residues</B><P>
In some cases the sponsor may be unable to extract the total radiolabeled
residue. The non-extractable material usually represents two general classes of
compounds, endogenous components derived from a portion or the radiolabeled
compound of covalently bound residues derived from the reaction between a
metabolite of the compound and cellular macromolecules. If the sponsor shows
that a portion of the total residue results from the incorporation of
radiolabel into endogenous compounds (for example, amino acids, fatty acids,
carbohydrates, nucleotides), FDA will subtract that portion from the total
residue because it is not of toxicological concern. FDA will consider the
covalently bound residue to be of toxicological concern, but will not consider
it to be more toxic than the parent compound. Unless the covalently bound
residue represents a major portion of the residue and the information is needed
for analytical methodology, FDA will not require that the sponsor attempt
structural identification.<P>
If the total residue concentration (that is, free metabolites plus covalently
bound residue) is below the permitted concentration of residue in edible tissue
at the requested withdrawal time, then this residue is shown to be safe within
the meaning of the act, and FDA will not ask for additional safety testing on
the covalently bound residue. However, if the concentration of covalently bound
residue exceeds the permitted concentration of residue, then FDA cannot approve
the compound until the sponsor provides additional data to demonstrate
safety.<P>
If the parent compound is not a carcinogen, FDA will discount from the residue
of toxicological concern that portion of the covalently bound residue that the
sponsor demonstrates is not bioavailable, provided that a substantial portion
(for example, 50%) of the covalently bound residue is not bioavailable. FDA
will adjust the total residue based on the relative bioavailability of the
parent compound and the covalently bound residue. The experimental technique
described by Gallo-Torres (Ref. 3) is an example of an acceptable protocol.
However, if the parent compound is a demonstrated carcinogen, FDA will normally
not accept bioavailability data alone to discount the covalently bound residue
from carcinogenic concern. In any specific case the sponsor has the option of
proposing to FDA an experimental approach to demonstrate that the covalently
bound residue is not of carcinogenic concern.<P>
<B>4. Reporting of Data</B><P>
The sponsor should submit data from the metabolism studies in a format that
will facilitate FDA review and should include supporting raw data. A flow chart
of known or postulated metabolic pathways is usually helpful. The sponsor
should provide:<P>
<ul>
<li>The concentration of the total residue in each edible tissue, and milk or eggs
where applicable, at a series of times following administration of the
product.<P>
<li>Information on the extractability of the total residue with no treatment,
conditions of varying pH, or following denaturation, chemical and/or enzymatic
hydrolysis.<P>
<li>Chromatographic profiles of the metabolites extracted from edible tissue(s)
and, if applicable, excreta. FDA recommends high resolution chromatographic
methods. FDA also recommends rechromatography after treatment of the extract
with conjugate-hydrolyzing enzymes or dilute acid.<P>
<li>Structural identification of the major metabolites.<P>
<li>Data on bioavailability of covalently bound residues, if appropriate.<P>
</ul>
<B>D. METABOLISM STUDIES IN LABORATORY ANIMALS</B><P>
The purpose of these studies is to determine whether the metabolites that
people will consume from tissues of target animals are also produced by
metabolism in the laboratory animals used for the toxicological testing. The
sponsor should conduct these studies for compounds being tested for
carcinogenicity as well as those being tested for other toxicological
endpoints. To facilitate evaluation of the data, the sponsor should use the
same procedures for chromatography and chemical characterization as those
employed in the metabolism study in the target animals. Qualitative information
on metabolites is sufficient. FDA will use this information to determine what
metabolites, if any, need separate toxicological testing (see section E
below).<P>
The sponsor should give laboratory animals a sufficient number of daily doses
of the radiolabeled test compound to ensure that it undergoes all relevant
metabolic events, including those associated with enzyme induction. The sponsor
should consult with FDA prior to dose selection.<P>
The sponsor should try to conduct toxicological studies in the laboratory
animals whose profile of metabolites most closely resembles that observed in
target animals. However, other factors also need to be considered. For example,
knowledge that certain laboratory animals are especially sensitive to the
parent compound or its chemical class may dictate their choice, even though the
metabolite profile of other laboratory animals may more closely model that of
the target animals. FDA does require that the strain of test species chosen for
the comparative metabolism work be the one used for the toxicological
testing.<P>
<B>E. SELECTION OF METABOLITES FOR TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING</B><P>
FDA may ask for separate toxicological studies on a metabolite if it is not
tested through autoexposure and it is likely to have toxicological potency
significantly greater than the parent compound. FDA will normally conclude that
autoexposure provides an adequate test of the toxicity of the sponsored
compound if laboratory animals produce the metabolites that collectively
comprise over 90% of the residue that people will consume from tissues of
treated target animals. Failing that, FDA will use the information obtained
from target animals on the concentration, persistence, and chemical structure
or characterization of that metabolite to determine whether separate
toxicological testing is desirable.<P>
<B>F.	IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET TISSUE AND MARKER RESIDUE</B><P>
The target tissue is the edible tissue selected to monitor for the total
residue in the target animal. The target tissue is usually, but not
necessarily, the last tissue in which residues deplete to the permitted
concentration. A marker residue is a residue whose concentration is in a known
relationship to the concentration of the total residue in the last tissue to
deplete to its permitted concentration. The marker residue can be the sponsored
compound, any of its metabolites, or a combination of the residues for which a
common assay can be developed. The target tissue and marker residue are
selected so that the absence of marker residue above a designated concentration
R(M) will confirm that each edible tissue has a concentration of total residue
at or below its permitted concentration.<P>
When a compound is to be used in milk- or egg-producing animals, milk or eggs
may be a target tissue in addition to one tissue selected to monitor for
residues in the edible carcass because milk or eggs enter the food supply
independently. In these cases, it may be necessary to select a marker residue
for milk or eggs that is different from the marker residue selected for the
target tissue representing the edible carcass.<P>
Application of the concepts of marker residue and target tissue requires an
experimental determination of the quantitative relationships among the residues
that might serve as the marker residue in each of the various edible tissues
that might serve as the target tissue. Because these relationships may change
with time, the sponsor should measure the depletion of potential marker
residues in potential target tissues starting after the last treatment with the
sponsored compound and continuing until the residue has reached the permitted
concentration for that tissue.<P>
The sponsor may use the results from the total residue depletion study and
metabolism study to determine the marker residue, target tissue, and R(M). If a
new depletion study is advisable, the desired experimental parameters are as
outlined for the total residue depletion study in section B. (A radiotracer
depletion study provides an initial estimate of the R(M). The final R(M) is
determined with the regulatory assay.)<P>
