Budget Negotiators Push On, But Actuaries Say Plans Could Backfire


Budget negotiators meeting Dec.  29 vowed to work through the holiday if
necessary.  "We all know what the differences are.  The key now is to keep
working" on a balanced budget, says White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta.
The greatest concern is to get federal workers, "innocent victims being hurt,"
back to work, he said.  "We want to get this done as quickly as we can to get
federal workers back to work, and get back to normal as soon as possible,"
agreed Senate Budget Committee Chair Pete Domenici (R-NM).

Meanwhile the American Academy of Actuaries sees "major defects" in Medicare
reform plans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.  Its Medicare Work Group
says both White House and congressional proposals rely too heavily on curbing
provider pay growth when there's no evidence it reduces overall spending.  "In
fact, in many cases, the rate of growth in volume and intensity of services
increases when unit payments are lowered," says a report released Dec.  21.
It criticizes both plans for having capitation rates set "arbitrarily" by
government rather than the market.  That will cause providers to choose
payment mechanisms to maximize revenues, it says.  Hiking rates where they are
currently low, plus "favorable selection" of capitated plans by healthy
seniors, also make it "far more likely" that overall costs will rise, say the
actuaries.  Provider-sponsored networks in particular "will allow for
significant increases in favorable selection."  Providers who make up such
plans "have detailed knowledge of their own patients and, on that basis, will
be able to steer these patients to the program that will yield the most
favorable payments" for such plans, say the actuaries.  The report slams as
"fiscal sleight-of-hand" an Administration proposal to transfer home health
pay from the Part A Trust Fund to the Part B Trust Fund without a
corresponding increase in Part B premiums.  It "gives the appearance of having
solved a problem" by meeting short-range solvency standards, says the report,
but "undermines" fiscal discipline.  The report also blasts the Republicans'
"failsafe" mechanism that would cut provider pay further if expected savings
from capitation don't materialize.  Such cuts could decrease access and
quality in the Medicare fee-for-service program.  Where capitation rates are
also cut, that could mean access to quality care is "significantly impaired,"
says the report.  Still, says Medicare Working Group Chair Guy King, it would
only take a handful of changes, such as adding beneficiary cost-sharing to the
failsafe and increasing competitive bidding, to make "a pretty good plan."

FTC Reviews 'Light' Cigarette Rules


The Federal Trade Commission is reconsidering cigarette tar and nicotine
descriptions.  "Light" cigarettes are defined as those with less than 15
milligrams of tar.  But tobacco foes say the smoking machines used to
determine cigarette content underestimate how much smokers inhale.  They cite
surveys showing most people think "light" cigarettes are safer.  But
scientific studies show that "light" cigarette smokers can often ingest as
many harmful substances as regular cigarette smokers.  They either cover
airholes or suck harder, longer, or more often.  The Commission is thinking
about having cigarette manufacturers list a range of tar and nicotine levels
rather than a set number, or include a statement saying that actual inhaled
amounts vary.  And deceptive advertising suits are another possibility.

Some HMOs Shortchange Patient Care, But Field Pays Lots To Its Executives


Some HMOs are taking much more off the top than others, says a Weiss Ratings
study released Dec.  19.  The average plan spends 83 cents of every premium
dollar on patient care.  But CaliforniaCare Health Plan, with more than 2
million enrollees, spends 74.8 cents, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Georgia
spends 72.4 cents, and CIGNA Healthcare of Virginia spends 71.5 cents.  At the
other end, Aetna Health Plans of New York spend 94.6 cents of every premium
dollar on patient care, and the Scott & White Health Plan in Texas and the 4.8
million member Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California both spend 98.3
cents.  Meanwhile another study shows HMOs are paying their CEOs more than any
other industry.  The Crystal Report says total annual pay to Foundation Health
Corp.'s Daniel Crowley is $6,147,000 - that's 277 percent above the average
for executives in companies of similar size and financial performance.  U.S.
Healthcare's Leonard Abramson gets $3,992,000 a year - 107 percent above size
and performance peers.  Healthcare Compare's James Smith gets $1,756,000 - 88
percent above average pay at similar firms.  The report, which analyzed
compensation packages of 896 CEOs who had held their jobs for at least 3
years, found that health insurance industry CEOs as a group earn 80 percent
above average pay.  Pharmaceutical and biotech firms also pay executives well
above average rates.

Yet another study suggests costs under capitation are cut most by
physician-owned groups.  A study in the Dec.  21 New England Journal of
Medicine of six physician-owned medical groups paid primarily under capitation
found that, for non-Medicare patients in 1994, hospital days per 1,000 ranged
from 120 to 140, vs.  a 1993 average of 232 for commercial health maintenance
plans in California and 297 nationally.  Rates of physician visits were also
lower than at HMOs; one group averaged 6.8 days per Medicare enrollee in 1994
vs.  a 9.1 average for the state.  The authors caution that the data were not
controlled for case-mix, and could mean merely that the groups had relatively
healthy patients.

Pew Urges Start Of Interdisciplinary Evaluations And End To 'Monopolies'


Physicians should no longer be evaluated only by their own kind, says the Pew
Health Professions Commission.  Interdisciplinary oversight is among
recommendations for health provider regulatory reforms released Dec.  22 by
the Commission's Task Force on Health Care Workforce Regulation.  Nurses,
physicians' assistants, and consumers should be included in physician
evaluation because managed care increasingly involves interdisciplinary teams
of providers, says the Task Force.  Director Leonard Finocchio says
hospital-based, fee-for-service practice skills "are about to be obsolete.  We
must instead use new strategies for ensuring that physicians, nurses, and
other [providers] understand the health care of tomorrow - community-based
managed care that emphasizes prevention and primary care solutions."  The Task
Force also calls for an overhaul of scopes-of-practice rules that have
"created monopolies" by erecting "unreasonable access barriers."  Dental
hygienists should be "free from a financial leash" to dentists, nurses and
midwives should be free to manage uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries,
and nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants should be able to bill for
their services "without requiring the consumer to make an overhead payment to
physicians," says Commission Chair Richard Lamm.  The Task Force says there
should be periodic competency testing to ensure that providers are current
with the newest information.  And it wants disciplinary files opened to the
public.  The medical establishment is criticizing the report.  The Federation
of State Medical Boards' James Winn says consumers are already on most boards,
but no physicians were on the Task Force.

Not All Whistleblowers' Tunes Unhappy


Most people who blow the whistle on scientific misconduct say the negative
effects are not so bad.  A survey of such whistleblowers by the Department of
Health & Human Services' Office of Research Integrity finds that fears of
retaliation are not always borne out.  Almost a third (31 percent) of
respondents say they had no negative repercussions, and almost as many (28
percent) say they only experienced one.  However, 12 percent say they were
fired, jobs were not renewed, or pay hikes were denied.  Fully 43 percent say
they were pressured to drop allegations, 40 percent say they were victims of
counter-allegations, 25 percent report ostracism, 20 percent say research
support was reduced, 15 percent say they were threatened with lawsuits, 10
percent say travel funds were cut, 10 percent say desirable work assignments
were lost, 10 percent say staff support was reduced, 9 percent say manuscript
reviews were delayed, 9 percent say they were denied tenure, and 7 percent say
they lost promotions.  In most cases, the accused initiated retaliation.  But
institutional officials like administrators, deans, and department chairs were
involved in 88 percent of serious, career-threatening actions.  The report
concludes that, to prevent the most serious consequences, regulations and
enforcement must "primarily" target institutional officials.

'Gag' Rule Gets Himmelstein, He Says


Prominent single-payer health plan advocate David Himmelstein says he's being
ousted from an HMO for violating its 'gag' rule.  The Physicians for a
National Health Program co-founder contends that U.S.  Healthcare is dropping
him for comments he made at a National Managed Healthcare Congress.  He showed
a slide of the confidentiality or 'gag' clause prohibiting member physicians
from saying anything that could "undermine confidence" in the plan.  He also
complained about referral disincentives and the CEO's multimillion dollar
salary, and made similar comments on the "Donahue" show.  "It is not illegal
for them to fire me," he concedes.  "We need a law outlawing" gag rules and to
throw firms that use them out of health care, he says.  U.S.  Healthcare says
it is dropping Himmelstein because it has too many doctors in his area, but
Himmelstein says the plan is hiring.  The HMO industry says confidentiality
clauses aren't designed to curtail patient advocacy, and merely protect
proprietary information.  But gag rules were repeatedly attacked at last
month's American Medical Association meeting.  The AMA has many of its own
employees sign confidentiality agreements.  Nonetheless, its Council on
Ethical & Judicial Affairs is drafting policy on the issue that may be ready
for the Association's June meeting.

Double-Digit Indemnity Hikes Predicted


Only loosely-managed indemnity plans will see costs rise by more than 10
percent in 1996, predicts the Alexander & Alexander Consulting group.  Its
survey of self-funded, employer-sponsored medical plans suggests that
preferred provider organizations will see increases of 9 percent to 10
percent.  Point-of-service HMOs that let members see out-of-plan physicians
will cost 5 percent to 7 percent more.  And closed-panel HMOs will see costs
rise by at most 4 percent, if at all, says the survey.  It found little
difference among regions, except for higher indemnity plan increases of 15
percent in California.  Meanwhile Interstudy predicts Boston, Nassau-Suffolk
NY, Philadelphia, Tampa-St.  Petersburg, and St.  Louis will lead large
markets' HMO growth in 1996.  Fastest-growing medium size markets include West
Palm Beach-Boca Raton FL, Albany-Schenectady NY, Springfield MA, Worcester MA,
and Knoxville TN.

Hospitals Happier With JCAHO Surveys


Hospital are more satisfied with Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) onsite surveys, according to an American
Hospital Association (AHA) survey.  The survey, conducted in November, found
that 64 percent of hospitals "strongly" agree that they are satisfied, up from
48 percent last August.  Just one year ago relations between JCAHO and
hospitals were so bad AHA was talking about withdrawing its support from the
accrediting body.  Hospitals are unhappy with delays in getting written
accreditation reports after onsite surveys.  Only 63 percent said reports were
delivered within a reasonable time, down from 76 percent in August.  JCAHO
says a computer system caused delays.  The number of hospitals who feel the
JCAHO survey was of value stayed at about 80 percent.  But the number who feel
it's worth the fees charged is up slightly.

Approval Fails To Quell Controversy Over 'Sensor Pad' Breast Lump Device


Foes and fans dislike the Dec.  22 Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approval
of the Sensor Pad.  The 10-year tussle over the purported breast lump
detection aide is one of FDA critics' favorite examples of alleged agency
arrogance and intransigence.  The FDA says it granted approval now because
data submitted in November show that the product, two sheets of plastic
sliding over a silicone filling, does not decrease detection of lumps.  An FDA
advisory panel asked the manufacturer, Inventive Products Inc., for such
evidence earlier in the year.  But Pad critics say there's still no proof that
it improves lump detection.  And Pad supporters say the approval, allowing
sales only in clinics and physicians' offices, is too narrow.  Both camps
claim the action was political.  Advocates of legislation to allow
over-the-counter sales plan to push ahead.

VT Hospitals Decry Scaled-Back Reform


The exclusion of inpatient coverage from sharply curtailed health reform plans
in Vermont has hospitals crying foul.  Legislation was passed last spring to
enroll everyone below 150 percent of the poverty level in managed care.  But
only one out-of-state, for-profit plan successfully bid, and it didn't have
the infrastructure to meet the Jan.  1 target startup date.  Providers say the
contract it offered was not for true managed care but "discount
fee-for-service" that indemnified the plan against any decisions it made.  The
state is going ahead with enrollments in a "limited fee-for-service" plan,
albeit only for people below 100 percent of the poverty level.  The governor's
office says inpatient coverage won't be provided until at least two managed
care plans are participating.  But hospitals feel cheated.  The whole package
wouldn't have passed without their support, says hospital association
President Norm Wright.

Briefly This Week...


The largest provider of insurance to cover gaps in Medicare coverage is
increasing premium costs 30 percent on average.  The 3.1 million seniors with
American Association of Retired Persons "Medigap" policies will be charged on
average $51 per month for the most basic and $151.75 for the most complete
plan.  Growth of outpatient claims is being blamed.

Hospitals can now check the Internet to see if they're getting a good deal on
disposable products.  PriceGuide, from the nonprofit research agency ECRI,
provides both national and geographic average price and lowest price paid by
hospitals for brandname disposables.  A test of the system for cardiac
catherization labs found average potential savings of $243,000 per hospital,
says ECRI.

The Food & Drug Administration may allow more flexibility for food label
health claims.  A proposed rule in the Dec.  21 Federal Register would allow
synonymous nutrient content claims next to the required standard text, permit
health claims for certain foods that don't contain at least 10 percent of
required nutrients, eliminate some requirements for health claims, and make
other refinements in regulations issued two years ago.

Malpractice awards are back up to 1993's record setting $500,000 median, says
a Jury Verdict Research report.  The 1995 figure is a 40 percent jump from
1994's $365,000.  Since 1990, says a Tillinghast-Towers Perrin study,
malpractice costs rose 48.6 percent, vs.  16.6 percent for overall tort costs.

University of California/San Francisco has the greatest percentage of
underrepresented minority graduates among non-historically black medical
schools, according to Association of American Medical Colleges statistics.
From 1990 to 1994, 21 percent of UCSF graduates were Native-, African-,
Mexican-American, or Puerto Rican.  Saint Louis University ranks last with
0.57 percent.

The drug AZT given after needle sticks cuts HIV infection rates by 79 percent,
says the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.  The agency plans to hold a
meeting on possible new needle stick injury guidelines.

Prozac is more cost-effective than other selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors used to treat depression, says a report in the November/December
Journal of International Medical Research.  Annual mean health care costs are
$442 for patients taking Prozac, $744 for those on Paxil, and $756 for those
on Zoloft.  More frequent dose changes on the last two explain much of the
difference.

The American Jewish Congress is protesting a Health Care Financing
Administration decision to not require nursing homes to take account of
residents' religious dietary restrictions.  The Congress is upset by a letter
from a HCFA staffer saying that the government "does not impose any" religious
practices, and that patients with religious dietary needs "should choose a
home that adheres to those" rules.

Year In Review:  Ghost of Reform Returns to Haunt GOP


A poignant and ironic spectacle unfolded in 1995 as victorious Republicans in
Congress lifted the burden of leadership in health care reform from the
shoulders of a battered Democratic Administration - and then staggered under
the load just as the Democrats had.

Initially, the collapse of universal coverage and comprehensive federal
reforms in the 103rd Congress appeared to leave in its wake an agenda of
incremental policy measures for the states and the new Congress to take up.
But the budgetary goals of the new Republican majority soon put systemwide
reform of Medicare and Medicaid back at the top of the national agenda.

The Republicans had no more choice than Clinton but to shape policy in the
image of the breathtaking changes taking place in the private market.  Despite
all the partisan rhetoric and rancor, the Republicans wanted to do for
Medicare and Medicaid what Clinton tried to do for the system as a whole -
facilitate a minimally-disruptive transition to the new order.

"The events of 1993 and 1994 may have put proposals for government-guaranteed
universal coverage and cost control in the deep freeze, but they assuredly did
not cool political interest in health care policy," writes Henry Aaron, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in a new book.

Federal budget pressures, combined with the aging of the population and
continuing technological advances, ensure that "health care financing as a
national political issue will not go away," according to Aaron.  But the terms
of the debate will change.  "Public and private policy in the United States
are combining to transform the health care financing system in ways that were
not widely foreseen when the Clinton administration made health care reform
its number one domestic priority."

Incrementalism Deferred

In the states and the Congress, incremental change was the order of the day as
1995 began.  Most of the states were implementing insurance-market reforms.
Organized medicine and the managed care industry were fighting a
state-by-state war over any-willing-provider laws, the latest in a long series
of state reform issues clouded by the formidable influence of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  But the most urgent issue for the
states was the uncontrolled growth of Medicaid costs.

Consolidation of payers and providers continued in the marketplace, with
physician practices and practice management companies contributing
increasingly to the trend.  Despite the eclipse of health purchasing alliances
in the national policy sphere, several states were sponsoring alliances, and
business buyer coalitions continued to form.  For the second consecutive year
health plan premiums were under control - growing at or below the general
inflation rate, or down.

In May, details of the Republican plan for Medicare began to emerge.  The
hallmark of the proposal was the opening of the Medicare market to a
relatively unrestricted variety of competing health plans, with special
treatment for those sponsored by providers.  Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
would be an option for those who preferred to receive their benefit in cash.
Increased cost-sharing was dropped as a penalty for beneficiaries who wanted
to stay in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service system, but retrospective
cuts in reimbursement would penalize fee-for-service providers if budget
targets were not met.

As expected, the Republicans proposed abolishing Medicaid as an entitlement
for the poor and disabled and converting the program to block grants for the
states.  The puissant National Governors' Association hailed the block grant
concept, but was handcuffed by divisions - across party lines - over proposed
allocation formulas.

Obstacles to the Medicare plan seemed to melt away in the face of the
Republicans' tight party discipline and focus on budget goals.  Sen.  Alan
Simpson's (R-WY) attacks on the tax-exempt status of the American Association
of Retired Persons (AARP) helped distract the seniors' strongest lobbying arm
and forestall frontal resistance to Medicare budget reductions per se.  House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) worked assiduously to maintain the AARP's
relative quiescence.  The American Hospital Association apparently succumbed
to implicit threats that there would be no seat at the table for stakeholders
who went negative in public.

The coup de grace came in September when the American Medical Association
announced its support for the GOP Medicare plan.  As Aaron suggests, the
ground had shifted under the policymakers' feet.  Out-and-out warfare between
organized medicine and the managed care industry had been a major distraction
during the fight over the Clinton plan.  Now, many in the AMA believed that
provider-sponsored plans would be their salvation.

Republican unity and finesse in neutralizing potential opposition did not work
as well on Medicaid.  The nation's governors were offering their acquiescence
to tight constraints on federal Medicaid spending in exchange for freedom to
run the program without federal interference.  Republican moderates in the
Senate, however, led by Maine's William Cohen, refused to accept repeal of
federal nursing home standards, and the Republicans lost their grip on a
veto-proof strategy for this mother of all step-child programs.

Stab In the Dark

With passage of the Republican budget bill and the ensuing Presidential veto,
the policy debate moves out of the subjunctive mode.  The questions are no
longer:  "What if we do this?"  or "What if we do that?"  They become:
"What's going to happen when we do this?"  and "What if it turns out to be a
disaster?"

But even changes that are near at hand are difficult to visualize.
Provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), for example, are an unknown quantity
in Medicare and the marketplace generally.  They will be subject to varying
state licensure requirements and solvency standards overseen by the Secretary
of Health & Human Services.  PSOs may provide a sort of haven for doctors.
But if their sickest patients follow them, the doctors are in for some jolting
lessons in risk selection.

The pace of Medicare enrollment in managed care is another crucial variable
that is impossible to forecast, according to Guy King, who was chief actuary
at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for 16 years and is
currently chair of a working group on Medicare in the American Academy of
Actuaries (AAA).

"Any estimate there is really a stab in the dark, because you've got two
offsetting things going on," King says.  Opening the Medicare choice market to
all comers will facilitate expansion of enrollment, but lowering capitation
rates will have a constricting effect, he says.  An additional downward
adjustment of rates will be made in areas that currently have relatively high
capitation payments, slowing growth where it is now most vigorous, King warns.

The AAA workgroup faulted both the Republican MediPlus plan and President
Clinton's proposal for maintaining a system of capitation payments "determined
arbitrarily by the government, rather than the market."  (See this week's M&H,
p.  2.)  King suggests that the Republican plan could be fixed with a system
of blind price-and-product bidding by plans, against fixed per capita payments
then set by HCFA; and by increases in cost sharing for beneficiaries who
choose expensive coverages.

To preempt Democratic criticism and mobilization of the seniors' lobby, the
Republicans dropped beneficiary cost sharing from the retrospective failsafe
mechanism on the fee-for-service side of the program, which still accounts for
90 percent of all enrollment.  By inflicting on providers all of the pain from
the lookback mechanism, the Republicans risk driving doctors and hospitals out
of Medicare and pinching off access for many beneficiaries, according to King
and others.

Greater access problems could result from curtailment of Medicaid growth to
4.8 percent per year, combined with a continuing erosion of employment-based
coverage, according to a recent analysis by Harvard University health
economist Kenneth Thorpe - a former Clinton advisor - and others.

Recent data indicate that the percentage of the population covered through the
workplace fell from 61 percent four years ago to less than 57 percent in 1994.
Reductions in Medicaid coverage by the states could freeze out growing numbers
of workers who lose job-based coverage in the future, pushing the number of
uninsured as high as 66 million in 2002 in a worst-case scenario, Thorpe and
his colleagues estimated.  Lewin-VHI expects 45.9 million to be uninsured in
2002.

Dramatic growth in the number of uninsured would lead to public discontent and
"pressures for a revived and heightened role of government," Aaron predicts.
And according to King, "You and I both know that what's really going to happen
is that if access to care and quality of care start suffering in the
[traditional] Medicare program, that something's going to be done."

The Medicare Preservation Act calls for a national MedicarePlus Health Fair in
October 1996 "which would provide for a nationally coordinated educational and
publicity campaign to inform MedicarePlus eligible persons about MedicarePlus
plans, and the election [choice] process, including the upcoming annual,
coordinated election periods that would begin in October 1997."

Candidates, start your engines.

In Other Business...


Academic health centers (AHCs) survived the storm of deficit reduction without
catastrophic losses to their shrinking revenue base.  Medicare-based subsidies
were largely salvaged by creation of a trust fund for graduate medical
education.  Plans to slash funding for the National Institutes of Health were
blocked.  But with cross subsidies for research and teaching drying up on all
sides, AHCs were looking increasingly to partner with managed care systems to
broaden their financial and patient base.

The Agency for Health Care Policy & Research (AHCPR) was targeted for
extinction by Republican budget hawks, then resurrected after an impressive
show of support from its friends, including influential voices in the
corporate community who value medical effectiveness research.  In its ongoing
work, AHCPR placed increasing emphasis on efforts to implement practice
guidelines as well as develop them, and to renegotiate the roles of
specialists in managed care.

The Business Health Care Action Group in Minnesota turned heads among the
managed care elite with plans to solicit direct bids from competing provider
groups within the big integrated health plans that dominate the
Minneapolis/St.  Paul market.

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.  acquired more than 40 new hospitals during the
year, most of them former nonprofits.  The Nashville TN powerhouse put a
notable new jewel in its crown in December with the announcement of a joint
venture with the respected Sharp HealthCare in San Diego.  Consumer advocates
vowed to make sure Sharp's nonprofit status is not subverted.

Cost shifting by providers resulting from the Republican Medicare and Medicaid
budget rollbacks will add more than $84 billion to private insurance bills
over the next seven years, Lewin-VHI estimates.

Dying in the hospital is often prolonged against patients' wishes, according
to a massive study sponsored by the R.  W.  Johnson Foundation.  A controlled
intervention aimed at improving communication of patients' preferences to
physicians was largely ineffective, researchers found.

Depression, because of its prevalence and impact, is the focus of a new,
AHCPR-sponsored Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) project that will seek
to identify more effective approaches to treatment in primary care settings.

Fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid were not as big a political focus in
the legislation-making process as some expected.  Differences between the two
parties were largely rhetorical.  Republicans could not play tough on the
issue if they were also shrinking enforcement budgets.

Golden Rule Insurance Co.  earned a reputation for super-clout with its heavy
donations to Republican candidates, the friendship between chair Patrick
Rooney and Speaker Gingrich, and success in helping to place medical savings
accounts - which Golden Rule sells - high on the Republican agenda.

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) shrugged off relentless
maligning while attempting to balance fiscal and program accountability
against the states' desire for quick and easy Medicaid managed care waivers.
Haste had made waste in large scale programs in Arizona and Tennessee.  But
waiver applicants like New York City chafed at delays and dreamed fondly of
block grants.

Jackson Hole WY became a vacation spot again.

Kaiser Permanente, losing market share, undertook restructuring and became a
target of California's feisty Health Care Workers' Local 250, whose 13,700
Kaiser workers rejected a 3-year wage freeze proposed by the archetype HMO.

MedPartners and Mullikin Medical Enterprises announced merger plans creating
the largest company yet in the booming physician practice management field,
with projected revenues of $1 billion in 1996.  Growth continued with the
merged giant's planned acquisition of Pacific Physician Services.

The federal Office of Technology Assessment was put out of business by
Congress.  Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Technology Evaluation Center stepped
in soon after to serve one former OTA client, the Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), under a long term contract.

Point-of-service (POS) health plans are the fastest-growing managed care
hybrids on the market.  While HMOs and PPOs each held a stable 25 percent
market share in 1993-1994, Foster Higgins reported that POS plans absorbed
most of the 10-point drop in indemnity coverage, climbing from 9 percent to 17
percent of the market.  HCFA worked overtime preparing new rules to allow POS
plans to enter the Medicare market, where they were expected to have
substantial appeal as a door-opener, or transitional product.

The Ryan White CARE Act received overwhelming support in the Senate's
five-year reauthorization vote on the program, which grants money to cities
and states for care for AIDS patients.

Strokes due to atrial fibrillation could be cut in half with proper
anti-coagulation therapy with warfarin, according to the AHCPR's stroke PORT.

Telemedicine experiments advanced in many rural areas.  Further development of
the fledgling technology will depend on the effects of deregulation of
telecommunications and the buildup of a multipurpose information
infrastructure that will allow costs to be spread among government, education,
and health users.

The tobacco industry stayed on the defensive, as internal memos discovered in
litigation characterized cigarettes as "nicotine delivery systems" and likened
nicotine to cocaine.  The AMA and the Clinton Administration kept up their
push for regulating tobacco as a drug.

The President's Vaccines for Children program was targeted for defunding by
Congress after being undercut by a government report that said outreach to
socially-isolated children was a bigger obstacle to immunization goals than
the cost of vaccines.

WellPoint Health Networks Inc.  and Health Systems International Inc.  dropped
plans for what would have been the biggest HMO merger ever, after a long
wrangle.  Power-sharing by CEOs Leonard Schaeffer and Malik Hasan appeared to
be a major hangup.

Medicine & Health's 8th Annual Health People of the Year Awards


Winner:  Newt Gingrich

The Speaker of the House displayed disarming naivete when he blithely asserted
to the AMA House of Delegates in December that after physicians set up PSOs,
"you're going to be able to offer dramatically better services at lower costs.
Within a very short time the customer's going to figure out where to go, and
at that point you're going to see a very dramatic drop in the profit margin of
the insurance company."

But Gingrich was nothing short of brilliant in marshalling his assets and
neutralizing his opposition during the crafting of the Republican Medicare and
Medicaid legislation.  Squabbling among stakeholders helped paralyze reform
the previous year.  Gingrich refused to let it happen again.  The Speaker made
time for meetings over details with the trade and consumer lobbies.  He coaxed
and cajoled the American Association of Retired Persons and the American
Hospital Association out of frontal resistance.  He wooed the American Medical
Association with the promise of freedom to run their own managed care plans
and reap the rewards.

Revolutionaries don't often take the AMA by storm.  We think Gingrich probably
overstates the promise of the free market, and that his rhetoric and ideology
get in the way of smart health policy.  But in 1995, Newt Gingrich set the
agenda.

Runner-up:  Nancy Kassebaum

The retiring icon of incrementalism from Kansas might have been our winner in
many other years.  Few can match the scope and persistence of her efforts to
make the system work better.  She engineered a message vote in the Senate on
the Ryan White CARE Act; worked unstintingly on Food and Drug Administration
reform; co-sponsored action on drive-through deliveries; labored patiently on
incremental insurance reforms; and even held a Senate committee overtime to
conduct an impromptu civics lesson for a group of students after wrapping up
action on national organ transplantation legislation.

Sen.  Kassebaum has been one of the anchors of a group of moderate Republicans
in the Senate who stopped attempts to completely dismantle the Medicaid
program and represent the voice of reason in current budget negotiations.  She
will be missed.

FEDERAL CIRCUIT FINDS
PTO ERRED IN REJECTING
PATENT FOR OBVIOUSNESS.TEXT

     Both a Patent and Trademark Office patent examiner and the
PTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences erred when they
ruled that "similar" elements of a chemical compound are
"identical" elements and, therefore, that a patent application
should be rejected as being obvious in light of the prior art,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Dec. 11.
In re Ochiai et al., No. 92-1446 (Fed. Cir.).

     In 1992, the Patent and Trademark Office's Board of Patent
Appeals and Interferences upheld a patent examiner's rejection of
claims 6-10 of Michihiko Ochiai's patent application Serial
No. 07/462,492 for a method of making "a cephem compound having
antibiotic properties" for obviousness in view of the combined
teachings of six prior art references.

     The principal claim, claim 6, describes the use of a new,
non-obvious acid to make a new, non-obvious cephem, but the
examiner ruled that it actually describes a "standard,
conventional" process starting with an acylation agent (amino
acid) that is only "slightly different" from the prior art to
result in a final product that is only "slightly different."

     On appeal, the board upheld the rejection, agreeing with the
examiner that there was nothing non-obvious in the particular
process chosen and claimed by the appellants.

     The Federal Circuit reversed that finding, however, finding
that the PTO failed to apply the required statutory test of
obviousness under federal patent law, 35 U.S.C. sec. 103, which
requires that one compare the claim's subject matter as a whole
with the prior art to which it pertains.

     In this case, the process that Ochiai recites in claim 6
requires the use of a new, non-obvious acid as one of the
starting materials and, therefore, that claim cannot be obvious,
the circuit court ruled.

     "One having no knowledge of this acid could hardly find it
obvious to make any cephem using this acid as an acylating agent,
much less the particular cephem recited in claim 6.  In other
words, it would not have been obvious to those of ordinary skill
in the art to choose the particular acid of claim 6 as the
acylating agent for the known amine for the simple reason that
the particular acid was unknown but for Ochiai's disclosure in
the 429 application," the court said.

     The examiner incorrectly drew from case law a general
obviousness rule, that a process claim is obvious if the prior
art references disclose the same general process using similar
starting materials, the Federal Circuit found.  However, the
court said, "similarity is...not necessarily obviousness," and
the PTO cannot make up any such per se rules of obviousness for
its own convenience in violation of the fact-intensive
requirement of sec. 103 of the federal patent law.

     "Per se rules that eliminate the need for fact-specific
analysis of claims and prior art may be administratively
convenient for PTO examiners and the Board.  Indeed, they have
been sanctioned by the Board as well.  But reliance on per se
rules of obviousness is legally incorrect and must cease," the
appellate panel declared.

     Ochiai was represented by Harold C. Wegner, Herbert I.
Cantor and Douglas P. Mueller of Foley & Lardner, Washington, DC.
The PTO was represented by Fred E. McKelvey, Nancy J. Linck, Lee
E. Barrett, John W. Dewhirst, Albin F. Drost and Richard E.
Schafer of the Solicitor's Office of the PTO, Arlington, VA.

CLASS ACTION FILED
AGAINST AHF MAKERS BY
COLORADO HEMOPHILIACS.TEXT

     A multi-count Colorado District Court negligence and breach
of warranty class action was filed Oct. 5 by a seven-member group
seeking to represent individuals with " or survivors of persons
who contracted " HIV through tainted antihemophilic factor (AHF)
concentrate in the early 1980s.  Morabito et al. v. Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer et al., No. 95-CV-4409 (CO Dist. Ct., Denver Cty.).

     Targeting Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., Armour Pharmaceutical
Co, Inc., Miles Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corp., Alpha Therapeutic
Corp., and the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), the suit
alleges that the defendants failed to warn hemophiliacs of the
risk of using AHF or employ available processing measures that
would have reduced the incidence of tainted blood.  It also
accuses the pharmaceutical companies of distributing knowingly
HIV-tainted AHF while working to enact infection control measures
and telling hemophiliacs the products were safe.

     The NHF, according to the suit, acted in a "willful and
malicious" manner by presenting itself as an impartial watchdog
for the welfare of hemophiliacs while failing to disclose to its
membership that it was funded "almost entirely from contributions
and other financial support given by the defendant manufacturers
and other affiliated organizations."  NHF's Medical and
Scientific Advisory Committee, according to the suit, was stacked
with physicians who "had received and were continuing to receive
monetary payments from the defendant manufacturers to carry out
their scientific research and, in some cases, to fund clinical
trials for the testing of products manufactured by the defendant
manufacturers."

     The suit asserts claims of negligence, strict liability,
breach of implied warranty, and outrageous conduct against the
pharmaceutical companies and includes a separate liability claim
against NHF.

     "By December 1982, the manufacturers were belatedly
developing new manufacturing techniques to reduce the viral
contamination of AHF products but, in the interim, continued to
aggressively promote and sell their existing AHF products knowing
or having reason to know that said products were defective and
harmful," says the suit.  "Notwithstanding the mounting body of
medical and scientific information in 1982, that AIDS was likely
of viral etiology and the certain knowledge at that stage that it
was blood-borne, the defendants, without any serious basis on
which to dispute such inferences, represented or caused to be
represented that the risk to persons with hemophilia associated
with the use of AHF products was remote and that the likelihood
of a person with hemophilia developing AIDS as a result of AHF
use was insignificant."

     Further, the complaint says, "[d]uring the time frame that
such information was given and produced, it was known that the
hemophilia community and their medical treaters would reasonably
rely on such information and representations coming as they did
from organizations they supposed were in a position of a higher
level of knowledge on the subject matter.  The hemophilia
community supposed that defendants would be acting in accordance
with the best and most conservative state of the medical and
scientific art and be faithful to their legal, ethical and moral
obligations to the thousands of persons with hemophilia."

     The suit was filed by Denver attorneys William E. Brayshaw
and Larry F. Hobbs.

U.S. SUP. CT. LETS STAND
FINDING NIH SCIENTISTS
ARE NOT CO-INVENTORS

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 16 let stand a ruling by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that two
National Institutes of Health scientists merely helped Burroughs
Wellcome Co. reduce its patented invention of the AIDS drug AZT
to practice and are not its co-inventors.  Barr Laboratories Inc.
v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., No. 94-1527 (U.S.); Novopharm Inc. et
al v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., No. 94-1531 (U.S.); see
Pharmaceutical LR, May 1995.

     The Federal Circuit ruling affirmed that Burroughs Wellcome
(BW) is the sole owner of five of six patents for the drug and
that two companies seeking to market generic versions of it are
liable for infringement.  The issue involved hundreds of millions
of dollars in revenues for the rival companies because AZT is one
of the few drugs approved for treatment of AIDS and is prescribed
to nearly all AIDS patients.

     BW began experimenting with different compounds to determine
their effectiveness for treating AIDS in the early 1980s.  At the
same time, scientists at the NIH had developed a test that could
demonstrate a compound's effectiveness against HIV, the
retrovirus that causes AIDS.

     On Feb. 6, 1985, BW's five inventors had prepared a draft
patent application for filing in the United Kingdom.  Two days
earlier, it had sent samples of AZT and other compounds to NIH
for blind testing against its HIV cell line.  When the NIH tests
showed that the compound was active against HIV, BW filed its
patent application in the United Kingdom on March 16, 1985.

     BW subsequently applied for and received the six U.S.
patents for AZT.  After receiving Food and Drug Administration
approval, it began marketing the drug in 1987 under the trademark
Retrovir.

     Barr Laboratories, and then Novopharm Ltd. of Canada, sought
to manufacture generic versions of AZT.  BW filed complaints of
patent infringement against the two companies in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  Both
companies admitted that their generic versions would infringe on
BW's patents, but they claimed BW's patents are invalid and
unenforceable for inequitable conduct because BW failed to name
the two NIH researchers, Drs. Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya,
as co-inventors.

     In July 1993, more than three weeks into what appeared would
be a lengthy trial, U.S. District Judge Malcolm J. Howard issued
a directed verdict for BW, finding the company the sole inventor
of the six patents.

     Barr and Novopharm then appealed to the Federal Circuit,
which affirmed Judge Howard's ruling for five of the patents but
found a significant material fact in dispute on the sixth patent.
According to the circuit court opinion, the central issue of the
case was the question of when the BW inventors conceived their
invention.

     Barr and Novopharm had contended that an inventor's idea
must include a reasonable expectation that an invention will work
for its intended purpose before conception is complete.  In this
case, they argued, conception was not completed until the two NIH
scientists proved that AZT is effective against HIV.  Therefore,
they said, the NIH researchers should have been named as co-
inventors.

     However, the Federal Circuit found that an inventor does not
need to prove that his invention will work for its conception to
be complete.  It is enough for the inventor to prove that he had
a definite and permanent idea that someone skilled in the art
could understand, the panel said.  In this case, BW had in fact
fully conceived the AZT invention by the time it prepared the
draft application for the United Kingdom patent, which was
prepared before the NIH test results were known, the panel found.

     Barr was represented by Dan Webb, Eric L. Hirschhorn, George
C. Lombardi, James F. Hurst and Monique M. Vasilchik of Winston &
Strawn in Chicago.  Novopharm was represented by Robert F. Green,
Bruce M. Gagala and Jeffrey S. Ward of Leydig, Voit & Mayer, also
in Chicago.

     Burroughs Wellcome was represented by E. Anthony Figg of
Rothwell, Figg, Ernst & Kurz, Washington, DC; and Thomas F.
Curnin, Laura Mezey, Daniel L. Cantor and Michael B. Weiss of
Cahill, Gorgon & Reindel of New York City.

BRIEF FILED SUPPORTING
MERRELL'S APPLICATION
FOR WRIT OF ERROR

     Amici curiae The Chemical Manufacturers Association, The
Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America and The Texas
Chemical Council on Dec. 14 filed with the Texas Supreme Court a
brief in support of Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s
application for writ of error in Ernest and Marilyn Havner's suit
alleging that the drug Bendectin caused their daughter's
limb-reduction defect.  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Havner, No. 95-1036 (TX Sup. Ct.); see Pharmaceutical LR, October
1995.

     Merrell contended in its application for writ of error that
the appellate court's decision in this case not only does
injustice between the parties, it eviscerates the standard of the
admissibility of scientific expert testimony that the Texas
Supreme Court recently articulated in E.I. duPont de Nemours and
Co., Inc. v. Robinson, 38 Sup.Ct.J. 852 (June 15, 1995).

     "Indeed, the expert testimony in this case amounts to no
more than guesswork and surmise disguised in a deceptive mantle
of scientific certainty.  As this Court held in Robinson, such
unreliable evidence is inadmissible under Rule 702, and as this
Court concluded in Parker [v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co.
of Wisconsin, 440 S.W.2d 43,47 (Tex, 1969)], evidence of a mere
possibility, even if properly admitted, is insufficient to
sustain a jury verdict," Merrell claimed.
               Merrell's Nov. 16 application pointed to three specific
points of error:

     " "The court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court's
     submission to the jury of unreliable and irrelevant
     causation evidence";

     " "The Havners' expert testimony was legally insufficient to
     establish causation"; and

     " "Merrell was denied due process of law as guaranteed by
     the United States and Texas Constitutions."

     Merrell asked the state's high court to grant writ of error,
reverse the appellate court and render judgment that the Havners
take nothing.

     In their brief in support, the amici offered three central
arguments:

     " "The en banc opinion accepts expert testimony contrary to
     the scientific consensus that Bendectin does not cause birth
     defects";

     " "The en banc opinion contradicts overwhelming precedent
     rejecting respondents' expert testimony"; and

     " "The en banc opinion ignores Robinson's requirement that
     expert scientific testimony be derived by scientific methods
     and reflect 'scientific knowledge.'"

     The brief concluded, "In Robinson, this Court reiterated
that expert testimony must satisfy a threshold standard of
reliability and relevancy before reaching a jury.  Regardless of
how that threshold is articulated, the expert testimony offered
by Respondents cannot pass muster.  This is particularly true
given the uniform body of case law reaching the same conclusion
in other Bendectin cases.  For these reasons, the Court should
grant Petitioner's application for writ of error and reverse the
judgment of the trial court."

     In their suit, the Havners alleged that the prescription
anti-nausea medicine Bendectin, used by Mrs. Havner during her
pregnancy, caused a limb-reduction defect of their daughter's
right hand.  On Oct. 4, 1991, a state court jury in Corpus
Christi, TX, awarded the Havners $30 million in punitive damages
and $3.75 million in compensatory damages; punitive damages were
later reduced to $20 million.  In March 1994, the court threw out
the jury verdict in favor of the Havners, finding that they had
failed to present anything more than suspicion on the essential
element of causation.  The court then granted rehearing en banc,
heard oral argument before the entire court and, in August 1995,
affirmed the judgment below with regard to liability and actual
damages, but reversed that part of the jury verdict awarding
punitive damages.

     The court held that, in reviewing the factual sufficiency of
evidence, a court could only exercise its jurisdiction over
factual sufficiency to prevent a manifestly unjust result; it
could not reweigh the evidence and set aside a jury verdict
merely because the judges feel that a different result is more
reasonable.  It said a jury is the sole judge of the credibility
of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.
Here, it said, each of the witnesses was extensively cross-
examined; flaws in their credentials, methodological
disagreements and errors of omission in their testimony were
explored by opposing counsel; and each of the experts' work was
criticized by an expert for the opposing party.  After reweighing
the evidence to determine if the jury's verdict is so contrary to
the greater weight of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust,
the court concluded that the verdict as to causation is supported
by sufficient evidence.

     As for punitive damages, the court concluded that the
evidence "is too weak to support the conclusion that Merrell Dow
was consciously indifferent to an extreme risk that Bendectin
could cause limb reduction defects if taken during the critical
period of pregnancy."

     Merrell's application for writ of error was filed by Robert
L. Dickson, Hall R. Marston and George E. Berry with Dickson,

MI CT. GRANTS SUMMARY
JUDGMENT TO MERRELL
IN BENDECTIN SUIT

     Finding that the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts was
inadmissible because their methodology was not generally accepted
by teratologists, the Wayne County, MI, Circuit Court on Nov. 27
granted summary judgment to Bendectin manufacturer Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  DePyper et al. v. Navarro et al., No. 83-
303467-NM (MI Cir. Ct., Wayne Cty.).

     "Given the otherwise unexplained incidence of birth defects,
scientific uncertainty as to their origin, and widespread
scientific recognition that Bendectin is not a human teratogen,
it is necessary that there be expert scientific testimony which
demonstrates that more probably than not Bendectin is a human
teratogen and a cause of the injury, and further, that such an
opinion be grounded in generally accepted scientific
methodology," the court said.  The court conducted a Davis/Frye
inquiry, and said it was not concerned with what plaintiffs'
experts finally concluded, but rather the methodology or process
or basis for their conclusions, and whether it is generally
accepted or recognized.

     In determining whether the methodology used by plaintiffs'
experts to establish causation is generally recognized by
teratologists, the court made note of factors established by
Michigan case law, including:  Have the results been published?
Has there been independent or objective verification?  Has there
been independent testing and what are the rates of error?  And
has there been criticism of the method or technique within the
scientific community?

     The court said that, among other factors, "at least two high
quality epidemiological studies showing a strong association
between the substance and the occurrence of a birth defect" are
required to show that a substance is a human teratogen.  In
reaching this conclusion, the court did not reject out of hand
the assertion that in vitro studies, animal studies or structure
activity data have a role in determining whether a substance is a
human teratogen.  But it said these types of data have their own
limitations that inherently limit their usefulness or
applicability, and reliance on such data to form an opinion on
human teratogenicity would basically amount to no more than
speculation.

     "Given the lack of any epidemiological studies that show any
meaningful statistical positive association, this Court finds
that teratologists using generally accepted methodology, could
not conclude that Bendectin can more probably than not cause limb
reduction birth defects in any given case," the court said.  It
accordingly found that the opinions of the plaintiffs' experts
are not supported by a methodology generally accepted by
teratologists, so the opinions of those experts that Bendectin is
a human teratogen are inadmissible because they fail the
Davis/Frye test.  In a footnote, the court said its conclusion
would be the same under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993) (see Pharmaceutical LR, November
1995, P. 10,790), another Bendectin case.  The Daubert test has
not been adopted in Michigan; the Davis/Frye rule is Michigan's
standard governing the admissibility of scientific evidence.  The
court, therefore, granted Merrell's summary judgment motion.
               Lawrence R. DePyper Sr. and Jane N. DePyper filed suit on
behalf of their son and themselves, claiming that Lawrence R.
DePyper Jr.'s limb reduction birth defects were caused by in
utero exposure to Bendectin, which Jane DePyper ingested while
pregnant.  The court granted Merrell's summary judgment motion,
citing two earlier published federal cases.

     However, on appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed
and remanded, stating it was satisfied that the evidentiary rule
in those cases did not comport with Michigan jurisprudence.  The
appellate court said the trial court should conduct a Davis/Frye
inquiry into the question:  "Do impartial and disinterested
experts in the field of teratology generally accept the
methodology employed by plaintiffs' expert in assessing the
impact of in vivo, in vitro, chemical structure and animal
studies in determining teratogenicity?"

     The DePypers were represented by Barry J. Nace with Paulson,
Nace, Norwind & Sellinger of Washington, DC; and by Robert A.
Tyler with Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz of Southfield,
MI.  Merrell was represented by Frank C. Woodside III and Fred
Erny with Dinsmore & Shohl of Cincinnati; and by Lamont E.
Buffington with Garan, Lucow, Miller, Seward, Cooper & Becker,
P.C. of Detroit.

$1.5 MILLION AWARDED IN
NEGLIGENCE SUIT AGAINST
NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER

     A New York Supreme Court jury in Manhattan on Dec. 19
awarded $1.5 million to a 16-year-old Staten Island resident who
said New York Blood Center's (NYBC) failure to employ surrogate
marker or Hepatitis B-core antibody tests led to his receipt of
HIV-tainted blood during a 1984 heart operation.  DiPaolo et al.
v. Greater New York Blood Center et al., No. 2751/91, (NY Sup.
Ct., New York Cty.); see Pharmaceutical LR, January 1996.

     Attorneys for both sides disagree, however, whether the
amount will be set off by settlements already obtained by
plaintiff Joseph "Joey" DiPaolo.

     Capping six days of deliberation, the panel, however, ruled
for co-defendant Dr. Richard Golinko, the pediatric cardiologist
who recommended that DiPaolo undergo surgery.  DiPaolo said the
doctor failed to obtain informed consent before allowing the
operation to proceed and accused him of failing to reveal the
existence of a then-pending test to identify HIV antibodies.
Dr. Golinko said such duties were those of DiPaolo's surgeons.

     DiPaolo was operated on at Downstate Medical Center in
Brooklyn, NY, on May 23, 1984.  During the procedure to correct
an atrial septal heart defect, he received some 16 units of NYBC-
supplied blood components.  One of those units was tainted with
the AIDS virus.

     DiPaolo, who tested HIV-positive at age eight, alleged in
his suit that NYBC neglected to "aggressively institute" a
directed donations policy, educate doctors about the risk of
transmitting HIV via blood and blood components, or directly
interrogate donors about any high-risk behaviors.

     In 1993, the surgeons settled with DiPaolo and his family
for $1.2 million.  The hospital entered a separate $400,000
settlement.

     Both sides are expected to file various post-trial motions
before the end of January, including a plaintiff's request for a
new trial on the damages issue.  Plaintiff co-counsel Robert
Jenner says he expects to appeal the jury's charge on the
standard of care question and to ask the court whether the
aggregate $1.6 million settlement DiPaolo received from the
surgeons and hospital is considered, under New York law, a set-
off against the $1.5 million jury verdict.

     NYBC attorney Roger K. Solymosy of Brody & Fabiani in New
York City expressed little concern over the jury's award, saying
that under a recent state appellate court ruling, there is
clearly a set-off against the amounts the plaintiff already
received.  Solymosy says he expects to file several pro forma
post-trial motions on behalf of his client before expiration of a
30-day deadline.

     Jenner says although the jury entered a "very compromised
verdict on damages," DiPaolo is "very pleased that NYBC was held
responsible after avoiding such responsibility in so many cases
to date.  My client, however, still has AIDS whether the award
was $1.5 million or $1.5 billion."  Although Jenner did not seek
a specific amount in damages, during the nine-week trial he
frequently cited an internal NYBC memo stating that the blood
bank stood to save some $10 million by avoiding core-antibody
tests.

     DiPaolo is represented by Jenner and by Martin Freeman of
Freeman & Jenner in Bethesda, MD; and by Dennis Drasco of Lum,
Danzis, Drasco, Positan & Kleinberg in Roseland, NJ.  Golinko is
represented by Jay Rappaport and Nancy A. Steptoe of Aaronson,
Rappaport, Feinstein & Deutsch, LLP in New York City.

WIDOW TELLS IL SUP. CT.
$2.14 MILLION NEGLIGENCE
RULING SHOULD BE AFFIRMED

     The widow of a man who died of AIDS as the result of
receiving HIV-tainted blood during a February 1984 heart
operation urged the Illinois Supreme Court on Dec. 11 to second a
state Appellate Court's affirmation of a $2.14 million jury
verdict against United Blood Services (UBS), the supplier of the
bad blood.  Advincula v. United Blood Services, No. 79653 (IL
Sup. Ct.); see Pharmaceutical LR, January 1996.

     Marietta Advincula told the high court the rulings below
should stand and that it should reject the blood bank's assertion
that the trial court misapplied the Illinois Blood Shield Law
(745 ILCS 40/3 [1994]) in judging the case under a "due care"
rather than a "professional liability" standard based on
adherence to industry practice.  The 75-page brief says that even
if UBS were judged under the latter test, the verdict would stand
by virtue of its failure to follow internal procedures at the
1984 blood drive during which the implicated "John Donor"
provided the tainted blood.  UBS barred him from giving blood
once a 1986 donation proved HIV-positive.

     "UBS' fundamental position is that 'only a failure to adhere
to [professional] standards can give rise to liability' [emphasis
added]," says the Advincula brief.  "Both the circuit court and
the appellate court were correct in rejecting this
argument...because it conflicts with the plain language of the
Blood Shield Law and violates fundamental principles of statutory
interpretation....  The Blood Shield Law states that a blood bank
warrants that it has 'exercised due care and followed
professional standards of care in providing the service according
to the current state of the medical arts [emphasis added].  This
language, and in particular, the conjunctive 'and,' plainly
imposes two requirements " a blood bank must exercise due care
and follow professional standards of care."

     Advincula says the court should reject the asserted UBS
interpretation of sec. 40/3, that blood banks are "to exercise
due care in following professional standards of care."  Because
neither that interpretation, nor those offered in amicus
petitions by the American Red Cross, the American Association of
Blood Banks and Abbott Laboratories, says the plaintiff, "adheres
to the language the Legislature did adopt, they all should be
rejected."

     Adds Advincula, "[T]he phrases 'exercised due care' and
'followed professional standard of care' describes the means by
which a blood bank is to fulfill this responsibility.
Accordingly, compliance with professional standards of care is
not necessarily conclusive evidence that a blood bank has
satisfied its duty of care.  If such standards do not incorporate
currently known and available safeguards at the time of the blood
donation at issue, then compliance with them is not enough."

     The brief says that despite knowledge held by UBS in early
1983 that homosexual men should be barred from donating blood and
that any of several surrogate marker tests would have almost
eliminated the threat of HIV in the blood supply, UBS took no
such action.  Surrogate tests, it adds, were rejected on a
business basis because of their cost.  The suit over the AIDS
death of Ronaldo Advincula, says the brief, is not grounded on
medical malpractice claims as intimated by UBS, because the final
authority over whether to implement surrogate tests rested with
then-UBS Chief Executive Officer Hayle Rudolph.

     Responding to the claim UBS made in its Illinois Supreme
Court brief, Advincula says she is not required to show that her
late husband would have avoided HIV infection if any of five
discussed surrogate tests were in effect in February 1984.
Testimony from her experts, she says, indicated that any of the
tests would have been effective in disqualifying HIV-positive
donors.  The Hepatitis B Core Antibody test, said plaintiff
expert Dr. Thomas Asher, was the most thorough test available,
while another plaintiff expert estimated there was a 100%
probability that the test would have excluded John Donor's blood
in 1984.

     The Advincula brief states that even if UBS were to be
judged under a professional standard, as it wishes, the jury's
verdict would still stand, based on the blood bank's failure to
adhere to its own operating procedures.  "UBS argues that nothing
UBS could have done would have kept John Donor from donating
because he did not think he was at risk for AIDS," argues the
plaintiff.  "The evidence, however, showed that John Donor was a
gay man...; that gay men were at highest risk for AIDS...; and
that UBS did not adequately educate John Donor before and during
the blood drive about those who were at risk for AIDS and should
not donate blood....  The evidence also showed that had UBS used
proper screening methods at a properly conducted blood drive,
John Donor would have excluded himself or been deferred.  It was
undisputed that UBS did nothing to educate John Donor before or
after he arrived at the blood drive."

     Concluded the brief, "Additionally, contrary to UBS' claim,
John Donor testified that he never received any 'disqualifying
information' in any of the years he donated blood from 1983 to
1986....  Thus, UBS' argument that better screening in 1984 would
have made no difference because John Donor donated in 1985 and
1986 when UBS gave more specific information to donors...is
without merit.  Further, the jury could well have concluded that
had UBS educated John Donor properly in 1984, he would not have
donated then."  Because UBS failed to obtain written
acknowledgment from the donor in 1984 that he had read and
understood the blood bank's "Important Message" notice on AIDS,
adds Advincula, "UBS' negligence in this regard violated the
industry practices and UBS' own policy."

     Advincula is represented by Judith Fors and Margaret Byrne
of Chicago; and by Maureen Witt, Elizabeth Phelan and Carlos
Samour of Holland & Hart in Denver.  UBS is represented by
Michael Brody, Jerold Solovy, Barry Levanstam and Jeralyn Baran

ARIZONA JUDGE CERTIFIES
PARTIAL HIV/BLOOD CLASS
ACTION ON TIME ISSUE.TEXT

     Although rejecting class proceedings on negligence,
liability and failure to warn claims, a U.S. District Court judge
in Tucson on Dec. 4 granted partial class action status to all
Arizonans infected with HIV via blood transfusions between July
1982 and March 1985.  Doe et al. v. American Red Cross et al.,
No. CV 94-521 TUC RMB (D AZ).

     Judge Richard M. Bilby ruled that lead plaintiff Jane Doe,
the widow of an AIDS-infected blood recipient, failed to show the
case met the class certification requirements of FRCP 23(b)(1)(A)
because there are too many individual variables for class
members, including time and medical factors.  A  partial class
action, however, is appropriate for class determination of
another issue under FRCP 23(b)(3), said the judge.  That issue
is:

     At that point in time, if ever, between 1982 and 1985
     was sufficient information available to cause a reasonable
     blood components provider to adopt screening and testing
     procedures to protect Arizona transfusion recipients from
     the transmission of HIV.

     Because "individual questions of fact predominate over
common questions of law or fact," said Judge Bilby, the class
action device is not a "superior means of adjudicating this
entire controversy."  Even if a class were certified on the
liability, negligence and failure to warn claims, the judge noted
that "a great deal of time and expense would be involved in the
conduct of individual trials necessary to determine liability as
to each potential member, creating great difficulties in the
management of the litigation."

     On the certified issue, however, the order held, "What a
jury will determine on a class-wide basis is whether, and if so
when, the defendants had the knowledge needed to eliminate or
reduce the risk of HIV-tainted blood being used for transfusion."
The jury, noted Judge Bilby, "will not reach the question of
ultimate liability of any defendant to any particular plaintiff."

     The judge said class certification of the time issue
satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) because it aids in
efficient case management.  "The time that the knowledge was
available is the same in each individual case although each
plaintiff may have been affected differently," said the
certification order.  "The class issue of available knowledge at
a particular time is much more narrow than negligence.  If the
jury determines a date at which time sufficient knowledge was
available that a reasonable blood provider would have implemented
donor screening and blood testing measures, that date serves to
include and exclude plaintiffs.  This will greatly aid in the
fair and speedy adjudication of this controversy by deciding a
key issue that is common to each claim and will not need to be
relitigated."

     Added Judge Bilby, "...[T]his is not the type of issue that
an individual plaintiff would have a strong interest in
controlling.  The availability of knowledge at a certain point in
time is not particular to any plaintiff and does not require a
venture into her lifestyle and personal circumstances.  The
determination of knowledge availability is distinct from its
impact on any one person."

     In addition to lead defendant American Red Cross, other
named defendants include United Blood Services (UBS), a division
of Blood Systems, Inc., the American Association of Blood Banks
(AABB), Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC), and the
University of Arizona.

     In an Oct. 16 opposition brief, the Red Cross said there are
no common issues which would lend to class resolution and that
Doe's suit fails to meet the requirements of either FRCP
23(b)(1)(A) or 23(b)(3).  "[E]ven if plaintiff's issues were
certified for class action treatment, not only damages, but even
the defendants' liability to each individual class member would
still have to be litigated separately," said the Red Cross.
"Thus, the class certification plaintiff requests will result in
mere advisory opinions on certain abstract issues.  Moreover,
those advisory will not meaningfully advance the litigation, or
even save time in the individual class member trials that must
follow the class issue trial, because the bulk of the evidence
will have to be presented and considered again in the individual
class member trials."

     The plaintiffs are represented by Rose Marie Ibanez of
Ibanez and Wilkinson, and J. Patrick Butler of Dickerson, Butler,
Rabb & Rodriguez, P.C., both in Tucson.  The Red Cross is
represented by Joseph E. Mais and Samuel A. Thumma of Brown &
Bain in Phoenix; and Tracy L. Merritt, William H. Forman and
Jacqueline R. Denning (of counsel) of Arnold & Porter in
Washington, DC.  Foster Robberson of Lewis & Roca in Phoenix
represents UBS.  CCBC is represented by Ellen Wheeler of Tucson.
The AABB is represented by Tom Manning of O'Connor, Cohn, Dillon
& Barr in San Francisco.  Michael W. Capp of Weyl, Guyer, MacBan
& Olson in Tucson represents the University of Arizona.

CIBA ARGUES THAT NEGLIGENCE
CLAIMS BY CA WOMAN ARE
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW.TEXT

     Approved labels and warnings on medical devices are
"specific requirements" of federal law that preempt causes of
action brought under state law, respondent Ciba Vision Corp.
argued in its answer to a petition filed by a California woman
asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling
that all of her claims against Ciba are preempted by the Medical
Devices Amendments (MDA).  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp.,
No. S049608 (CA Sup. Ct.); see Pharmaceutical LR, January 1996.

     In its Nov. 15 answer, Ciba contended that the California
Court of Appeal, Sixth District, was aligned with a majority of
jurisdictions that have held that federal law preempts causes of
action brought under state law.

     Appellant Leslie Scott brought suit in California state
court against Ciba, alleging claims of strict liability,
negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and breach of
implied warranty.  Scott claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, from its saline solution.  She claimed that as a result
of her failure to distinguish between the bottles, she suffered
chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts in the
AOSEPT solution instead of the saline solution.

     Scott argued that, around the time of her injury, Ciba had
begun to market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also
continued to market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons
not wearing their contacts would have difficulty in
distinguishing the two.

     The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding Scott's claims preempted by the
MDA.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District,
affirmed the trial court.

     The Court of Appeal cited to Evraets v. Intermedics
Intraocular, Inc., 29 Cal.App.4th 786, and 21 C.F.R. sec.
808.1(b), in holding that the "requirement" the Food and Drug
Administration refers to in sec. 360k includes "any requirement
having the force and effect of law 'whether established by
statute, ordinance, regulation, or court decision.'"

     Examining Scott's argument that the MDA contains no specific
counterpart regulations regarding AOSEPT, the Court of Appeal
held that all Class III medical devices are subject to the
requirements of the MDA, which include the FDA's stringent
premarket approval (PMA) process.

     In her petition to the California Supreme Court, Scott
argued that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed
the issue of federal preemption concerning Class III devices
found that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v.
Pacesetter Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

     Some of the leading cases that have expounded on the issue
of preemption have recently been criticized, Scott said.  For
example, the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' 1984 ruling in
Martello v. Ciba Vision Corp. gave sec. 360k(a), the MDA's
preemption provision, an expansive reading, but was criticized in
the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kennedy, Scott said.  "The...Ninth
Circuit in Kennedy...stated that the language of [sec.] 360k(a)
does not create the broad, sweeping preemption found by the
'strained reading of the statute' by the court in Martello,"
Scott argued.

     And, Scott said, state actions that attempt to enforce
federal standards are not preempted.  Citing to Evraets, the
appellant said, regarding a claim of negligence per se, since the
state requirements are equal to the federal requirements because
they adopt the federal standards, they are not preempted.

     On the other hand, Ciba argued in its answer that a
consistent line of cases holds that state law tort and warranty
causes of action are preempted because the pre-market approval
process envelopes the approved product in specific requirements
of federal law.

     "Scott makes no claim of any defect in the design or
manufacture of AOSEPT," Ciba said.  "Rather, she contends that
California tort and warranty law required that Ciba Vision
package and label AOSEPT differently in order to warn users
against accidental placement of deneutralized solution in the
eye."

     Ciba argued that this is a "strong case for MDA preemption"
because of AOSEPT's premarket approval and Scott's singular focus
on warning deficiencies in the product.

     The respondent said that the court's decision in Evraets,
which Scott cited in her petition, does not warrant review by the
state Supreme Court.  Ciba said Evraets does not deal with a
device that received FDA premarket approval.

     "Evraets contains a discussion of the preemption of state
law claims for breach of warranty that is consistent with the
decision in Scott," Ciba said.  "Evraets only reaches the issue
of preemption in relation to a claim of breach of an express
warranty."

     Ciba concluded that by enacting the MDA, Congress interposed
the FDA as an expert watchdog and preempted certain state law
causes of action.  A jury ought not be allowed to rethink the
sufficiency of labels and packaging that the FDA endorsed, said
Ciba.

     Scott is represented by Jonathan D. Gordon of the Law
Offices of Jonathan D. Gordon in Denver.  Ciba is represented by
Thomas M. Peterson and Diane S. Rice of Brobeck, Phleger &
Harrison in San Francisco.

Hospital Overhauls Information System To Adopt
Client-Server Environment


Tired of the lack of communication between and duplication of
effort among components of its budding integrated delivery system,
one Texas hospital decided to rework the entire information system.
Hermann Hospital of Houston embarked on a three-year initiative to
phase in a system to create an electronic medical record accessible
from all parts of the network, says CIO David Tucker.
The first phase involves pilot tests at five or six University of
Texas clinics associated with the hospital. After phase one is
complete, the hospital will focus on integrating other departments,
such as nursing, into the network.
The hospital currently operates in a mainframe environment, but is
now moving to a client-server environment that makes information
more accessible to the end-user, Tucker says.
The paperless, client-server system will eliminate the need for
duplicate medical records scattered around the network.
For example, if a patient goes into a clinic in the morning, then
goes to the Hermann emergency room that night, physicians in the ER
have no way of knowing about the encounter that morning and will
draw up a new chart, Tucker says.
When implemented, the system will link about 2,000 devices,
including workstations and printers, located at about 60 clinics in
the area. Hermann hopes to have the first pilot systems in place by
September.
Contact Tucker at (713) 704-3367.

Hospital Slashes Patient Admission Time Using
`Administrative Partner' Program


Physician managers at a Southern California hospital credit
first-phase implementation of a patient-focused quality care model
- the use of "administrative partners" - with shorter patient
waits, increased cash collections and other process improvements.
"Our overall goal is to bring services closer to the patient, to
eliminate wait times, the redundancy of people asking the same
questions of the patient"to rework the entire patient flow process
so it is simpler and easier from a patient's perspective," says
Kari Cornicelli, director of financial operations at 109-bed
Pomerado Hospital in Poway, Calif.
Called Patient First, Pomerado's four-stage program began in April
1994 with implementation of the administrative partners phase.
"Service partners" was implemented in March 1995, and the hospital
plans to begin "clinical care partners" (training direct-care staff
for multiple tasks and improved case management) and "family
partners" (working with families to improve care for discharged
patients) by the end of 1996.
Pomerado's sister hospital, 353-bed Palomar Medical Center in
Escondido, Calif., runs a similar patient-focused care program.
Administrative partners, which combine the roles of unit secretary
and admitting clerk, surpassed some stated goals:

o       Average admission time fell to 3.07
minutes by December 1995, down from 15 minutes in February 1994.
The 1995 goal: not to exceed 5 minutes.
o       Monthly cash collections rose to
$86,752 by December 1995, up from $15,270 in February 1994. The
1995 goal: $53,000.

From February 1994 to year-end 1995, officials also cite the
following process improvement indicators for administrative
partners: 
(1) Completed account files for patient billing rose to
86% from 50% (below a 1995 goal of 95% completion); 
(2) Advanced directive acknowledgments on patient charts
climbed to 92% from 61.8% (above a 90% goal);
(3) Signed requests for extension of hospital stay for Medi-Cal
patients increased to 92% from 83% (below a 98% goal).

Pomerado then re-designed the role of the environmental service
worker/housekeeper. Housekeeper  duties were limited to some
cleaning chores. But Pomerado trained 11 FTEs as "service partners"
to clean an entire floor and to ambulate patients and perform basic
comfort duties, such as getting blankets and water.
Registered nurse Lori Burnell, assistant administrator and nurse
executive, says Pomerado saved $173,800 in its service partners
phase through staff consolidation and the elimination of 4.2 FTEs.

Plans Target Accessible MDs For Contracts, Rewards


An increasing number of managed care plans are rewarding primary
care physicians based on their ability to take on new patients.
The trend started a few years ago and has taken root in mature East
and West Coast markets and in  the Twin Cities, says Bill
Townsend, a consultant in Towers Perrin's integrated health systems
group in Minneapolis.
The move toward rewarding MDs for seeing more patients is part of
a broader strategy among employers and managed care plans to
increase access to services. To meet this objective, a plan or
employer must first make sure it contracts with doctors who offer
easy access to patients.
According to Townsend, plans and employers use a variety of methods
to reward MDs who maintain their access for patients, including:

o       Paying an MD a flat bonus for
keeping his or her practice open to new patients; or
o       Tying the MD's share of any surplus
pool to the percentage of plan enrollees that physician sees.

Generally, plans and employers don't set "growth targets" that
specifically reward MDs for increasing the number of patients they
see over a period of time, Keyes says. That's because allocating
the risk pool based on the number of enrollees an MD sees
encourages doctors to add new patients, he explains.

Hospital Restructures Triage To Speed Interventions


Finding its emergency room triage system redundant and frustrating
to patients, Fairfax (Va.) Hospital's continuous quality
improvement team empowered nurses to intervene in certain patient
cases.
The result: a 40% reduction in turnaround time for intervention in
extreme-trauma cases. The same triage method was used to conduct
septic workups on children, stomach pain, and urinary tract
infections.
The 700-bed, level-one trauma center receives about 62,000
emergency room visits annually and admits 23% of its patients.
That's a significant number compared to most emergency departments,
which admit an average 12% to 15% cases.
Most emergency departments have four vertical care "silos" that
patients encounter, says Dr. Thom Mayer, chairman of the department
of emergency medicine. Those silos: (1) physicians; (2) nurses;
(3) essential service providers such as lab and X-ray
technicians; and (4) registration personnel.
But each silo operates independently, leading to redundancies and
patient frustration.
Applying continuous quality improvement methods, Fairfax emergency
department representatives held monthly quality council meetings to
determine how to improve services.
The team examined the amount of time it took to get a patient into
an X-ray or to the lab and the number of steps involved in the
process.
One result: a key staffer intervenes in patient cases and guides
cases through the emergency room.
For more information, contact Mayer at (703)  698-3195.

HMOs Held Financially Liable For Meeting Quality Goals


A Denver small-business alliance has launched a "performance
program" of quality indicators - complete with financial incentives
and disincentives - for health plans in its Cooperative for Health
Insurance Purchasing (CHIP).
Founded in 1988, the Colorado Health Care Purchasing Alliance
offers two products to its 370-odd members, which represent 85,000
covered lives: a PPO for self-insured companies and the CHIP. About
228 companies, representing 5,000 covered lives, use the purchasing
alliance.
The "performance program" covers the four CHIP HMOs with which the
alliance contracts for standard benefit plans. The program sets
seven indicators, with common objectives for each.
Financial incentives and disincentives were a part of the plan from
the beginning, says LaDon Kessler, alliance information manager. At
the end of the year, the best-performing health plan in each
indicator gets 50% of the pool accumulating over the year from
plans not meeting the goal.
Service indicators are reported monthly and financially assessed
quarterly; other indicators, including provider access and member
satisfaction, are reported annually and financially assessed
annually. Clinical indicators have no financial adjustment.
Assessments run 0.333% of total quarterly premium for service
indicators, and 0.333% of total annual premium for satisfaction and
provider access indicators.
Close to the fall open enrollment period, the alliance will release
a "report card" that shows plans'  performance against the seven
indicators' common  objectives. The alliance may attach some
HEDIS results to the report card.

Blues Group Implements Appropriateness Rules


The National Account Consortium, a group of nine Blue Cross and
Blue Shield plans with national employer accounts, has adopted
nationwide standards for treatment appropriateness for all
participating caregivers.
The standards, developed by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn.'s
Technology Evaluation Center, are outcomes- and protocol-based.
Other health plans, including Cigna, Prudential, Kaiser and HCFA,
use the system as well.
The consortium is implementing the standards as part of its managed
care strategy, says Dr. Alex Rodriguez, medical director of the
Stamford, Ct.-based consortium. The standards apply to HMO, PPO,
point-of-service (POS) and indemnity plans.
Consortium members use the standards to determine payment for
services. If physicians don't follow the standards, they could be
denied payment, may not receive authorization for treatment, and,
if inappropriate utilization persists, risk exclusion from provider
panels.
The standards systematize more than 200 medical evaluations and
treatments that involve complicated diagnoses, including
controversial, high-risk and high-cost treatments. They also
provide a summary of appropriate and inappropriate care with
references to scientific evidence, and include the appropriate
procedure and diagnosis codes for treatments such as routine Pap
smears for women.
The consortium plans to automate the standards to allow for more
rapid payment of claims. Blues plans in California, Connecticut,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas
participate.

Problems with Provider Risk Outlined in Safe Harbors


The final managed care "safe harbor" regulations raise the specter
of false claims accusations for providers who participate in
non-contract managed care plans that use withholds, lawyers say.
Issued Jan. 25 by the HHS inspector general, safe harbors protect
certain deals from prosecution under the Medicare-Medicaid
anti-kickback law (61 FR 2122).
The preamble to the regulations state the IG has "declined to
provide specific safe harbor protection to withhold pools, risk
incentive pools or other types of incentive programs offered by
non-contract managed care plans" (PM 2/9/96, p. 8).
The safe harbors expand the definition of "health plan" to protect
a wider variety of managed care arrangements, including (1) PPOs
that act as intermediaries between providers and payers and (2)
self-insured employers or union welfare funds that contract
directly with providers or insurance companies.
The rules also protect provider fee-for-service discounts to
managed care plans, as well as some capitated arrangements that
plans make with providers. But they don't protect other forms of
provider risk assumption, such as payment withholds and risk pools.
The safe harbors only protect the waiver of Medicare coinsurance
and deductibles in Medicare risk and cost-contract HMOs and the
waiver of inpatient hospital coinsurance and deductibles in
Medicare Select PPOs and HMOs. The rules don't protect waivers of
coinsurance and deductibles in other types of plans.

Group Tackles Pregnancy Care In First Report Card Effort


Dallas/Forth Worth employers, hospitals and physicians have joined
forces in an ambitious first-time effort to measure health care
quality and value - and thus improve health communitywide.
Called the Health Care Value Initiative, the collaboration by the
DFW Business Group on Health, Dallas-Forth Worth Hospital Council,
5,900-member Dallas County Medical Society, and 2,000-member
Tarrant County Medical Society in Fort Worth seeks to design a
quality report card with uniform standards for health providers to
disseminate to the business community by March 1997.
While the initial focus is on measuring quality during pregnancy
and childbirth, which employers cite as a top concern, the group
also plans to examine cardiology, orthopedics, oncology and
psychiatry, says John Gavras, president of the 82-member hospital
council.
Pregnancy and childbirth indicators include maternal mortality
rate; neonatal mortality rate; post-operative mortality rate;
C-section rates (primary, secondary, total and vaginal birth after
C-section); post-operative surgical site infection; uterine rupture
rate; infection rate (metritis only); and unplanned neonatal
readmission. All are risk-adjusted.
The group also will examine indicators that are not risk-adjusted,
including complications due to anesthetic/sedation.
The coalition will follow up with health risk assessment and
patient satisfaction surveys.
The hospital council anticipates statewide comparison of hospital
data and perhaps comparison with cities such as Seattle and Kansas
City, Mo.
Participating hospitals will sign a confidentiality statement so
data will not be used for marketing; the council will sign a
confidentiality statement with members underscoring an
understanding that data are hospital-owned.

Telephone Survey Comments Influence Outcomes Initiatives


Using qualitative comments gleaned from post-discharge patient
satisfaction surveys, a children's hospital tries to pull parents
into pediatric care decisions and influence patient outcomes.
The hospital gleans qualitative comments from 20-minute telephone
surveys of parents conducted 10 days after patient discharge. Those
comments - positive and negative - show up on a large bulletin
board in the waiting room of the hospital's outpatient center for
cancer and blood disorders.
HealthCare Research Systems of Columbus, Ohio, conducts the
telephone surveys - about 400 twice a year for the outpatient
center, in addition to mail and other surveys performed for the
facility over the past four years.
If the comment is negative, the hospital lists the action it took
to fix the problem.
Comments generally deal with how a physician listened to the
parents, how much time the physician spent with the parents, and
whether the physician involved the parents in decisions made about
a child's medical care.
Although some quantitative scores are posted, they don't interest
parents as much as the qualitative scores, contends Charlie Hauser,
vice president of the provider division for HealthCare Research
Systems.
The goal: encourage parental involvement by breaking down the
intimidating and often mysterious barriers surrounding medical
care. By encouraging family participation, the bulletin board has
a positive effect on the patient's outcomes, Hauser says.

Nurse Quality Initiative Garners `Magnet Hospital' Rank


An Atlanta hospital's initiative to give nurses more
decision-making authority at the patient bedside and in turn boost
quality of care nabbed the facility "magnet hospital" status.
Saint Joseph's Hospital of Atlanta became the third hospital
nationwide to earn recognition by the American Nurses Credentialing
Center as a magnet hospital for nursing care.
The center reviews documentation and conducts site visits to
evaluate whether a hospital meets nursing standards in nine areas,
including quality assurance. More than 200 criteria are used.
The voluntary, four-year magnet hospital designation allows
hospitals to go beyond the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations' overview to a closer examination of
nursing programs, says Mary Tilbury, consultant to the magnet
program.
Noting that Atlanta's highly competitive health market includes
50-odd hospitals and a recent influx of managed care, Kim Sharkey,
the hospital's director of nursing business planning and support
services, says Saint Joseph's sought magnet status to get
recognition of ongoing positive feedback from physicians, patients
and families on a shared governance professional practice model.
Implemented in 1981, the practice model allows the nurse at bedside
greater decision-making autonomy. The model includes nurse quality
assurance, management, and practice and education councils.
Saint Joseph's uses a top-down, multidisciplinary approach to
continuous quality improvement. The hospital also uses national
databases to compare performance on quality measures. "Our feeling
is if we can validate outcomes that are positive, payers ultimately
will realize cost is important but outcomes are even more
important," Sharkey says.
Contact Sharkey at (404) 851-7296, and Tilbury at (202) 651-7000.

Hospital Cuts Paper Chase Out of System Buy Process


In its search for a new information system, a New York hospital
found an alternative to the usual paper-intensive process of
submitting a request for proposal (RFP) to vendors.
Brooks Memorial Hospital of Dunkirk, N.Y., first sent out a request
for information to 13 vendors and narrowed the choice to seven.
But an RFP involves a great deal of paperwork on both sides and
often is not filled with information that prospective buyers can
really use. So hospital CFO Ralph Webdale chaired a 13-member
committee that included physicians and representatives from
nursing, billing, accounting and pharmacy departments.
For one day a week, each of the seven vendors did on-site demos in
each department. Committee members independently rated each
vendor's software package, then discussed the systems' strengths
and weaknesses as a group.
A vital element of the review process was the telephone reference,
Webdale says. Each committee member spoke to their counterparts at
hospitals that had installed the vendors' products, then rated and
discussed each product based on the conversations.
The final step: rate the documentation of the top six vendors based
on criteria such as ease-of-use.
Contact Webdale at (716) 366-1111.

Contract `Gag Clauses' Rare, Seldom Used on MDs


Like it or not, physicians generally have little choice but to
agree to the "gag clauses" included in HMO provider contracts.
However, few HMOs use the wide-ranging clauses that lately have
drawn backlash from physicians, consumers and legislators, say
experts.
HMOs say the clauses, when used, prevent MDs from (1) disclosing
proprietary information, (2) spoiling a patient's opinion of the
health plan, or (3) enticing the patient to enroll in a competing
plan.
But physicians say the "gag clauses" distort the  doctor-patient
relationship because they prohibit physicians from explaining to
thier patients that treatment decisions are based on a health
plan's appropriateness standards, treatment guidelines or payment
rules.

"Gag clauses" can range from:

o       A simple clause that says a
physician faces termination for interfering with the plan's
relations with employer groups and business contacts; to
o       A dictum that MDs can't undermine
the confidence of enrollees, potential enrollees, employers, plan
sponsors or others in the plan's quality of care; to
o       A prohibition on physicians
discussing the HMO-provider compensation arrangement, advising
patients to disenroll, or recommending to patients services and
treatments not covered by the plan.

But HMOs have found any "gag clause" hard to  enforce. The only
means of identifying violations:  (1) anomalies in members'
disenrollment patterns;  (2) patient complaints; and (3) comments
on member disenrollment forms.
Industry observers say most HMOs using "gag clauses" will define
allowable physician-patient communications, or get rid of the
clauses altogether.

Clinic Tracks Utilization Through Electronic Record


To track patient utilization and improve allocation of resources,
a multisite Iowa provider group decided to use a computerized
medical record system.
The Iowa Physicians Clinic Medical Foundation will install
computerized medical record systems in about 15 sites around the
state, according to Dr. Mark Purtle, director of internal medicine.
The group has patient record systems up and running, although only
in partial installation, in about half of its sites.
Patient demographics data is collected at registration on a
workstation linked to the central database. The system
automatically updates the patient record. Billing information is
fowarded in daily batches to the database.
Instead of entering encounter notes directly into the record,
physicians record notes, which are then transcribed and entered
into the record.
All clinic sites can access records stored in the central database.
However, each site maintains a server with its own records.
Workstations are located at all physician offices, nurse stations
and registration desks. When the system is fully installed, there
will be workstations in every exam room.
Because the electronic medical record has not yet eliminated the
need for a paper record, the group may use a scanner to create
electronic images of the paper records.
The group hopes to build a complete database of codes and
demographics that tracks encounters by provider and clinic site.
Being able to track seasonal variations in utilization would enable
the group to better plan the number of physicians it needs during
certain periods of the year or the type of physician it would need
in a certain  community.
The group hopes to have the system fully implemented at all its
sites by the end of the year.

Compliance Plans Crucial As Whistleblower Cases Grow


Given several false-claims cases sparked by whistleblowers pending
against major companies, physician managers should take voluntary
disclosure and compliance plans very seriously, a top government
attorney says.
"Health care enterprises, especially bigger ones, need aggressive
compliance policies in place to self-correct [billing problems] and
voluntarily disclose these problems"while they're still small,"
says HHS Inspector General Chief Counsel D. McCarty Thornton.
Thornton says if your company's compliance plan turns up serious
liability, you can take advantage of the feds' voluntary disclosure
program regardless of where you're in business - even though the
program is technically operational only in the five states where
the government is piloting its anti-fraud initiative.

For compliance plans to be meaningful, Thornton says they should:
o       Be "quite elaborate," not a slim
code of conduct that's just "window dressing."
o       Include a hotline so people can
report suspected fraud and other wrongdoing.
o       Track complaints that come over the
hotline, which means assigning them to someone to handle, recording
them and following up.
o       Protect tipsters so they don't fail
to report misconduct because they fear losing their jobs.
o       Assign at least one full-time person
to handle  implementation of the plan.
o       Continually educate all employees on
the ethics of dealing with federal health plans.
o       Require periodic, independent audits
of billing and other practices.
       Have "commitment and attention from
senior level managers," Thornton says.

Firm Tweaks Report Card To Pinpoint CQI Initiatives


An Indianapolis-based home care company this spring will release a
second-generation report card on the satisfaction rates of severely
chronically ill patients.
"Even though we were the first [home care] company to come out with
a [patient satisfaction] report card, there were certain
improvements we could make in methodology and our treatment of data
for the continuous quality improvement process," says Sandra Kretz,
vice president of standards and outcomes for Quantum Health
Resources Inc.
Quantum in 1993 piloted a clinician-developed  patient
satisfaction survey instrument, used in the for-profit company's 40
branches nationwide the following year. Using results from the
spring 1994 national survey of 1,000-plus patients, Quantum
published its first report card in January 1995, outlining patient
satisfaction rates (95.3% overall), and a composite patient
retention rate of 96.1% from 1989 to mid-1994.
Quantum's 1994 survey could not discern old patients from new. But
its 1995 survey targets last year's more than 900 new patients.
Kretz says this ensured a good picture of new patients, with whom
one expects more glitches in satisfaction to occur.
In its effort to reinforce better service patterns companywide,
Quantum feeds survey information back to clinicians, customer
service representatives and its sales force.
Kretz says the 1994 survey identified issues for  improvement,
such as access to an after-hours company contact. 
Although Quantum puts its 24-hour, toll-free number on all patient
material, the company faces a continuing dilemma in alerting
patients on how to contact the company after hours. 
Various interventions include using customer service
representatives to follow up with patients and putting the
telephone number on notepads in patients' medication packets.
Contact Kretz at (317) 580-6830.

Hospital Cuts CABG Costs By $7 Million, LOS by 23%


Saint Joseph's Hospital of Atlanta's involvement in a HCFA national
demonstration project on coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
surgery highlights its multidisciplinary quality improvement
approach.
The project combines efforts of nurses, surgeons, respiratory
therapists, pharmacists, rehabilitation therapists and others to
cut costs and improve outcomes for post-surgical patients.
Saint Joseph's has performed more than 1,300 CABG surgeries,
decreasing length of stay by 23% without compromising quality, and
saving HCFA more than $7 million since the project's implementation
in July 1993.
CABG patients rank satisfaction at 2.94 on a three-point scale,
above the national average; their mortality rate is 4%, below the
national average; they leave the ICU within 24 hours of surgery
rather than three to four days; and they are discharged in five to
seven days, not seven to 10 days.

HCFA Merging Quality Rules For Medicare, Medicaid Plans


HCFA is working on devising one set of quality standards for both
Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans.
The agency also is considering giving credit to plans that
recently were accredited by private bodies such as National
Committee for Quality Assurance,  according to Jeffrey Kang,
chief medical officer at HCFA's office of managed care.
For example, HCFA would look to see where its standards and NCQA's
overlap, Kang told a recent conference of the Academy of Managed
Care Pharmacy. For these areas, the agency would recognize NCQA's
seal of approval.
But HCFA is concerned that applying a broad set of NCQA measures
"could lose its meaning for Medicare," Kang said. The agency might
identify a subset of measures suitable for Medicare managed care
plans.
NCQA likely won't have Medicare performance measures until HEDIS
3.0 launches in early 1997, says Bruce Fried, director of HCFA's
office of managed care.
As part of that effort, HCFA wants the new quality standards to
replace the 50-50 commercial enrollment composition rule. The
Medicare law and regulations require Medicare HMOs to enroll at
least 50% commercial members. Fried says he hopes to have the new
quality standards in place by July 1997.

Multiprovider Networks Eyed As 1996 Antitrust Target


As health care dealmakers continue to travel uncharted territory,
government regulators and enforcers are watching closely to
determine whether cutting-edge health delivery systems,
collaborations and compensation arrangements comply with the law.
Experts tell physician managers that 1996 will be a year in which
antitrust enforcers will focus on multiprovider networks,
payer-provider collaboration, and most-favored nation clauses. 
Multiprovider networks will be a big focus of Justice's antitrust
enforcement this year, says Gail Kursh, chief of the health care
task force. "We have a number of investigations of multiprovider
arrangements underway," Kursh says.
Last year, in two separate cases, Justice settled antitrust charges
with two PHOs formed with most of the doctors in one-hospital
towns. Those settlements provided the industry with a blueprint for
doing such deals without antitrust violations.
This year, Justice will look at PHOs in multihospital markets and
may strike deals that provide guidance, Kursh says. The kind of
conduct scrutinized includes: (1) hospitals buying too many
physician practices;  (2) hospitals with market power locking up
all referrals in town; and (3) hospitals keeping out competitors by
inducing MDs not to hook up with a new hospital.
Kursh emphasizes, though, that Justice doesn't want to "chill"
deals that spur competition. "Our goal is not to deter
efficiency-enhancing arrangements where they're appropriate," she
says.

Merger-Like Deals to Get More Scrutiny

Observers also predict the FTC and Justice Department will back
away from hospital merger challenges and focus more on integrated
delivery systems, HMOs and physician practice acquisitions.
While traditional hospital mergers may be less of a focus, other
incarnations of hospital collaborations will get more scrutiny.
Justice's Kursh notes that "we're attuned to partnerships or
alliances between hospitals that aren't necessarily mergers."
Her staff is exploring the competitive implications of deals that
look like mergers but aren't, she says. "The question is how do we
analyze them? Are they illegal? Are they joint ventures? Or are
they enough like mergers they should be treated like a merger?
We'll be looking very closely at this area."

First Choice PPO, Group Health HMO to Bid Jointly on CHAMPUS Pact


In an action that could set an industry precedent, PPO First
Choice Health Network and HMO Group Health Cooperative of Puget
Sound are teaming up to bid on the giant CHAMPUS contract for
Washington state and Oregon, THE PPO LETTER has learned.

"We think we complement each other far more than we compete,"
says First Choice President and CEO Clayton Field. And Field
suggests that such joint marketing efforts may become common in
the future as "part of the maturity of the industry."

It is possible, he says, that First Choice, Washington's largest
PPO with about 300,000 covered lives, and Group Health Coopera-
tive, the state's largest HMO with 470,000 enrollees, might
cooperate in bidding for other public and private pacts later.

To date, joint ventures involving PPOs and HMOs have been ex-
tremely rare. The only one involving large organizations recently
occurred in Minneapolis, where PPO Preferred One agreed in 1991
to lease its provider network to HMO GroupCare, a unit of Group
Health, to offer clients more flexible benefit options (THE PPO
LETTER, 9/2/91, p. 4).

It was a similar need - in the form of the new federal
mandate to offer a "triple option (i.e., HMO, PPO, and indemnity)
- in managed-care programs for the Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) that helped
bring together First Choice and Group Health Cooperative.

The Washington-Oregon CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI) contract,
for which bids are due in mid-January 1993, covers a whopping
250,000 military dependents and retirees. The current pact does
not contain managed-care features and expires in early 1994.

Given the "mega-big" nature of the contract and the fact that
"one vendor would be responsible for the risk and care," Group
Health Cooperative decided "no one plan can absorb that," ex-
plains Peter Brumleve, vice president of marketing for the HMO.

While many of the requirements of the contract were "right up our
alley," include utilization management, quality assurance, cost
containment, and a large number of network providers, Brumleve
says, one wasn't. "We're not a PPO," he notes, and since the
contract specifications mandate a PPO option, the HMO decided "we
need a PPO."

He says Group Health Cooperative looked at the PPOs available and
soon focused on First Choice. Like First Choice, the 45-year-old
staff-model HMO is not for profit. Moreover, the two Seattle-
based organizations and their CEOs, Field and Phil Nudelman, had
longstanding relationships "that facilitated negotiations," says
Brumleve.

The HMO went on to fill another contract requirement, claims
processing, by recruiting as a bid partner Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of South Carolina. That organization, the CHAMPUS fiscal
intermediary for the mid-Atlantic region, is well regarded for
CHAMPUS claims administration (THE PPO LETTER, 8/10/92, p. 2).

Brumleve says the group also will have other partners, but he
won't identify them yet since arrangements haven't been final-
ized. He acknowledges that the partners expect to face consider-
able competition for the one-year pact (with four one-year
renewal options) slated to start February 1994, based on atten-
dance at the bidders' meeting held this year.

But regardless of whether the group wins the contract, the
cooperative effort has major implications for the future. Terming
the relationship "synergistic" and "good and getting better,"
Brumleve says it is "definitely possible" that Group Health
Cooperative and First Choice could team up for other pacts,
although it's "too early to tell."

The chances of such arrangements are growing especially since CRI
contracts are like other large ones increasingly being discussed
at both public and private levels that involve risk and account-
ability for cost and quality, he says. He cites as examples the
purchasing cooperatives in Minnesota that are awarding single
contracts covering several customers.

Teamwork between PPOs and HMOs hasn't occurred much before, he
asserts, because there haven't been opportunities - or needs
- to do this previously. The joint bid on the CHAMPUS pact
"will be a learning experience for our organization and for the
industry," adds Brumleve.

"This is the right way to go," agrees Field. It's clear now, he
says, that HMOs are trying to loosen up (e.g., allowing more
flexibility) at the same time that PPOs are trying to tighten up
in areas such as medical management. Thus, there's a need for
change, but "we're in an era where it seems foolish to invent a
new HMO or PPO," he maintains.

"If you have them out there, why not go together?" he asks. He
argues that the public is better served in this way, and PPOs and
HMOs have increased "buying power" if they collaborate to assure
doctors significantly more patients. It also eases administrative
problems, Field says, since, for instance, a Taft-Hartley entity
has to deal with only one managed care firm.

Such cooperation hasn't occurred often before since "there's been
a perception that PPOs and HMOs compete," Field notes. This is
partly true, he says, since they each may solicit the same
company for contracts. But there invariably are some employees
who want only an HMO or only a PPO, so "it's an advantage" to be
able to offer both.

The trend, says Field, is toward the kind of "managed competi-
tion" model now popular in both the Democratic and Republican
party camps. He adds it's "ironic" that the government, in the
form of the huge CRI pact, was responsible for leading organiza-
tions such as First Choice and Group Health Cooperative to this
new kind of teamwork.

22 Companies Offer New Medicare SELECT Plans, HCFA Survey Shows

An informal and limited survey conducted by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) indicates that a total of 22
companies are offering plans under the new Medicare SELECT
program in 10 of the 15 designated states.

The survey, sent out in late August and just tabulated, also
shows that seven additional companies have SELECT proposals
awaiting approval in the same plus one other state, which HCFA
declines to identify.

But two of the designated states, Oregon and Michigan, have
withdrawn from the program, and replacement states probably won't
be named until early next year, according to HCFA.

Medicare SELECT, which began operation July 1, enables Medicare
supplemental insurance (Medigap) carriers to offer retirees a
fee-for-service preferred provider network. A principal attrac-
tion is that employers can buy Medicare SELECT plans at prices
15% to 25% lower than they paid for previous conventional Medigap
policies.

But there are some restrictions. The policies offered must be
selected from the 10 specific ones described by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and must include
the basic plan A. And no other new Medigap policies may be
offered in the participating states.

The HCFA survey did not attempt to find out which of the nine
other plans were being offered or how many beneficiaries are
being covered. It did show SELECT policies are available in
Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missou-
ri, North Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

That indicates no SELECT policies were being offered as of the
time of the survey in two of the biggest states, California and
Ohio, as well as in Washington state. Oft-proposed legislation to
extend the SELECT program to all 50 states died in a House-Senate
conference committee this year. It is expected to be reintroduced
in 1993.

Despite the relatively limited initial use of the pilot program,
which runs through 1994, HCFA expects other companies to begin
offering SELECT policies in the designated states soon.

One major trigger for that may be the long-delayed approval of
"safe harbor" provisions for the SELECT plans. They would allow
SELECT PPOs to get discounts from providers and waive copayments
for only the Medicare beneficiaries who use these providers
without running afoul of Medicare's anti-kickback rules. That
might help overcome the current lack of interest among many PPOs
in the over-65 market.

A Department of Health and Human Services source says those safe-
harbor provisions - along with others eagerly awaited by PPOs
for non-SELECT plans to protect their payment arrangements -
probably won't be out until late November at the earliest.

The reason for the delays, the source says, aside from the
relatively recent addition of the SELECT provisions, is that the
rules need the blessing of the Office of Management and Budget.

There also have been managed-care industry concerns, communicated
to federal policy makers, that the planned safe-harbor rules were
too narrow and leave too much regulatory authority to the states,
which often do not have mechanisms for overseeing PPOs.

Safe-harbor worries notwthstanding, one Medicare SELECT market
participant sees a bright future for the plans.

SELECT will become "more and more significant" in the future
since the over-65 population is growing and becoming more accus-
tomed to preferred provider arrangements, says Debbie Ahl, execu-
tive vice president of Olympic Health Management Systems, Inc.
(Bellingham, Wash.).

Olympic is a health-care consulting firm and third-party admin-
istrator specializing since 1986 in Medigap and now SELECT plans.
The company is marketing SELECT policies underwritten by Sierra
Health & Life in Texas, where it knows of only one other company
(Humana) competing for that business, according to Greg Brethour,
vice president of sales.

Ahl, however, says she's not surprised by that since SELECT is a
"brand new concept." She declines to say in what other SELECT
states Olympic is active.

But she does say there is a consensus in the industry that NAIC-
designated plans C and F will be the dominant SELECT policies.
Plan C pays the 20% Medicare Parts A and B coinsurance based on
the Medicare-allowable fees, while Plan F covers 100% of physi-
cian charges.

SouthCare Adds 11 Hospitals to Establish Statewide PPO Network

SouthCare Medical Alliance, which has been a provider-owned PPO
in the Atlanta area since its establishment in 1985, will have a
statewide hospital network by the end of the year. The PPO has
signed up nine not-for-profit hospitals outside metropolitan
Atlanta (11 overall) as affiliates during the past three months,
says President and CEO Larry L. Madlem.

Moreover, Madlem says, SouthCare expects to start contracting
with physicians affiliated with these hospitals in 1993. By
completion in 1994, the PPO will boost by about 1,200 its current
1,300-physician network, he adds.

SouthCare, which now has 16 hospitals in its network, thereby
apparently will become the first statewide provider-owned PPO in
Georgia. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia now has a state-
wide network, as does investor-owned Affordable Health Concepts,
a unit of HealthCare COMPARE.

The expansion push for SouthCare outside metropolitan Atlanta
began in the Savannah area and includes hospitals generally in
the 400- to 500-bed size range, according to Madlem.

The additions are Douglas General Hospital (Douglasville),
Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory University (Atlanta), Floyd
Medical Center (Rome), Northeast Georgia Medical Center (Gaines-
ville), Paulding Memorial Medical Center (Dallas), Peach County
Hospital (Fort Valley), Rockdale Hospital (Conyers), Saint
Joseph's Hospital (Savannah), Scottish Rite Children's Medical
Center (Atlanta), The Medical Center of Central Georgia (Macon),
and University Hospital (Augusta).

Madlem says several factors resulted in the decision to go
statewide. Among them were the requests of some of SouthCare's
major customers, including The Principal Financial Group and
Mutual of Omaha, he says. Others that have contracted for state-
wide access include employers Waffle House and Home Depot.

The "changing dynamics" in the legislative and political arenas
also spurred the statewide expansion, Madlem adds. He explains
that SouthCare wants to be able to bid on Medicare and Medicaid
as well as large private provider-network contracts that will
become more prevalent.

There is an industry trend, he says, toward consolidation,
bringing more and more coverage under a single contract largely
to save on expense from a time and personnel standpoint.

"We didn't feel we had much time left to be viable in the market
as just a metropolitan area PPO" as SouthCare was before, asserts
Madlem. To remain competitive, he says, the PPO needed to become
broader in the services it offers (including adding mental
health, workers' compensation, and utilization review), and "we
needed to be at least statewide."

SouthCare now claims to be Georgia's largest managed care organi-
zation with 366,390 covered lives as of last month and more than
1,300 doctors in its directory. A handful of physicians, as well
as 11 hospitals, were its original owners.

New York Life Chooses PHC to Provide Mental Health Networks

New York Life Insurance Co., fulfilling a pledge early this year
that it would hire a nationwide mental-health services vendor
rather than handle this specialty in house, said October 20 that
Preferred Health Care Ltd. (PHC) will be its provider.

The agreement, which New York Life predicts will cover 525,000
lives by 1995, offers major pluses for both firms.

New York Life, which has been rolling out a whole range of new
provider-network products (THE PPO LETTER, 1/13/92, p. 1), gains
the aid of a proven developer and manager of mental-health
networks. It does that at less cost than if it had developed a
program from scratch or acquired a behavioral-health specialist
such as insurers CIGNA, The Travelers, and Aetna have done.

PHC (Wilton, Conn.), which has built its reputation and much of
its business providing services directly to self-funded Fortune
500 employers, gains enhanced access to the insured, smaller-
employer market through an alliance with a huge carrier.

Under the contract, PHC will support mental-health components of
a wide range of New York Life's managed care products, including
PPOs and managed indemnity.

The agreement calls for it to furnish provider networks, case
evaluation, patient referral, utilization review, claims review,
and management reporting and analysis. Those services will not be
provided in "southern New York State," where New York Life says
its Sanus HMO subsidiary will continue to furnish managed mental
health care to clients.

"Our unique affiliation with New York Life will provide nation-
wide access to managed mental health services for small and mid-
size businesses," says David McDonnell, chairman and CEO of PHC.
He calls that an "expanding segment" in the managed mental health
market.

PHC, founded in 1983, now covers seven million people in managed
behavioral health and workers' compensation services. It has been
been boosting stakes aggressively in both businesses this year,
most recently in the latter by agreeing to buy the stock of
Adjustco Inc., a third-party administrator primarily in workers'
comp.

In its most recent financial report, for the quarter that ended
June 30, PHC posted net income from continuing operations of 10
cents a share, up from 4 cents a share in the comparable year-ago
period. Revenues climbed to $13.3 million from $9.3 million.

New York Life has introduced an exclusive provider organization
(EPO) this year and continued its rollout of second-generation
PPO products designed for employee groups of up to 3,000 covered
lives.

In unveiling its mental-health strategy early this year, Vice
President for Managed Care Dr. Dan Fishbein pointed to the
efficiency of using an established vendor rather than "reinvent
the wheel." Fishbein added then, "It's not a carve-out. We're
assuming risk."

Admar Acquires Two TPAs As Part of EPO "Evolution" Move

The Admar Group, which started out as a third-party administrator (TPA) in
California before becoming a PPO operator, has come full circle. The Santa
Ana, Calif.-based managed care firm acquired two TPAs in Colorado to support
its planned operation of an exclusive provider organization (EPO) there.

"We're evolving into an EPO organization," says Richard Toral, CEO of Admar.
Because of the need for its own administration to support the more intensive
data requirements of an EPO than of a PPO, he explains, the company agreed to
purchase Boulder, Colo.-based TPAs Benefit Plan Administrators and Hofgard &
Co. for a total of $1.6 million in cash and notes.

He says the additional administrative capability will aid the marketing of
the EPO, which Admar plans to start in Colorado in the first quarter of 1993.
Admar already has PPOs in the state, but Toral says the company has no plans
to start an HMO there.

An HMO isn't necessary in Colorado, according to Toral, since Admar can
"equal the performance of an HMO with an indemnity-based product."

Admar, which also plans an EPO in southern California and is in the midst of
rapid PPO expansion in several states (THE PPO LETTER, 9/21/92, p. 1),
expects the major portion of its growth to come internally, Toral says. He
adds, however, that further acquisitions are a "possibility."

The firm recently agreed to furnish an 18-state preferred provider network
for National Insurance Services (Tampa), thereby adding 100,000 covered lives
and anticipated first-year revenues of $1 million from the PPO and
utilization management provisions of the contract.

The growth, however, is coming at a price. The company posted a net loss of
$296,000 or 4 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July
31, compared with net income of $57,000 (less than one cent a share) in the
year-ago period as revenues climbed 12% to $2.8 million from $2.5 million.
Part of the reason for the decline in the bottom line, Admar says, is an
increase in marketing expenditures.

CHAMPUS Northern Region Rebidding Offers New Market for PPOs

Adhering to mandates contained in the new law that resolved a
stalemate (THE PPO LETTER, 6/29/92, p. 1), the Department of
Defense is seeking bids that include a PPO option for the first
time for the 19-state Northern Region CHAMPUS contract.

The huge contract contains the requirement, included in the
Request for Proposals (RFP), that "all network providers shall
discount rates at least 5% below the CHAMPUS allowable amount."
The PPO also must include retail pharmacies as well as hospitals
and physicians.

Proposals on the one-year pact (with four one-year renewal
options), which is a "rebid" of a contract that did not previous-
ly have a managed-care network component, are due November 18. A
bidders' meeting was held in Denver September 23.

The Northern Region solicitation is the third of four major
contracts up for grabs with the Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) that involve the
CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI) style of managed care.

The others are the controversial rebid California-Hawaii pact
(THE PPO LETTER, 8/10/92, p. 1), a Washington-Oregon contract now
out for proposals (see article, page 1), and a Florida pact for
which the RFP still is in development, according to Commander Tom
Corrato, director of cooordinated care operations for CHAMPUS.

There also are smaller projects, to be set up by next May, linked
with military-base closure sites in Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth,
Tex. and Alexandria, La.

The Northern Region contract, though, dwarfs all the others in
terms of sheer size of area covered. It covers the states of
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky (except
the Ft. Campbell "catchment area"), Maine, Massachusetts, Michi-
gan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wiscon-
sin.

Its managed care "task" includes an enrolled HMO-like plan, using
a "gatekeeper"-like Primary Care Manager, as well as the PPO.
There are stringent network access mandates for bidders as well
as a requirement that "PPO networks shall continuously operate in
all areas" where "sufficient beneficiary population exists."

The PPO developer would have to show why it is not cost-effective
to implement a network within any of the areas. It also would
have to document efforts to contract with providers there.

The RFP states that no payment may be required for a noncovered
service from a network provider unless the beneficiary has agreed
in advance to pay for such service.

The PPO benefit plan design calls for a beneficiary copayment for
most outpatient services of 15% of the fee negotiated by the
contractor for active-duty (AD) families and 20% for retirees and
their families. For ambulatory surgery, there is no copayment
for AD and 20% for retirees.

On hospitalization, there is no copayment for AD families. For
retirees and dependents, the copayment requirement is $125 per
day or 25% of total charges (based on fee schedules negotiated by
the contractor), whichever is less, for "institutional services"
plus 20% of "separately billed professional charges."

For mental illness and alcoholism treatment, the RFP for the PPO
plan calls for no copayment for AD families. For retiree fami-
lies, the "cost share" is $50 per day or 25% of total charges
(based on negotiated fee schedules), whichever is less, for
institutional services plus 20% of separately billed professional
charges.

While Corrato says "there is a push for us" to develop mail-order
pharmacy plans for CHAMPUS health-care programs, there is no
mail-order requirement in the Northern Region RFP. A pilot of
such a plan is salted to be tried in Hawaii.

Spiegel Looks to Add Physician, POS Networks to Successful PPO

Spiegel Inc., which began using a hospital-only PPO network in
1989, is "leaning toward" adding the physician portion of that
network next year, says Michael Tulaga, benefits and compensation
director. And Tulaga says the company might develop a point-of-
service (POS) plan in 1994.

The Downers Grove, Ill.-based specialty retailer, which spent
$16.3 million on employee health care (excluding a couple of
subsidiaries) in 1991, says it saved more than $1.1 million
through using the 52-hospital network of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Illinois. That compares with savings of about $300,000
in 1989 and $600,000 in 1990.

The high savings in 1991, according to Tulaga, result not only
directly from the approximately 20% discounts the network pro-
vides but also from the fact that 80% of eligible employees now
use the network for hospitalization.

He attributes the high usage partly to the concentration of the
company's employees (4,000 out of 5,000) in the well-networked
Chicago area. "Employees don't have to go far to [preferred]
providers," Tulaga says.

Another factor, though, is plan design, he asserts. Spiegel
reworked its overall employee benefits when the PPO option was
introduced to give employees a flexible structure in which they
could choose from three different levels of health-insurance
coverage.

A thorough employee communications effort also has helped. Small
staff meetings explaining the benefit changes with the aid of
slides or videos were accompanied by education about the causes
and effects of rising health costs.

Together with written materials, Spiegel says, the effort helped
reverse a prior (before the PPO) lukewarm feeling surveyed
employees displayed toward the company's health benefits.

Having made its first limited move into managed care from the
previous indemnity plan, which still covers about 1,000 employees
outside the Chicago area, Tulaga says, the self-insured company
now wants to go further.

He says the physician network "could be our next step." But
Spiegel also is looking into developing a POS plan with HMO and
indemnity components in 1994 "to help manage overall costs," he
adds. The company now has HMOs only for hourly employees and just
since this year.

PHCS Uses Quality-Based Ranking System to Evaluate PPO Providers

Preferred Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) is using a quality-based evaluation
system to rank its 63,500 PPO providers and to make retention and patient
"redirection" decisions, according to Dr. N. Stephen Ober, vice president and
corporate medical director.

Preliminary results of the system, Ober told a session of the American
Managed Care and Review Association annual conference in San Diego October
20, show 90% of the physicians examined ranked in the top two categories.
This is a similar result, and indeed the system is similar to that used by
unrelated mental-health PPO Preferred Health Care Ltd. in provider profiling
(THE PPO LETTER, 9/21/92, p. 7).

But the PHCS system generated several questions from attendees about use of
the findings. The Lexington, Mass.-based PPO, Ober responded to a couple of
them, shares some of the information with its employer clients but does not
make results available to patients, partly because of liability
considerations.

And it doesn't report "incidents" of inappropriate care to the government, he
noted, partly because PPOs aren't allowed to access the National Practitioner
Data Bank.

The preliminary findings, he said, showed that 16.7% of its network
physicians accounted for all the incidents found, and only 2.7% of the
doctors examined had five or more incidents. About 30% of the physicians
ranked in the top category and are being rewarded by gaining referrals of
patients who call the PHCS "hotline" for assistance.

Ober said the system depends on using a large amount of data on physicians'
practice patterns over time to obtain "meaningful" and comprehensive clinical
information on the providers. The idea is to assess the quality of the
physician, not just that of the care provided, he added.

The raw data used in the system include medical and pharmaceutical claims,
utilization review results, patient surveys, and "administrative reports"
(often "ad hoc" documents filed by PHCS' field staff). Using a computerized
method and physician reviewers, the data are looked at for indicators of
performance.

The "indicators" are in several areas. Patient satisfaction information comes
from surveys and administrative reports. The reports also provide raw
material for an indicator of administrative efficiency, which takes into
account such findings as "upcoding" and claims unbundling. Indicators of
outcomes of care come from both administrative reports and from data on post-
procedure complications.

Moreover, the "process of care" is examined, according to Ober, for such
deficiencies as inappropriate use of assistant surgeons, "procedure/diagnosis
mismatch," outmoded procedures, and "therapeutic overlap" in the drugs
prescribed.


In the second phase of the process, PHCS does a "targeted review" using
"relative weighting of incidents" to examine "targeted outlier providers" to
get a "provider quality score," Ober said. He explained that quality ratings
of 3 to 5 in this phase involve "deviations in practice patterns" with a 5
indicating "major deviations."

The final phase involves "provider intervention." After using its medical-
director and quality-assurance subcommittees to arrive at a consensus on what
to do, PHCS discusses its findings with the targeted providers and gets
"feedback" from them.

Those who receive a score of 3 get an inquiry letter, are asked for
additional "general information" and "educated" about PHCS quality management
processes. A 4 score gets the provider a warning letter, a request for
additional specific information, and an "evaluation." A score of 5, said
Ober, results in termination from the network, although there is an appeal
procedure.

In the preliminary results, only 1% of the physicians received a 5 score,
while 4% had a 4, 5% a 3, 60% a 2, and 30% a 1.

Ober said the system should be usable for any contracted network, especially
since it utilizes commonly available data and doesn't require a huge data
base. The "multiple interventions," which focus on non-punitive actions, he
said, broaden the impact of the system.

In response to questions, he said the system can detect underutilization as
well as overutilization and can even pinpoint when physicians are not
administering needed periodic immunizations. But he acknowledged that PHCS
doesn't yet have the means to use this system for examination of physicians'
referral patterns.

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

The Sept. 21, 1992 issue of THE PPO LETTER somewhat misrepresent-
ed my comments regarding [American] Biodyne's provider network
made at the recent Behavioral Health Tomorrow conference in
Chicago.

It is not Biodyne's goal to narrow its current network. Rather,
we are committed to developing and maintaining the highest
quality networks. This necessitates a process of selection which
tends to result in a more refined network which is traditional
for managed care companies. We want to ensure that our patients
are treated by the most qualified providers available and that
these providers receive valuable support from Biodyne.

We are not looking to reward efficiency. We are looking to reward
clinical effectiveness and high quality service. Our unending
commitment to this goal will guarantee that our provider networks
are strong and that our patients receive the most clinically
appropriate care possible.

Jeffrey I. Bragman, Ph.D.
Vice President, Quality Management and Clinical Services

Specialized Needs of Retirees Said to Create PPO Opportunities

While managed health care for retirees remains largely an HMO
rather than PPO emphasis, there is potential for substantially
more provider network activity, particularly in specialty areas.
And those opportunities, which some employers already are taking
advantage of, could rise if proposed legislation is enacted.

That, at least, appeared to be the consensus of speakers at a
conference on managing health care for retirees, sponsored by the
Washington Business Group on Health, in Washington, D.C. last
month.

The biggest component of retiree managed care now is Medicare
risk contracting. About 100 HMOs (no PPOs) participate in that
program, which involves Medicare paying the HMOs 95% of its
average per-capita cost in return for providing at least Medi-
care's standard level of benefits.

But there are relatively untapped options for PPOs, even aside
from the new Medicare SELECT program (see article, page 1). These
areas especially involve "younger retirees," not Medicare eligi-
ble, who usually can be "leveraged" into existing networks, said
Dr. Saul Spivack, a consultant with Tillinghast in New York.

Some of the opportunities, Spivack said, lie in specialized areas
that reflect the different health conditions and performance
expectations of retirees as well as their geographical disper-
sion. He saw a need for "subnetworks" in such specialties as
cardiac, musculoskeletal/orthopedic, cancer, organic brain
disorders, neurology, and multidisciplinary diagnostics.

For these networks to be successful, he contended, utilization
management must be a high priority. It should include prospective
identification of high risk/high cost retirees, retroactive
evaluation of emergency admissions, and on-site concurrent
reviews.

For younger retirees, regular PPOs are a feasible option for
employers, according to Spivack. His findings are supported by an
Intracorp survey, conducted this summer, which showed 51% of
responding employers used PPOs for pre-Medicare eligible retir-
ees, compared with only 24% for Medicare eligible retirees.

For the older retirees, Spivack suggested point-of-service (POS)
plans of a "soft" nature that pull enrollees through "perceived
value" rather than through cutting benefits.

Medicare has proposed legislation for retiree POS programs along
these lines, pointed out Edmund C. Moy, director of the office of
coordinated care policy and planning at the U.S. Health Care
Financing Administration.


The plan, not acted on by Congress this year, would involve the
government renting an employer's existing POS network for its
retirees to get continuity and "not reinvent the wheel," Moy
said. A lure for retirees, he explained, would be that network
beneficiaries get higher benefits than they would under Medicare.

While that proposal seems unlikely to get action soon, some
corporations have taken their own actions involving PPOs for
retirees. One is Chrysler Corporation. Its financial staff
specialist for health care planning, Christopher Mykrantz, told
the conference that the automaker has successfully employed
several directly contracted specialty PPOs for retirees.

All of these PPOs use capitated rate payments. A podiatry PPO,
started in Michigan in 1986 and extended regionally in 1991,
saved 40% the first year and now is limiting the annual cost
increase trend to 1.8%.

A laboratory PPO, also begun in Michigan in 1986, expanded in
1992 to other states, Mykrantz said. It saved 30% the first year,
and the cost-hike trend since then has been 1.9%. There also are
new prescription-drug and durable-medical-equipment PPOs that are
off to good starts, according to Mykrantz.

PPOs Expected to Participate in New AMCRA Healthcare Database

Having completed its technical and financial feasibility analysis with
favorable results, the AMCRA Healthcare Database (AHD) now is beginning a
two-year development phase in which 250 additional managed care plans will
participate.

Those participants will include PPOs as well as HMOs, says Howard Fomby, a
principal in Prolifix, the Lenexa, Kan. firm putting together the huge data
base. He predicted that 400 plans will be participating when AHD begins
actual, self-sufficient operation in 1995.

Fomby updated the status and business plan for AHD at a session of the
American Managed Care and Review Association (AMCRA) annual conference in San
Diego Oct. 19. AMCRA commissioned the project in 1988 as a means of
quantifying the impact of managed care in such areas as cost, utilization,
and quality of care.

A more specific set of objectives involves aiding managed care plans in
evaluating utilization management, predicting revenue requirements, and
reporting data to clients and regulators. Some of these objectives overlap
those of the American Accreditation Program Inc., the PPO-industry plan that
has published similar summary information about its approximately 25
accredited PPOs.

AHD obtained funding and management aid for its pilot phase from Marion
Merrell Dow, Fomby's former employer, in 1991.

The just-completed pilot included data from six HMOs selected on the basis of
diversity of hardware, software, and type of plans. One of them, which Fomby
declined to identify, also submitted PPO data. He did say PPOs will be
invited to be full participants in AHD, which started out as an HMO-only
project.

Previous unsuccessful private and public efforts to create a comprehensive
data base have been plagued by fragmentation and insufficient participation
by individual plans. Their problems, said Robert Thompson, a Health Care
Horizons, Inc. vice president who chairs AMCRA's data committee, included
inconsistent data, no way to verify accuracy, and lack of flexibility in data
use.

Those problems resulted in high cost, the resulting lack of participation,
and a "limited payback" to participants, Thompson explained. He asserted that
the AMCRA project overcomes these problems by collecting raw claims and
enrollment data from individual plans and then manipulating them into a
common format for comparability, thereby minimizing the cost to participating
plans.

The kind of data to be included, according to Thompson, include average cost
per member and per month, and service- and procedure-specific utilization,
all analyzable demographically.

The data base won't analyze financial or administrative expenses and will
protect the confidentiality of individual patient information as well as the
identities of individual plans. There also is no attempt to adjust for plans
that do not furnish data to the data base.

AHD is meant for use not only by participating HMOs and PPOs, which would not
have to pay for it, but also by large employers, pharmaceutical companies,
actuaries, and government.

The concept, Thompson said, is to make it marketable to aid its self-
sufficiency after expected grant funding for its development runs out. He
added that AHD now has about half the funding needed for the developmental
phase, in which it plans to start establishing a paying customer base, and
expects to get the rest by the end of the year.

During the development phase, AHD will be able to offer both a standard
report and some custom reports, Fomby said. Starting in 1994, he said, the
data base also will allow dial-up access, with CD-ROM access planned for
"later." AHD will use encryption so that it can be accessed only with the
proper participant program.

JCAHO Issues Second Call For Indicators


The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has
launched the second phase of its attempt to create a comprehensive catalogue
of performance measures - the National Library of Healthcare Indicators
(NLHI).

On April 16, JCAHO announced a Request for Indicators (RFI) for ambulatory
care, behavioral health care, home care, or long term care indicators, to
serve as a resource to organizations interested in measuring performance.
JCAHO sent information to more than 1,200 health care organizations for
comments, which will be accepted until May 10.  JCAHO expects indicators for
these settings to be selected by the end of the year and available for use in
the spring of 1997.

"This RFI gives us a major opportunity to enrich the Library to include
measures that cover the full mainstream of the delivery system," says Dennis
O'Leary, MD, JCAHO president.  "This will substantially enhance our abilities
to support quality improvement in health care organizations while also setting
the stage for using performance measures in the accreditation process."

The call for these measures specifies that indicators be classified into one
of four broad categories:  administrative/financial (coordination and
integration of functions); clinical performance (care processes and outcomes
for specific conditions and procedures); health status (functional well-being
of populations); and satisfaction (how well patient, purchaser, and
practitioner needs are met).  After May 10, the Joint Commission will assemble
expert panels to select indicators based on importance and usefulness for each
of the four areas.

Last March, the Joint Commission began the first phase of its Library effort
when it solicited measures applicable to health plans and networks.  The 900
suggested indicators have been whittled to about 200, and these will be
available for use this summer (QMU, 3/20/96).  JCAHO also is planning to issue
a call for acute measures sometime next year.  Eventually, indicators will be
included as part of accreditation surveys, although JCAHO has not specified
when this will take effect.

For more information on the RFI and the Library project, call JCAHO's Sharon
Sprenger at 708/916-5968.

Medicare Pay System Boosts Satisfaction


Recently-published research indicates that patient satisfaction increased
after implementation of the 1992 Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) despite fears
that the new payment approach would compromise quality.

Between 1991 and 1993, Medicare beneficiaries' satisfaction with quality,
availability, accessibility, and costs of care significantly increased.  The
area with the greatest rise (costs) was a direct result of the relative
value-based fee schedule, write the authors of the research.  The information
appears in the Winter 1996 Health Care Financing Review, published on April 5
by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which runs the Medicare
program.

"With the implementation of the MFS, access, use, and satisfaction have not
deteriorated during the 3-year period included in this study," write the
authors.  "Indeed, we have shown that Medicare beneficiaries are reporting
increased satisfaction with many aspects of their health care .  .  .
suggesting that the program has become 'more equitable' over time."

Despite the improved satisfaction, the study is lacking, says Uwe Reinhardt,
professor of political economy at the Woodrow Wilson School in Princeton NJ.
"The real distinction to make is between the chronically ill and the healthy,"
he says, adding that 90 percent of the elderly are relatively healthy and not
heavy users of health services.  "I'd like to see a breakdown of satisfaction
scores by level of functioning."

The article bases its findings on HCFA surveys conducted from 1991-93 of 7,651
continuously-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries (6,337 elderly and 1,314 disabled
nonelderly).  Researchers exclude any results for beneficiaries who died from
1991-1994.  Enrollees in managed care programs and fee-for-service plans are
combined.

Of the four parameters measured, satisfaction with quality of care was
highest, while satisfaction with costs was lowest.  However, satisfaction with
costs between 1991 and 1993 rose most sharply, from 71.0 to 83.5 (scale 0 to
100).  For each of the four categories, scores for the disabled are lower than
those for the elderly (see chart).

Higher satisfaction was reported for persons with the fewest limitations on
activities of daily living, whites, the high-income population, persons in
areas with the highest number of physicians per capita, and persons with
insurance supplementary to Medicare.

One interesting finding was the reduction from 1991 to 1993 in mammography (40
percent to 32 percent) and Pap smears (49 percent to 32 percent).  Medicare
introduced new benefits for both of these preventive services in late 1990.
However, the decreases may reflect women screened in 1991 who would not be
rescreened until after 1993; Medicare officials recommend mammographies every
two years and Pap smears every three years.

In a second study in the same issue of the journal, HCFA official Margo
Rosenbach found that within the disabled Medicare population, those with
mental disabilities are less satisfied with their care than those with
nonmental disorders.  The disabled are most satisfied with their care after an
initial treatment or operation (score of 89) and least satisfied with
out-of-pocket costs of medical care (60).

Single copies of the issue of the Health Care Financing Review may be
purchased for $19 by calling HCFA at 410/786-6572.

NCQA Drafts Behavioral Health Norms


The first national accreditation standards designed for managed behavioral
healthcare organizations (MBHOs) moved one step closer to reality when the
National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) announced the completion of a
draft set of standards.

On April 10, NCQA held a news conference to discuss the proposed standards,
which are being circulated to more than 1,000 organizations for comments over
the next 45 days.  After pilot testing the standards in the fall, NCQA hopes
to begin review of MBHOs, separate from its standard review of HMOs, early
next year.  To date, no MBHO has received accreditation from NCQA using HMO
standards.

NCQA President Margaret E.  O'Kane acknowledges concerns about the lack of
information related to MBHO quality and says, "these standards fill that void
and provide assurance that NCQA will be scrutinizing the quality of behavioral
health plans every bit as closely as we do that of HMOs."  Others see the
standards as playing a broader role; Harvard Pilgrim Health Plan's John Ludden
believes that the new standards will promote "integration of managed
behavioral health care to other care, which can lead to a whole series of
improvement in quality and cost."

The draft standards are an outgrowth of the rapid expansion of MBHOs, whose
ranks number more than 300 and cover 100 million Americans.  Payers turned to
MBHOs in the past decade to control behavioral health expenses; however, these
cost-containment methods have caused widespread public concern that enrollees
are being denied necessary services, shortchanging quality to save money.  No
national set of accreditation standards exists to ensure that MBHOs' practices
are acceptable.

In 1995, NCQA convened a 22-member Behavioral Health Task Force to draft new
standards, recognizing that services covered by MBHOs were distinct from those
covered by HMOs.  The Task Force initially framed its work in terms of
standards developed by several large employers.  The draft emulated NCQA's HMO
standards to promote coordination between primary care and behavioral health.
In fact, the seven categories of behavioral health standards are quite similar
to the HMO version:

1.  Quality Management and Improvement.  The most comprehensive of the seven
categories, it covers the structure, process, and outcomes of the MBHO quality
management program.

2.  Accessibility, Availability, Referral, and Triage.  This section includes
specific standards for telephone access, geographic distance, and travel times
for appointments.

3.  Utilization Management.  NCQA requires MBHOs to have written protocols
"based on reasonable scientific evidence" for authorizing members to use
services.

4.  Credentialing and Recredentialing.  NCQA mandates MBHOs to exercise "due
diligence" in ensuring that its participating providers maintain proper
credentials.

5.  Members' Rights and Responsibilities.  Each accredited MBHO must have a
grievance procedure that will be scrutinized by NCQA for the opportunity to
appeal MBHO decisions on coverage.

6.  Preventive Behavioral Health Care Services.  MBHOs must have programs to
decrease incidence, prevalence, and residual effects of behavioral health
disorders among its enrollees.

7.  Clinical Evaluation and Treatment Records.  MBHO records must be current,
comprehensive, detailed, and organized.

"The standards are not perfect, but solid," says Leslie Scallet, executive
director of the Mental Health Policy Research Center in Washington and a
member of the task force.  She also believes the standards will promote
quality and appropriate practices due to the support of managed care
organizations, "which were stung by bad press and are committed to seeing the
standards work."

Managed care organizations with behavioral health programs will be given the
option of NCQA reviewing their behavioral health component under the
established HMO standards or the new behavioral health-specific standards.
Eventually, MBHO survey scores will be released to the public, says NCQA
spokesperson Barry Scholl.

For more information or for a copy of the draft standards, call NCQA at
202/955-3577 or use NCQA's site on the World Wide Web (www.ncqa.org).

Vaccine Rate Up Due to Fed Effort


Children receiving all recommended immunizations by age two rose from 55
percent to 75 percent in the last four years, according to figures released
April 10 by Dept.  of Health & Human Services (HHS) Secretary Donna E.
Shalala.

Shalala credits the improved vaccination record to a variety of federal
government initiatives.  "Just two months after he was sworn into office,
President Clinton personally committed his Administration to an historic,
comprehensive strategy to immunize our youngest and most vulnerable children,"
says Shalala in remarks delivered to the 30th National Immunization Conference
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).  "And
together, we are making good on that promise."

Ten infectious diseases - polio, measles, diphtheria, mumps, whooping cough,
German measles, tetanus, spinal meningitis, chicken pox, and hepatitis-B - can
be prevented through childhood vaccines.  Experts recommend that children
receive 12 to 16 doses of the various vaccines by age two, accounting for 80
percent of all recommended childhood immunizations.

Noncompliance with vaccination requirements stems from inadequate numbers of
accessible services, including public clinics; lack of parental awareness of
the need to immunize children by age two; and the increasing cost of vaccines.
HHS estimates that the full series of immunizations costs $313 per child, up
from $27 in 1983.

One of President Clinton's initial pledges was a government buyout of all
vaccines, to be distributed from a warehouse in New Jersey.  Congress failed
to pass Clinton's plan, but the federal government made other moves in the
past three years to improve vaccination rates.

For example, CDC funding for immunization programs has doubled to about $1
billion, and HHS has approved and funded a number of demonstration projects by
state governments to improve immunization rates.  Also a number of states now
require childhood immunizations as a condition for receiving benefits under
Aid for Families with Dependent Children and Women and Infant Children
programs.

Climbing immunization rates can also be linked to the emergence of HMOs, with
their traditional focus on preventive health services.  Last year, 21 large
HMOs released 1993 data showing that 79 percent of enrolled children had been
fully immunized by age two, a figure higher than the national rate (QMU,
3/1/95).  The goal set by the U.S.  Public Health Service for the year 2000 is
90 percent.

It continues to be debated whether or not cost is a major obstacle to children
receiving immunizations.  Despite the defeat of its plan to distribute all
vaccines, the Clinton Administration expanded the Vaccines for Children
program to all 50 states.  The program offers free vaccines to about 60
percent of U.S.  children, including the uninsured, Medicaid-eligible, and
American Indians/Alaska natives.

Despite the improved rates of immunization, considerable variation between
geographic areas remains.  For example, the compliance rate in Boston is 87
percent, but only 52 percent in Detroit.  v

Satisfaction Poll Marks HMO Guide


The first national survey of consumer satisfaction using measures specified by
the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) is a prominent new
addition to a guide on health plans, physicians, hospitals, and health
systems.

The survey, launched earlier this month, will include all patient satisfaction
questions from the NCQA Annual Member Health Care Survey, a poll of more than
170,000 U.S.  households (see chart p.4).  When the data are released in June,
users will be able to compare results for their geographic area - zip code,
county, state, etc.  - with national averages or benchmarks/best practices.
Data will be contained in the sixth edition of the Healthcare Market Guide, a
product of National Research Corp.  (NRC) of Lincoln NE, a company
specializing in health care performance assessment.

NRC touts its database as the first national measurement of all satisfaction
questions from the NCQA Annual Member Health Care Survey, finalized over a
year ago.  To date, use of these questions has been left to the discretion of
each managed care plan.  The survey is likely to be a component of NCQA's
report card prototype Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
3.0, due to be presented in draft form this summer.

The Guide encompasses 16 major categories, including quality attributes such
as best-reputed hospitals and doctors, most personalized care, best community
health programs, best image, and lowest costs.  To date, NRC has published the
guide every two years, but now will publish an annual volume.  National
information in the Guide is contained on a computer diskette, says Kris
Benson, NRC director of marketing.  She says that plans, hospitals, and
physician groups, in releasing their data, will often compare it to industry
averages and benchmarks found in the Guide; NRC requests that it review data
before public dissemination.

For more information about the Guide, call Benson at 800/388-4264.  Costs of
the product vary according to the data requested.

Drug Company Promotes QI Tools


Pfizer Inc.  has formed a subsidiary that will link up with providers to
introduce new quality management products.

The April 15 announcement of Pfizer Health Solutions Inc.  (PHS), based in New
York, represents a venture into an area in which pharmaceutical companies have
historically had little involvement.  "While Pfizer's innovative
pharmaceuticals have long been recognized for their contributions to treating
disease, I am confident that PHS will help strengthen our partnerships with
our customers .  .  .  and position Pfizer at the forefront of new solutions
for improving patient care, whatever the setting," says Karen Katen, president
of the Pfizer U.S.  Pharmaceuticals Group.

PHS has kicked off its agenda by selecting three pilot projects, each testing
a different product with a client provider.  The first pilot is the Clinical
Management System (CMS), a clinical guideline instrument customized to local
practices.  The CMS analyzes physician examination and laboratory test
results, lists possible treatment options, and produces reports for providers
on effects of care.

Value Health Sciences of Avon CT, which specializes in developing guidelines
and software, helped Pfizer create this tool.  The new system is being tested
in diagnosing and treating depression and benign prostatic hypertrophy at the
Lahey Hitchcock Clinic in Burlington MA.

The second product being tested by PHS is a wireless, handheld computer that
allows practitioners to access any part of the medical record instantaneously.
This product, developed with WiSE Medical Systems Inc.  of Los Gatos CA (a
company that creates mobile information systems for physicians), is expected
to enhance physician decisionmaking.  It is being demonstrated at several
sites, including Santa Cruz (CA) Medical Center.

The third tool tested by PHS is making clinical information available via
telephone around the clock.  The information is maintained through a series of
"medical call centers" made up of specially-trained nurses using algorithms to
answer patients' questions.  National Health Enhancement Systems, Inc.  of
Phoenix AZ developed the system; test sites have not yet been selected.

For more information on PHS and its related products, call Bob Fauteux at
Pfizer at 212/573-3079.

AIDS Evolution Means QM Changes


The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic presents a stiff and
growing challenge to quality managers trying to assess and improve processes
in AIDS care.  In the March 20 issue, QMU looked at examples of AIDS QM in
hospitals, home care organizations, and regulatory agencies.  HMOs, employers,
and researchers are also trying their hand at improving the state of the art.

NONPROVIDERS EVALUATE AIDS CARE

A variety of research projects evaluating the care given to HIV-positive
patients are now under way, including one by the Columbia University School of
Public Health in New York.  The School contracts with the city's health
department to evaluate AIDS programs funded under the federal Ryan White law,
says Peter Masseri, associate clinical professor at Columbia.  Masseri and
other staff are conducting interviews with 650 HIV-positive New Yorkers to
evaluate how well services are being rendered and what the outcomes of these
services are.  These verbal interviews take more than two hours each and are
conducted every six months.

Masseri says initial results of the study will not be ready until the summer.
However, he and other researchers will look at utilization of services (at all
levels) and evaluate changes in health status, compared to the patients'
needs.  The SF-36 tool, which measures patient self-reported health status,
will be used:  "We find the tool to be quite reliable," says Masseri.  In
addition, other measures of health status, such as CD-4 cell count, will be
included in the analysis.

HMOS LOOK TO COORDINATED CARE

Although hospitals are extending AIDS care beyond just the acute level, it is
managed care organizations (MCOs) that portray themselves as providers of
coordinated care across all levels.  Despite this stated purpose, there is
much controversy over how MCOs handle AIDS treatment as more and more AIDS
patients (especially Medicaid recipients) enroll in MCOs.

The Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) in New York City reports that a recent
survey finds 95 percent of HMOs unable to refer callers to primary care
physicians experienced in AIDS treatment.  GMHC Senior Policy Associate Susan
Dooha says this lack of expertise lowers the use of prophylactic therapy
needed by many patients infected with HIV.  Other aspects of medical care are
affected by practitioner inexperience.  A 1995 study published in the Journal
of the American Medical Assn.  found that of 134 general practitioners and
family physicians (not just HMO physicians), only 25.8 percent correctly
diagnosed Kaposi's sarcoma, and 22.7 percent diagnosed oral hairy leukoplakia,
conditions common in the AIDS population.

GMHC also says they believe there is a lack of specific standards for AIDS
care, particularly newer therapies, and HMOs do not monitor care to
HIV-positive patients.  Most plan-based report cards, including the Health
Plan Employer Data & Information Set (HEDIS), do not include indicators
specifically addressed to AIDS patients.

Possibly the hottest quality-related issue surrounding AIDS patients in HMOs
is financial incentives.  Because many HMOs pay providers on a capitated
basis, the incentive to not provide unnecessary services exists.  The practice
of HMOs denying what they consider "unneeded" treatments in order to hold down
costs has the AIDS community in an uproar.  With a lack of standards for
treatment, especially newer therapies, and with the cost of care escalating,
the furor is not likely to end any time soon.

One HMO that has addressed this issue by revamping its quality management
program is the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound of Seattle WA.  Founded
in 1947, this group-model HMO covers more than 500,000 lives in the Pacific
Northwest.  It functions as a cooperative governed by consumers.

Group Health recognizes the special needs of AIDS patients.  "TQM [total
quality management] for HIV-positive patients is not the same as that for
other diseases," says Wayne Dodge, MD, HIV/AIDS program director at Group
Health.  A more activist patient group plus a bevy of expensive treatments
available before effectiveness is proven creates "a challenge for all
providers," he says.

The HMO has a specific TQM structure for AIDS treatment, focused around three
groups committed to a team approach, says Dodge:

1.  The core committee, which meets twice a month, serves as the operating
committee for AIDS TQM activities.  It is multidisciplinary, consisting of
Dodge, the nursing HIV coordinator, a social worker, systems analyst,
administrator, and liaison with the local AIDS foundation.

2.  The steering committee is also a multidisciplinary panel providing general
direction and strategic planning to AIDS quality activities.  It meets
quarterly.

3.  The prevention subcommittee meets quarterly and specifically supports
preventive activities related to care of AIDS patients.

Puget Sound's focus on prevention has guided some of its decisions on AIDS
quality management.  The core committee reviewed the administration of Pap
smears and recommended this test be performed for all HIV-positive women
enrolled in the HMO, says Dodge.  In addition, prophylactic treatment is now
given to all HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts below 200 or less than
14 percent of white blood cells (the clinical definition of full-blown AIDS)
in order to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), which is common in
the AIDS population.

Another Group Health initiative, on physician expertise and AIDS, is contained
in an article published in the March 13 New England Journal of Medicine.  Mari
Kitahara, MD, the study's principal investigator, reported that men who were
the first-ever AIDS patient seen by a physician lived 14 months with
full-blown AIDS, compared with 26 months for men who consulted physicians that
had treated at least five cases of the disease previously.  Kitihara
calculated that patients treated by doctors more experienced in AIDS care had
a 43 percent lower risk of death after adjustment for CD-4 cell count.

Group Health has also developed a Clinical Roadmap, or a set of priorities for
HIV care.  "We have sent out flow sheets and pathways to caregivers," says
Dodge, adding that later in 1996 the HMO will evaluate how successful these
interventions are.

The problem of how to handle new treatments for AIDS is a difficult one, says
Dodge.  "We've got no real answer," he says, although several principles guide
the HMO.  No treatments considered experimental are covered by Group Health,
says Dodge, but other new treatments are placed on a "Code 29" list.  This
designation means that a drug is not automatically covered by the HMO, but if
the treating physician consults with a designated peer at Group Health, it may
be covered if deemed best for the patient.  Dodge says the new protease
inhibitors are on the Code 29 list.

Dodge says that his HMO has a huge advantage in analyzing processes and
improvements in AIDS care.  "We're a totally computerized system that includes
all levels of care," he says.  "I can't see how you can do good quality
management any other way."

Another managed care organization with an innovative approach to AIDS
treatment is the Community Medical Alliance (CMA) of Boston.  The Alliance is
an HMO founded in 1989 that manages only the care of AIDS patients and
chronically-ill populations with special needs.  Its current enrollment of
more than 300 includes 18 percent of Boston's Medicaid recipients that are
HIV-positive.  The state pays CMA a flat, capitated fee of $4,337.54 per
enrollee per month to manage the needs of Medicaid patients with AIDS.

CMA's QM structure for AIDS patients revolves around a committee that sets the
goals of the program, says Priscilla Meriot, QI director at the Alliance.
Goals are developed in conjunction with the Massachusetts Division of Medical
Assistance (Medicaid agency).  "We have a number of multidisciplinary teams
that have developed protocols," she says, including:

* prophylactic therapy for PCP; * pain management; * screening/treatment for
Cytomegalovirus retinitis; * screening for tuberculosis; and * Pap smear
screening for cervical cancer.

"We don't have any critical paths yet," says Meriot, acknowledging that the
complexity of treating AIDS patients often makes use of paths somewhat
difficult.  CMA has done some benchmarking using information from the medical
literature as a standard and will be doing more outcomes studies, frequently
using functional status as a measure of outcomes, she adds.

What have been the major enhancements in the quality of care managed by CMA?
Meriot first mentions that more patients live at home instead of in
institutions, which is a byproduct of coordinated care and early intervention.
CMA Medical Director Robert Master, MD, estimates that about 40 percent of
costs now go to hospital-based care, down from 60 percent to 75 percent when
the program started.

A second improvement is a more satisfied population with a better quality of
life, which Meriot attributes to CMA's educational activities.  In August
1995, Master stated there was "virtually no disenrollment from CMA due to
dissatisfaction" with the program.  Education of both patients and physicians
makes satisfaction rates higher and hospitalizations lower, he says.  "You
don't need as much specialty care if you have an educated, empowered patient
and a well-skilled and responsive primary care provider."

Better prevention of AIDS-related illnesses is a third area of achievement by
CMA.  "We're seeing fewer infections and a more delayed onset of certain
diseases," says Meriot.

In one example of this type of improvement, the 1992-93 rate of PCP episodes
was 17.2 per 100 patient years, down from 58.7 prior to enrollment in CMA.  Of
the 113 patients studied, 82 (73 percent) received prophylactic (preventive)
care under the management of CMA.  The drugs trimetheprim/sulfamethexazol,
aerosolized pentamidine, and dapsone were used in treatment for all but one of
the 82 patients.  The data appear in an article by Master in the Winter 1996
Journal of Ambulatory Care Management.

Meriot says the organization doesn't pay for experimental AIDS treatment, but
monitors the progress of patients already enrolled in clinical trials.  No
category of drug therapy is automatically paid for; all drug decisions must be
reviewed by the QI committee on a case-by-case basis.  Patients or physicians
have the right to appeal any decisions to an ethics advisory committee,
although such appeals "are rare," says Meriot.

A major thrust started by CMA last year is a redesign of the medical record
and a bolstering of the computer system to help the organization more
effectively manage patient care.

AN EMPLOYER TAKES A ROLE

Although a portion of the bill for treating HIV-positive patients is borne by
employers, corporations are not usually involved in quality standard setting
and monitoring.  One exception is the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of
Maynard MA, which formed an HIV/AIDS program in 1988.

"It was really a partnership with HMOs," says Paul Ross, worldwide manager of
the program.  He says that since 1988, the proportion of DEC employees
choosing an HMO has increased.  Currently, most employees are covered by one
of 85 HMOs.

Ross says that DEC took several steps to manage quality of care given to
HIV-positive employees.  First, it hired Clinical Partners, a San
Francisco-based case management firm with considerable experience in AIDS
treatment, to better coordinate care.

Second, the company developed standards about five years ago for HIV/AIDS
treatment in conjunction with the 85 HMOs.  DEC mandates that HMOs comply with
these standards as part of the contract with the company.  Ross says that the
standards cover patient care, education, and reporting procedures, and "are
broad enough to accommodate the rapid upgrades in HIV/AIDS treatment."

DEC is currently working on an evaluation of what effects the standards have
had on care of its employees.  Although results aren't available yet, Ross
expects to see improvements in the continuum of care and education of the
staff, increased AIDS testing of at-risk workers, and a greater proportion of
physicians with AIDS expertise treating patients.

CAN AIDS CARE BE IMPROVED?

Most experts agree that while improving AIDS care is possible, it is
difficult.  The most desirable outcome - decreased mortality - is still
elusive.

GMHC's Dooha says there have been a number of improvements in recent years.
"There is definitely better coordination of care," she says, citing a greater
number of knowledgeable physicians who are more accessible to the public.  She
also lists the survival of patients with AIDS-related pneumonia and fewer,
less expensive hospitalizations as other improvements.

Statistics seem to back up Dooha's contentions that care is being better
coordinated and requiring fewer hospital stays.  The number and rate of
discharges continue to grow, which represents the rising number of
HIV-positive Americans in the population.  However, the average length of
stay, which was 17.1 days in 1985, dropped to 11.4 days in 1993, the latest
year for which data are available.  For the first time, days of care fell
between 1990-92, before rising again in 1993.

Developments In Brief


Conference on NCQA.  "Surviving NCQA:  Lessons Learned from Health Plans" is
the theme of a May 13-15 conference held by the American Assn.  of Health
Plans (AAHP) in San Antonio TX.  Participants will hear from health plans that
recently underwent accreditation surveys from the National Committee for
Quality Assurance.  For more information, contact AAHP at 202/778-3269.

PRO Contractor Sues Feds.  Following the termination of its contract as the
Peer Review Organization (PRO) for Maine and Rhode Island, Medical Synergy is
suing the Medicare program.  The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
cited "significant weaknesses" in the company's proposal to renew the
contracts, which expire June 30.  Medical Synergy President Edward Lynch told
Faulkner & Gray's Medicine & Health that he believes philosophical differences
lie behind the decision - HCFA perceives the company as too tough on
providers.

NY Hospitals Receive Funds To Improve Home Care.  Nine New York City hospitals
have received grants totaling $500,000 to devise enhanced ways to help
patients manage their care at home after a hospital stay or outpatient
surgery.  Issues such as recognizing danger signs, coordinating medication
schedules, obtaining answers to medical questions, and finding psychological
support are examples of subjects to be researched by the hospitals.  The April
12 grant is part of the Discharge Preparation Initiative of New York's United
Hospital Fund.

HCFA Expands Centers for Excellence Program.  As many as 100 hospitals in 10
states will receive the "Participating Centers of Excellence" designation for
cardiovascular and orthopedic services from HCFA.  Such a designation is seen
as prestigious for hospitals, which must meet HCFA volume and quality
standards and are paid by Medicare through a "package price" for episodes of
care.  The initial two services in the program cover coronary artery bypass
graft surgery and outpatient cataract procedures.  Ten states are eligible
(AZ, CA, HI, IL, IN, MI, MN, NV, OH, and WI).  Call HCFA's Office of Research
and Demonstrations (410/786-7800) for more information.

New HSQB Director Appointed.  Richard W.  Besdine, MD, is the new director of
the federal Health Standards & Quality Bureau (HSQB), the agency responsible
for enforcing Medicare and Medicaid quality standards.  The April 9
announcement by Bruce C.  Vladeck, administrator of the HCFA (to whom Besdine
will report), notes his extensive academic experience at the University of
Connecticut and Harvard Medical School.  Besdine takes over for Barbara Gagel,
who resigned late last year.

Healthcare Forum Recognizes Young Leaders.  At its 1996 Healthier Communities
Summit in San Francisco on April 22, the Healthcare Forum recognized four
winners of the International Emerging Leaders in Healthcare award.  The award,
given to health care leaders under age 40 who have made achievements in
improving community health (national or local), went to Todd Linden of
Grinnell (IA) Regional Medical Center; Joanne Marqusee of Beth Israel Hospital
in Boston; Arthur Southam, MD, of CareAmerica in Woodland Hills CA; and Paul
Zucarelli of Partners Health Plan in Tucson AZ.  For more information about
the award, call Sally Mudd at the Healthcare Forum (415/356-4312).

CA Regulators Accused of Weak Oversight.  A California consumer group has
issued a report asserting that state regulators have not adequately evaluated
consumer complaints and overall quality of care by HMOs.  The April 11 report
by Consumers Union is critical of the state Dept.  of Corporations' ability to
keep up with the fast pace of HMO growth in California.  It recommends that
the state review HMOs every year instead of every three years and make review
standards available to the public.

Pocket Guides on LOS, Costs Available.  Three pocket guides giving the number
of 1992 hospital discharges, average LOS, and average charges for all
diagnosis and procedure groups were recently issued by the Agency for Health
Care Policy & Research (AHCPR).  The three guides are aggregated by 260
principal diagnosis categories, 230 procedure categories, and 492 Diagnosis
Related Groups.  For free copies, call AHCPR at 301/594-1410 and ask for the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP-3) pocket guides.

Seattle Groups Team Up for QM Effort.  A think tank, the Peer Review
Organization, and a business coalition in the Seattle area have combined to
form the Quality Measurement Advisory Service.  The Service, funded by the
John A.  Hartford Foundation, will hold national and local meetings, assist
local groups in QM projects, and operate an information clearinghouse.  For
more information, call Richard Rubin at 206/682-2811.

Hospital Hits Cardiac Care Mortality Rate With
Heart Risk Assessment Program


The risk assessment program includes EKG, cholesterol
screening and blood pressure measurement. Patients receive a
coronary risk report on disk, which offers suggestions for avoiding
heart attack.

To reach more patients and intervene in the early stage of heart
disease - thus boosting performance and outcomes - Sarasota
Memorial Hospital implemented the Heart C.A.R.E. program, a cardiac
assessment and risk evaluation initiative.
Sarasota, Florida's second largest hospital, realized last year
that it was caring for only 5% of the patients in its service area
who were at risk for heart disease.
Announced less than a month ago, Heart C.A.R.E. has received
overwhelming response. The hospital has booked patients for
screening through May.
"It took off like lightening," says April Mason, director of
cardiovascular diagnostic service at Sarasota.
Heart C.A.R.E. accomplishes two goals: screening and educating
patients.
The 35-minute screening requires that a patient fast for 12 hours.
Evaluators get a detailed family and personal history from the
patient, such as eating and exercise habits. The patient receives
an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cholesterol test. Blood pressure
measurements, both in the arm and ankle, determine presence of
peripheral heart disease. Measurement of hip-to-waist ratio
determines level of obesity.
The hospital places this information on a computer disk, which the
patient receives as a coronary risk report. The seven-page report
details coronary risk overview, fitness profile and cardiovascular
fitness recommendations.
A learning guide tells the patient ways to prevent heart attacks
and heart disease and reduce risk factors.
The patient's doctor receives a copy of the coronary risk report.
But in many cases, patients don't have a doctor, so the hospital
refers them to an internist or  cardiologist.
Sarasota hopes to measure program outcomes in a year. In an
evaluation, the hospital will look at several interrelated factors
of success, such as acuity, intervention and morbidity rates.
But hospital officials have already recognized some kinks in the
system.
For instance, because "snowbirds" make up much of Sarasota's
population, follow-up becomes difficult. The hospital wants to
target the older, more permanent residents of the Sarasota area
through churches and businesses.
The hospital has targeted people 40 years and older and have paid
special attention to women, who don't realize they are at risk and
have lesser chances than men for surviving a heart attack. Sarasota
wants to lower the mortality rate for that group.
Currently, 94% of patients that Sarasota sees has acute heart
disease. The hospital wants to lower that rate. "It's outrageously
high," Mason says. "Some patients come straight from the airport to
the hospital complaining of chest pains."
Finally, the hospital hopes to raise from 5% to 45% the percentage
of Sarasota residents it treats who are at risk of heart disease.

Utah Targets Health Plans, Providers In Mandated,
Statewide Report Card Effort


The state could begin with patient satisfaction and
cost comparisons before tackling the more expensive and difficult
comparison of clinical outcomes.

Utah lawmakers could bring a statewide quality report card
initiative a step closer to reality this week, just days after
yielding to providers' demands that an outside vendor evaluate the
state's data collection process.
State Sen. John Holmgren (R), who introduced the Health Care
Quality bill (SB 171) Jan. 31, says the Senate should vote on the
measure this week. The bill strengthens the role of the Utah Health
Data Committee and calls for the committee to publish "comparative
analyses" of provider performance.
"I think a year from now you'll see [the report card system] up and
running," Holmgren says, noting the need for heightened
accountability in a state of under  2 million people where health
care is a major $4.5 billion industry.
The Utah Assn. of HealthCare Providers "insisted" that comparative
quality data collection and analysis be validated by an outside
vendor, says Rick Kinnersley, president of the association of 53
hospitals and eight health care systems.
Kinnersley says hospitals were "uncomfortable" with the Health Data
Committee's earlier validation of hospital discharge data. He
expects the state to begin with patient satisfaction and cost
comparisons before tackling the more expensive and difficult
comparison of clinical outcomes.
Under the Utah Health Data Authorization Act of 1990, the committee
may collect data on cost, quality of care, and access from any
provider. Hospitals were the first priority; the committee has
collected four years (1992-95) of hospital discharge all-payer
data.
Denise Love, committee executive secretary, says the group has
collected some financial data on hospital performance as well.
But other efforts were put on hold for a report card initiative
that provides better consumer information at the health plan level.
The Utah Health Data Committee's advisory committee is hashing out
the details of the report card to recommend to the full committee.
The advisory committee is talking to the provider community about
what data are now collected by plans, and looking at enrollee
satisfaction survey instrument models.
Discussions have not begun on specific data measures. Love notes
the committee is considering public dissemination of comparative
health plan data, perhaps at an aggregate level, while reserving
more detailed information for health plans' internal quality
improvement efforts.
The committee's future priorities may include comparative
performance reports on health systems, networks, or individual
providers, adds Love, who is also director of the Utah Department
of Health Office of Health Data Analysis.

Committee Outlines Criteria For HEDIS 3.0 Measures


The National Committee for Quality Assurance Committee on
Performance Measurement approved criteria for HEDIS 3.0 measures,
set for release this month. Attributes fall in three categories and
include:

o        Relevance.
  x  Meaningful. Decisionmakers should be able
to use the measures to understand clinical or economic differences
among plans; this will be enhanced if benchmarks or targets are
available.
  x  Health importance. The measure should
capture as much of the plan's activities relating to quality as
possible, including type of measure, prevalence and seriousness of
the related medical condition.
  x  Financial importance.
  x  Strategically important. The measure
should encourage plans to devote resources to activities that most
effectively maximize the health of members.
  x  Controllability. Health plans should be
able to take actions that improve their performance.
  x  Variance among plans. There should be
potentially wide variations across plans.
  x  Potential for improvement. There should be
substantial room for improvement on the measure.
o        Scientific validity.
  x  Reproducible. The measure should produce
the same results when repeated with the same population and in the
same setting.
  x  Accurate.
  x  Valid. It should make sense logically,

  x  Precisely specified. The measure should
have clear methods for data collection and reporting.
  x  Reasonable cost. The measure should not
impose an inappropriate burden on plans.
  x  Confidential. Collecting data for the
measure should not involve any violation of member
confidentiality.
  x  Logistically feasible. The data required
for the measure should be available in the time period allowed for
collection and should not be subject to cultural or other barriers,
such as a satisfaction survey in English for Spanish-speaking
members.

The committee would not expect all measures to meet all attributes.

Quality Boils Down to Cost In Blue Cross Hospital Program


Hospitals seeking "Partnerships for Quality" status had to
meet some baseline quality standards, but the first year of the
program focuses on reimbursement, not performance.

Blue Cross of California is touting its recent placement of 85% of
participating hospitals within its statewide network as preferred
"Tier I" facilities and the rest as "Tier II," but officials
acknowledge the designation boils down to reimbursement rates, not
quality.
Hospitals within both "Partnerships for Quality" tiers have passed
a quality threshold that must be met in order to discuss
contracting and rates with Blue Cross affiliate CaliforniaCare
Health Plans, explains Dr. Jeffrey Rideout, vice president and
medical director of quality management for Woodland Hills,
Calif.-based Blue Cross of California.
Indeed, Rideout says the quality threshold is fairly low in order
to keep most of the network intact. "We didn't want to eliminate
many [participating hospitals], but we wanted to take the first
step to build the logic of quality performance into the contract,"
he says.
He says Blue Cross plans to become more discriminating over the
next few years as data are validated.

Tier I Hospitals Receive Preferred Status

Under the program, Tier I hospitals receive preferred status within
the network, prominent mention in marketing materials, and access
to electronic interfacing, quality and outcome support, and
utilization management from the company.
In contrast, patients face higher copayments at Tier II hospitals.
Contracting hospitals responding to a Blue Cross request for
proposal on "Partnerships for Quality" provided information on
quality and reimbursement rates, then received scores based on
comparisons within six peer categories.
The company expects to finalize designations for remaining
hospitals by the end of March.
Rideout notes Blue Cross runs programs parallel to the affiliated
hospital quality performance program: (1) a quality monitoring
program for medical groups and IPAs now in its fourth year; and (2)
an ongoing member survey on service and access.
Last year the medical group program used eight quality indicators,
including administrative and grievance rates; voluntary transfer
from one medical group to another for quality or access reasons;
and preventive measures.
Rideout says Blue Cross hopes to use its size and clout to initiate
statewide quality processes that smaller health plans cannot
negotiate.
The hospital program uses 10 quality indicators, including five
institution-specific measures on C-section rates; coronary artery
bypass graft (CABG) surgery rates; myocardial infarction with and
without catheterization; and perinatal mortality.
The indicators are supplemented by self-reported quality data
including JCAHO accreditation and any existing patient satisfaction
surveys and clinical pathways. Data are risk-adjusted, Rideout
says, but much of it is "very old" and some is controversial.

Outcomes Focus Helps Network Hike Survival Rate Above
Norm


An adult liver transplant calls for at least: 25
transplants per year; a program in exist- ence two years; a
transplanter with two years' post-fellowship experience who has
performed 50 cases as primary surgeon; an 80% survival rate at one
year; and a re-transplantation rate lower than 15% within the first
year.

A Minneapolis-based transplant network that focuses on outcomes
measurement and management achieved a 92% one-year survival rate
for liver transplant patients, topping the 77% national average
reported by the United Network of Organ Sharing.
United Resource Networks' 86% two-year survival rate was 14% above
a national average.
United HealthCare Corp. of Minneapolis founded United Resource
Networks in 1989 to manage the catastrophic costs of
transplantation: an end-stage disease management therapy. The
company sought out quality transplant facilities in areas with
United HealthCare HMOs, and packaged services - everything from
hospital and physician costs to organ procurement and  follow-up
expenses - in one contract.
United Resource Networks manages transplant outcomes measurement,
case management and pricing structures for 285 clients, covering
about 20 million lives. Most are HMOs, but clients also include
commercial insurers, the state of Colorado, and a couple of large,
self-funded employers.
Kirk Stapleton, president and founder, credits United Resource
Networks' work in facilitating access to quality care while
creating cost-control strategies - along with technological
advances - with improved patient outcomes and reduced costs over
the past several years.
Stapleton also cites estimated cost savings of 25%-30% per
transplant procedure. "Because we move a lot of volume, we bulk
purchase competitive packages for clients," he says. For example,
the company on average pays $178,198 on a $267,234 average bill for
a liver transplant at network facilities - an average savings of
33% per procedure.

Highlights of United Resource Networks' program include:
o        Using 38 registered nurses as
account managers to help clients manage benefits. The company
sometimes case manages individual patients.
o        Tracking outcomes at six months and
one-year for every patient "to quickly identify survival issues."
o        Recredentialing transplant sites
yearly. After the company started contracting for services, it
began looking beyond meeting price to tracking outcomes, using
guidelines from the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. 

Unlike HCFA, which reviews facilities for compliance only one time,
United returns every year to recredential sites. Stapleton notes
transplant surgeons change facilities, which can result in
different patient outcomes at a given site.
"We drop three to four programs a year on resurvey, looking at
specific organ outcomes," he says. Using 28 participating
facilities in the United States and two facilities in Canada,
United managed about 1,400 transplants in 1995.
The combined United/Specialty Care Institutes annual caseload
stands at 2,900. United plans to complete the acquisition of
competitor Specialty Care Institutes on July 1.
United's outcomes criteria, based on American College of Transplant
Surgeons guidelines, is reviewed by the company's medical
directors, all practicing transplant surgeons. 
Criteria are divided between adult and pediatric categories. An
adult liver transplant, for example, calls for at least: 25
transplants per year; a program in existence two years; a
transplanter with two years' post- fellowship experience who has
performed 50 cases as primary surgeon; an 80% survival rate at one
year; and a re-transplantation rate lower than 15% within the first
year.
"We won't contract with any program unless it meets our outcomes
criteria," Stapleton says. "We're religious about it."

MDs Develop QA Program For Managed Kidney Care


A medical group incorporates a patient advocate's care
model to develop a treatment path for dialysis patients covered by
managed care plans.

Southern California Permanente Medical Group and the American Assn.
of Kidney Patients will jointly develop a quality assurance program
for patients with severe kidney conditions.
Few dialysis patients are in managed care programs. In fact,
managed care plans cannot by law recruit dialysis patients, but do
care for members who develop end-stage renal disease, says Ramon
Hannah, assistant to the associate medical director and physician
manager of operations.
But that soon may change as capitated plans target dialysis care.
Worried about what this could mean for kidney patients, the
American Assn. of Kidney Patients developed a patient care model
that lays out rights and benefits for dialysis patients. The model
demands quality care and education about the disease.
The medical group, affiliated with the Southern California region
of Kaiser Permanente, persuaded the kidney group to look at the
medical group's award-winning program.
The Kaiser program sets several high standards for quality of care
and assigns nurse monitors to determine whether these standards are
met.
Indicators, such as the amount of dialysis a patient receives, tell
whether patient care is good.
The medical group will use the association's patient care model to
make improvements in its program. The improved plan is set for
implementation this spring.
Additional goal: prove the medical group is the best place for
patients who need renal disease care and results in the best
patient outcomes.
In measuring whether the program meets these goals, the group will
look at four factors: morbidity, mortality, rehospitalization and
rehabilitation rates.
The 450 patients enrolled in the group's internal program already
have better outcomes when compared to patients in other local
networks. The goal is to assure the similar rates for the group's
1,200 patients who use contract dialysis services, Hannah says.
"From a quality assurance perspective, it's a classic example of
success of quality assurance," Hannah says. "If you define
indicators and push providers to improve, good outcomes result. And
good outcomes does lower costs."

Risk Assessment Draws Fire; Regulators Say HMO Form OK


An HMO using a health risk appraisal tool finds that 60%
of members completing the survey reported behavioral changes to
improve health status.

A major Colorado HMO, stung by bad publicity over a clinical
quality tool that launched a state inquiry, now emphasizes to
members the survey is  voluntary and, as confidential medical
record information, can't be released without member authorization.
Kaiser's "Confidential Health Profile" form is a clinical tool that
serves as the "cornerstone" of the HMO's prevention program, "and
we have proof that it makes a difference," says Dr. Ned Calonge,
chairman of preventive medicine. The HMO's experience highlights
the troubles plans can have in collecting data for performance
improvement.
The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado at a December 1995
media briefing announced the ongoing dissemination of a
questionnaire seeking medical and lifestyle information on the
321,000-member HMO's adult members.
But the Colorado Division of Insurance launched an inquiry when the
media asked whether the HMO could penalize members by requiring
members supply the information in order to stay in the plan or to
receive treatment, or whether health profile information, such as
acknowledging HIV risk factors, could be used by other insurers to
deny coverage.
State regulators, after review and clarification from Kaiser,
concluded that no regulatory concerns exist and that the HMO is
taking appropriate action to ensure information remains
confidential.
The state also found no violation of a state insurance regulation
that prohibits the development of sexual orientation questions with
subsequent use of the information for underwriting purposes. The
HMO's questionnaire lists several risk factors for HIV infection or
AIDS, including "male homosexual or bisexual contacts," and asks
whether factors in the aggregate apply to the member.
Although the state required no action, Kaiser officials say the
HMO's cover letter accompanying the health profile now states the
survey is voluntary. And the HMO modified its medical record
release form to include members' approval or denial of release of
survey information.
The questionnaire consists of 40 questions for men and 51 questions
for women on such topics as smoking, exercise, dietary habits and
sexual activity. Members get a computer-generated personal health
risk profile suggesting ways to reduce risks and quantifying risks
through a pie chart that shows the number of years a change in each
unhealthy habit would add to life expectancy.
A multidisciplinary team of the HMO's physicians and nurses, along
with a consultant, in 1991 began  developing the survey based on
a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) health
risk appraisal form. Calonge says it evolved into the "shortest,
easiest form possible" through HMO physicians' input and member
focus groups' recommendations.

Survey Helps Create Whole-Life Algorithm

The CDC looked at predicted mortality for a person over a 10-year
period; Calonge says this underestimates risk. The HMO created a
whole-life algorithm summarizing risk over a lifetime.
Kaiser piloted the form in 1994, then reworded some questions and
added a query on depression.
Calonge says the health profile will continue to evolve. The HMO
may, for example, add questions on family history to determine
genetic predisposition to certain cancers, and fine-tune the pie
chart based on additional epidemiological information.
"The concept was to quantify risk factors in a way to motivate
behavioral changes," Calonge explains, noting the HMO expects
behavioral changes among members and greater utilization of
resource programs thanks to the questionnaire. In the pilot study,
more than 60% of members completing the health risk appraisal
reported behavioral changes or intended behavioral changes, vs. 30%
in the group not using the form.
Kaiser expects 70% of adult members will complete the health
profile, up from 40%. The HMO plans to use another mailing in the
second year, plus handouts in physician offices, to reach the
target. A 70% level "could really show a programmatic impact," he
says.
While confidentiality has not been an issue, Calonge says some
members object to the form's questions on birth control, sexually
transmitted diseases, and HIV risk factors. But he says such
queries are important to a comprehensive health risk appraisal.

REPORTS & SURVEYS


       With continuous changes in the
quantity and types of health care personnel providing services,
health plans and providers will increasingly need to monitor and
understand the various aspects of patient satisfaction, according
to "Tracking the System: American Health Care 1996." The report,
the fifth from the National Committee for Quality Healthcare, says
current patient satisfaction measurement tools "collect information
of questionable rigor." For a copy, call (202) 347-5731. Cost: $15.

       A Kaiser Permanente physician
completed a study on the effectiveness of fecal occult blood test
in detecting colorectal cancers and large polyps. Dr. James
Allison, in a study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, documents for the first time that fecal occult blood
tests can detect 1.5 to two times as many cancers and polyps as the
most-used test, Hemoccult II. Clinicians and health planners can
use the study data to recommend tests. Contact Kaiser at (510)
987-3900.

       In a study of nearly 2,000 seriously
ill hospital patients, only about one quarter said they didn't want
CPR used to save their lives - many fewer than researchers
expected, given the poor prognosis of the study group and the
likely outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of
cardiac arrest. After adjusting for demographics, severity of
illness and functional status, the Beth Israel Hospital researchers
found that a patient's diagnosis, his or her understanding of the
prognosis, and the institution where a patient was hospitalized
were some of the factors influencing decisions about whether to
forgo CPR. A patient's decision not to have CPR was associated with
a decrease in the intensity, not the quality, of patient care. It
also did not result in differences in hospital mortality rate. The
study was published in The American Journal of Medicine.

       Get a look at four methods for
conducting an internal quality assessment based on the
healthcare-specific Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award pilot
criteria. A new handbook, "Quality,  Assessment for Healthcare,"

implementation stages covering management workshops, focus groups,
surveys and an assessment based on comprehensive criteria. To order

       "The search for `best practices' to
benchmark the rates of surgery leads to those practices that have
adopted shared decision-making, because learning which rate is
right requires the active participation of the patient in the
decision process," say the authors of the "Dartmouth Atlas of
Health Care." For a copy, call (800) 242-2626.

       Hospitals in cities with high levels
of managed care report significantly lower costs, reduced length of
stay and decreased mortality rates, according to a national study
of 11.7 million patients at 3,700 acute care hospitals. The KPMG
Peat Marwick study, "The Impact of Managed Care on U.S. Markets,"
also finds the presence of managed care has not resulted in higher
mortality rates or complication rates. The risk-adjusted mortality
rates in high managed care markets were 5.25% below the national
average. For a copy of the study, call (800) 243-1397.

QUALITY BRIEFS


       The National Committee for Quality
Assurance next week will release information that will enable
people to compare information from hundreds of health plans. NCQA's
effort is culled from its national database for HEDIS and
accreditation information. For more information, contact Barry
Scholl of NCQA at (202) 955-3500.

       Watch for HCFA to announce this
month a Medicare "centers of excellence" program for cardiac and/or
orthopedic care, according to HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck. The
program currently bundles payments to designated coronary artery
bypass graft and cataract surgery facilities and gives seniors who
choose such facilities a rebate.

       Prudential HealthCare Group formed
a special unit, Health Management Programs, to build expert
guidelines, collect outcomes data, enhance patient and physician
education, provide case management and measure results - all aimed
at managing chronic illness. The plan will build on experience
garnered in its three-city asthma management pilot program in
January 1995. Other programs under consideration: diabetes,
depression and hypertension. Contact Prudential at (201) 802-4884.

       Humana Medical Plan Inc. of South
Florida won full accreditation from the National Committee for
Quality Assurance. NCQA denied the plan accreditation during its
first review of the HMO in 1993.

       HEDIS 3.0 should be used to measure
the quality of care a population is receiving and to assess whether
plan efforts are helping to improve public health, for example by
reducing tobacco use, according to members of the NCQA Committee on
Performance Measurement. At its last meeting, committee members

       The Colorado legislature shelved a
bill to implement a mandatory maternity stay after state insurers
and managed care plans agree to comply voluntarily with the bill's
provisions. The bill would have required plans to cover 48 hours of
hospital care following a normal delivery and 96 hours after a
C-section. Instead, plans agree to allow 48-hour stays without
reauthorization and to apply guidelines issued by the American
College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy of
Pediatrics when conducting utilization reviews and considering
authorization requests.

       In related news, the American Nurses

Reform moves to state arena, loses some ground.  


With the federal government focusing on other issues, health care reform
shifted back to the states, where it suffered some setbacks.  Opposition from
small business employers and Republican control of more state legislatures put
reform issues on hold or reversed them.  Massachusetts' "play or pay" law,
which would have taxed employers who did not offer their workers health
coverage, was tabled for the third time in seven years.  Washington state
dismantled a law requiring employers to pay for group health coverage, and
Vermont opted out of a single-payer system proposal.  Groundwork was laid,
however, for expansion of coverage due to a recent U.S.  Supreme Court
decision in a New York case.  The court found that a surcharge on hospital
bills is not pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  Other
states are now expected to enact their own surcharges to fund coverage for
uninsured individuals.

A study by the Wellness Program Management Advisor shows that such programs
can cut costs by as much as 30 percent.  Thirty-eight percent of respondents
said that health screenings had the greatest effect on costs.  Nutrition, high
blood pressure and stress management were also found to reduce costs.  Only
two percent of respondents said they saw a rise in health care expenses after
implementing wellness programs.

Medical fee schedules most popular cost control measure.  


Forty states now use medical fee schedules as a method of containing workers'
compensation costs, according to a study by the Workers' Compensation Research
Institute.  Hospital payment regulation is used by 35 states, and a change of
provider limit is used by 32 states.  Restrictions on provider changes is the
fastest-growing method of cost containment; 13 states enacted such
restrictions this year.

Poll shows general dissatisfaction with health care.  


Fewer than 2 in 10 respondents were satisfied with the nation's health care
system, according to a Louis Harris poll.  Twelve percent said they couldn't
get needed treatment in 1995, and 15 percent had to wait at least a week to
get an appointment with a physician.  More than 80 percent of respondents said
the health care system is too bureaucratized.  Responses were somewhat better
than a poll taken five years ago, when only 1 in 10 said they were satisfied
with the system.

Carrier expands comp coverage through new endorsements.  


ITT Hartford Insurance Group is now marketing two endorsements which enable
employers to broaden workers' compensation coverage.  The first, available at
no extra charge to eligible risks, expands coverage in six different areas,
including employers liability stop gap and voluntary compensation.  The
second, available at 1.5 to 3 percent of the standard premium, expands
coverage in 11 areas, such as business trips to foreign countries and an
increase in employers' liability bodily injury limits.  It also includes the
six areas covered in the first new endorsement.

Health Insurance Plan of California brings in some employers, but many workers
still uncovered.


Although the HIPC has enrolled more than 5,000 employers and covers nearly
100,000 workers, uninsured employees are still a problem in the Golden State.
In Los Angeles County alone, four out of five are workers or their dependents,
according to a study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.  A large
share of L.A.  workers are paid too little to afford coverage, and their
employers have profit margins too small to provide coverage.  "A relatively
large group of employers are still marginally profitable, and an incremental
increase in expenses may put them over the edge," said Richard Figueroa, an
HIPC state manager.  Of the employers that the HIPC has signed up during its
two years of operation, only 20 percent were previously uninsured.

New York slated for comp reform.  


In his state of the state address, Gov.  George Pataki called for major
changes in many of the state's programs and procedures, including workers'
compensation and unemployment insurance.  The National Federation of
Independent Business applauded the governor's message.  "It's not just the
state and local taxes that have dulled small business growth, " said Mark P.
Alesse, NFIB's state director.  "Costly employer mandates like workers' comp
and UI have depressed small business job creation, too.  With real reform this
session, we are confident that small business will respond with substantial
new job opportunities."  The New York Workers' Compensation Action Network,
which represents 7,000 businesses statewide, praised the governor's plan to
implement a managed care system, a reform the group has sought for several
years.  Senate Democratic Leader Martin Connor was not as confident.  "The
governor forgets to mention that his health care plans will probably lead to
the closing of many hospitals and thousands of layoffs," he warned.

Concern over ADA kills New Jersey HIV exclusion testing.  


The proposed regulation would have enabled group health insurers to test for
the human immunodeficiency virus and deny coverage based on test results
(SNCHB 10-23-95).  Insurance Commissioner Elizabeth Randall said that the
proposal most likely violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as
state insurance regulations that bar unfair discrimination.

Pennsylvania small businesses urge passage of comp reform bill.  


H.B.  2216, up before the state legislature this session, would reduce
workers' compensation costs for smaller employers currently facing increases
under the proposed "loss cost" filing.  The bill would change calculation of
average weekly wages to reflect actual yearly earnings; offset benefits by the
amount received in Social Security, pension, and severance benefits; prohibit
payment of disability benefits when the worker is earning wages equal to or
greater than pre-injury wages; provide safe employer discounts of five percent
on annual premiums; and permit employers to control medical care for 180 days
instead of 30 days.  Nearly 5,000 businesses are participating in the
campaign, spearheaded by SMC Business Councils, the Pennsylvania Business
Association and the Chamber Summit.  Small businesses make up over 95 percent
of all businesses in the state.

Other Keystone State bills would clarify emergency coverage for HMO members.


State Senators Roy C.  Afflerbach and Jim Gerlach have introduced two bills
that would broaden emergency room treatment coverage for members of health
maintenance organizations.  The Gerlach bill would define an emergency for the
purposes of insurance coverage, and the Afflerbach bill would guarantee
emergency care to stabilize the patient, including 24-hour authorization
access for members.  The senators are responding to complaints from patients
whose managed health care providers have refused to pay for emergency
treatment when the symptoms were later determined not to constitute an
emergency under the medical insurers definition.  "Common sense tells you that
people with perfectly good health insurance don't get up in the middle of the
night and rush to the hospital unless they honestly believe they are having a
medical emergency," said Afflerbach.

Ohio Blue Cross/Blue Shield to base copayments on negotiated discounts.  


After a long year of complaints and court battles, the Blues have stopped the
practice of basing insured copayments on regular hospital rates rather than
the discounted rates the Blues actually pay.  And starting the first of this
month, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio will incorporate the discounts into
copayment billings.  Still pending is a court case in Toledo, where a federal
judge is still to decide whether the Blues must pay restitution to insureds.

Florida reform helping many to obtain health care coverage.  


Since its formation in 1994, the Community Health Purchasing Alliance has
enrolled over 14,000 businesses in the state, covering more than 63,000
individuals.  The CHPA is a non-profit group designed to help small businesses
of 1 to 50 employees afford to offer health insurance to their workers.
Purchasing alliances for small businesses are currently available in 15
states.  With more alliances in the process of forming, the number of states
is expected to climb to 23.

South Carolina comp costs will continue to drop.  


The National Council on Compensation Insurance reports that slow economic
growth and a move toward trade and service jobs will continue to lower the
state's workers' comp costs.  Key factors are a decline in defense and other
manufacturing industries such as textiles, similar to the changes in the
Northeast.  As workers shift to less hazardous jobs, comp costs will continue
to decrease.  "Workers' compensation voluntary loss costs fell 13.9 percent in
1995 and residual market rates dropped by 1.9 percent," said William D.
Hager, NCCI president.  South Carolina's lower unemployment rate has also had
a positive impact on comp costs, dropping from 7.5 percent in 1993 to 5.0
percent in 1995.  The rate is expected to remain below 5.2 percent over the
next two years.

Minnesota's Care on Call provides callers with treatment for their symptoms
over the phone.  Developed jointly by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota
and HealthSystem Minnesota, the service puts callers through to registered
nurses who use physician-approved guidelines to treat non-emergency
conditions, similar to medical hotlines in other states (SNCHB, 10-9-95).  The
nurses also phone in prescriptions and set up doctor appointments for callers.

Texas comp carriers given rate reduction ultimatum.  


The Texas Department of Insurance gave insurers until February 1 to cut or
justify their workers' compensation rates or prepare for possible rollback
hearings.  Letters were sent to 17 insurer groups that write workers' comp in
the state, including Aetna, Allstate, Nationwide, Reliance and Zurich.  These
groups have 74 companies that write comp coverage, accounting for a seventh of
the state's market.  "The carriers have known for months of my concern that
workers' compensation rates are too high," said Insurance Commissioner Elton
Bomer, "particularly rates for small businesses."  He added that although some
insurers have reduced their rates due to savings created from a 1989 reform
law, more than a few have not responded.  "Some carriers have persisted in
charging rates that ignore the vastly improved claim situation," Bomer said.
"TDI's patience has worn thin, and we're carrying out the responsibility the
Legislature gave us to challenge excessive rates."  An analysis by TDI showed
comp rates were too high by 4 to 17 percent.

Infection Control
TB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?


Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfully
combined?

The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris with
researchers expressing differing views.

D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less than
compatible, because they target different groups.

"Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIV
prevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted.

"Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,
attempts to combine them are difficult."

Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conference
on Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.

Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is the
same - to prevent infections - the focus must be different.

"In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of case
management in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventing
transmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstract
presented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.
Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit the
infection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infected
person who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection.

"Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on general
health education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point of
implementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point of
implementation must be the general population of subsets of it."

R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Program
countered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs is
essential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficiently
implement.

"Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,
but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Brien
noted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient care
and help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling is
not widely available."

O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patients
with TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TB
programs and prevent further TB transmission in households.

O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis
to be lacking.

"AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which together
can address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLD
meeting.

"Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for working
separately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is now
recognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death in
HIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer be
permitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care and
preventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."

The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programs
for people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis in
developing areas.

"Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home care
programs for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomed
rapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLD
conference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100
different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affected
families, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals can
scarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families have
seriously deteriorated, due to AIDS.

"More than half of the people with HIV related illness will develop
tuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to complete
treatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various health
care programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses and
reduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist within
home care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in close
contact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB disease

Animal Models
Mouse Model Useful for Determining TB Pathology


A murine study suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is far more virulent
when given by the respiratory route than by the intravenous route.

Researcher Robert J.  North of New York's Trudeau Institute earlier reported
that intravenous inoculation of mice with M.  tuberculosis results in a slowly
progressive infection in the lungs, despite the acquisition of systemic host
immunity capable of resolving infection in the liver, spleen and kidneys.

"The present study was undertaken to determine whether the peculiar
susceptibility of the lungs to M.  tuberculosis infection is even more obvious
in mice infected via the respiratory route," North wrote ("M.  tuberculosis is
Strikingly More Virulent for Mice When Given via the Respiratory than via the
Intravenous Route," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1550-1553).

North found that fewer M.  tuberculosis colony-forming units (cfu) given by
aerosol were substantially more virulent for mice than much larger numbers
inoculated intravenously, as shown by a faster rate of bacillary growth in the
lungs and much shorter survival of the host.

"Earlier death of mice infected by aerosol was associated with faster
development of lung pathology, even though the number of M.  tuberculosis
given intravenously resulted in the same number of bacilli initially
implanting in the lungs as the number given by aerosol," North wrote.  "Mice
depleted of CD4 T cells died of infection much sooner than immunocompetent
mice but at about the same time after being infected via either route."

North noted that mice infected by aerosol, in contrast with those given M.
tuberculosis intravenously were incapable of resolving infection in their
livers, indicating that they generated and expressed a lower level of systemic
immunity.

"This interpretation is in keeping with the finding that mice depleted of CD4
T cells died at about the same time after infection was initiated via either
route and much earlier than immunocompetent controls," North wrote.  "In
addition, the survival time of mice infected via the respiratory route was
greatly extended if they were also infected intravenously with a larger number
of M.  tuberculosis.  Thus, a larger number of M.  tuberculosis cfu given
intravenously induces a higher level of systemic immunity than does a smaller
number given by aerosol.  This likely occurs because a larger intravenous
inoculum represents a larger quantity of replicating antigen capable of
engaging larger amounts of lymphoid tissue, including that in the spleen."

North concludes that bacilli that reach the lungs via the respiratory route
have a growth advantage over those that enter from blood during the initial
stage of infection.

"This may be because microorganisms that enter the lung via the respiratory
route are ingested by resident alveolar macrophages, whereas those that enter
from the blood need to be carried into the organ after being ingested by
monocytes, neutrophils, or pulmonary intravascular macrophages.

"Given that resident alveolar macrophages tend to be less capable than other
macrophages of killing microbial pathogens in general, it is possible that
this enables M.  tuberculosis to grow more rapidly during the initial stage of
infection.  Results of the present study support this concept in that M.
tuberculosis that entered the lung directly grew faster during the first 20
days of infection than did M.  tuberculosis that entered from blood."

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Disease Markers
Increased Soluble CD14 Useful Marker in TB Patients


Increased levels of soluble CD14 are present in bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

CD14 was first identified as a marker of cells derived from the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, although it was later found on other cells like
neutrophils and B lymphocytes.  The cell surface glycoprotein serves as a
cellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide with
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased in
serum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonary
sarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum and
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheisel
and colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 are
also found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels in
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December
1995;108:1614-1616).

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologic
characteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

"The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was
increased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22
ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote.

"No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar to
patients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found in
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,
this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing to
granuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cell
surface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determine
the significance and clinical relevance of this finding."

Drug Screening
Particle Counting Assay Evaluates TB Drugs


A particle counting immunoassay developed in Belgium appears to offer a rapid
and inexpensive method for screening antituberculosis agents.

Researcher J.P.  Van Vooren and colleagues from the University of Brussels
developed the method based on particle counting immunoassay to detect
mycobacteria in clinical specimens.

"We adapted this procedure to test the efficiency of antimicrobial agents
against M.  tuberculosis," Van Vooren et al.  wrote in an abstract presented
to the 1995 annual meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and
Lung Disease (IUATLD), held in Paris, France.

The latex particles used in the technique were coated with polyclonal anti-BCG
to detect mycobacterial antigens.

Four drug-susceptible, five multi-resistant and three isoniazid-resistant M.
tuberculosis strains were inoculated in bottles containing nonradioactive
Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium and rifampin or isoniazid.

To lessen risk of contamination the mycobacteria were destroyed in an
autoclave between culture and subsequent manipulations.  Drug susceptibilities
were measured and those obtained with the BACTEC system were critically
compared.  For each of the 12 strains drug sensitivities were found comparable
in the two methods and could be determined after five days.

"We conclude that particle immunoassay gives access to a safe, reproducible,
fast and inexpensive nonradioactive procedure to screen drug sensitivities for
mycobacterial strains," Van Vooren et al.  wrote in an abstract presented to
the IUATLD meeting.

Epidemiology (TB)
Old Infection May Be Responsible for Clustered TB in Arkansas


Fingerprint clustering in large rural geographic areas may not represent
recent tuberculosis transmission, according to a report from the U.S.  Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Arkansas Department of
Health.

Researcher C.R.  Braden and colleagues reported the findings at the 1995
annual meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (IUATLD).

Previous studies have suggested that M.  tuberculosis isolates with similar
DNA fingerprints represent recent transmission of tuberculosis (TB) between
patients.

In this study DNA fingerprinting and conventional epidemiology techniques were
used to identify connections, recent and remote, among clustered patients.

M.  tuberculosis isolates obtained from Arkansas residents diagnosed in 1992
and 1993 were analyzed by DNA fingerprinting.  For clustered patients, health
department and laboratory records were established by identifying direct
exposure among cluster members or by placing cluster members in the same
location when TB transmission could have occurred.

A total of 338 culture positive cases of TB were identified.  Fingerprints
were obtained on isolates from 248 (73 percent).  Of these, 137 (55 percent)
grouped into 35 clusters.  Fingerprints had from two to 17 bands.  Cluster
sizes ranged from two to 15 patients and 15 clusters had only two patients.

Connections were found for all patients in seven (20 percent) clusters, some
in eight (23 percent) clusters and none in 20 (57 percent) clusters.

Twelve clusters, including the two largest, had fingerprints with five or less
bands.  Some or all patients were linked in 57 percent of clusters whose
isolates had fingerprints with more than five bands, but only 13 percent of
those with fingerprints with five or less bands.

"For most clusters, conventional epidemiologic methods did not identify
opportunities for TB transmission among cluster patients," Braden et al.
wrote.  "Fingerprint clustering in a large rural geographic area may not
represent recent transmission and DNA fingerprint patterns with five or less
bands may lack specificity."

Occupational Exposure (TB)
Most TB in New York HCWs Due to Recent Infections


A finding that most tuberculosis cases among health care workers in a New York
study were due to recent infections suggests that occupational transmission of
tuberculosis routinely occurs in facilities without recognized tuberculosis
(TB) outbreaks, according to Cornell University's Public Health Research
Institute.

A number of nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred across the United
States during 1990 and 1991, resulting in several deaths among personnel in
contact with infected patients.  These outbreaks prompted the issuance of new
guidelines for health care workers from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).

"Since (the implementation of the CDC guidelines) there have been relatively
few reported outbreaks, which suggests that current control measures may be
effective," researcher Kent A Sepkowitz and colleagues wrote ("TB Among Urban
Health Care Workers:  A Study Using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
Typing," Clinical Infectious Diseases, November 1995;21:1098-1102).

"However, it is not known whether the apparently sporadic cases of
tuberculosis in health care workers are due to occupationally acquired
infections or, as a recent study suggested, are more likely due to
community-acquired infections.  In addition, the risk for HIV infected
personnel is not well defined, although some have suggested that HIV infected
health care workers should have the option of being assigned to an area
associated with a low risk of exposure to tuberculosis."

In this study Sepkowitz and colleagues at New York's Cornell University
Medical College analyzed cases of tuberculosis using laboratory-based active
surveillance system for TB at six hospitals in New York City (members of the
TBNetwork).

Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992 to 1994 were analyzed according
to the occupational status of the patients.

The researchers reviewed medical records and restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was
performed.

"No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in
the study period," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Occupational status was known
for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing.
Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as
determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease."

RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65 percent) of 20 health care
workers and 50 (41 percent) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered
RFLP pattern.

Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status
revealed that HIV status and health care worker status were independent risk
factors for a clustered RFLP strain.

The recent transmission rate of 65 percent outlined by Sepkowitz et al.  is
greater than that seen among health care workers with tuberculosis in Bern,
Switzerland, San Francisco, California, or the Bronx, New York.

Sepkowitz et al.  conclude that many apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis
among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational
transmission.

The authors note, however, that the cases analyzed in their report probably
reflect transmissions that occurred prior to the time hospitals updated
infection control procedures.

"Our data suggest that occupational transmission of tuberculosis occurs in
hospitals without recognized outbreaks," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Health
care workers with HIV infection appear to be at particular risk.  Prospective
RFLP-based studies will be useful to confirm these findings and may help
determine the efficacy of current guidelines for preventing transmission of
tuberculosis in health care settings."

Occupational Exposure (TB)
Product Simplifies Compliance with Guidelines for TB Exposure


Uvex Safety, Inc., Smithfield, Rhode Island, has introduced a new family of
N95 disposable particulate respirators designed to help healthcare and
emergency medical organizations comply with recently-enacted regulations for
respiratory protection for workers exposed to tuberculosis (TB).

The uvex/Pro-Tech N95 respirators enable users of existing uvex HEPA-Tech
respirators to update their equipment at about half the cost without
fit-testing for employees.  Because they have the same physical design, the
uvex N95 respirators allow users to switch without a re-fit test if they have
been trained and fit tested with the HEPA-Tech models.

Featuring a 95 percent efficient filter media, the N95 respirators meet the
new NIOSH test criteria for particulate respiratory filters (42 CFR Part 84).
In addition, they comply with the new U.S.  Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) guidelines for respiratory protection against occupational
exposure to TB.  Available in three sizes and capable of
qualitative/quantitative fit testing as well as reliable fit checking, they
also meet all performance criteria in the new OSHA enforcement policies for TB
protection.

There are currently two models in the uvex/Pro-Tech N95 product family, both
of which feature adjustable top and bottom head straps as well as a patented
foam sealing flange.

* The Model 4010 is an entry level respirator designed for medical
environments that do not permit open exhalation of respiratory aerosols.

* The Model 4Al0 includes an exhalation valve that streamlines exhaled air out
of the facepiece, making it cooler and more comfortable to wear.

"Now that OSHA has adopted the CDC guidelines into regulation, the healthcare
field has a new alternative for TB protection," explains uvex industrial
hygienist Michael Fuchs.  "In many cases, the new regulations enable employers
to make an across-the-board change from existing HEPA respirators to the new
N95 models.  But in large facilities and organizations, this can prove to be a
time-consuming problem for safety officials.

"With its new N95 respirators, uvex is making the transition easier and less
costly for its customers.  Users who have been fit-tested for uvex HEPA-Tech
respirators can simply switch to similar sized uvex N95 models with no
qualitative or quantitative fit testing ...  at about half the cost of the
Hepa-Tech 3010 Series.  The switch will be quick and simple."

Pediatrics 
Hepatic Toxicity Reversible in TB-Treated Children


Hepatic toxicity in children treated for tuberculosis in Macedonia was less
severe and long lasting when preventive measures were undertaken.

Researcher L.  Jakovski and colleagues from Macedonia's Institute for
Respiratory Diseases in Children compared hepatic toxicity during two periods
(1974 to 1982 and 1986 to 1994).

Their study was presented at the 1995 annual meeting of the International
Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) , held in Paris, France.

Investigations were performed before the beginning of treatment and each 15
days after treatment was begun (during hospitalization).

Of the 1521 patients treated for tuberculosis between 1974 and 1982, 118 had
disturbed hepatic function (7.76 percent).  In the group of 917 children
treated between 1986 and 1994, 29 had disturbed hepatic function (3.16
percent).

Jakovski et al.  found that there were 2.5 times fewer hepatic disturbances in
the second group of patients.  The majority of toxicities occurred in the 0-2
year old age group during both periods.

Combination therapy with isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide was the
treatment regimen which caused the most adverse reactions.

During the second treatment period patients were given hepatoprotective drugs
and toxic reactions were monitored carefully.

In all cases during both treatment periods there was recovery of hepatic
function.

Respiratory Diseases in Children, Skopje, Macedonia.

Prophylaxis (TB)
Isoniazid-Based Therapy Useful Despite Hepatotoxicity


Prophylactic isoniazid therapy is beneficial to all patients with pulmonary
fibrotic lesions compatible with previous tuberculosis (TB), despite the risk
of potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatitis, according to
a report from Switzerland.

The report warns, however, that it is still unclear whether the benefits of
such therapy outweigh possible side-effects.

Tuberculosis reactivation is increased among patients with chest X-rays
showing untreated fibrotic lesions suggestive of healed, previous TB
(so-called fibrotic lesions).

"Prophylactic treatment with a six to 12-month course of isoniazid (INH) has
proven effective in these cases, giving about 70 percent protection rate
against reactivation of TB," researcher F.P.  Sarasin and colleagues wrote
("Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Sequelae:  Which
Patients Up to Which Age?"  Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:394-400).

"Nonetheless, whether the benefit of isoniazid outweighs it potentially
life-threatening side effects (isoniazid-induced hepatitis) in all age groups,
and in patients with coexisting diseases that limit life expectancy such as
severe chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), a frequent clinical situation, remains unstudied."

Earlier studies have focused on recommendations for prophylactic isoniazid
among patients with positive tuberculin skin test reactions only.  None,
however, has specifically addressed recommendations regarding persons with
fibrotic lesions discovered on chest X-ray.

In this study Sarasin et al.  conducted a Markov-based decision analysis model
which balances the risk of recurrent TB against TB-related mortality,
incidence of isoniazid-related hepatitis, and isoniazid-related death.

They also sought to determine the optimal strategy between a six- to 12-month
course of prophylactic isoniazid and therapeutic abstention in different age
groups and in patients with severe coexisting diseases that limit life
expectancy such as CHF or COPD.

"The core of our decision tree was a model representing the natural history of
untreated patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae," Sarasin et al.
wrote.  "Over time, they may die from different age- or gender-related causes,
or develop early or late TB and die from it.  Whether these patients may
benefit from prophylactic isoniazid involves weighing the trade-offs between
the short term risks of isoniazid-related complications and avoidance of TB
reactivation, a benefit that may be accrued over the short or the long term,
depending on when TB occurs."

The Markov decision analysis found that in all groups of patients,
prophylactic isoniazid clearly reduced the number of deaths from tuberculosis,
whereas very few cases died from isoniazid-related toxicity.  However, because
isoniazid-related deaths occur early, and TB-related deaths can occur early or
late, the gain in life expectancy was small.

"Particularly for patients with short survival such as those older than 80
years and those with CHF or COPD, the average gain in life expectancy provided
by prophylactic isoniazid did not exceed on week," Sarasin et al.  wrote.

"When the gains in life expectancy provided by prophylactic isoniazid are
small and may not be considered clinically relevant, the optimal therapeutic
decision becomes a toss-up.  In clinical practice, toss-ups will undoubted be
interpreted differently by the physicians, the patients, and the health care
planners.  While physicians will focus on the patient's attitude toward risk
(risk-aversion versus risk-seeking profile) and on therapeutic observance,
patients will pay much more attention to the quality of life associated with
isoniazid therapy, and specifically the inconvenience of taking medication,
office visits, and laboratory tests.  On the other hand, from the health
planners' vantage point, the potential epidemiologic benefit of preventing
several future TB cases by treating one patient preventively will be the most
important determinant of decision making."

The authors conclude that the usually recommended six- to 12-month course of
prophylactic isoniazid is beneficial to all cohort age groups.  They added,
however, that recommendations should be modulated for the very elderly and
those with severe disease that limits life expectancy.

"For this subgroup of patients, frequently encountered in daily clinical
practice, the decision whether and for how long to give prophylactic therapy
might reasonably be left to the judgement of the individual patient and the
physician," they wrote.

Therapy
Levofloxacin More Active than Ofloxacin in In Vitro Study


The experimental antituberculosis quinolone levofloxacin showed two- to
four-times more antimicrobial activity than ofloxacin in a newly reported in
vitro study from Japan.

"Levofloxacin showed greater activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
phagocytosed in macrophages than ofloxacin," researcher H.  Saito and
colleagues wrote ("In Vitro Antimycobacterial Activity of a New Quinolone,
Levofloxacin," Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:377-380).

Levofloxacin, the optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin, exhibits significant
bactericidal activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase and has a strong antimicrobial
activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

The antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin has been found to be eight to 128
times greater than that of the corresponding D-isomer and approximately twice
as potent as that of ofloxacin.

In earlier studies Saito et al.  reported that some new quinolones including
ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin and sparfloxacin possessed appreciable in
vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activity, especially against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  fortuitum, and M.  leprae.

In this study Saito et al.  examined in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various pathogenic mycobacteria, in particular M.
tuberculosis and M.  avium complex (MAC).

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin for various
mycobacterial species were determined by the agar dilution method using 7H11
medium and compared with those of ofloxacin.  Antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis and M.  intracellulare phagocytosed in
murine peritoneal macrophages was measured in terms of reducing
cell-associated bacterial colony forming units (CFUs).

MICs of levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  marinum, M.
scrofulaceum, M.  avium, M.  intracellulare, M.  fortuitum, and M.  chelonae
were two to four times lower than those of ofloxacin.  Levofloxacin exhibited
higher efficacy in reducing bacterial CFUs in macrophages than ofloxacin.

"The present results showed that in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various mycobacteria was two to four times greater than
that of ofloxacin, in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration values," Saito
et al.  wrote.

Previous investigators have reported that the antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various bacteria other than mycobacteria is generally
twice that of ofloxacin (Hayakawa et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemother
1986;29:163-164; Imamura et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemo 1987;31:325-327
and Tanka et al., J Antimicrob Chemother 1990;26:659-666).

"The difference in in vitro activity of levofloxacin from ofloxacin in these
reports is therefore consistent with that in the present study," Saito et al.
wrote.  "In the case of M.  intracellulare, significant delay of bacterial
growth was caused by levofloxacin added at 1 mg/L, but such efficacy was not
observed for ofloxacin at the same concentration.  Levofloxacin and ofloxacin
at doses of 10 mg/L prevented the bacterial growth during the whole incubation
period.  There were significant differences between these two quinolones in
the efficacy in reducing the intra-macrophage growth of M.  intracellulare."

Transmission (TB)
Primary School Teacher in Amsterdam Infects 19 Students


A primary school teacher with tuberculous laryngitis in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, infected all of his students with tuberculosis (TB) before his
disease was detected.

All 19 children who had been taught by the teacher became infected with TB and
four contracted active disease, according to a report presented at the 1995
Annual Meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (IUATLD), held in Paris, France.

"Three months after the start of the new school year, the notification of
primary tuberculosis in two children of the same primary school urged the
local Municipal Health Service to perform source detection and contact
tracing," researcher S.T.  Keizer and colleagues from The Netherlands' Health
Service wrote in an abstract presented at the IUATLD conference.

Extensive testing was conducted and those with a skin induration of 10 mm or
more were considered infected.  A case of primary tuberculosis was defined as
the combination of a positive Mantoux test and compatible radiographic
findings.

"A teacher was identified as the source case," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "At the
time of detection he was without symptoms, yet his chest X-ray showed typical
infiltration of the left upper lobe and his sputum was Ziehl-Neelsen positive.
His medical history revealed that he had been suffering from severe hoarseness
for three months until a benign growth was removed from his vocal cords during
the summer-holidays.  The pathologist had reported the presence of epithelioid
cell granuloma indicating tuberculosis, but this had not reached the attention
of the otorhinolaryngist."

Nearly one-third of all 99 children at the school were found to be infected
with tuberculosis.

"All 19 children who had been taught by our patient until the summer holidays
were infected," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "Among them were four cases of primary
tuberculosis.  In the group (13 children) that had entered his class after the
summer-holidays only one infection was detected.  It is concluded that this
teacher was extremely infectious during the time he was hoarse from a
tuberculous laryngeal lesion.  The consideration of TB in the differential
diagnosis of laryngeal lesions needs emphasis for individual and for public
health reasons."

Positive Patients."  P.M.  Boiselle, I.  Tocino, R.J.  Hooley, A.S.

Pumerantz, P.A.  Selwyn and V.P.  Neklesa, et al.  New Haven, Connecticut.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To assess the accuracy of
chest radiographic interpretation in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
HIV-positive patients and to identify the frequency with which these
infections mimic each other radiographically.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The
admitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratory
proved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIV
positive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively and
independently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinical
presentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and final
diagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followed
by an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis was
made in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the median
accuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and no
active disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderate
interobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked other
infections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis by
all 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretation
allows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIV
positive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.  In
approximately 10% of cases, these infections may mimic each other
radiographically."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis of abdominal
lymph nodes is in some countries and can be easily misdiagnosed as malignant
lymphoma.  This study evaluates specific imaging criteria for differentiating
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes on contrast
enhanced CT.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The enhanced CT features of 125 sites in
50 patients, including tuberculosis (20 patients) and malignant lymphoma (30
patients) in abdominal lymph nodes, were retrospectively evaluated in a blind
review for the enhancement criteria of morphology, density, and location.
RESULTS:  Approximately 94% of sites of tuberculosis showed a ringlike
enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes, as compared with 4% of the sites of
malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Approximately 55% of the patients with
tuberculosis had a mass of multilocular appearance compared with 4% of the
patients with malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Tuberculosis frequently involved
the mesenteric, omental, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, while malignant
lymphoma frequently involved the retroperitoneal space.  But, the
retroperitoneal lymph nodes under L-2 were involved with tuberculosis in only
8% of the patients, whereas malignant lymphoma involved about 20% (P<.01).
Combining all criteria, reviewers diagnosed tuberculosis correctly in 94%,
with 93% specificity and 95% sensitivity.  CONCLUSION:  The differentiation of
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma can be made with contrast-enhanced CT on
the basis of characteristic enhancement and sites of involved
lymphadenopathy."

Immunology (TB) 
"Regulation of the Human Cellular Immune Response in Tuberculosis."  J.J.
Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemic
immune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayed
type hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, and
in vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.
Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chiefly
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,
depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression of
cytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) function
in autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,
respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) from
virulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)
relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,
TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increased
spontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated
production of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)
reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gamma
expression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppression
and energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restores
PPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,
and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too may
reflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding of
immunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions for
immunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and
monocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serum
and cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosis
patients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,
monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;
and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infected
macrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutually
enhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for a
subunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role for
extracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.
Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominance
of certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine or
DTH skin test."

Infection Control (TB)
"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients complete
treatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factors
concern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatment
outcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, and
health care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patients
and for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIV
infected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality of
treatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the core
Behavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observed
therapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; where
successful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social and
Behavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographic
research has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals about
tuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associate
tuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about the
appropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed about
the cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show the
effectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, and
comprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinic
practices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research is
emerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk to
patients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studies
of treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, with
implications for the education and supervision of physicians who treat
tuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development of
locally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral research
must focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existing
descriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory and
research methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues will
be identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types of
patients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,
and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infection
seek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."

10 proteins requires their aggregation into heptameric structures.  We
describe size-exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation studies that
reveal that while Escherichia coli chaperonin 10 exists as a heptamer, the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis chaperonin 10 is tetrameric in dilute solutions and
in whole M.  tuberculosis lysate.  At high protein concentration and in the
presence of saturating amounts of divalent ions, the protein is heptameric.
Human chaperonin 10 is predominantly heptameric, although smaller oligomers
were detected.  These differences in structural assembly between species may
explain differences in biological activity such as antigenicity.  Using
C-terminal and N-terminal fragments, sequence 1-25 was identified as
indispensable for aggregation.  CD spectroscopy studies revealed that (i) a
minimum at 202-204 nm correlates with aggregation and characterizes not only
the spectrum of the mycobacterial protein, but also those of E.  coli and
human chaperonin 10 proteins; (ii) the interactions between subunits are of
the hydrophobic type; and (iii) the anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet is the
main secondary structure element of subunits in both tetrameric and heptameric

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Biological Chemistry, "The major mycolic acid produced by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis contains two cis-cyclopropanes in the meromycolate chain.  The
gene whose product cyclopropanates the proximal double bond was cloned by
homology to a putative cyclopropane synthase identified from the Mycobacterium
leprae genome sequencing project.  This gene, named cma2, was sequenced and
found to be 52% identical to cma1 (which cyclopropanates the distal double
bond) and 73% identical to the gene from M.  leprae.  Both cma genes were
found to be restricted in distribution to pathogenic species of mycobacteria.
Expression of cma2 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in the cyclopropanation
of the proximal double bond in the alpha(1), series of mycolic acids.
Coexpression of both cyclopropane synthases resulted in cyclopropanation of
both centers, producing a molecule structurally similar to the M.
tuberculosis alpha-dicyclopropyl mycolates.  Differential scanning calorimetry
of purified cell walls and mycolic acids demonstrated that cyclopropanation of
the proximal position raised the observed transition temperature by
3(degree)C.  These results suggest that cyclopropanation contributes to the
structural integrity of the cell wall complex."  The corresponding author for

increasingly important because of greater incidence among immunocompromised

insertion sequence IS6110.  With each of the three pairs of isolates (case and
suspicious case), identical IS6110 banding patterns were found suggesting
identical MTB strains.  Because the patients were geographically separated, it
is strongly suspected that laboratory contamination of M.  tuberculosis

and inhA genes of Isoniazid-Resistant Clinical Isolates of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis."  Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, November

1995;39(11):2472-2477.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy, "Resistance to isoniazid in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis has been associated with mutations in genes encoding the
mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase (katG) and the InhA protein (inhA).  Among
the 26 isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates evaluated in this study,
mutations in putative inhA regulatory sequences were identified in 2
catalase-positive isolates, katG gene alterations were detected in 20 strains,
and 4 isolates had wild-type katG and inhA genes.  Mutations in the katG gene
were detected in all 11 catalase negative isolates:  one frameshift insertion,
two partial gene deletions, and nine different missense mutations were
identified.  An arginine-to-leucine substitution at position 463 was detected
in nine catalase-positive isolates.  However, site-directed mutagenesis
experiments demonstrated that the presence of a leucine at codon 463 did not
alter the activity of the M.  tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase and did not
affect the capacity of this enzyme to restore isoniazid susceptibility to

Protective Effect of Neonatal BCG Correlate with Vaccine-Induced Tuberculin
Reaction?."  American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,

November 1995;152(5):1575-1578.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "A case-control study was conducted
in Saudi Arabia, where the same strain of BCG has been used and surveys had
shown that up to 88% of vaccinated children remain tuberculin negative.
Active cases were obtained by surveying the seven tuberculosis centers in 1
yr.  Control subjects were obtained from a nationwide survey of normal
individuals.  Vaccination in both groups was ascertained by history and BCG
scar.  Relative risk of contracting active tuberculosis in the vaccinated
versus unvaccinated and protection was calculated.  protection was as follows:
age group 5 to 14 yr, 82% (55 to 93%); age group 15 to 24 yr, 67% (55 to 77%);
and age group 25 to 34 yr, 20% (-6 to 37%).  We document the uninterrupted
record of protection by BCG administered in the neonatal period and discuss
the significance of vaccination timing.  We concur with other studies that
protection lapsed after about 20 yr.  More importantly, this is the first
large study that documents a lack of tuberculin sensitivity despite
protection.  This challenges the view that sensitization is essential for
protection and supports the 'two-pathway' theory that BCG vaccination could
trigger either protective (Lister type) or antagonistic (tuberculin or Koch
type) reactions and that the most protective vaccines would have little
tuberculin-sensitizing effect because the two pathways are competitive."  The

Pharmacoeconomics
Castelo, A.; Mathiasi, P.A.; Iunes, R.; Kritski, A.L.; Dalcolmo, M.; Demelo,
F.F.; Drummond, M.  "Cost Effectiveness of Antituberculosis Interventions."
Pharmacoeconomics, November 1995;8(5):385-399.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in
Pharmacoeconomics, "The treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is ranked as the most
cost effective of all therapeutic programmes in terms of cost per year of life
saved.  Nevertheless, TB kills or debilitates more adults aged between 15 and
59 years than any other disease in the world; furthermore, about 2 to 4% of
the burden of disease, 7% of all deaths and 26% of all preventable deaths are
directly attributable to TB.  About one-third of the world's population is
infected with the TB bacillus.  In the developing world, more women of
childbearing age die from TB than from causes directly associated with
pregnancy and childbirth.  The death of adults in their prime, who are
parents, community leaders and producers in most societies, causes a
particularly onerous burden besides being a serious public health problem.  In
the poorest countries, where the magnitude of the TB problem is greatest,
those TB control strategies that are economically feasible tend to be less
effective.  Therefore, in low and middle income countries, cost-effectiveness
considerations aimed at prioritizing resource allocation in the health sector
in general, and in TB control programmes in particular, are of paramount
importance.  Operationally, the main components of a TB control programme are:
(i) detection and treatment of TB; and (ii) prevention of TB through BCG
vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.  Priority should be given to ensuring that
TB patients complete their prescribed course of chemotherapy.  Adequate
treatment is the most effective way of preventing the spread of TB and the
emergence of drug resistance.  This article reviews evidence of the
effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different approaches to TB can,
particularly those that are applicable to low income countries, in both
HIV-infected and noninfected patients.  Financial implications and ways to
implement directly observed therapy for TB in large urban areas are discussed,
and the need to address some relevant operational issues is highlighted.  The
current role of chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination is also reviewed."  The

Screening

"Tuberculin Screening of Trauma Admissions at a University Hospital:  A
Preventive Strategy."  Archives of Surgery, November 1995;130(11):1223-1227.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Archives of
Surgery, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB)
infection in our trauma service population, namely, those patients who had
positive Mantoux (purified protein derivative [PPD] [tuberculin]) tests.
DESIGN:  Prospective study.  SETTING:  Trauma service at a university hospital
in Newark, NJ.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  During a 9-month period, 110 admitted
trauma patients underwent screening for TB.  Of these patients, 20 had
undergone recent PPD tests in the last 6 months, of which nine were positive.
The remaining 90 patients underwent PPD and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin
tests (anergy panel); five patients were unavailable for follow-up.  The
patients also answered questions regarding human immunodeficiency virus
status, risk factors for TB infection, and clinical symptoms.  RESULTS:  The
mean age of the study group was 34 years (age range, 13 to 69 years).
Eighty-four percent of these patients were males who belonged to the high-risk
socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups (poor, nonwhite).  The tests for 15
patients (17%) were newly discovered to be positive for PPD.  Eleven percent
of the patients with negative PPD tests were anergic, thus raising the
percentage of patients with positive PPD tests to 20%.  The human
immunodeficiency virus status was known in only 41% of the total patients.
All patients with positive PPD tests had a chest X-ray film performed; of
these patients, positive findings for TB were determined for one patient.
Another patient had evidence of abdominal TB at laparotomy.  All patients with
positive PPD tests were given appointments in the pulmonary clinic for
follow-up, and only three of 15 patients kept their appointments.
CONCLUSIONS:  Patients who were admitted to the trauma service were
predominantly young males from high-risk groups with a high incidence of TB
infection.  Their admission to the trauma service was a unique opportunity for
screening and implementing existing preventive programs."  The corresponding

"Clinical and Chest Radiographic Features of Tuberculosis Associated with
Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Zimbabwe."  American Journal of Respiratory

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "In the developing world, the
diagnosis of tuberculosis is dependent on clinical and radiologic features as
culture facilities are not readily available.  It has been reported that
tuberculosis in HIV-positive persons can present with atypical clinical and
radiographic features.  The object of this study was to examine how often
atypical features occur in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative persons and
how these findings correspond to sputum-smear findings.  Detailed demographic,
clinical, and chest radiographic features of tuberculosis were assessed in 202
HIV-positive adults and 220 HIV-negative patients admitted consecutively.
Using univariate analysis, several of these features were found to be
significantly associated with being HIV-positive, but after multiple
regression analysis only, age group (15 to 42 yr), a negative tuberculin
response, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and lack of cavitation but not
sputum-smear status remained significant."  The corresponding author for this

Therapy (Hepatotoxicity)
Vandenbrande, P.; Vansteenbergen, W.; Vervoort, G.; Demedts, M.  "Aging and
Hepatotoxicity of Isoniazid and Rifampin in Pulmonary Tuberculosis."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November

1995;152(5):1705-1708.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "We evaluated whether elderly
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and without apparent preexisting liver
disease are at an increased risk to develop hepatotoxicity from an
isoniazid-rifampin regimen and require regular liver function tests in
comparison with younger patients.  We analyzed the data of 131 patients
treated in the period 1980-1985 of whom 64 (49%) were at least 60 yr of age.
Subsequent increases of transaminases (measured weekly for as long as 4 wk
after the start of treatment and later on when symptoms suggestive of
hepatotoxicity occurred) above baseline values were found more frequently in
the elderly (38 versus 18%, P<0.05) and were also more pronounced in them
(P<0.01).  The ratio of the highest transaminase value over the baseline value
was called the transaminase index (TI).  A TI of at least 5 was found in 22%
of elderly and 8% of younger patients (P=NS), but ratios as high as 10 were
mostly asymptomatic and always normalized progressively without treatment
adjustment.  Only symptomatic patients with a TI greater than or equal to 10
(five elderly and three younger) required temporary or definitive treatment
adjustment.  We conclude that repeated liver function test evaluations are
generally unnecessary, except for symptomatic elderly and younger patients
alike, in order to detect those with a TI greater than or equal to 10, thus
requiring drug adjustment."  The corresponding author for this study is:  M

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Gastroenterology, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity
due to isoniazid and rifampin in inner-city patients with active tuberculosis.
DESIGN:  A hospital-based review of 70 consecutive in-patients in a 770-bed,
inner-city hospital.  The patient population is primarily African-American and
Hispanic.  METHODS:  Fifty-eight men and 12 women were followed from 2-12 wk
(median 4 wk).  Patients had to be treated for at least 2 wk to be eligible
for the study.  Patients were excluded if they had been on any
anti-tuberculous or any other hepatotoxic drug during the 2-month period
before their hospitalization.  Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase,
bilirubin, and albumin were obtained at least every 2 wk.  RESULTS:
Hepatocellular toxicity, defined as AST and/or ALT greater than 200 IU/L,
occurred in eight out of 70 (11.4%) patients.  The mean age of these patients
was 38.9 yr (22-58 yr).  Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to
develop hepatotoxicity than those with any other risk factor (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS:  Baseline aminotransferases followed by monitoring may be
necessary in AIDS patients."  The corresponding author for this study is:  LA

ATC PREVAILS ON CAUSATION ISSUE IN MISSISSIPPI TRIAL

    A jury empaneled in the Washington County, MS, Circuit Court on
June 17 returned a defense verdict for American Tobacco Co. in a
long-fought cigarette wrongful death action, determining 11-1 that the
plaintiffs' decedent's death resulted from a blood clot caused by urinary
tract surgery and not his lung cancer or emphysema (Wilks et al. v.
American Tobacco Co. et al., MS Cir. Ct., Washington Cty., No. 91-12,
355(B)(W)).

    After eight days of trial that featured primarily medical testimony,
the jury deliberated for two and a half hours before returning the
verdict.  Anderson Smith's lung cancer was first diagnosed four months
before his death in 1986; no autopsy was ever performed.  The panel also
cleared New Deal Tobacco Co., a regional distributor, of any liability.

    Jeanette Wilks, Smith's daughter, lodged her complaint in November
1987, seeking $17 million in damages from the defendants.  Smith began
smoking ATC's Pall Malls as a teenager when he entered the U.S. Army in
1943.  Smith's habit grew to three packs a day and would endure for 40
years; Smith became mentally incompetent during his tenure in the
Service, and he resided at a V.A. hospital for a number of years.  Wilks'
sister subsequently joined the action as a plaintiff.

    Presiding Judge Eugene M. Bogen would make various significant
rulings during the litigation's course.  In April 1991, he denied summary
judgment to the defense, finding the plaintiffs' risk/utility theory of
recovery to be viable.  This ruling ran contrary to an earlier
determination made in another Mississippi cigarette products suit by
Judge Bogen himself, and the state Supreme Court in 1992 refused to
review the inconsistency.

    Last May, Judge Bogen granted a plaintiffs' motion and held
cigarettes to be defective and unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law
and found their manufacturers to be absolutely liable on product claims.

    Don Barrett of Barrett Law Offices, Lexington, Mississippi, Victor
McTeer of McTeer & Byers, Greenville, Mississippi, and Fred Clark,
Greenwood, Mississippi, represent the plaintiffs.

    James E. Upshaw of Upshaw, Williams, Biggers, Page & Kruger,
Greenwood, Johnny Walls, Greenville, and Bruce Sheffler of Chadbourne &
Parke, New York, represent the American Tobacco Co.

HIGH COURT LETS PRISONER'S 8TH AMENDMENT ETS EXPOSURE SUIT PROCEED

    The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in a 7-2 ruling on June 18 a March
1992 Ninth Circuit opinion and permitted a Nevada inmate to pursue an
Eighth Amendment claim against state prison officials for involuntary
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Helling et al. v. McKinney, U.S.
Sup. Ct., No. 91-1958).

    (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access Service.  Call
1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    William McKinney, who is serving a life sentence in Nevada, filed a
{1983 action in 1987 with the U.S. District Court for the District of
Nevada against officials of the Carson City prison.  McKinney, a
nonsmoker, had a cellmate with a five-pack-a-day habit; his requests to
be housed with a nonsmoking cellmate had been repeatedly denied.

    McKinney had asserted that the unabated ETS exposure had constituted
cruel and unusual punishment; a federal magistrate entered a directed
verdict for the defense in 1989, finding the plaintiff to have no
constitutional right not to be exposed to ETS.  In February 1991, the
Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that McKinney should have been permitted
to enter evidence regarding the level of his ETS exposure and whether
such exposure presented a health risk.

    The prison officials petitioned the Supreme Court in August 1991,
seeking a remand for reconsideration in light of Wilson v. Seiter, a 1991
opinion that established the "deliberate indifference" standard for
prisoners making Eighth Amendment claims.  The high court granted the
petition the following October.

    In March 1992, the Ninth Circuit reinstated its earlier opinion,
holding that Wilson only added an additional element that McKinney would
have to demonstrate to press his action.  The high court granted the
defendants' certiorari petition the following June; oral argument was
heard last Jan. 13.

    Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the court, in which
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John
Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, And David H.
Souter joined.  "Petitioners...submit that unless McKinney can prove that
he is currently suffering serious medical problems caused by exposure to
ETS, there can be no violation of the Eighth Amendment.  That Amendment,
it is urged, does not protect against prison conditions that merely
threaten to cause health problems in the future, no matter how grave and
imminent the threat....

    "We have great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities may not be
deliberately indifferent to an inmate's current health problems but may
ignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause
serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year,"
the court continued.  "We thus reject petitioners' central thesis that
only deliberate indifference to current serious health problems of
inmates is actionable under the Eighth Amendment."

    The court rejected the stance taken by the United States in its
amicus brief that the harm that ETS exposure causes to any one individual
is speculative and that exposure to ETS is not contrary to current
standards of decency.  As well as having to demonstrate that his exposure
has unreasonably endangered his future health, the court stated, McKinney
"must also establish that it is contrary to current standards of decency
for anyone to be so exposed against his will and that prison officials
are deliberately indifferent to his plight."

    The court noted that since the institution of his lawsuit, McKinney
has been transferred to another prison and is no longer housed with a
heavy smoker; and that the Nevada prison system adopted a formal smoking
policy in January 1992.  The court stated that these realities would
weigh against McKinney's ability to demonstrate the elements of his claim.

    Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent in which Justice Antonin
Scalia joined.  "Last term," stated the dissent, "the Court held that the
Eighth Amendment prohibits the use of force that causes a prisoner only
minor injuries....  Today the Court expands the Eighth Amendment in yet
another direction, holding that it applies to a prisoner's mere risk of
injury.  Because I find this holding no more acceptable...I again
dissent."

    Nevada Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa argued on behalf of the
petitioners.

    Cornish F. Hitchcock of Public Citizen Litigation Group, Washington,
DC, argued on behalf of the respondent.

    Deputy U.S. Solicitor General John G. Roberts Jr. argued on behalf of
the amicus curiae.

INDUSTRY SUES EPA IN NC FEDERAL COURT OVER ETS REPORT

    Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and four other industry
entities filed a complaint June 22 in the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of North Carolina against the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, seeking to have the agency withdraw its January 1993
decision and risk assessment classifying environmental tobacco smoke as a
Class A carcinogen (Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp. et
al. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency et al., MD NC, No. 6:93CV370).

    (The complaint is available from Andrews Document Access Service.
Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    Joining the two manufacturers in the suit are Flue-Cured Tobacco
Cooperative Stabilization Corp., a North Carolina cooperative marketing
association that purchases flue-cured tobacco from growers and sells to
manufacturers; the Kentucky-based Council for Burley Tobacco Inc., which
represents growers and sellers of burley tobacco; Universal Leaf Tobacco
Co. Inc., a Virginia processor of leaf tobacco who purchases from growers
and sells to manufacturers; and Gallins Vending Co., a North Carolina
vendor/distributor.  The complainants asserted that they "have been and
will continue to be directly affected and injured by [the] unauthorized
and unlawful decision to classify ETS as a human carcinogen."

    The action, which also named EPA Administrator Carol Browner,
asserted that the Agency's actions were violative of the Radon Gas and
Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986, the Administrative Procedure Act
and the plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.  The
plaintiffs seek a withdrawal of the decision and a declaration that the
classification and risk assessment are arbitrary, capricious, violative
of required procedures and unconstitutional.

    The complaint asserted that the EPA's actions overstepped its mandate
under the Radon Act and violated requirements to consult with specific
advisory committees.  The decision, the complaint asserted, "did have a
substantial impact throughout the country, including but not limited to
compelling increased restrictions on smoking by private entities and all
entities of government."

    The complaint deemed the EPA's conclusions "wrong as a matter of law
and science....  EPA was able to reach its conclusion only by
manipulating and 'cherry-picking' data, ignoring critical statistical
studies and chemical analyses...and generally altering EPA's models,
assumptions and methodologies when use of the Agency's usual models,
assumptions and methodologies would not have supported its conclusions."

    Submitting the complaint were Dewey W. Wells, Keith W. Vaughan and
Jeffrey L. Furr of Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, on behalf of Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and
Universal Leaf Tobacco Co. Inc.; James K. Dorsett Jr. and James D. Blount
of Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan, Raleigh, North
Carolina, on behalf of Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization
Corp., and The Council for Burley Tobacco Inc.; and Richard B. Howington
of Allman Spry Humphreys Leggett & Howington, P.A., Winston-Salem, NC, on
behalf of Gallins Vending Co.

6TH CIR.: NO ERROR IN DISALLOWING ETS EVIDENCE IN MARITIME ASBESTOS SUIT

    The federal trial court which heard the asbestos-exposure claims of
three merchant seamen did not err by preventing the seamen from arguing
that the shipowner-defendants were liable for exposing them to passive
cigarette smoke, as well as asbestos, or by permitting alternate jurors
to participate in jury deliberations, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled June 3  (Smith v. Gulf Oil Co., 6th Cir., No. 91-3034;
Carbone v. American President Lines et al., No. 91-3036/3037; and Reeves
v. American Export Isbrandsten, No. 91-3040.)

    (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access Service.  Call
1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    The claims of the three merchant seamen -- Harry Smith, Joseph
Carbone and Ashton H. Reeves -- were tried with one other case in federal
court in Cleveland in 1990.  In the first phase of a bifurcated trial,
the trial court allowed the shipowner defendants to present evidence of
the seamen's smoking.  The seamen attempted to counter this defense with
evidence that the shipowners had exposed them to dense, secondhand
tobacco smoke aboard ships.  The court, however, refused a request by the
seamen that it rule that a ship laden with tobacco smoke renders a ship
unseaworthy, and it refused another request by the seamen that to
instruct the jury that dense cigarette smoke may support a finding that
the ship was unseaworthy.

    The case was given to a panel of 10 jurors, including four alternates
who were allowed to participate in the deliberations but not to vote.

    The jury found that neither Smith, Carbone nor Reeves suffers from an
asbestos-related injury.  It awarded $166,000 to the fourth claimant,
Moline.  (The judgment in the Moline case was appealed, and the Sixth
Circuit addressed that appeal in a separate opinion earlier this year in
Miller v. American President Lines.)

    In their appeal, Smith, Carbone and Reeves argued that the trial
court had erred in precluding their claim that the presence of tobacco
smoke in the ships rendered the ships unseaworthy and that the shipowners
were negligent in permitting smoking in unventilated areas of the ships.
They also alleged error in the court's decision to allow alternate jurors
to participate in jury deliberations.

    The Sixth Circuit affirmed.  It said that it need not address "the
novel and difficult question whether a shipowner, by virtue of
maintaining a ship dense with cigarette smoke generated by its occupants,
may have breached its Jone Act duty of care or its maritime law duty to
maintain a seaworthy ship" because the seamen never pleaded that theory
of liability.  Instead, the court said, they presented the theory "in an
altogether off-hand manner" during the trial.  "We conclude that the
district court was well within its discretion to eliminate the issue as
unworthy of trial," the panel said.

    The court added that counsel for the seamen suggested that he was
raising the cigarette smoke liability theory only as a "tactical effort"
to persuade defense counsel to drop their smoking defense.  "Here,
counsel [for the seamen] never seriously suggested that he was prepared
to advance this novel arugment with proof," the panel said.

    The court added that it was not deciding whether a properly presented
claim of cigarette-smoke liability would stand as a matter of law.

    With regard to the jury issue, the appeals court said that the record
showed that the parties had stipulated at trial to the unusual
arrangement, albeit after the trial court judge had threatened to
eliminate consolidated trials for other seamen if the plaintiffs refused
to agree to the arrangement.  It noted that the seamen were represented
by able and experienced counsel and that counsel agreed to the jury
arrangement during an off-record conference without the judge's
presence.

    "Based upon this record, we cannot say that the trial judge's strong
words were enough to overcome plaintiffs' counsel's ability to act in the
perceived best interest of his clients," the court said.

    It held that the seamen had waived their right, under FRCP 47(b), to
have the alternate jurors discharged after the jury retires to
deliberate.

    The seamen are represented by the Jacques Admiralty Law Firm in
Detroit, by Merrit Green with Green, Ashley & Wegian in Toledo, Ohio and
by Dean Robb with Robb, Messing & Palmer in Traverse City, MI.

    Defense attorneys involved in the case included Thomas A. Heffernan
and Richard C. Binzley with Thompson, Hine & Flory in Cleveland, David G.
Davies with Ray, Robinson, Hannian & Carle in Cleveland, and William
Tousley Smith with Calfee, Halter & Griswold, also in Cleveland.

HIGH COURT FINDS FOR B&W IN GENERICS WAR ANTITRUST DISPUTE

    The U.S. Supreme Court on June 21 affirmed the Fourth Circuit's May
1992 determination that Brooke Group Ltd. (nee Liggett Group Inc.) could
not sustain its claim under the Robinson-Patman Act against Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp. for predatory pricing in connection with the
generic cigarette war of the mid-1980s.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for a 6-3 majority, accepted the
theoretical viability of Liggett's contention that an oligopolist could
engage in predatory pricing tactics, but found that the plaintiff failed
to prove the level of industry orchestration that such a claim would
require (Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., U.S. Sup.
Ct., No. 92-466).

    (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access Service.  Call
1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    Liggett, whose share of the domestic cigarette market stood at
roughly 2% in 1980, became in that year the first American manufacturer
to enter the black-and-white field.  Within three years, generics came to
account for 65% of Liggett's sales volume; by 1984, Liggett's overall
market share stood at 4%, and the company had 97% of the overall generic
market.

    B&W entered the market in 1984 with black-and-white packaged product,
offering distributors both volume rebates and higher bonuses for stocking
their generics exclusively.  Liggett responded by increasing its rebates;
it would do so four more times to try to beat B&W's terms.  Liggett
shortly thereafter lodged a Lanham Act/Robinson-Patman Act complaint
against B&W in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North
Carolina.

    Following a 115-day trial, the jury found for Liggett in March 1990.
The plaintiff was awarded the costs of engaging in the rebate war, $49.6
million, statutorily trebled to $148.8 million.  Six months later, the
presiding judge granted B&W's motion for JNOV, holding that the plaintiff
had failed to demonstrate that the defendant's practices would injure
competition in the overall U.S. market or that such injury would result
from price discrimination.

    The Fourth Circuit predicated its May 1992 affirmance on the
rationale that, as a member of an oligopoly, B&W could not reasonably
expect to recoup the losses that pursuit of a scheme of predatory pricing
would by necessity involve.

    Justice Kennedy's affirmance was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice
David H. Souter and Justice Clarence Thomas.  "[W]hether the claim
alleges predatory pricing under { 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line
price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act, two prerequisites to
recovery remain the same," wrote the Court.  "First, a plaintiff seeking
to establish competitive injury resulting from a rival's low prices must
prove that the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of
its rival's costs....

    "The second prerequisite," the Court continued, "is a demonstration
that the competitor had a reasonable prospect, or, under { 2 of the
Sherman Act, a dangerous probability, of recouping its investment in
below-costs prices."  The Court stated that in the oligopoly context, the
plaintiff would have to demonstrate that the below-cost prices would
likely cause the plaintiff to leave the market or raise its prices to
supracompetitive levels, and show that the below-costs prices would
result in injury to competition, i.e. that the predator would have to
raise its prices above competitive levels to cover the costs of the
predation.

    "These prerequisites to recovery are not easy to establish," stated
Justice Kennedy, "but they are not artificial obstacles to recovery;
rather, they are essential components of real market injury.... It would
be ironic indeed if the standards for predatory pricing liability were so
low that antitrust suits themselves became a tool for keeping prices
high."

    The Court found the likelihood of predatory pricing by a oligopolist
to be lowest where "there is no express coordination.  Firms that seek to
recoup predatory losses through the conscious parallelism of oligopoly
must rely on uncertain and ambiguous signals to achieve concerted
action.... This anticompetitive minuet is most difficult to compose and
perform, even for a disciplined oligopoly."

    The Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's dismissal of the viability of
predatory pricing occuring within an oligopoly.  "A predatory pricing
scheme designed to preserve or create a stable oligopoly, if successful,
can injure consumers in the same way, and to the same extent, as one
designed to bring about a monopoly.... [W]hen the realities of the market
and the record facts indicate that it has occurred and was likely to have
succeeded, theory will not stand in the way of liability."

    Ultimately, however, the High Court determined that Liggett did not
have a case to take to the jury.  "The record in this case demonstrates
that the anticompetitive scheme Liggett alleged, when judged against the
realities of the market, does not provide an adequate basis for a finding
of liability."  Justice Kennedy found the evidence sufficient to show
that B&W envisioned or anticipated the anticompetitive results of its
actions; that it priced its generics below cost for a year-and-a-half;
and that Liggett sustained losses as a result of that pricing.

    "[H]owever," the Court continued, "[Liggett's] proof is flawed in a
critical respect: The evidence is inadequate to show that in pursuing
this scheme, Brown & Williamson had a reasonable prospect of recovering
its losses from below-costs pricing through slowing the growth of
generics.... [N]o evidence suggests that [B&W] was likely to obtain the
power to raise the prices for generic cigarettes above a competitive
level."

    The Court determined that Liggett's market evidence did not support
its theory of the case.  "[T]he price and output data do not support a
reasonable inference that [B&W] and the other cigarette companies
elevated prices above a competitive level for generic cigarettes.... the
record evidence does not permit a reasonable inference that output would
have been greater without [B&W]'s entry into the generic segment."

    The Court was unmoved by the plaintiff's citation to price behavior
of generic and branded cigarettes through the remainder of the 1980s.
"All of Liggett's data is based upon the list prices of various
categories of cigarettes.  Yet the jury had before it undisputed evidence
that during the period in question, list prices were not the actual
prices paid by consumers...  Liggett's gap data ignores the effect of
'subgeneric' cigarettes... Liggett itself, while supposedly under the
sway of oligopoly power, pioneered this development in 1988".

    The Court held that "rising prices do not themselves permit an
inference of a collusive market dynamic."  Justice Kennedy found
significant that Liggett's own officers had "consistently denied that
they or other firms [priced] their cigarettes through tacit collusion".

    The High Court found that the evidence did not even show a likelihood
of supracompetitive pricing, noting that the industry in 1984 faced a
decline in demand and substantial excess capacity.  "[T]he situation
facing the cigarette companies in the 1980's would have made such tacit
coordination unmanageable," Justice Kennedy determined.

    "We understand that the chain of reasoning by which we have concluded
that Brown & Williamson is entitled to judgment as a matter of law is
demanding," the Court concluded.  "But a reasonable jury is presumed to
know and understand the law, the facts of the case, and the realities of
the market."

    Justice John Paul Stevens authored a dissent in which Justice Byron
R. White and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined.  "The fact that a price
war may not have accomplished its purpose as quickly or as completely as
originally intended," wrote Justice Stevens, "does not immunize conduct
that was illegal when it occurred...

    "That B&W executives were willing to accept [$15 million in losses]
during the entire 18 months is powerful evidence of their belief that
prices ultimately could be 'managed up' to a level that would allow B&W
to recoup its investment," the dissent stated.  "[The majority relies] on
the supposition that an 'anticompetitive minuet is most difficult to
compose and perform, even for a disciplined oligopoly'... I would
suppose, however, that the professional performers who had danced the
minuet for 40 to 50 years would be better able to predict whether their
favorite partners would follow them in the future than would an outsider,
who might not know the difference between Haydn and Mozart."

    Philip Areeda, Cambridge, Massachusetts, argued on behalf of the
petitioner.

    Robert H. Bork, Washington, D.C., argued on behalf of the respondent.

WA SMALL CLAIMS CT. REJECTS EX-SMOKER'S CESSATION CLAIMS AGAINST PM

    Judge Linda Jacke of the Mercer Island County, WA, District Court on
June 22 dismissed as time-barred the small claims suit lodged against
Philip Morris Inc. by a Kirkland design engineer who sought to recoup
$1154 in expenditures incurred as a result of his quitting smoking
(Deskiewicz v. Philip Morris Inc., Mercer Island Cty., WA, Dist. Ct.,
No. 16917).

    Judge Jacke determined that Alfred Deskiewicz Jr.'s claims against PM
began to run in the 1970s, when he first unsuccessfully tried to kick a
Marlboro habit that lasted 34 years.  Deskiewicz, 51, had argued that he
first realized that he was addicted to smoking in 1989; his expenses
represented the costs of doctor's visits, nicotine patches and a health
club membership in order to lose the weight gained after he quit.

    Judge Jacke also determined that the plaintiff failed to prove that
he could not stop smoking without outside aid.  Deskiewicz had made two
unsuccesful attempts at quitting before breaking his habit.

    Mr. Deskiewicz was self-represented.

HIGH COURT: JUDGES SHOULD DECIDE RELIABILITY OF SCIENTIFIC TESTIMONY

    The U.S. Supreme Court on June 28 held that federal judges should be
active gatekeepers charged with insuring that "any and all scientific
testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable"
(Daubert et al. v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., U.S. Sup. Ct.,
No. 92-102).

    (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access Service.  Call
1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    The Supreme Court case involved Jason Daubert and Eric Schuller, who
were born with severe and permanent limb-reduction birth defects.  In
1984, their parents, individually and as guardians ad litem
(collectively, Daubert), filed suit in California state court against
Merrell Dow, alleging that the birth defects had been caused by the
company's anti-nausea drug Bendectin, which each child's mother had taken
during the limb-development phase of pregnancy.  Eight experts testified
in support of the allegation that Bendectin had caused both sets of limb
defects.  Merrell Dow elected to remove the cases to the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of California, based on diversity of
citizenship.

    After preliminary discovery, Merrell Dow moved for summary judgment
on the issue of causation, claiming there exists no scientific proof that
Bendectin causes birth defects and, therefore, it could not have caused
the birth defects at issue in this case.  The district court granted
summary judgment on the basis that none of Daubert's expert testimony was
admissible "because it lacks the sufficient foundation necessary under
[Federal Rule of Evidence] 703."  The evidence was excluded on the basis
that either:  (1) the testimony excluded epidemiological data, or (2) the
testimony included epidemiological data but the expert did not cite a
specific, published, peer-reviewed study that, considered in isolation,
proves causation with "statistical significance," i.e., 95% certainty.

    Daubert appealed, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, advancing its own
ground for excluding Daubert's expert testimony.  Citing Frye v. Unites
States (293 F. 1013, 1014 [DC Cir. 1923]), the court held that expert
opinion based on a scientific technique is admissible only if it is
generally accepted as a reliable technique among the scientific community.

    Daubert filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme
Court, which granted certiorari on Oct. 13.  During a March 30 hearing,
Michael H. Gottesman, professor of law at the Georgetown University
School of Law, argued the case for Daubert.  He urged the court to permit
expert testimony based on animal studies, cell studies, chemical
composition studies and the re-analysis of epidemiological studies.  He
claimed the Ninth Circuit incorrectly adopted a requirement that
scientific evidence appear in peer-reviewed journals.  He said the
correct law, the Federal Rules of Evidence, would allow the evidence to
be admitted.

    Former Solicitor General Charles Fried, currently a law professor at
the Harvard University College of Law, argued the case for Merrell Dow.
He called 'scientific knowledge,' as used in Rule 702, "that body of
propositions which have been produced by the methods and procedures of
science."  He contended Daubert's propositions "have not been produced by
the methods and procedures of science."

    In an opinion written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Supreme Court
said that the trial judge must determine at the outset whether an expert
is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist
the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact is issue.  It said,
"This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or
methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of
whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the
facts in issue.  We are confident that federal judges possess the
capacity to undertake this review.  Many factors will bear on the
inquiry, and we do not presume to set out a definitive checklist or test."

    But the court did find some general observations to be appropriate.
"Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a
theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of
fact will be whether it can be (and has been) tested....  Another
pertinent consideration is whether the theory or technique has been
subjected to peer review and publication.  Publication (which is but one
element of peer review) is not a sine qua non of admissibility; it does
not necessarily correlate with reliability,...and in some instances
well-grounded but innovative theories will not have been published....
Some propositions, moreover, are too particular, too new, or of too
limited interest to be published.  But submission to the scrutiny of the
scientific community is a component of 'good science,' in part because it
increases the likelihood that substantive flaws in methodology will be
detected....  The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a
peer-reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive,
consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular
technique or methodology on which an opinion is premised....
Additionally, in the case of a particular scientific technique, the court
ordinarily should consider the known or potential rate of error,...and
the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's
operation," the court said.

    "Finally," the panel continued, "'general acceptance' can yet have a
bearing on the inquiry....  Widespread acceptance can be an important
factor in ruling particular evidence admissible, and 'a known technique
that has been able to attract only minimal support within the
community'...may properly be viewed with skepticism.  The inquiry
envisioned by Rule 702 is, we emphasize, a flexible one....  Throughout,
a judge assessing a proffer of expert scientific testimony under Rule 702
should always be mindful of other applicable rules.  Rule 703 provides
that expert opinions based on otherwise inadmissible hearsay are to be
admitted only if the facts or data are 'of a type reasonably relied upon
by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon
the subject.'  Rule 706 allows the court at its discretion to procure the
assistance of an expert of its own choosing.  Finally, Rule 403 permits
the exclusion of relevant evidence 'if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of
the issues, or misleading the jury....'"

    The court addressed Merrell Dow's concerns that abandonment of
"general acceptance" as the exclusive requirement for admission will
result in a "free-for-all" in which befuddled juries are confounded by
absurd and irrational pseudoscientific assertions.  It said, in this
regard, Merrell Dow "seems to us to be overly pessimistic about the
capabilities of the jury, and of the adversary system generally.
Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and
careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and
appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence....
Additionally, in the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla
of evidence presented supporting a position is insufficient to allow a
reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is
true, the court remains free to direct a judgment....  These conventional
devices, rather than wholesale exclusion under an uncompromising 'general
acceptance' test, are the appropriate safeguards where the basis of
scientific testimony meets the standards of Rule 702."

    The court added, "We recognize that in practice, a gatekeeping role
for the judge, no matter how flexible, inevitably on occasion will
prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights and innovations.
That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence
designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic understanding but for
the particularized resolution of legal disputes."

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a partial dissent.  "I do
not doubt that Rule 702 confides to the judge some gatekeeping
responsibility in deciding questions of the admissibility of proffered
expert testimony.  But I do not think it imposes on them either the
obligation or the authority to become amateur scientists in order to
perform that role.  I think the Court would be far better advised in this
case to decide only the questions presented, and to leave the further
development of this important area of the law to future cases," he said.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS $10 MILLION WV PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD

    The U.S. Supreme Court on June 25 affirmed the determination of West
Virginia's highest court that a $10 million punitive damage award granted
by a jury on a $19,000 slander of title claim was not violative of the
14th Amendment's Due Process Clause (TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance
Resources Group et al., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 92-479).

    (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access Service.  Call
1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    The litigation arose from the petitioner TXO Production Corp.'s 1984
decision to obtain the rights to develop oil and gas resources on a
1000-acre West Virginia tract.  TXO approached the rightsholder Alliance
Resources Group with an offer of $20 per acre and a 22% royalty on all
oil and gas revenues in exchange for Alliance's interests; Alliance
accepted the offer in 1985, agreeing to return all consideration paid if
its title was found invalid.

    TXO's lawyers subsequently uncovered a 1958 deed executed by
Alliance's predecessor in interest that conveyed interests in mining
rights.  TXO's lawyers spoke to the recipient of the deed, and his
subsequent transferees, and all understood that the deed solely applied
to mine coal.  The 1958 deed stated on its face that the conveyor
retained all oil and gas rights.

    Despite this knowledge, TXO thereafter apprised Alliance that a
"distinct possibility or probability" existed that its title was flawed.
TXO obtained a quitclaim deed to the mineral rights from the last
deedholder, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade the recipient of the
1958 deed to sign a false affidavit indicating that the deed might
contemplate oil and gas rights.

    TXO thereafter sought to renegotiate the agreement, and filed the
instant suit after negotiations failed.  The McDowell County Circuit
Court rejected TXO's claims; moreover, a jury found for Alliance on its
counterclaim for slander of title.  Among the evidence before the jury
was TXO's knowledge of the validity of Alliance's title; the bad faith in
which TXO acted by challenging the title; the large size of TXO and its
parent company; that the anticipated revenues (and royalties) were
substantial; and TXO's comparable behavior in other business dealings.
The jury based its $19,000 actual damages award on Alliance's defense
costs.

    The trial court denied TXO's J.N.O.V. and remittitur motions, and TXO
appealed to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, arguing the
punitive award as unconstitutional per the U.S. Supreme Court's 1991
holding in Pacific Mutual Life v. Haslip.

    The state high court rejected the appeal, finding the award supported
by each factor in its recognized "reasonable relationship" test, i.e.,
the potential harm TXO's actions could have caused; the maliciousness of
TXO's actions; and the penalty necessary to discourage similar conduct in
the future.

    "The parties' desire to formulate a 'test' for determining whether a
particular punitive award is 'grossly excessive' is understandable,"
wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in an opinion joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justice Harry A. Blackmun.  "Under respondents'
rational basis standard, apparently any award that would serve the
legitimate state interest in deterring or punishing wrongful conduct, no
matter how large, would be acceptable....

    "On the other hand, we reject the premise underlying TXO's invocation
of heightened scrutiny," the court continued.  "[I]n determining whether
a particular award is so 'grossly excessive' as to violate the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ...we return to what we said
two Terms ago in Haslip:  'We need not and indeed we cannot, draw a
mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the
constitutionally unacceptable that would fit in every case.'"

    In response to the petitioner's emphasizing that the punitive award
was 526 times the amount of the actual damages, the court wrote that it
has "eschewed an approach that concentrates entirely on the relationship
between actual and punitive damages.  It is appropriate to consider the
magnitude of the potential harm that the defendant's conduct would have
caused to its intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded, as well
as the possible harm to other victims that might have resulted if similar
future behavior were not deterred....

    "While petitioner stresses the shocking disparity between the
punitive award and the compensatory award," the court continued, "that
shock dissipates when one considers the potential loss to respondents, in
terms of reduced or eliminated royalties payments, had petitioner
succeeded in its illicit scheme."

    The court refused to find the award "grossly excessive" in light of
"the amount of money potentially at stake, the bad faith of petitioner,
the fact that the scheme employed in this case was part of a larger
pattern of fraud, trickery and deceit, and petitioner's wealth."

    TXO had argued that, unlike in Haslip, the jury was instructed to
take "the wealth of the perpetrator" into account in arriving at the
punitive award; this distinction did not alter the majority's final
analysis.  "[I]n Haslip we referred to the 'financial position' of the
defendant as one factor that could be taken into account in assessing
punitive damages....  We also note that TXO did not squarely argue in the
West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals that these aspects of the jury
instruction violated the Due Process [Clause], possibly because many
States permit the jury to take account of the defendant's wealth," the
court stated.

    The court was unmoved by the criticism engendered by the West
Virginia high court's drawing of distinction between classes of "really
mean" and "really stupid" defendants in weighing a punitive award.  "That
those terms played little, if any, part in [the West Virginia Supreme
Court's] actual evaluation of the propriety of the damages award is
evident from the reasoning in its thorough opinion....  Moreover, two
members of the court who wrote separately to disassociate themselves from
the 'really mean' and 'really stupid' terminology shared the views of the
rest of the members of the court on the merits."

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who concurred in part and concurred in
the judgment, wrote separately to state that he "was not in full
agreement [with] the plurality's discussion of the substantive
requirements of the Due Process Clause....  To ask whether a particular
award of punitive damages is grossly excessive begs the question:
excessive in relation to what?  The answer excessive in relation to the
conduct of the tortfeasor may be correct, but it is unhelpful, for we are
still bereft of any standard by which to compare the punishment to the
malefaction that gave rise to it."

    Justice Antonin Scalia, who concurred in the judgment, wrote a
separate opinion in which Justice Clarence Thomas joined.  Justice Scalia
stated that the plurality "makes explicit what was implicit in Haslip:
the existence of a so-called 'substantive due process' right that
punitive damages be reasonable....  I am willing to accept the
proposition that the Due Process [Clause] incorporates certain
substantive guarantees specified in the Bill of Rights; but I do not
accept the proposition that it is the secret repository of all sorts of
other, enumerated, substantive rights."

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a lengthy dissent that was joined
by Justice Byron R. White and in part by Justice David H. Souter.  "In
[Haslip]," the dissent stated, "this Court held out the promise that
punitive damages award would receive sufficient constitutional scrutiny
to restore fairness in what is rapidly becoming an arbitrary and
oppressive system.  Today the Court's judgment renders Haslip's promise a
false one."

    "The procedures that converted this commercial dispute into a $10
million punitive verdict," the dissent continued, "were wholly
inadequate.  Rather than producing a judgment founded on verifiable
criteria, they produced a monstrous award....  In my view, due process
does not tolerate such cavalier standards when so much is at stake."

    Carter Phillips of Sidley & Austin, Washington, DC, argued the case
for the petitioner.

    Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard University Law School argued the case
for the respondents.

MARYLAND APPEALS CT. FINDS NO REVERSIBLE ERROR IN CANCER-FEAR EVIDENCE

    The Maryland Court of Special Appeals on April 28 affirmed a $407,224
judgment against Keene Corp. in an asbestosis case after rejecting
Keene's arguments that the trial court had erred in admitting evidence of
the claimant's fear of cancer and that the claimant presented
insufficient evidence to overcome Keene's state-of-the-art defense (Keene
Corp. v. Lewis, MD Ct. of Special App., Sept. Term 1992, No. 1479).

    (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access Service.  Call
1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

    Plaintiff William Lewis alleges asbestosis from exposure to asbestos
while working as a sheet metal worker at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard in
Baltimore between 1942 and 1944.

    His original suit against 16 defendants alleged mesothelioma and
asbestosis, but the claim of mesothelioma was withdrawn after he learned
that it had been misdiagnosed.  Before the trial, Keene sought to prevent
all references to cancer or mesothelioma.  The trial court denied the
motion to the extent that it would have precluded all evidence concerning
Lewis' fear or emotional distress at the prospect of contracting cancer,
but it also ruled that evidence concerning the prospect of Lewis'
contracting cancer would not be allowed absent evidence of the medical
probability of contracting the disease.

    The case went to trial against Keene only.  The jury found Keene
liable on Lewis' strict liability claim and awarded him $402,224 in
compensatory damages, and awarded his wife $5,999 for loss of
consortium.

    Keene appealed, arguing that the court erred in allowing references
to cancer and evidence of Lewis' fear of cancer and in submitting the
strict liability claim to the jury.

    Affirming, the appeals court noted that the record of the trial
contains 79 scattered references to the word "cancer" and 41 references
to the word "mesothelioma."  But, it refused to regard these "incidental
references" as grounds for reversing, observing that the both plaintiff's
counsel and the court had told the jury that Lewis was making no claim
for present or future cancer.

    The court said that it could locate no testimony by Lewis in the
record concerning a current fear of cancer; the only testimony it could
locate concerned his relief upon learning that his mesothelioma had been
misdiagnosed.  "The only evidence that the jury heard in this regard was
essentially positive -- that Mr. Lewis did not have cancer and that he
was making no claim for either present or future cancer.  He gave no
testimony as to any present emotional distress but expressed only his
delight in knowing that he was 'going to be here for a while,'" the court
observed.

    "In summary, then, we do not see in this record a sufficient
intrusion of inappropriate evidence to require reversal."

    The court also rejected Keene's argument that Lewis presented
insufficient evidence to show that, at the time of his exposure in the
early 1940s, it had or should have known that its product, as used in the
shipyards where he worked, was sufficiently dangerous to require a
warning.

    The court simply reviewed the relevant state-of-the-art testimony
from Kenneth Nelson and from Lewis, and concluded that it was sufficient
to show that the product was dangerous when used in ships on which Lewis
worked, that Keene should have known of its danger to shipyard workers by
February 1943, and that it failed to warn Lewis and others in his
position of the danger.

    Lewis is represented by Shepard Hoffman and Deboarh Hines with
Connerton, Ray & Simon in Washington, DC, and by G. Mitchel Mowell of
Chestertown, Maryland.  Keene is represented by Ford Davis and John
Billmyer with Whiteford, Taylor & Preston in Baltimore.

Encephalitis
Microsphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis Vaccine


Mouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against a
deadly form of viral encephalitis.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the family
Togaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infections
during epizootics among horses.

The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidad
donkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans and
animals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidence
suggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,
there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.

The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.
While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuated
vaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.

Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEE
virus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported their
results in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses to
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"
Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20).

"The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responses
which were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virus
vaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was more
effective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective against
systemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."

Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as a
means of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to see
the potential benefits of this technology.

"Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number of
inoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oral
vaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieve
immune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center for
Immunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,
January 1994;12(1):5-11).

Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams have
shown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effective
vehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered either
mucosally or systemically.

Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe in
humans.

Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEE
virus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that of
free virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.

Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yielded
anti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.

When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received a
second booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stable
throughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane only
in mice boosted with free virus.

"At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared with
either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducing
specific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondary
immunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5
(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processed
microspheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary and
secondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced the
immunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during the
microencapsulation procedure."

In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better than
non-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres.

"Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior to
microencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhanced
the immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhanced
conformational stability," they wrote.

In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5
(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survived
challenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received the
free virus vaccine survived challenge.

"At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccines
afforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigen
resulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival in
a second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote.

"These results, taken together with the protection results after secondary
immunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicate
that a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could afford
protection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the free
virus vaccine."

The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulated
VEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosol
challenge with virulent VEE virus.

Emerging Diseases
Could Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?


Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animals
are imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) researchers warn.

Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only one
or two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domestic
animals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recent
programs to vaccinate wild animals.

This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention program
costs an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expenses
per year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recent
publication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public Health
Concern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).

But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.
are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidental
or intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise the
animal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from various
species of bats.

"Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccine
failures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter of
potentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequently
established in susceptible bat populations."

Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically related
negative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are the
rhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and some
isolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:

* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.
suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was first
isolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outside
Ibadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.
Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Central
African Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented human
infections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.

* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.
Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, in
Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, and
Ethiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginal
protection.

* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but is
suspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, South
Africa who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by a
bat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.
Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human case
was documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus has
been found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have been
identified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus was
first identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of a
rabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domestic
animals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

"The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New World
mitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy bats
without human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, several
recent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer of
rabies-infected bats."

These events include:

* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in research
facilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosed
with rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild big
brown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died of
rabies.

* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on a
container ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.

* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permits
in 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptian
tomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or their
offspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions or
zoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normally
subjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported bats
to prevent contact with humans.

"Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,
active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.
warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the area
that extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,
and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in a
wide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction with
other Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolon
helvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of these
species have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa.

"The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern because
of the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,
particularly in the southern United States."

Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to the
United States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior to
European colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxes
for the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.

When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillance
revealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 human
deaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960
rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.

From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but they
were then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infected
animals from southern states.

Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies has
changed.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after a
known exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975
advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in people
who had no history of an animal bite.

"Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that was
unrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"
Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has also
changed:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involved
rabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."

As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.
noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000
submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after the
epizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state.

"The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000
to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability
of rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.

"What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account the
psychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequent
euthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.
Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the United
States, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."

Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue strongly
against population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,
economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programs
for wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC.

"Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is an
integral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,
where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5
million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabies
incidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for human
rabies."

However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required an
extensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective for
foxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes.

"In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine was
developed that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons and
various other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improved
thermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.
"When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact with
them by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,
studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,
or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate species
examined."

An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, New
Jersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baits
laced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and by
helicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantly
reduced.

Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there are
many questions yet to be answered:

* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?

* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?

* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?

* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabies
control in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?

* Who will fund these programs over time?

* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?

"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue of
extending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing world
will be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.

Cancer Vaccines (Pancreatic Carcinoma)
Vaccination with Mutant Ras Peptides Induces T-Cell Response


Pancreatic carcinoma patients carrying a ras mutation exhibited T-cell
responsiveness after vaccination with the corresponding mutant RAS peptides.

Because CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for a single ras mutation have been
described, and because mutant p21 RAS can be recognized by human T cells,
mutant p21 RAS represents an exclusive tumor-specific antigen.  These findings
suggest that RAS peptide vaccination of cancer patients with a verified ras
mutation might be used as a specific immunotherapy.

Marianne K.  Gjertsen et al.  vaccinated pancreatic cancer patients exhibiting
a ras mutation with a synthetic RAS peptide in an effort to influence the
clinical course of the disease ("Vaccination with Mutant RAS Peptides and
Induction of T-Cell Responsiveness in Pancreatic Carcinoma Patients Carrying
the Corresponding ras Mutation," The Lancet, November 25,
1995;346(8987):1399-1400).

"Results indicate that specific T-cell responses against mutations uniquely
harbored in tumor cells can be induced in cancer patients by vaccination,"
stated Gjertsen et al.

Five patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
with ras mutations were enrolled in this clinical trial.  Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (1-4x10(9)) were collected by leukapheresis and loaded with
a synthetic RAS peptide encompassing residues 5-21 of p21 RAS and
corresponding to the mutation in the patients tumor tissue.

Patients were vaccinated on day 0 and boosted on days 14 and 35.  Additional
boosters were given every 4-6 weeks.  None of the patients exhibited any toxic
reactions or side-effects after vaccination.

None of the patients exhibited T-cell responsiveness to any of the RAS
peptides tested before the protocol started, although they showed normal
T-cell responses against other test antigens.  Two of the five patients
exhibited T-cell response to RAS peptides in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells around day 40 after the onset of the vaccination protocol,
noted the authors.

The T-cell response was transient, and disappeared during the following weeks.
Repeated vaccinations did not result in a reappearance of detectable
responding T cells in the peripheral blood.

Although puzzled at first by the lack of detectable T-cell response, the
authors determined that the tumor-specific T cells elicited by RAS peptide
vaccination were homing to the tumor and being selectively removed from
circulation.

No major therapeutic response was observed in the any of the patients,
including the two who exhibited brief T-cell responses.  The authors felt that
this was due to the terminal stage of the disease in the patients.  All the
patients had large tumor burdens and progressively deteriorating immune
systems, with life expectancies of only three to four months.

Tumor tissue taken from the two responding patients after they died showed
that lymphocyte infiltration was prominent and was mainly constituted by T
cells.  This finding was compatible with the explanation that the RAS-specific
T cells elicited by the vaccination may have homed in to the tumors of these
patients, noted the authors.

They also noted that vaccination by a single tumor-specific epitope may not be
sufficient in these circumstances as the therapeutic vaccine may have been too
little, too late.  Ongoing studies in patients with minimal residual disease
could provide a clinical setting allowing for more careful evaluation of
immune responses and the potential for clinical benefits of RAS peptide
vaccine, noted the authors.

"Our method for vaccination is novel," concluded Gjertsen et al.  "We injected
large amounts of peptide-pulsed mononuclear cells.  The rational is that a
fraction of these cells (i.e., pulsed dendritic cells and monocytes) will end
up in lymphoid organs, where the actual T-cell stimulation will take place.
Two and three rounds of vaccination seemed to be sufficient to break the state
of unresponsiveness to the mutant RAS peptides in [the two] patients [who
responded]."

This study was an extension of preliminary research done by these same authors
which was presented at the International Symposium on Cancer Vaccines, held
October 3-5, 1994.  At that time, they stated "Our results indicate that
immunotherapy targeted against neoplastic cells carrying ras mutations is
possible, and a protocol based on loading professional antigen presenting
cells with synthetic RAS peptides is currently being tested in a clinical
setting."

This research was supported by the Norwegian Cancer Society, the Norwegian
Research Council for Science and the Humanities, and Pronova, Norway.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

HBV Vaccines
Hepatitis Screening/Vaccination Needed in Hong Kong


Hepatitis screening and vaccination programs are desperately needed for
students in Hong Kong, according to a report from the University of Hong Kong.

Researcher Ian B.  Marshall wrote that similar programs should be recommended
for students from Southeast Asia who attend overseas colleges and
universities, including those in the United States ("Screening and Vaccination
for Hepatitis B in Hong Kong University Students," College
Health,1995;44:59-62).

Hepatitis B is endemic in Chinese populations in Hong Kong, with an overall
prevalence of hepatitis B markers of 49.9 percent and an antigen carrier rate
of 9.5 percent.  Ninety percent of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) occurs in
carriers of hepatitis B.

"In spite of improvements in treatment, HCC is still the second most common
cause of all cancer deaths in Hong Kong," Marshall wrote.  "Carriers are also
at risk of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; combined, these two conditions
are the 10th leading cause of all deaths in the community.

"Active immunization against hepatitis B is safe and effective, with only
minor local and general reactions.  Protective antibody levels are produced in
88 percent to 100 percent of healthy adults who receive a three-dose course of
vaccination.  Because of this high level of seroconversion and presumed
immunogenicity, routine postvaccination testing is not recommended."

In this report Marshall evaluated a campaign to promote screening and
vaccination for hepatitis B in students at the University of Hong Kong.
Students entering the program appeared to have been highly motivated to
receive vaccination and responded well to a mailed recall.

Ninety-eight percent of those eligible had the first dose of vaccine, and more
than 96 percent completed the full course of three vaccinations.  The
prevalence of hepatitis B antigen was 3.59 percent; male students showed
significantly higher prevalence (4.48 percent) than female students (2.97
percent).  Hepatitis B surface antibody prevalence was the same in both sexes
(11.8 percent).

"These levels are about one third the prevalence levels found in the same age
group in the general population in Hong Kong," Marshall wrote.  "It is
recommended that students at secondary schools and postsecondary education
institutions in Hong Kong be offered serological screening and vaccination for
Hepatitis B.  A similar policy is recommended for students from Southeast Asia
who attend overseas colleges and universities including those in the United
States."

Marshall wrote that further studies are needed to assess the effect such a
policy would have in reducing the prevalence rates for hepatitis B markers in
older age groups.

"Significant numbers of young people from Southeast Asian countries, where
prevalence levels for hepatitis B are similar to those in Hong Kong, study in
colleges and universities overseas, particularly in North America, Australian,
and the United Kingdom.  Foreign students studying in the United States have
also been identified as being at higher risk for hepatitis B.  Unless students
from Southeast Asia can provide a vaccination record or laboratory evidence of
immunity, they should be screened for hepatitis B markers before they enter
postsecondary education programs overseas.  HBsAg carriers should be
counseled, and their susceptible household and sexual contacts should receive
hepatitis vaccination, as should those foreign students who test negative for
hepatitis B markers."

Services at the University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.

Human Papillomavirus (Vaccine Design)
VLPs from One Variant May Help To Prevent Infection


The finding that two human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) variants are
serologically cross-reactive is encouraging news for the development of a
genital HPV vaccine.

Grace Cheng, U.S.  National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland and
colleagues from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, Georgia, and the Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark, set out
to find whether DNA sequence variants of HPV-16 are distinct serotypes.

Cheng et al.  compared the reactivities of women's sera from Zaire (n=97) and
Denmark (n=123) ("Divergent Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Variants Are
Serologically Cross-Reactive," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1584-1587).

For the comparison, they used IgG-specific ELISAs based on virus-like
particles (VLPs) composed of the L1 major capsid protein derived from an
HPV-16 variant commonly found in central Africa (Z-1194) or from a variant
that is common in northern Europe (114K).  Z-1194 was isolated in Zaire from a
woman with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and who also was positive for
HIV.

"We have found that among the 220 women whose sera were tested, almost all who
had a serologic response to one HPV-16 L1 variant also responded to the
other," wrote Cheng et al.  "Therefore we conclude that strains 114K and
Z-1194 are serologically cross-reactive and likely belong to the same
serotype.  This is the case despite a relatively large number of amino acid
differences in the major capsid proteins of the two strains."

The L1s differed in seven amino acids.  In only one serum sample did the
researchers see evidence for a specific reaction to only one, and not the
other VLP variant.

If data from future research studies, which apply other L1 variants and other
sets of sera, substantiate the current findings, this would have several
implications.

The first such implication would be that the lack of serotypic divergence
would suggest individual genital HPV types have not undergone the type of
antigenic drift (such as that seen in influenza viruses) that changes
seroreactivity to virons.

"This implies either that changes in the major seroreactive virion epitopes
cannot be tolerated or that neutralizing antibodies do not play a dominant
role in controlling genital HPV infection under natural conditions," wrote
Cheng et al.

The results also suggest that an ELISA which is based on a single VLP variant
could be applied for evaluating HPV-16 infection in different populations.

"Finally, these results are encouraging from the point of view of developing a
genital HPV vaccine, since they suggest that VLPs from a single HPV-16 variant
might be effective worldwide in preventing HPV-16 infection," Cheng et al.
wrote.

Many of the nucleotide sequence variants of HPV-16 that have been identified
have been isolated in separate geographic areas (Chan et al., J Virol,
1992;66:2057-2066 and 5714-5725; Ho et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6413-6423).

Reinhard Kirnbauer, a co-author of the current report, and colleagues have
performed numerous VLP-based ELISA studies to investigate HPV-16 infection
(Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1992;89:12180-12184; J Virol, 1993;67:6923-6936; J
Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-504).

Immunology
Discovery of Tumor Antigens Facilitated by Novel Process


Elusive tumor antigens can't hide from SEREX (serological identification of
antigens by recombinant expression cloning).

The success of recombinant tumor vaccines and other immunotherapeutic
modalities in cancer patients is dependent upon the immune systems recognition
of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens.  In spite of extensive
efforts to identify tumor antigens in human neoplasms at the molecular level,
too few have actually been pinpointed.

Ugur Sahin et al.  modified the strategy of autologous typing to allow for an
unbiased search, in addition to the direct molecular definition of,
immunogenic tumor proteins based on their reaction with autologous patient
sera ("Human Neoplasms Elicit Multiple Specific Immune Responses in the
Autologous Host," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5,
1995;92(25):11810-13).

"By applying this strategy of SEREX to four unselected human tumors of
different origin, we discovered an unexpected frequency of tumor antigens that
elicit specific immune responses in the autologous host," stated Sahin et al.
"Since the molecular definition of tumor antigens by SEREX of tumor cDNA is
fast and has a high yield, it may make sense to first define tumor antigens by
SEREX and then to analyze their role in T-cell immunity.  Such a strategy
could provide a rapidly expanding basis for additional approaches to the
immunotherapy and gene therapy of human neoplasms."

The cDNA libraries from diagnostic biopsies of four patients with malignant
melanoma, brain tumor, renal cancer, and Hodgkin disease, were expressed in E.
coli.  In order to test for clones expressing antigens against which the
autologous patient had specific antibodies, 1x10(6) recombinant clones from
each tumor cDNA were screened.  An ELISA modified for the exclusive detection
of human IgG antibodies was used.

Of the 5x10(6) clones tested, 109 were found to be reactive with IgG
antibodies in the serum sample of the autologous patient.  Cross-hybridization
experiments determined that the 109 positive clones contained 24 different
inserts.  From four patients, 24 different antigens were discovered, noted the
authors.

The autologous typing strategy that was modified by the authors was first
developed by L.J.  Old and reported in the 1981 issue of Cancer Research,
41:361-75.

In order to determine the occurrence of antibodies against these newly defined
tumor antigens, different tumor patients and healthy controls donated blood
for testing against these antigens.  Antibodies against the tumor antigens
were detected at varying rates only in patients with the same type of tumor.

The authors noted that the definition of 24 antigens in four tumors of
different origin suggests that the analysis of B-cell responses against other
tumors of the same or new types may identify an unexpected abundance of human
tumor antigens.  Their results suggested that tumor immunogenicity in the
autologous host is a common phenomenon and not restricted to malignant
melanomas.

In addition, the immunogenicity of human tumors seems not to be due to the
expression of a single antigen, but is conferred by multiple antigens.  Their
observation that antibodies against the new antigens could only be found in
the sera of patients bearing the same type of tumor suggested that tumor
growth is essential for the development of a humoral immune response against
the respective tumor antigens, and that antibody production is not an
autoimmune effect elicited by tumor-independent mechanisms.

The authors noted that their study was different from other studies which used
sera to detect antibodies.  Other studies have relied on low-titer serum
antibodies or human monoclonal antibodies generated in vitro from patients'
lymphocytes.  Theirs, on the other hand, uses a stringent serological
detection system which is limited to antigens that elicit high-titer IgG
responses in the patient in vivo.

"According to our data, overexpression of antigens in the tumor compared to
normal tissues seems to be the most common reason for immunogenicity,"
concluded Sahin et al.  "Our observation that tumor antigens defined by T-cell
responses such as MAGE-1 and tyrosinase can also be detected by the
serological approach suggest that an integrated immune response against tumor
antigens may exist that involves both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as well as B
cells."

Survival Improvement Shown in Breast Cancer Trial with Theratope


Dr.  Grant MacLean, Medical Oncologist and principal investigator for
Biomira's clinical study at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada, presented results of Biomira's Phase II clinical trials of Theratope
therapeutic vaccine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

The meeting "Novel Vaccine Strategies:  Immunotherapeutic Strategies for
Cancer" Conference was held in San Diego, California.  Theratope is a
non-toxic therapy designed to stimulate the immune system of cancer patients
to respond against the cancer.  The study was conducted over a 2-1/2 year
period at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton and Guy's Hospital in London,
United Kingdom (U.K.).

Among 48 women in a randomized clinical trial, MacLean reported that 24 who
received Theratope in its standard investigational program had a statistically
significant increase in survival over 24 women in the other study group who
did not receive the standard immunomodulation prior to Theratope treatment.
The women on the standard Theratope program have a projected median survival
of 19.7 months versus 12.6 months for the other study group, with statistical
significant at P=0.018.

In addition to increased survival, the women on the standard Theratope program
had statistically significant higher levels of antibodies against a specific
molecule, Sialyl-Tn (STn), found on the surface of breast cancer cells, than
was observed with those who received the alternate Theratope program.

Since receiving the analysis of the data, Biomira has been consulting with
clinical investigators and scientists about these results and will be
contacting regulatory officials in the U.S., Canada and Europe to discuss
their recommendations for the next steps to take Theratope therapeutic vaccine
to commercialization for women who suffer from metastatic breast cancer.

Influenza
Killer Flu Expected


Influenza could develop a new form and trigger a worldwide epidemic at any
time, experts caution.

At a conference of more than 200 infectious disease specialists, work has
started on a plan to prepare for what some believe is an inevitable pandemic,
or worldwide epidemic, of killer flu.

John LaMontagne of the U.S.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) said at the
conference that the flu virus is "dynamic and very resourceful" and can change
rapidly into forms that overwhelm natural human defenses.  "We anticipate we
will have another pandemic, but we don't know when," he said.

Dr.  Dominick Iacuzio of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said concern about another pandemic led to his
organizing the conference.  "It has happened before, and it can happen again,"
he said.

The last major worldwide flu epidemic was in 1968, the so-called "Hong Kong
flu."  New strains of the flu virus typically sweep through the international
population every ten to 40 years.

"Some experts say we are overdue," said Iacuzio.

Alan Hansen of the World Health Organization (WHO) said modern transportation
makes it possible for new flu viruses to touch every continent within a matter
of weeks - it once took many months.

In 1918-1919, a new viral strain infected more than 2 billion people and
killed an estimated 20 million to 40 million.  The "Asian flu" in 1957 was
also new and caused 750,000 deaths in the United States alone.

Iacuzio said the Bethesda, Maryland, conference was called to help
international experts identify the gaps in what is known about the flu virus
and its control.

A formal report is being prepared, but these findings will be among the
conclusions, he said:

* Increased surveillance, particularly in remote Asian areas, is needed for
early detection of new flu viral strains.  If a potentially new form of the
flu is found early enough, said Iacuzio, the pandemic could be blunted by
rapidly producing a new vaccine.

* Some experts believe the concentration of proteins used in the flu vaccine
could be reduced, thus making more doses available.  "We don't know the
answers to this," said Iacuzio, and that knowledge could be critical if there
is a sudden, worldwide need for vaccine.

* Final work on vaccines that can be applied as nose spray or nose drops must
be completed.  These so-called "cold-adapted vaccines" use modified live virus
and have been shown to be effective in some studies.  Iacuzio said their
availability in a pandemic could save many lives by protecting people against
the disease.

* Antivirals, drugs used to treat the flu infections, could provide physicians
with important new weapons in treating patients already infected.  Iacuzio
said candidate drugs are being tested, but are not available.  Such drugs need
to be speedily developed, he said.

Malaria Vaccines
SPf66 Vaccine Candidate Is Produced Under GMP Criteria


The malaria vaccine candidate SPf66 can be reproducibly manufactured, which is
essential for performing large-scale trials.

For large morbidity and mortality trials to study SPf66 (being considered for
the World Health Organization) to be interpretable, the product must be well
characterized, meet standardized release criteria and perform consistently,
noted W.R.  Ballou, Department of Immunology, Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research, Washington, D.C., and colleagues.

Ballou et al.  presented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas,
November 17-21, 1995 ("Characterization of the Peptide Polymer SPf66 Malaria
Vaccine, abstract 325, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,
1995;53(2):194-195).

"Our data indicate that SPf66 can be reproducibly manufactured and provide a
rational basis for developing reference standards for in-process and final
product release criteria," wrote Ballou et al.  in their presentation
abstract.

The methods of analysis the researchers used included the following:  mass
spectroscopy, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, size
exclusion chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid
analysis, sequence analysis, assessment of free thiols and determination of
counter ions.

"These analyses indicate that SPf66 exists as a mixture of monomeric and
multimeric species, but in our hands, the ratios of these species are
remarkably consistent from lot to lot," Ballou et al.  wrote.

Although the manufacturing process for SPf66 has the potential to produce
peptide with substantial variability from lot to lot, Ballou et al.  produced
several lots of SPf66 under good manufacturing practices (GMP) for the
specific purpose of product characterization and to establish standardization
criteria.

In a related report, Ballou et al.  said they established an assay that may be
applicable in making sure that vaccine lots are uniform ("Analysis of Potency
of the SPf66 Malaria Vaccine," abstract 324, American Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):194).

The assay also may be suitable for comparing differences with new SPf66
formulations.

Data about immunogenicity from numerous clinical trials of SPf66 have had
seroconversion rates that varied significantly.  This variability could not be
easily explained by differences in the populations that were vaccinated, noted
Ballou et al.

"We have established a potency assay in BALB/c mice in which the read out is
antibody response following intraperitoneal immunization at various dilutions
of vaccine," wrote Ballou et al.  "SPf66 can be shown to have a very steep
dose response curve in this system which permits comparison among various
vaccine formulations."

Using this model, the researchers showed that a low molecular weight component
purified from SPf66 peptide by size exclusion chromatography essentially is
nonimmunogenic.  The low molecular weight component does not bind well to
aluminum hydroxide and comprises a substantial portion of SPf66.  The
variability in its content among clinical lots may have contributed to the
disparate results obtained in human vaccine studies, Ballou et al.  said.

"Whether vaccine potency as measured by this assay in any way correlates with
efficacy has not been established, but this system may be useful as a release
assay to insure comparability among vaccine lots and to compare differences
with new SPf66 formulations," wrote Ballou et al.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Human RSV Succumbs to Bioengineering Techniques


Bioengineered production of infectious human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
provides immediate applications for the development of a live attenuated
vaccine.

RSV is considered the most important pediatric viral respiratory pathogen
worldwide.  It is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality and
lacks an approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy.  In addition to the
lack of a good animal model (other than the chimpanzee), RSV does not grow
well in culture.  Both of these problems have impeded research, making the
development of a vaccine difficult.

Peter L.  Collins et al.  produced infectious human RSV from cloned cDNA
particles in vitro paving the way for development of live attenuated vaccine
strains ("Production of Infectious Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus from
Cloned cDNA Confirms an Essential Role for the Transcription Elongation Factor
from the 5' Proximal Open Reading Frame of the M2 mRNA in Gene Expression and
Provides a Capability for Vaccine Development," Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11563-67).

"An exciting possibility is that RSV might be engineered in ways that enhance
its immunogenicity and induce a level of protection greater than that provided
by natural infection," noted Collins et al.  In addition "RSV can be evaluated
as a possible vector for protective antigens of other respiratory tract
pathogens.  An RSV vector also might have utility in transient gene therapy of
the respiratory tract."

The cloned RSV was produced by the intracellular coexpression of five
plasmid-born cDNAs.  One encoded a complete positive-sense version of the RSV
genome, and each of the other four encode a separate RSV protein.  If any of
these were deleted, RSV was not produced.  The cDNA segments were synthesized
by reverse transcription (RT)-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) from intracellular RSV mRNA
or virion-derived genome RNA.

They noted that the strategy for producing infections RSV from cDNA-express
antigenome involved its coexpression with those RSV proteins that were
necessary and sufficient to complete two important processes:  1) the ability
to produce an antigenomic nucleocapsid capable of RNA replication and 2) to
render the progeny genomic nucleocapsid competent for both RNA replication and
transcription.  Transcription by the genomic nucleocapsid would then provide
all of the other RSV proteins and initiate a productive infection.

Recently, this approach was successfully accomplished with two rhabdoviruses,
rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus, by M.J.  Schnell et al.  (EMBO J.,
1994;13:4195-4203) and N.D.  Lawson et al.  (PNAS, 1995;92:4477-81).

The possibility also exists that defined mutations can be introduced into
these infectious RSV clones.  This could have multiple applications toward the
understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of this particularly
difficult to study virus.

"It may be possible to insert foreign sequence into the RSV genome for
coexpression," concluded Collins et al.  "Genes of interest for evaluation
include those encoding cytokines, antagonists thereof, or proteins rich in
T-helper-cell epitopes.  This offers the possibility of modifying and
improving the immune response quantitatively and qualitatively."

The corresponding author for this study is Peter L.  Collins, Laboratory of
Infectious Disease, 7 Center Drive, MSC 0720, NIAID, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-0720, USA.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "We have developed an ex vivo gene therapy paradigm for the
treatment of brain tumors using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF).  The murine B16 melanoma and the GL 261 glioma lines were
infected with MFG recombinant retrovirus containing the mouse GM-CSF cDNA.
The tumor lines were confirmed to secrete GM-CSF by ELISA.  Subcutaneous
vaccination of syngeneic mice with irradiated GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma
cells completely protected animals from subsequent intracranial B16 tumor
inoculation.  Histologic evaluation revealed the presence of neutrophils,
eosinophils and lymphocytes in the intracerebral inoculation site.  In
contrast, animals vaccinated with irradiated B16 cells or not vaccinated
succumbed to intracranial tumor within 3 weeks after inoculation.  Treatment
of established intracranial B16 melanoma tumors with subcutaneous injection of
irradiated GMCSF secreting B16 cells increased median survival as compared to
injection of irradiated B16 cells or no treatment.  In addition, treatment of
intracerebral glioma with subcutaneous vaccination with irradiated,
GM-CSF-secreting autologous cells also increased survival compared to
controls.  Histologic examination revealed a dramatic perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate beginning 3 days after treatment with GM-CSF transduced cells which
was not found in controls."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "Immunity to tumors develops following ganciclovir (GCV) treatment
of brain tumors expressing the Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)
gene.  To study if HSV-TK by itself might contribute to the anti-tumor
immunogenicity, the growth of non-immunogenic D74 tumors, wild type (D74-w.t.)
and TK-modified D74 (D74-TK) brain tumor cells, were studied in naive rats and
rats previously treated and cured of 9L, tumors by HSV-TK and GCV treatments.
Formation of the D74-TK tumors were significantly reduced in both naive and
pretreated rats, even though the in vitro growth rate of these tumors was
similar.  Analysis of immune cells infiltrating the tumors revealed a
significant increase in the CD4 positive cells in TK-modified tumor cells in
the previously treated rats.  Furthermore the regression of the D74-TK tumors
was greater in the previously treated rats.  These findings suggest that even
in non immunogenic tumors, the expression of HSV-TK slows the tumor formation,
that can be associated with the immune response.  This immunity could be
exploited by vaccination strategies to increase tumor regression seen with
HSV-TK and GCV treatments.  Supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Sedegah, H.  Wang, M.  Kaur, P.  Hobart and S.L.  Hoffman.  Malaria Program,

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "We recently reported that Plasmodium yoelii CSP
DNA vaccines induced specific antibodies and nearly complete CD8(+)
CTL-dependent protection against sporozoite challenge in BALB/c mice.
Preliminary studies have now shown that a full-length P.  yoelii SSP2 (PySSP2)
DNA vaccine protected approximately 50% of A/J mice.  In an effort to improve
upon the results with PySSP2, we constructed two DNA vaccine plasmids both of
which contained a truncated PySSP2 gene lacking the 5' terminal region of the
gene thought to encode the native signal peptide:  one contained an in-frame
fusion with a mammalian (tPA) signal peptide while the other one remained
signal minus.  The ability of both plasmids to express PySSP2 in vitro was
demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of the cell pellet and culture supernatant
material from transiently transfected COS-7 cells.  An immunoreactive band of
an expected molecular mass was detected with anti-PySSP2 Mab (NYS4) in both
fractions from cells transfected with the tPAPySSP2 plasmid but only in the
cell pellet material of the COS-7 cell cultures transfected with the signal
minus plasmid.  The ability of these plasmids to induce protective immunity is
being evaluated in multiple strains of mice.  So far, both BALB/c and A/J mice
have produced antibodies after a single immunization with the tPA-PySSP2 DNA
vaccine as determined by IFAT; the immunoreactive pattern on sporozoites was
similar in appearance to that obtained with NYS4.  Mice immunized with the
signal minus construct have not yet produced measurable antibodies to
sporozoites.  Initial protection studies and the results of the ongoing
immunogenicity and protection studies will be presented."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "We report here the effect on blood stage
development of the vaccination of 5 non-splenectomized chimpanzees with 4
Plasmodium falciparum liver stage proteins:  Liver Stage Antigen 1 (LSA-1) and
3 (LSA-3), Sporozoite Threonine and Asparagin Rich Protein (STARP), and
Sporozoite And Liver Stage Antigen (SALSA).  LSA-1 is specific to liver stages
while LSA-3, SALSA, and STARP are also expressed by the sporozoite.  To
activate multiple immune mechanisms using the same antigen, 3 types of
immunization per chimpanzee were used:  immunization by lipopeptides only, by
peptides associated with the adjuvant Moutaulde ISA 31 (SEPIC, Paris France),
and by recombinant proteins associated with the some adjuvant.  One chimpanzee
per vaccine candidate was used; a control animal was immunized with adjuvant
only.  After the course of vaccination each chimpanzee received a dose
containing 120,000 sporozoites intravenously at day 0.  The control animal
developed a parasitemia of 270 parasites/(micro)l at day 7.  Parasitemia
decreased rapidly to 15 parasites/(micro)l the next day, and no parasites were
detectable at day 10.  The 2 chimpanzee vaccinated with LSA-1 and SALSA
developed identical parasitemias (270 parasites/(micro)l at day 7).
Interestingly, the chimpanzee vaccinated with STARP developed a 3 fold greater
parasitemia at day 7.  In marked contrast, the chimpanzee vaccinated with
products from the protein LSA-3 developed a 3 times lower parasitemia than the
non-protected animals at day 7 (80 parasites/(micro)l).  According to the time
of maturation of liver stage of P.  falciparum (minimum of 6 days),
parasitemia observed 7 days after sporozoite inoculation is directly linked
with merozoites from the hepatic stage, and not from blood-stage
multiplication.  Thus, the decreased parasitemia observed for the LSA-3
vaccinated animal could be linked with a protective immune mechanism.
Although this experiment does not allow to prove vaccine efficacy, interest of
such research using limited a number of Apes will be discussed with reference
to these observation."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "We have demonstrated that intramuscular (IM)
immunization with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Plasmodium yoelii CSP
protein (PyCSP) induces high antibody levels and cytotoxic T cells against
PyCSP, and induces a CD8(+) T-cell dependent protection in 85% of BALB/c mice.
In preparation for development of DNA vaccines designed to produce protective
antibodies against P.  falciparum erythrocytic stage antigens, we conducted
studies to optimize antibody responses in Aotus monkeys after immunization
with the PyCSP DNA vaccine.  Groups of 3 monkeys were immunized at 3 week
intervals with 125, 500, or 2000 (micro)g PyCSP DNA.  IM alone (tibialis
anterior), IM after pre-treatment with 0.25% bupivacaine, and intradermal (ID)
routes were compared.  Only monkeys immunized by the ID route produced
antibodies against sporozoites.  Antibody titers, obtained by indirect
fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) against air-dried sporozoites and by ELISA
using a PyCSP recombinant protein, peaked at 3 weeks after the third ID dose
and were reduced 50% by 7 weeks after the third dose.  There was a trend
toward a dose response with peak geometric mean IFAT titers of 806, 508, and
403 for the 2000, 500, and 125 (micro)g doses respectively.  In a second
experiment antibody responses to a 500 (micro)g dose at multiple sites (2 or
6) were found superior to responses generated by a single site administration.
These data clearly demonstrate that ID immunization generates significantly
better antibody responses to the PyCSP DNA vaccine than IM immunization, and
support the use of the ID route for the initial studies of the efficacy of DNA
vaccines in inducing protective antibodies against P.  falciparum erythrocytic
stage antigens."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "Recent reports indicated that immunization of
mice with GST-PYCI, a recombinant protein based on the Plasmodium yoelii MSP-1
protects against challenge with infected erythrocytes, and immunization of
mice with MAP4 (QGPGAP)4 P2P30, a multiple antigen peptide based on the P.
yoelii CS protein protects against sporozoite challenge.  The current studies
were designed to determine if:  (1) GST-PYC2 (a modified GST PYC1) protects
against sporozoite challenge, and (2) if immunization with GST-PYC2 plus MAP4
(OGPGAP)4 P2P30 would provide additive or synergistic protection.  Groups of
10 mice were immunized with individual or combined vaccine emulsified in
TiterMax adjuvant and challenged with P.  yoelii sporozoites.  One of 10 mice
immunized with GSTPYC2 was completely protected against sporozoite challenge.
The remaining nine mice had significantly lower levels of parasitemia on the
last day of follow up (day 14) than did control mice (P<0.01 ).  Immunization
with the combined vaccine reduced by 50% the level of parasite specific
antibodies as compared to that induced by the individual components.
Nonetheless, 50% of the mice immunized with the combined vaccine, 40% of the
mice immunized with MAP4 (QGPGAP)4 P2P30 vaccine, and 10% of the mice
immunized with the GST-PYC2 vaccine were fully protected.  This modest
increase in protection in the combination group was not statistically
significant, but may have been a reflection of additive activity of antibodies
against each immunogen.  These studies provide a foundation and direction for

Cancer Vaccines
Duda, R.B.; Yang, H.; Dooley, D.D.; Abujawdeh, G.  "Recombinant BCG Therapy
Suppresses Melanoma Tumor Growth."  Annals of Surgical Oncology, November
1995;2(6):542-549.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals of
Surgical Oncology, "BACKGROUND:  Melanoma is the fastest rising cancer in the
United States.  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been genetically engineered
to actively express and secrete the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).  Both BCG
and IL-2 have known potent antitumor and immunomodulatory properties.
METHODS:  This recombinant BCG (rBCG 3A) has been tested as an intratumoral
injection and a vaccine therapy in conjunction with irradiated tumor cells
against melanoma in the murine B16 melanoma model.  RESULTS:  The transfection
process did not adversely alter the function of the wild-type (WT) BCG.  rBCG
3A and WT BCG are equally effective intratumoral and vaccine therapies against
melanoma when compared with normal saline control groups.  Tumor burdens were
significantly smaller (P less than or equal to 0.01 and 0.05) for the
treatment groups for both intratumoral and vaccine administration of therapy.
Immunization with rBCG 3A and WT BCG 14 days before a B16 challenge resulted
in an similar to 45% smaller tumor burden when compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS:  Novel therapies based on the immunogenic properties of melanoma
combined with molecular technologies may offer promise for an effective and
safe treatment of melanoma."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RB

Immune Responses Induced by Secretion of a Chimeric Soluble Protein from a
Recombinant Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Vector Candidate
Vaccine for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 in Small Animals."
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
America, November 7, 1995;92(23):10693-10697.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, "A
recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vector-based
vaccine that secretes the V3 principal neutralizing epitope of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could induce immune response to the epitope and
prevent the viral infection.  By using the Japanese consensus sequence of
HIV-1, we successfully constructed chimeric protein secretion vectors by
selecting an appropriate insertion site of a carrier protein and established
the principal neutralizing determinant (PND)-peptide secretion system in BCG.
The recombinant BCG (rBCG)-inoculated guinea pigs were initially screened by
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions to the PND peptide,
followed by passive transfer of the DTH by the systemic route.  Further,
immunization of mice with the rBCG resulted in induction of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes.  The guinea pig immune antisera showed elevated titers to the PND
peptide and neutralized HIVMN, and administration of serum IgG from the
vaccinated guinea pigs was effective in completely blocking the HIV infection
in thymus/liver transplanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/hu or
SCID/PBL mice.  In addition, the immune serum IgG was shown to neutralize
primary field isolates of HIV that match the neutralizing sequence motif by a
peripheral blood mononuclear fell-based virus neutralization assay.  The data
support the idea that the antigen-secreting rBCG system can be used as a tool
for development of HIV vaccines."  The corresponding author for this study is:

Frasch, C.E.  "Haemophilus influenzae Type b Conjugate and Combination
Vaccines."  Clinical Immunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):376-386.


According to the author's abstract of an article published in Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, "Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines
represent a new technology wherein an immunogen is targeted to a specific
immune response mechanism.  Covalent attachment of the Hib polysaccharide to a
protein carrier converts the T cell-independent polysaccharide antigen into a
protein-like T cell-dependent antigen.  The polysaccharide alone is poorly
immunogenic in infants (less than or equal to 12 months old), and conjugation
to a protein carrier results in a protein-like antibody response to the Hib
polysaccharide in infants.  Conjugate vaccines induce mostly IgG antibodies
and immunological memory.  Later vaccination or natural exposure then induces
a booster response to the Hib polysaccharide.  These conjugate vaccines have
dramatically reduced the incidence of Hib disease in many industrialized
countries, and also reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib in unvaccinated
children in populations in which the vaccine is used.  The Hib conjugates have
now been combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine to
reduce the number of injections required for infants.  Finally, the conjugate
technology that has permitted the near elimination of Hib disease has now been
extended to other invasive encapsulated bacterial pathogens."  The

Simplex Virus Type 2 Glycoprotein D Reduces the Severity of Genital Herpes in

Guinea Pigs."  Journal of Virology, December 1995;69(12):8109-8113.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Virology, "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an attractive candidate for a
live-virus vector for the delivery of foreign antigens.  The Oka vaccine
strain of VZV is safe and effective in humans, and recombinant Oka VZV (ROka)
can be generated by transfecting cells with a set of overlapping cosmid DNAs.
By this method, the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein D (gD2)
gene was inserted into an intergenic site in the unique short region of the
Oka VZV genome.  Expression of gD2 in cells infected with the recombinant Oka
strain VZV (ROka-gD2) was confirmed by antibody staining of fixed cells and by
immunoblot analysis.  Immune electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of
gD2 in the envelope of ROka-gD2 virions.  The ability of ROka-gD2 to protect
guinea pigs against HSV 2 challenge was assessed by inoculating animals with
three doses of uninfected human fibroblasts, fibroblasts infected with ROka
VZV, or fibroblasts infected with ROka-gD2.  Neutralizing antibodies specific
for HSV-2 developed in animals immunized with ROka-gD2.  Forty days after the
third inoculation, animals were challenged intravaginally with HSV-2.
Inoculation of guinea pigs with ROka-gD2 significantly reduced the severity of
primary HSV 2 infection (P<0.001).  These experiments demonstrate that the Oka
strain of VZV can be used as a live virus vector to protect animals from
disease with a heterologous virus."  The corresponding author for this study

Administered with IL-12 Generate Antigen-Specific T Cell Responses and
Protective Immunity Against Listeria monocytogenes."  Journal of Immunology,

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Immunology, "The development of effective vaccine strategies for intracellular
pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, is one of the major
frontiers of scientific research.  For the studies described here, the murine
model of Listeria infection was used to evaluate the adjuvant effects of IL-12
when used as an immunization component.  These studies revealed that typically
nonimmunogenic doses of heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes, or soluble
listerial Ag preparations, elicit intense Th1-type Listeria-specific T-cell
responses when administered i.p.  along with recombinant murine IL-12.  In
addition to the Ag-specific production of IL-2 by CD4(+) peritoneal cells that
was elicited, several other correlates of protective responses were noted,
including dramatic induction of CD3(+) and alpha beta TCR(+) cell populations
in the peritoneal cavity and increased expression of class II MHC and
production of IL-12 (upon in vitro restimulation) by peritoneal macrophages.
Protection studies demonstrated that the T-cell responses elicited by a
IL-12-potentiated, heat-killed L.  monocytogenes vaccine were sufficient to
effectively protect mice against challenge with a large dose of virulent

Universal Infant Hepatitis B Vaccination Recommendations."  Pediatrics,
November 1995;96(5 Part 1):875-879.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,
"OBJECTIVE:  To assess the extent to which hospitals in a midwestern state
with low acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) morbidity offered hepatitis B (Hep B)
vaccine to all infants, whether offering infants Hep B vaccine was associated
with hospital geographic location or size, as measured by the number of
births, and how hospital staff resolved key programmatic issues.  METHODS:
The managers of hospital newborn nurseries (n=110) were surveyed by mail.  The
written response rate was 72%; all of the nonresponders were interviewed by
telephone.  The outcome measured was the number of hospitals offering Hep B
vaccine to all infants by geographic region and hospital size.  RESULTS:
Sixty-five percent of the hospitals routinely offered Hep B vaccine to all
infants; these hospitals accounted far 80% of reported Wisconsin births.  In
univariate analysis, the decision to offer infants Hep B vaccine was
associated with both hospital size and hospital location.  After controlling
for size, hospitals in the northeastern region were eight times more likely
(relative risk, 8.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.30, 51.79) to offer infants
Hep B vaccine than hospitals in the southeastern (referent) region.  Regional
differences in reported rates of acute HBV infection do not explain this
finding, because morbidity in the northeastern region (1 per 100,000) is among
the lowest in Wisconsin.  Although more than 80% of hospitals with Hep B
vaccination programs required written informed consent for vaccination, had
standing orders for administering Hep B vaccine to infants whose mothers'
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test results were known, and had
mechanisms to notify the infants' physicians that the infants had been
vaccinated, only 38% had standing orders for testing mothers whose HBsAg test
results were unknown.  CONCLUSIONS:  Hospitals are not necessarily deterred
from implementing infant Hep B vaccination programs by low community HBV
morbidity.  Hospitals should develop policies to assure that parturient women
with unknown HBsAg status are screened and their infants are appropriately
treated."  The corresponding author for this study is:  MB Hurie, Wisconsin

"Beliefs and Practices Regarding Childhood Vaccination among Urban Pediatric
Providers in New Jersey."  Pediatrics, November 1995;96(5 Part 1):889-892.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,
"BACKGROUND:  In 1991, the fourth largest measles outbreak in the nation (824
cases) occurred in the Jersey City, New Jersey area.  Data from a subsequent
intervention trial in Jersey City demonstrated that vaccinations were more
likely to be delayed for children who had received care from private rather
than public clinic providers.  In addition, failure to administer multiple
indicated vaccines at a single visit was associated with vaccination delay,
and reluctance to administer multiple vaccines was more common among private
providers.  These findings prompted an investigation of vaccination beliefs
and practices among urban pediatric providers.  METHODS:  A telephone survey
of vaccination beliefs and practices was administered to all pediatric
providers in both private and public clinics in the Paterson and Jersey City
areas.  RESULTS:  Private providers were less likely than public clinic
providers to consider vaccinating children during emergency room visits
(relative risk [RR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-4.2) or hospital
admissions (RR = 13.2; 95% CI = 1.9-92.7) and less likely to believe that all
recommended vaccine doses should be administered simultaneously (RR =
infinite; lower 95% confidence limit = 3.0).  Private providers were less
likely to consider administering live-virus vaccines to children with minor
acute illnesses and low-grade fever (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-3.8) or
killed-virus vaccines to children with minor acute illnesses without fever (RR
= 3.4; 95% CI = 1.4-8.5) or with low-grade fever (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-3.9).
Private providers were more likely to believe that multiple injections should
be avoided because of potential psychological and physical trauma to the child
(RR = 4.0; 95% CI = 1.3-12.3).  CONCLUSIONS:  Adherence to Standards for
Pediatric Immunization Practices by pediatric providers could improve vaccine
coverage rates among urban children."  The corresponding author for this study

Protective Effect of Neonatal BCG Correlate with Vaccine-Induced Tuberculin
Reaction?."  American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,

November 1995;152(5):1575-1578.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "A case-control study was conducted
in Saudi Arabia, where the same strain of BCG has been used and surveys had
shown that up to 88% of vaccinated children remain tuberculin negative.
Active cases were obtained by surveying the seven tuberculosis centers in 1
yr.  Control subjects were obtained from a nationwide survey of normal
individuals.  Vaccination in both groups was ascertained by history and BCG
scar.  Relative risk of contracting active tuberculosis in the vaccinated
versus unvaccinated and protection was calculated.  protection was as follows:
age group 5 to 14 yr, 82% (55 to 93%); age group 15 to 24 yr, 67% (55 to 77%);
and age group 25 to 34 yr, 20% (-6 to 37%).  We document the uninterrupted
record of protection by BCG administered in the neonatal period and discuss
the significance of vaccination timing.  We concur with other studies that
protection lapsed after about 20 yr.  More importantly, this is the first
large study that documents a lack of tuberculin sensitivity despite
protection.  This challenges the view that sensitization is essential for
protection and supports the 'two-pathway' theory that BCG vaccination could
trigger either protective (Lister type) or antagonistic (tuberculin or Koch
type) reactions and that the most protective vaccines would have little
tuberculin-sensitizing effect because the two pathways are competitive."  The

Delivery System - Importance of Autologous Alpha 2-Macroglobulin in the
Development of Peptide Vaccine."  Biochemical and Biophysical Research

Communications, November 2, 1995;216(1):399-405.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Biochemical and
Biophysical Research Communications, "We have hijacked a process of the
receptor-mediated endocytosis to transport peptide antigens into antigen
presenting cells (APCs) for the purpose of increasing the level of antigen
presentation (named Receptor-Linked Antigen Delivery System (R-LADS)).  By
coupling an endogenous plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha
2M) to a synthetic peptide having a partial sequence of HIV-1 envelope
protein, alpha 2M was made to carry the peptide into APCs as a part of the
normal alpha 2M cycle, which resulted in an increased production of specific
antibodies against the peptide (Mitsuda, S., Nakagawa, T., Osada, T.,
Shimamoto, T., Nakazato, H.  and Ikai, A.  (1993) Biochem.  Biophys.  Res.
Commun.  194, 1155-1160).  We demonstrate here that this procedure becomes a
more efficient tool for antibody production when autologous transporter
protein was used.  By using murine alpha 2M (m alpha 2M) instead of
heterologous human alpha 2M (h alpha 2M) when mice were experimental animals,
we were able to dramatically enhance the production level of anti-HIV-1
peptide antibodies and shorten the period which is needed for antibody
production.  We aim to develop effective peptide vaccines by further improving
this system."  The corresponding author for this study is:  S Mitsuda, Tokyo

Pneumococcal

G.R.  "Serum, Breast Milk, and Infant Antibody after Maternal Immunisation
with Pneumococcal Vaccine."  Lancet, November 11, 1995;346(8985):1252-1257.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Lancet,
"Pneumococci are a leading cause of severe bacterial disease in infants and
children world wide.  A possible means of protecting infants in the first few
months of life is immunisation of the mother during prospectively assessed
pneumococcal pregnant women to determine the amount pneumococcal antibody
transmitted to the infants in serum and milk and the half-life of the
passively acquired antibody.  Healthy pregnant women in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
were randomized to receive pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine with routine
prenatal tetanus immunisation at 30-34 weeks of gestation.  Serum and breast
milk specimens from the mothers and sera from infants were collected up to 22
weeks of age and assayed for specific serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 and for milk
IgA antibodies to pneumococcal serotypes 6B and 19F.  55 mothers and 56
infants were followed from birth to five months.  Women who received
pneumococcal vaccine had geometric mean antibody increases of 2.6 and 3.4 to
types 6B and 19F, respectively, The mean infant/maternal antibody ratios were
0.56 and 0.59 (range 0.11-1.46) for these serotypes.  Infant cord antibody
titres correlated with maternal titres.  Infant/maternal IgG ratios correlated
with the interval between immunisation and birth and were higher for specific
IgG1 than for IgG2.  Infants of pneumococcal vaccine recipients had geometric
mean antibody concentrations of 6.8 and 7.5 (micro)g/mL to serotypes 6B and
19F in cord blood; in cord blood and in all subsequent serum specimens the
concentrations were 2-3 fold higher than in control infants.  The median
half-life of passive antibody was about 35 days; at five months of age 63-71%
of infants of pneumococcal vaccine recipients had antibody concentrations
greater than 0.15 (micro)g/mL.  Breast milk IgA antibodies for pneumococcal
serotype 19F, but not for type 6B, were significantly higher in vaccine
recipients up to five months after delivery.  If maternal pneumococcal
polysaccharide antibodies do not interfere with active immunisation of the
infant with new glycoprotein conjugate pneumococcal vaccines, passive-active
immunisation of infants can be a feasible strategy for developing regions."

Varicella-Zoster Virus
Perry, C.M.; Bryson, H.M.  "Oka/Merck Varicella Vaccine:  A Review of Its
Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy Against Varicella."  Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):396-416.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, "Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine
produced from the Oka strain of the herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV).
The Oka strain of VZV is recognized as having low virulence while eliciting
humoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV.  In numerous studies, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine achieved a seroconversion rate of >95% in healthy children
and adolescents.  In immunocompromised children with leukaemia in remission,
seroconversion was achieved in 80% of vaccinees 12 months after vaccination.
Cell-mediated immune responses generally closely paralleled humoral immune
responses.  The vaccine is also immunogenic in healthy adults.  In healthy
children, a high level of protection was conferred by Oka/Merck varicella
vaccine, and in the only double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted to
date the vaccine was 98% effective in protecting healthy children against
varicella during 2 varicella seasons.  In children with leukaemia, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine was 80% effective in protecting against mild varicella and
conferred 100% protection against moderate and severe varicella.  In healthy
adults, the rate of protection against varicella was reported to be
approximately 50%.  All observed cases of varicella in healthy and
immunocompromised vaccinees were mild and there were no reports of ay
disease-related complications.  Interestingly in children and adolescents with
leukaemia, the incidence of herpes tester was lower in children who received
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine than in similar children who had natural immunity.
Mild varicelliform rash (occasionally accompanied by fever) has been observed
in healthy children, adolescents and adults who have received Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine.  Pain at the injection site was the adverse effect most
frequently reported in one large study of the vaccine in healthy children.  In
children with leukaemia, vaccine-associated rash has been reported in up to
50% of vaccinees.  When Oka/Merck varicella vaccine was administered to
healthy children in combination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine there
was no increase in the incidence of skin rashes compared with that caused by
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in combination with placebo.  Thus,
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a highly immunogenic vaccine that confers a
high level of protection against typical varicella in healthy children and
adolescents, and in children and adolescents with leukaemia.  While results of
further long term studies investigating the persistence of protective immunity
against varicella are awaited with interest, available darn indicate that
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a major advance in the prevention of this
common and highly infectious disease."  The corresponding author for this

Insurance Bill Targeted by Opponents


Congress returns today to tackle a spring agenda laden with health
care possibilities, the most notable being a pending Senate
insurance reform bill that conservatives are targeting for
destruction.
Conservatives wary of Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kan) insurance bill
(S 1028), scheduled for debate later this spring, are designing a
"mutually assured destruction" campaign, says one lobbyist. They
are mulling introduction of controversial amendments such as
medical malpractice and medical savings accounts, and pushing
alternative legislation to expand COBRA or reform only the group
insurance market; S 1028 would dip into the individual market.
S 1028 opponents also may try to temper the effect of the bill by
attaching legislation (S 539) allowing tax-exempt status for state
risk pools; states with pools up and running would be exempt from
the Kassebaum insurer mandates.
In the House, GOP staffers want to move ahead with Rep. Bill
Thomas' (R-Calif) portability bill (HR 1610), but party leaders are
still deciding when to proceed, how to divide up committee
jurisdiction, and whether to add other health tax items.
S 1028's provision allowing portability for individual-market
purchasers leaving group plans is the subject of dueling actuarial
studies. The independent American Academy of Actuaries and the
non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) last week said in
separate reports that the provision would hike premiums between
1%-5%, while the Health Insurance Assn. of America (HIAA), which
opposes the provision, maintained rates would rise 10%-20%.
The discrepancy is rooted in different assumptions about state
reactions to the bill. The academy and CRS assume most states will
regulate individual-market premiums to protect new entrants but let
carriers charge high-risk persons up to 100% more than the average
rate. HIAA assumes states won't allow any rate variation.
A sleeper amendment is Senate Budget Committee Chair Pete
Domenici's (R-NM) initiative to establish parity between mental
health and other health benefits. Actuaries say big bucks are at
stake, but GOP members are wary of making waves.
Meanwhile, ERISA expansion legislation is scheduled for an early
March vote; an administrative simplification bill will be marked up
in April. Those issues, as well as antitrust, could come to a head
should insurance reform gather steam, sources say.

Medicaid Proposal Evolving; Medicare Reform Still
Stalled


A month ago, Medicare reform was front and center, while Medicaid
talks were stalled. Today, the political winds are blowing in the
opposite direction.
Congressional leaders and a bipartisan group of National Governors'
Assn. (NGA) members are working to refine and expand the
NGA-approved Medicaid proposal that has quickly drawn criticism
from most Democrats and liberal interest groups. Reform proponents
are pushing GOP leaders to draft and attach Medicaid and welfare
legislation to a bill extending the debt limit, which expires March
15.
However, a bill hasn't yet been drafted, and governors already are
still tweaking the NGA outline. The original proposal would have
given states total flexibility on amount, scope and duration of
benefits, but governors are mulling floor thresholds for quality,
such as minimum HMO requirements in each state.
The governors also may also nix their proposal to reduce the
maximum state matching percentage from 50% to 40%, set some minimum
definition of "disabled," and increase the proposal's federally
defined benefits package. Also subject to discussion are the
proposed repeal of state schemes to maximize federal matching funds
(WHW 11/6/95, p. 2) and whether to repeal the existing Medicaid
statute.
Medicare reform has an outside chance of being tacked onto debt
ceiling legislation, but House leaders are said to be "skeptical"
of initiating another reform push. House leaders trying to keep the
issue alive have floated $168 billion in seven-year savings that
are more modest than previous proposals.
The latest plan would keep Part B premiums at 25%; delay the
Medicare capitation payment floor by a year; let the feds oversee
provider networks; reduce Part A payment cuts to hospitals, skilled
nursing facilities and home health providers; and exempt physician
office labs from federal standards.

Certain Nurses Can Unionize Under New NLRB Rulings


Nurses who work as professional, non-supervisory employees have the
right to unionize and engage in other concerted activity without
the fear of being fired, under two National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) rulings issued earlier this month.
The American Nurses Assn. cheered the decisions, saying they remove
a tactic employers have used to impede union organizing by
registered nurses (RNs). The American Hospital Assn. opposes the
decisions, fearing they will encourage unions to organize nurses.
NLRB ruled that charge nurses at Providence Hospital in Anchorage,
Alaska, are not "supervisors" and therefore are protected by the
National Labor Relations Act. That law bars supervisors from
unionizing. Charge nurses are those in charge of a unit or floor.
In a companion case, NLRB ruled that licensed practical nurses at
Ten Broeck Commons, a New York nursing home, oversaw the work of
certified nursing assistants in a routine manner, without being
supervisors under the federal law.
The rulings have favorable implications for nurses about 60 other
nurses' cases before the NLRB.

IRS Issues Family Leave Rule For Cafeteria Plans


The IRS recently proposed guidelines for employers offering
flexible benefit programs whose workers take leave under the Family
and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), as well as guidance for firms in
which ex-workers and/or dependents choose COBRA coverage.
Final regulations for FMLA, enacted in 1993, were issued in January
1995, but were generally silent on treatment of flexible benefit
programs, also called cafeteria plans. The law allows workers to
take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family reasons or illness.
The new rules stipulate that firms offering Sec. 125 cafeteria
plans - in which workers are given an allotted pot of pre-tax money
to choose from an array of health plans and other benefits - can
collect health plan premium contributions from employees taking
unpaid FMLA leave in three ways: (1) pre-pay, in which workers
would pay before leave begins; (2) pay-as-you-go, in which workers
pay on the same schedule as if they were not on leave; and (3)
catch-up, in which employees pay upon returning to work.
For cafeteria plans offering flexible spending accounts (FSAs) "
into which employers put pre-tax dollars for workers' medical or
dependent-care costs - the IRS proposes FSAs be subject to the same
rules as other health plans for workers on family leave. Thus,
workers may revoke their health plan selections while on leave, but
firms must allow reinstatement upon their return. Those electing
continuation coverage during leave are subject to normal uniform
coverage laws.
Separately, the IRS specified when firms can charge COBRA
participants the family rate. The guidance says if a worker and
spouse elect COBRA together, the employer may charge 102% of the
family premium; if only a spouse or dependent child does, 102% of
the individual rate applies.

Medicare Supplemental Suit Alleges Systematic Overbilling


Asserting that hundreds of thousands of Medicare supplemental
insurance policyholders nationwide have been systematically and
intentionally overcharged, physician-patient advocates this month
filed a class action suit against the Prudential Insurance Co. Byan
v. Prudential, No. 600650/96 (N.Y. Sup.Ct., filed Feb. 8, 1996).
The case is said to be the first of its kind, but if it succeeds,
similar suits may be filed against other insurers, says Yvonne
Archer, executive director of the League of Physicians and
Surgeons, which supports the suit. Medicare supplemental insurance
provides benefits that Medicare doesn't cover, including
copayments, deductibles and prescription drugs.
At issue in the New York lawsuit are deluxe versions of policies
sponsored by the American Assn. of Retired Persons (AARP) and sold
by Prudential. Such policies allow members to see
non-Medicare-participating physicians and pay the difference
between the Medicare allowable fee and an MD's "usual and
prevailing" charge.
The plaintiffs, represented by the New York-based law firm Landy &
Seymour, say Pru didn't pay that difference and intentionally
charged it to AARP members. The amount sought in the suit is the
premium difference between the Pru plan and a less-comprehensive
version that doesn't fill the gap between Medicare payments and MD
fees, plus punitive damages and attorneys' fees.
The insurer says the suit is "without merit." AARP is not involved,
although Archer blames it for overlooking the alleged overcharges.
Still unclear is the actual number of people and dollars at stake.
That information will be determined during the discovery stage of
the suit.

Medicare to Add Procedures To Bundled Payment Pilot


HCFA plans to expand its Medicare bundled payment
"centers-of-excellence" demonstration in the next two months by
adding several orthopedic and four cardiology procedures.
The HCFA has already tested the program on bypass and cataract
surgery, but those demos are expiring this year.
Under the upcoming cardiology pilot, the agency will pay facilities
a negotiated bundled rate to cover hospital and physician services
for heart bypasses, angioplasties, valve replacements and
catheterization. The orthopedic demo will cover total hip and knee
joint replacements.
Hospitals can participate in either the cardiology or the
orthopedic demo, or both. The bundled payment will account for
outlier cases; separate payments won't be made for particularly
expensive patients.
HCFA hasn't decided on the number of sites, but most likely will
choose facilities in a region comprised of several contiguous
states. HCFA plans to select hospitals by late 1996 and have the
first sites operating by the spring of 1997.

Statewide Payment Areas For Medicare Docs Eyed


HCFA is considering moving to additional statewide payment areas
for the Medicare physician fee schedule in 1997 - a move that would
pay rural doctors higher fees, comparable to those of their city
brethren. Insiders say action appears imminent.
If HCFA proposes such a change in its annual fee update this
summer, "it will become a hot issue" for docs, says Randy Teach,
director of the Washington office of the Medical Group Management
Assn. Such a proposal would create winner and loser states, a
situation that could cause Congress to jump in and legislate a
solution.
Currently, the national fee schedule contains 210 geographic
payment areas, based on the locales Medicare claims processors used
under the old charge-based payment system. The Physician Payment
Review Commission (PPRC), which advises Congress on Medicare
physician payments, recommends revamping payment areas and creating
35 statewide fee schedules; the other 15 states should have
multiple schedules based on metropolitan areas.
HCFA may be listening. In the past, the agency claimed it didn't
have the authority to redefine payment areas across the board,
although it allowed a handful of states to establish statewide fee
schedules if widely supported by physicians.
But the agency recently decided it has such authority, and is
analyzing a just-completed study by Health Economics Research that
urges retaining current payment divisions only in areas where
medical prices are much higher than the state average. The finding:
Only 14 states would retain multiple fee schedules. G

Feds Seeks Recoupment Of Provider Device Fraud


The providers who allegedly billed Medicare for  experimental
medical devices knowing it was illegal were undaunted by the threat
of government retaliation, a Senate panel was told this month.
A former device industry executive, suing providers on behalf of
the government under the whistleblower provision of the False
Claims Act, told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations that some providers risked patients' lives, tampered
with files, and lied on forms to ensure Medicare payment.
The lawsuit claims providers improperly billed Medicare for
experimental devices and related care. HCFA began officially
covering such devices last fall.
Hospital lawyers contend the whistleblower is not the originator of
the allegations - a key requirement to win such cases. The feds
denied encouraging the whistleblower to sue.
Meanwhile, some hospitals are starting to get letters from the
government demanding records of Medicare claims for experimental
devices and related medical care to figure out how much hospitals
owe Medicare, sources say.
And in a new revelation, every hospital scrutinized by the feds for
improper Medicare claims for experimental medical devices allegedly
submitted these claims, at least half knew the claims were
inappropriate, and almost 30 hospitals tried to cover it up, HHS
Deputy Inspector General Jack Hartwig told the Senate panel.
In response, he said the IG and HCFA are calculating overpayments
to providers and plan to seek repayment; evidence of alleged
criminal conduct will be investigated; fraud that has been
identified is being addressed by the Justice Department; and HHS is
addressing weaknesses in accounting and tracking of investigational
devices, in hospital oversight, and in obtaining informed patient
consent. Physicians also are being probed.

INSIDE THE BELTWAY


        Some seniors join Medicare HMOs to
retain employer-provided health benefits, according to a GAO report
(GAO/HEHS-96-63). HMOs tend to join Medicare where HMO market
penetration is well-established and capitation payments are high,
notes GAO. Call (202) 512-6000.

        HCFA has slapped intermediate
sanctions on Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts for
"knowingly" supplying misleading marketing information in its
Medicare HMO application. In freezing the HMO's Medicare enrollment
and marketing functions, HCFA levied its first intermediate
sanction on an HMO. Before sanction rules were issued in 1994,
HCFA's only recourse was to yank an HMO's contract.

        HHS awarded $2.5 million in grants
for childrens' emergency medical services. Call (301) 594-1364.

        Medicaid recipients reported bad
health more frequently in 1995 than the prior year, used hospital
rooms twice as often as other groups, and were at least twice as
likely than those with private insurance to have hypertension,
cancer, migraines, emphysema, diabetes and heart failure, reports
the National Health Survey. Call (610) 366-1310.

        Physicians, optometrists,
psychiatrists, labs and durable medical equipment suppliers engaged
in Medicare nursing home billing fraud on a "frequent and
widespread" basis, says a new GAO report (GAO/HEHS-96-18).
Unscrupulous providers often operate their schemes in volume,
inappropriately receive beneficiary information from nursing homes,
and are not flagged by Medicare's automated systems.

        Postpartum programs should include
stabilization in the birth location, home visits and registered
nurse case management, says the American Nurses Assn. Congress may
entertain  maternity stay legislation this spring. Call (202)
651-7023.

        Elimination of the tax subsidy for
employer-provided health benefits would hurt the oldest and sickest
workers, according to the Center for Health Expenditures and
Insurance Studies in the winter issue of Inquiry. Call (716)

Pennsylvania to Mandate 438,000 Into Medicaid Managed
Care


Pennsylvania this month announced plans to mandate 438,000 Medicaid
recipients into HMOs in a five-county area around Philadelphia.
The initiative, dubbed "HealthChoices," is the first step of a
statewide mandatory program to be phased in over the next three
years. The state has operated a limited mandatory managed care
program for 100,000 Philadelphia-area Medicaid recipients since
1986.
Pennsylvania received a Sec. 1915(b) Medicaid waiver from HHS to
implement "HealthChoices" in 1993 under then-Gov. Robert Casey (D).
But the plan was criticized by some groups for lacking Medicaid HMO
regulations, and its implementation was delayed. A class-action
lawsuit was filed and is still pending.
Incoming Gov. Tom Ridge (R) made a number of changes to
HealthChoices before the state issued a draft request for proposals
(RFP) this month.
HMO bids will be awarded in the summer, open enrollment will begin
Aug. 6, and the program will become operational Nov. 1.
Enrollment will be phased in, with certain groups such as AFDC
recipients joining Nov. 1; remaining eligibles will be folded in on
July 1, 1997. Medicaid recipients targeted for 1997 entry may
voluntarily join HMOs sooner.
Recipients who don't select an HMO within a certain time period
will be randomly assigned one.

Changes Made to Address Criticisms

To address a number of criticisms lobbed at the initial
HealthChoices proposal, the department will:

o       Ban HMO direct marketing, such as
door-to-door solicitation, and instead have a benefits consultant
conduct enrollment activities.
o       Carve out behavioral health services
for a separate procurement process. County governments will be
given the first rights of refusal to manage mental health-substance
abuse treatment benefits before a private capitated contractor is
picked.
o       Require HMOs to submit encounter
data and comply with Medicaid HEDIS (WHW 2/5/96, p. 2).
o       Capitate HMOs, build in an allowable
profit margin, and link performance and outcome measures to profit
levels. This addresses concerns raised about the Philadelphia

Medicaid program, whose private contractor was found by the HHS
Inspector General to have made excessive profits. That contract and
program terminates Oct. 31.

o       Make direct payments to hospitals
for disproportionate share and graduate medical education, instead
of including them in HMO capitation payments.

Arkansas Hospitals, State Agree on Medicaid Payment Hikes


Arkansas hospitals and state officials recently sidestepped a
potential Medicaid payment lawsuit by  negotiating an $11
million-$12 million payment hike that will take effect April 1,
pending HCFA's expected approval.
At the heart of the three-part deal negotiated last month is a 16%
increase in the maximum amount Medicaid pays per day for inpatient
services. The increase adds up to a $5 million hike for hospitals.
The per-diem cap has been $584 since 1991, but after the Arkansas
Hospital Assn. argued that 25% of its members' costs were above
that level, the Department of Human Services agreed to raise the
cap to $675.
Second, the agreement would reduce Medicaid hospital copayments,
which in most instances are unpaid by recipients and absorbed by
hospitals. The copayment is currently 50% of hospital costs for the
first inpatient day, but that would be lowered to 10% of each
inpatient day.
Because the average Medicaid hospital length of stay in Arkansas is
under four days, state hospitals stand to gain $6 million from the
reduction in copays. That new policy also contains an economic
incentive for hospitals to reduce inpatient stays, notes James
Teeter, president of the state hospital association.
The third part of the deal is an increase in the Medicaid payment
to hospitals for patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.
Currently, Medicaid contributes the difference between the Medicare
deductible, which is $736, and 50% of the Medicaid hospital per-day
payment. The new Medicaid contribution would be the Medicare
deductible minus only 10% of the Medicaid per diem.
HCFA hasn't yet received the Arkansas Medicaid proposal, but
Teeter, who says the hospitals would sue the state otherwise, is
confident the payment hike will be approved. Arkansas Medicaid
officials, state legislators and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (D) are all
behind the deal.

Louisiana to Require Copayments To Help in Medicaid
Shortfall


Louisiana this month proposed requiring Medicaid recipients to make
nominal copayments for all health care services to help offset a
state budget crunch.
The copayments are expected to generate $21 million annually, in
addition to $10 million currently collected in prescription drug
copayments. Louisiana's Medicaid program is projecting a $450
million shortfall this fiscal year, which ends June 30, and a $330
million shortage in the following fiscal year, says David Hood,
undersecretary of the Department of Health and Hospitals.
More than half the states have adopted cost sharing in their
Medicaid programs, sources say. Louisiana is still looking at other
cuts and savings to balance the Medicaid program budget.
The proposed copays are subject to a two-week public comment period
that began Feb. 13. State officials will make changes after that
and finalize the copayment schedule, effective May 1.
As proposed, Louisiana Medicaid recipients would begin making
sliding-scale copayments, based on ability to pay. Copays would be
$0.50 to $3 for physician office visits, labs and X-ray services;
$25 for inpatient hospital admissions; 5% coinsurance for
ambulatory surgery; and $2 for alcohol and drug abuse treatment.
Children and categorically needy HMO enrollees would be exempt from
copayments. In addition, copays would not be required for
pregnancy, emergency, hospice, family planning and nursing home
services. Thus, about 50% of the state's Medicaid population would
be exempt.
Following the lead of other states, the program will let providers
decide how to collect the copayments.

In addition to the copays, the state is addressing the Medicaid
budget crunch by:

o       Reopening prior-year cost reports
for state hospitals. The department found additional allowable
costs that state hospitals are due from Medicaid, and will get
additional federal matching federal funds for that purpose. While
this move will only provide "one-time" funds, that amount will be
sufficient to solve all but $38 million to $40 million of this
year's shortfall, according to Hood.
o       Looking at changing the way nursing
homes are reimbursed by Medicaid, a move that could save anywhere
from $45 million to $105 million in fiscal 1997, Hood says.
o       Collecting about $25 million in
overpayments to psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and other
types of providers.

The state Medicaid program is looking at piloting a managed care
program and a separate voucher system on a regional basis for the
upcoming fiscal year, but won't move to a statewide managed care
system anytime soon, Hood adds.

Arizona Eyes Waiver to Integrate Medicare, Medicaid
Services


Arizona, the first state to develop a statewide capitated managed
care system that combines Medicaid acute and long-term care
services, is preparing to amend its existing Sec. 1115 waiver to
fully integrate Medicare and Medicaid services.
The state began its Medicaid managed care program in 1982 and added
the long-term care component in 1988. The program provides
institutional, residential and in-home services to elderly and
disabled Medicaid recipients who would normally be put in a nursing
home. Arizona contracts with counties and HMOs for the managed care
program.
As of Oct. 1, 1995, the program served 20,919 recipients. Nearly
half of those were elderly. About 97% of the Medicaid elderly
members in the long-term care program are "dual eligibles," who
also are covered by Medicare.
But coordination with Medicare services and linkages between acute
and long-term care have been hindered by conflicts between Medicare
and Medicaid regulations, says a new report by the National Academy
for State Health Policy.
Although the majority of elderly enrollees are dual eligibles and
receive Medicare services separately, some Medicaid long-term care
program contractors are also Medicare HMOs. If the long-term care
system contractor isn't a Medicare HMO, the contractor must
coordinate care with Medicare providers, the academy notes.
The state hopes HCFA approval of the waiver request will allow
integration of Medicare and Medicaid, and full integration of
acute, behavioral health and long-term care.
Arizona's capitation payment structure has created incentives for
program contractors to serve enrollees in their own homes or in
residential settings, the national academy notes.
As a result of the long-term care program's success, the
HCFA-imposed cap on the number of members who can receive home and
community-based services has been increased from 5% when the
program first began to 40% in 1995, says the academy.

Care System, call (207) 874-6524.

Maryland Hospital Cuts OK'd After Record Profits Reported


Determining that hospitals in Maryland enjoyed record profits last
year, state officials recently decided to pare back hospitals'
revenue stream in an attempt to pass on savings to patients.
Maryland is one of two states that set hospital rates for both
public and private payers.
Hospital net profits increased 93% in the state last year, from
$145.5 million in 1994 to $281.3 million in 1995, according to the
Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission, which regulates
hospital rates. As a percentage of total revenue, net profits went
from around 3.4% to 6.2%, says the commission.
While those rewards "can be attributed, in no small way," to
increased efficiency, the numbers also suggest that the state
rate-setting system "may simply be too generous" to hospitals, says
Commission Chair Charles Fisher.
As a result, the panel engaged in what executive director Robert
Murray called a "contentious" negotiating session with hospitals
and approved a $170.5 million cut in the projected rate increase.
In other words, while hospitals had been scheduled to get a 6.5%
rate increase in April, that bump will instead be around 4.4%. Last
year the commission made a similar 1.4 percentage point baseline
reduction.

Among other commission findings:

o       Hospital costs grew 1.63% in 1995,
below the national average of 1.75%. It's the 19th straight year
Maryland hospitals have outperformed the country in holding down
costs.
o       Hospital charges per case, the
actual bill paid by patients and carriers, increased 3%.
o       The amount of uncompensated care
increased 2.1% to $404.4 million. As a percent of revenue,
uncompensated care costs fell to 8% from 8.22%.

Mass. Providers Claim Vendor Owes Millions; State to
Intervene


Massachusetts mental health providers are prepared to sue the
state's Medicaid managed mental health contractor for $6 million to
$9 million in allegedly unpaid claims unless the providers' demands
are met. The state has promised to help the providers.
The providers, who may sue Mental Health Management of America for
breach of contract, say the vendor trapped them in a "Catch 22" to
avoid paying claims for mental health and substance abuse
treatment. The contractor required preauthorization numbers on
claims and required claims to be submitted within 90 days of
service, then allegedly didn't furnish the preauthorization numbers
promptly enough for providers to meet the 90-day deadline.
"Claims processing was not [Mental Health Management's] strength,"
admits Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the state Division for Medical
Assistance, which oversees Medicaid.
"We'll work this through with providers," he says. "We'll make sure
[the firm] is responsible for complying with the contract. But it
doesn't mean we'll pay all claims."
Bullen noted that Mental Health Management "performed in a superior
fashion in some areas, like quality management."
Nevertheless, Massachusetts didn't renew Mental Health Management's
Medicaid managed care contract. Mental Health Management, owned by
First Financial Management Corp. of Atlanta, got the Massachusetts
Medicaid contract for managed behavioral health care in 1992.
John Kahn, a lawyer representing Mental Health Corp. of
Massachusetts, an organization of 65 mental health agencies
allegedly owed money, asked the contractor to process the
providers' unpaid claims, and suspend requirements related to prior
approval, billing within 90 days, a 365-day payment appeals process
and claims identification numbers.
Kahn says Mental Health Management will meet with the providers
next week on the dispute.
Mental Health Management broke new ground in providing this type of
comprehensive managed mental health care to Medicaid, so naturally
there were growing pains, says Ron Preston, HCFA's associate
regional administrator.
But that's not why the firm's contract wasn't renewed, he
maintains. "Other applicants had more solid applications," Preston
says.
State officials say providers fear Mental Health Management will
disappear without making good on claims owed. "We want to make sure
they do everything in compliance," since the contract will be
closed out in June, says Bullen, whose agency is auditing the
company.
The Medicaid behavioral health vendor was unavailable for comment.
Mental Health Management was paid $11.5 million in administrative
expenses under the Medicaid risk-bearing contract.

STATE BRIEFS


        Ten states enacted laws governing
the administration and financing of child mental health services in
1995, and 15 passed laws governing treatment, says the National
Conference of State Legislatures. For example, New Mexico
eliminated restrictions on behavior modification, Tennessee banned
release of childrens' mental health records to persons accused of
child abuse or neglect, and Missouri required school districts to
educate children placed by mental health or social service
agencies. For details on "Children, Youth and Family Issues," call
(202) 624-5400.

        D.C. Mayor Marion Barry (D) proposed
an 11% Medicaid funding cut in his fiscal 1997 budget. The district
plans to expand its use of managed care. 

        Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton (D)
proposed to phase out the state's tax on physicians. The tax is
part of the 1994 health reform statute, which some lawmakers want
to pare back this session. 

        Low-income Wisconsin residents would
receive health care coverage if they needed it while moving off of
welfare into the workforce, according to reforms proposed by Gov.
Tommy Thompson (R). The state is scheduled to replace the AFDC
welfare program with a work-based system in 1999.

        Alaska, Pennsylvania and Louisiana
could pass provider-supported medical malpractice legislation this
year, according to the American Tort Reform Assn. Meanwhile,
medical liability changes could be rolled back in New Jersey,
Florida, Rhode Island and Utah. Call (202) 682-1022.

        California Medicaid HMOs vary from
plan to plan in the amount of physician services they offer,
according to a recent report by the Center for Health Care Rights.
For example, Universal Care HMO averages 0.37 physician encounters
a year per Medicaid patient, compared with 5.14 at Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan's HMO in southern California. Call (213)
383-4519.

        Hospital spending for acute
myocardial infarction in states with medical malpractice laws, such
as non-economic damage award caps, grew 17% between 1984 and 1990,
compared with 24% in states without such laws, according to
Stanford University economists Daniel Kessler and Mark McClellan.
For ischemic heart disease, spending growth was 17% in states with
medical liability changes and 28% in states without such laws. Call
(415) 723-9193.

MARKET BRIEFING

Most insurers include employers and public liability cover as part of a
specifically designed contractor's package.  A few, such as Commercial
Union and Eagle Star, use their standard liability wordings
appropriately tailored for the risk concerned.  General Accident, which
recently introduced a combined liability policy specifically for the
construction industry, uses instead its more general combined liability
policy where the construction element of the business is less than 10%.

Most contractors' liability covers offer a wide range of extensions,
although policies designed for small businesses may be more restricted,
for example omitting overseas cover.  Some insurers also have standard
endorsements for different trades.

Following a poor safety record and a significant number of death and
injury claims, there are now signs that liability claims experience in
the UK construction industry is improving.  The 1994/95 Health and
Safety Commission annual report, published last November, stated that
fatal injuries in construction during 1994/95 continued the steady
downward trend and were expected to be the lowest in eight years.  The
provisional fatality rate for the construction workforce was 4.7 per
hundred thousand.

In a key move to reduce accidents, the Construction Design and
Management (CDM) Regulations were  introduced on 31 March 1995.  These
implement the design and management aspects of the EC Temporary or
Mobile Construction Sites Directive, placing statutory duties on all
those involved in construction work to minimise accident and health
risks.  To avoid disrupting projects already underway at 31 March,
those involved in existing projects were allowed up to nine months in
which to comply with the regulations - which means that all qualifying
construction work should now be implementing CDM.  The regulations do
not apply to

* construction work, other than demolition, that does not last longer
than 30 working days or 500 person work days and does not involve more
than four people

* construction work for a domestic client

* construction work carried out inside offices and shops or similar
premises without interrupting the normal activities of the premises and
without separating the construction activities from the other
activities

* the maintenance or removal of insulation on pipes, boilers or other
parts of heating or water systems.

Under the new rules, clients, designers, planning supervisors,
principal contractors, contractors and self-employed workers acting as
contractors have clearly defined duties which they must carry out as
far as reasonably practicable.  A key element is the provision and
implementation of a health and safety plan and construction must not
start until this has been prepared.

DISCOUNTED RATES FOR TERRORISM

Pool Re is offering a 20% discount on premium rates for 1996.  Insureds
will be required to pay 60% of the discounted annual premium at the
beginning of the policy period.  The 40% remaining will not be
collected as long as losses are not in excess of #75m.  No claims were
made on the pool last year.

FUTURE FOR CAPTIVES?

Following Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's decision to increase the taxation
of controlled foreign companies from 50% to 90%, AIRMIC's Captive
Special Interest Group has been considering the implications for the
viability of offshore captive insurers owned by UK companies.  It
concludes that

* risk managers are under no pressure to take drastic or immediate
action with regard to the operation of their captive insurers.  Some
major organisations are still actively considering the possibility of
setting up offshore captives

* AIRMIC members' captive insurers have not been established for purely
tax reasons, but to provide the broadest cover to their companies at
lowest prudent cost

* captives are still the critical component of their risk financing
strategies, and provide the ability to meet their needs in the face of
the unpredictability of the insurance and reinsurance markets.

EMSS RESEARCH BEGINS

The Loss Prevention Council (LPC) is collaborating with Imperial
College London to investigate the links between Environmental
Management Systems (EMSs) and insurance.  EMSs are new tools by which
insurers may be able to assess and quantify the environmental
performance of their clients.  The LPC says that governments and
international agencies agree that continued, sustainable economic
development depends on the availability of adequate insurance cover for
environmental risks.  However, insurers are said to be wary of such
risks, particularly because of past experiences in the United States.

A three-year study entitled The Response of the Insurance Industry to
Developments in Environmental Management Systems recently began at the
Centre for Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.  The
research is aimed at analysing the response of insurers to the
introduction of EMSs as expressed in their attitudes towards their
clients' environmental performance, as well as supplying insurers with
information gathered during the study on the usefulness and benefits of
EMSs.

The study will also address the following questions.  What are the main
constraints on the environmental insurance market?  Are these caused by
uncertainties in technical assessment, or other problems such as
long-term uncertainty in legal liability?  How do insurers currently
assess the environmental performance of their clients - if at all?

In the medium term, the study aims to determine whether and to what
extent compliance with EMSs standards supports insurers' own assessment
systems, and also whether and how insurers might effectively use EMSs
in their assessments.

SAFETY SCHEME LAUNCHED

Minister for Local Transport and Road Safety Steven Norris has launched
DriveCare - a safety scheme targeted at commercial vehicles (including
heavy goods, commercial goods vehicles and coaches).  This sector is
responsible for nearly 45,000 of all road accident injuries in the UK.
Similar schemes in use in the USA over the past decade have resulted in
a 25% drop in commercial vehicle accident fatalities.

DriveCare encourages owners and operators of commercial vehicles along
with general motorists to take a pro-active approach to road safety.
Subscribing owners of commercial vehicles display a sticker which
includes a free-phone number on the rear of each vehicle in their
fleet.  Motorists who witness a driver driving dangerously, carelessly,
discourteously or speeding can telephone and lodge their complaint.
This is registered on the DriveCare database and the owner of the
vehicle is immediately faxed with the details of the incident.  The
owner is then in a position to take the necessary steps to counsel or
discipline the driver or provide further driver training.

The system originated in the USA where it is now estimated that over
80% of all commercial vehicles display the sticker.

HOTEL PROTECT

Conference specialist Insurex Expo-Sure launches a new policy for
hoteliers in February.  Hotel Protect provides for all costs which have
been pre-booked, such as deposits, room hire, accommodation or delegate
charges, to be paid back to the conference organiser should delegates
be prevented from arriving by any reason out of their control.  The
insurance is set in place at the time of booking by the hotelier adding
a premium of #1.75 per person per night (plus the hotelier's handling
fee) to the delegate rate.

Initially the policy is available for bookings of a minimum two nights
and is aimed primarily at the conference delegate or group bookings.
The cover also includes roadside assistance whereby a delegate breaking
down en route to the hotel will be towed to the nearest garage,
provided with emergency overnight accommodation if required and given
the cost of onward travel to the original hotel.  Hotel Protect is
underwritten by Home & Overseas.

Clinton Signs Bill Delaying Over-The-Road Bus Accessibility Under ADA

WASHINGTON -- As the Justice Department considers one amendment to the
ADA, another has already been signed into law by President Clinton. The
National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, signed by the president
on Nov. 28, 1995, delays the date by which over-the-road buses must be
accessible under the ADA.
Original ADA regulations called for large over-the-road carriers such as
Greyhound  to be accessible by July 1996, and smaller carriers by 1997.
Those dates, however, were based on the issuance of Department of
Transportation regulations by July 1994. DOT did not release regulations
by 1994 -- in fact, it still has not.
Congress, therefore, moved to amend the ADA so that large and small
carriers have two and three years, respectively, to comply from whatever
date DOT issues its regulations.
According to Maureen McCloskey, who monitors Congress for Paralyzed
Veterans Association, the ADA amendment was placed into the
transportation bill while it was being debated in the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Rep. Bud
Shuster, R-Pa.  The Senate had no ADA provision in its version of the
bill, but Senate officials receded in conference and the bill went to
the president with the ADA provision intact, McCloskey said.
"We're concerned that the disability community was not involved in the
process," McCloskey said. "We had received assurances from both the
minority and the majority that this would not be in the bill. But there
it was."
Disability-rights advocates concede that controversy about accessibility
to over-the-road buses did not cease when the ADA was signed into law in
1990. The Office of Technology Assessment was charged with doing a study
on the best way to provide accessibility to the buses; DOT was to have
based its regulations on the results of the study.
The study, completed in 1993, concluded that each vehicle should be
accessible, whether by a ramp or lift, either vehicle-based or station-
based. The controversy between advocates and bus company officials
simmered as DOT issued its notice of proposed rulemaking in 1994.
According to McCloskey, DOT was considering allowing only a percentage
of buses to be accessible. It also was considering a proposal by bus
companies to use a boarding device, placing a mobility-impaired person
into a regular bus seat and stowing the wheelchair. Advocates prefer
having the wheelchair secured within the bus -- but that tends to take
up more seats and more potential revenue from bus operators, McCloskey
said.
The 1994 deadline passed and DOT didn't issue regulations.
"I understand the bus companies' concern that they have no regulations
to comply with and their statutory deadline is in six months," McCloskey
said. "As far as the ADA being a reasonable law, the extension makes
sense. Other entities had two years after regulations came out to be in
compliance.
"On the other hand, they are the only public entity that hasn't had to
do anything under the ADA. They're being allowed to perpetuate an
inaccessible system. The technology is there. The private buses are
doing it. This is not a technological problem -- it's what the bus
industry is pushing as a financial problem."

WASHINGTON

The Department of Justice has proposed extending the deadline -- by 10
years, in some cases -- for the installation of curb ramps in cities and
towns across the U.S. The surprise announcement was made in a notice of
proposed rulemaking in the Nov. 27, 1995, Federal Register.
If Justice's proposal is realized it would become the most significant
alteration of Americans with Disabilities Act regulations since the
law's passage in 1990. Further, the proposal comes on the heels of
another rollback in ADA regulations that took disability-rights
activists by surprise: In late November President Clinton signed a
transportation bill containing a provision that extended the deadline
for accessibility to over-the-road buses. (Story on page 7.)
Public comment on the curb ramp proposal will be accepted until Jan. 26
-- and there should be plenty of it. For disability-rights advocates,
curb ramps are a basic issue: What good are other accessibility measures
if a person in a wheelchair can't get out of the street? Feelings run
equally deep in municipal governments, where officials say budgets are
being stretched to the limit to comply with this costly unfunded federal
mandate.
The proposed rule would amend Title II regulations to extend the time
period for compliance, to Jan. 26, 2000, for curb ramps serving state
and local government facilities, transportation, places of public
accommodation, other places of employment and the residences of
individuals with disabilities. It would extend the time period for
providing curb ramps at existing pedestrian walkways in other areas to
Jan. 26, 2005.
The proposed rule would not affect a public entity's obligation to
install curb ramps at all newly constructed or altered streets, roads
and highways. (28 C.F.R. Section 35.151(e)) And, public entities that
choose to take advantage of this extension of time must amend their
transition plans to establish specific schedules for meeting the new
deadlines.
What are the current deadlines for curb ramp installation? This has been
a matter of some debate. The provision of curb ramps is linked to the
Title II "program accessibility" standard -- in other words, a public
entity's programs and activities, when viewed in their entirety, must be
readily accessible to persons with disabilities. Title II required
public entities to have achieved program accessibility by Jan. 26, 1992
-- the effective date of Titles II and III. But where structural changes
-- such as curb ramps -- were required for program accessibility, the
ADA provided that such changes be made as expeditiously as possible, but
in no event later than Jan. 26, 1995, unless meeting that deadline would
result in a fundamental alteration of its program or would impose undue
financial and administrative burdens.
That Jan. 26 deadline came and went last year, and most disability-
rights advocates admitted that while some cities had made significant
progress toward full program accessibility, many -- if not most -- had
not. The Department of Justice, in explaining its reasons for proposing
the extension, stated that "it is the Department's hope that this
extension will provide the additional flexibility necessary for state
and local governments to comply with the ADA in light of strained fiscal
resources, and that it will actually increase the number  of curb ramps
that will be installed on this nation's streets." That, too, was the
stated motivation of a group of senators -- former co-sponsors of the
ADA -- who wrote the Department of Justice last year urging it to
consider the revised deadlines.
Justice Department officials could not be reached for further comment
due to the partial shutdown of the federal government, which was ongoing
at presstime.
Maureen McCloskey, who monitors Congress for the Paralyzed Veterans of
America, said members of her organization and the disability community
in general are not pleased by the proposal.
"We're real upset about this," she said. "This directly affects our
members' ability to get around. Local governments had five years since
the ADA was passed. They're not making a ruckus about this; they just
aren't doing anything. And what does this say to the communities that
have complied with the ADA's current provisions?"
Justin Dart, former chairman of the President's Committee on Employment
of People with Disabilities, sums up the arguments on both sides. On one
hand, would an extension of deadlines encourage further non-compliance?
Will further extensions of time be granted after these expire?
Conversely, he also said the revised deadlines are not unlike those
ordered by courts when communities are found to be in violation of the
ADA.
"What will we gain if we defeat the rule change?" he said. "We will
retain the right to sue now. If we sue or threaten to sue every
delinquent community and win, we will probably get court-ordered or
voluntary schedules for compliance that are very similar to the ones
required by the rule change. It will cost money and time. It could, in
some instances, create animosities that become barriers to other agenda
items -- access, programs and funding."
The genesis of the proposal was some of the ADA's staunchest and most
powerful allies in the U.S. Senate: Republican Sens. Bob Dole, John
McCain and Orrin Hatch and Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin and Edward
Kennedy. They sent a letter to the Department of Justice early last
year, stating that "it was our intent to carefully craft ADA to include
fair and balanced provisions and specific safeguards for state and local
governments regarding costs. In this regard, we have heard that curb
cuts are a unique, significant capital expense, and believe that our
intent would be more properly fulfilled over a longer time period."
It had been suggested by some advocates that the proposed rule should
require public entities to establish a formal process through which
individuals with disabilities may request installation of a ramp at
their personal residence -- and that the ramp should be installed within
one year of the request. The Justice Department, however, states that it
"is concerned that the imposition of a requirement to provide curb ramps
at private residences within a year of a request may inhibit the ability
of a public entity to give priority to installing curb ramps on more
heavily traveled routes serving public and commercial facilities."
Justice currently recommends -- but does not require -- the development
of a request procedure. The proposed rule would require public entities
to ensure that curb ramps serving the residences of individuals should
be done by Jan. 26, 2000, and before the construction of ramps at other
residential and non-commercial sites.
The Department of Justice also is seeking comments on:
Costs. Justice is hoping to get beyond anecdotal evidence from state and
local governments and receive specific curb ramp costs, including the
amount of funds used both in terms of gross numbers and percentages of
the city and state budgets.
Transportation. The lack of curb cuts could hamper the move toward
accessible transportation as some bus stops may lack curb ramps for a
longer period of time.

Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Rulemaking Docket 007, P.O. Box

Insurer Refusing to Cover Applicant Because He Is Deaf, Suit Alleges

MINNEAPOLIS -- While most insurance-related ADA suits have so far
focused on disability-based caps or exclusions in coverage provided by
employers, a case here appears to chart new waters: Does an insurer
violate the law if it refuses to write a health insurance policy for an
individual who is deaf?
That's the allegation in a suit filed by James L. Houselog, a 30-year-
old Minnesota man who has been deaf since birth. Houselog was denied
insurance by Continental General Insurance Co. because of his hearing
loss -- even though he has no apparent health problems, said one of his
attorneys, Laura Rovner of the National Center for Law and Deafness in
Washington.
The case has obvious implications for insurers. If Continental's
decision is found to be discriminatory, insurers across the nation could
be forced to re-evaluate their policies on applicants with disabilities.
Employers should keep an eye on the case too, as they are liable if they
offer a policy to employees that is found to be discriminatory.
Access to health insurance has been a long-standing problem for people
with disabilities -- in fact, it was at the top of disability activists'
agenda during the debate for national health care reform in 1994.
However, even staunch disability-rights proponents concede that the ADA
is a civil rights law and not a blueprint for healthcare and insurance
reform. Despite this, ADA suits continue to net favorable settlements
when challenging caps or exclusions in insurance (See Mason Tenders
story on page 1.)
The Minnesota case centers on plaintiff Houselog, a financial consultant
who does not receive health benefits from an employer. He submitted an
application for health and accident insurance to Continental. According
to the suit, the application asked whether he "[e]ver had any
indication, diagnosis or treatment of eyes or ears, including: impaired
sight or hearing?" Houselog answered yes, indicating that he was born
deaf because his mother had rubella while she was pregnant.
According to the suit, Continental denied the application, stating: "In
accordance with our current medical underwriting guidelines, we do
consider applicants with deafness on a substandard basis. Unfortunately,
the state of Minnesota has passed insurance regulation that limits our
ability to offer substandard coverage in Minnesota. Therefore, we are
unable to issue a policy to you." The insurer indicated that it would
have considered Houselog on a "substandard" basis -- in other words, it
would have covered him for only those expenses not related to his
deafness. However, Minnesota recently passed a law forbidding the
writing of substandard policies, Rover said.
"This is the purest form of discrimination," Rovner said. "It's like
racial discrimination; it's like saying we're not going to cover you
because you're black. There is no reason to think that this man, who has
a totally clean health record, would incur any more expenses than a
person who is not deaf."
An official representing Continental declined comment on the case.
Rovner expects the insurer to equate its alleged denial of Houselog's
application to the more common practice of insurers not covering persons
with pre-existing conditions. Rovner also notes that the ADA at 42
U.S.C. Section 12201(c) allows insurers to classify and administer
insurance risks that are consistent with state law.
"The ADA also requires that such a decision be based on actuarial
evidence," Rovner said. "I think their justification is that there is
some kind of actuarial basis that deaf people are a greater risk. But
they haven't presented that to us.
"Plus, they haven't obtained enough information from him to know whether
he's an increased risk. They know that his mother had rubella, that he
was born deaf. The insurance company didn't even get enough information
to know whether he was  totally deaf and therefore wouldn't even need a
hearing aid."
Houselog  asked the Minnesota Department of Commerce to investigate the
alleged denial of insurance. According to the suit, a Continental
official responded to the state inquiry by writing, "Because Mr.
Houselog presented an application with the history of hearing loss, we
were unable to provide a standard policy. We consider applicants with
deafness on a substandard basis."
The state concluded its investigation by informing Houselog that "[i]t
appears that the reply addresses your concerns and answers your
questions. We have closed the file."
Rovner said that, ironically, Minnesota has a law that prohibits the
denial of insurance because of someone's blindness. The law, however,
does not address other disabilities.

WASHINGTON

Employment of people with disabilities in the federal government remains
steady despite government-wide downsizing, according to a report just
released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
"It is gratifying to see that while government continues to downsize and
hiring restrictions at many agencies remain in effect, the number of
people with disabilities in the federal executive branch has actually
risen during the Clinton Administration from 6.9 percent in 1990 to 7.4
percent in 1994," said OPM director Jim King.
The office's report will be used to give agencies up-to-date information
to develop strategic affirmative recruiting plans, and for making
informed and cost-effective human resource decisions, according to OPM.
The report names the Department of Veterans Affairs as the largest
employer of persons with disabilities, employing 22,038 people with
disabilities. This represents 8.4 percent of the work force in that
department. About 13 percent of employees with disabilities in the
federal work force are veterans who are eligible for preference because
they served in combat or suffered a service-connected disability, the
report says.
Other agencies with the best records for hiring individuals with
disabilities, according to the report, are the Navy, Army, Air Force,
Agriculture and Treasury.

Mason Tenders Fund Settles Landmark Case

NEW YORK -- Mason Tenders District Council Welfare Fund will pay some $1
million to settle the government's first suit alleging unlawful ADA/HIV
insurance exclusions under the Americans with Disabilities Act. As part
of the settlement, the fund will pay back medical bills and compensatory
damages to workers with HIV or AIDS whose medical expenses were not
covered.
Terrance Donaghey, whose complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in 1992 got the case started, will receive $16,000 for
emotional distress as well as payment for past medical bills. In all,
the fund will compensate more than 10 workers who had filed complaints
with EEOC and also invite other plan members to file claims if they feel
they have been discriminated against.
The landmark settlement -- believed to be the largest yet in an
insurance exclusion case -- brings to a close the government's first
suit alleging "disability-based distinctions" under the ADA. From the
EEOC's perspective, it emphasizes to employers and insurers that
disability-based distinctions are illegal unless they can be justified.
Government regulations issued just days before Mason Tenders was sued in
1993 state that the so-called distinctions are illegal under the ADA
unless proven by actuarial evidence.
The fund, which provides health benefits to thousands of construction-
related workers in New York, amended its plan in 1991 to, among other
things, exclude coverage for expenses relating to HIV and AIDS. Union
officials had said the decision was prompted by rapidly rising health
care costs and a construction downturn related to the recession of the
early 1990s.
Nevertheless, the EEOC made the elimination of disability-based
distinctions a priority in its ADA enforcement and chose Mason Tenders
as its first target. EEOC went on to sue numerous other funds that had
excluded AIDS or HIV, but  just about all of those cases settled.
"The fact is that when the insurers were told they would have to justify
their denial of coverage, settlements came pretty quickly," said Cary
LaCheen of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, who represented
Donaghey in his private suit against Mason Tenders. "They don't fight
these cases indefinitely."
But Mason Tenders -- unlike most of the other funds sued by EEOC ----
appeared prepared to fight back. Many thought the case would eventually
go to the U.S. Supreme Court and resolve the murky interplay between the
ADA and insurance. While the case never made it to the high court, it
did yield an important decision at the district court level. There, the
fund's motion for summary judgment was denied when a judge held that it
was a covered entity under the ADA -- even though it didn't fit the
typical definition of employer under the act. The judge held that the
fund must justify its exclusions by a sound actuarial basis. (See box on
page 11.)
"The most significant part of the Mason Tenders case, in addition to the
settlement, is the earlier ruling that the plan was covered under the
ADA," LaCheen said. "That was instrumental in leading to the settlement
of this case and probably affected other settlements as well."
The judge's oral opinion -- which was never issued in written form --
relied on a broad interpretation of "employer" in a 2nd Circuit case,
Spirt v. Teachers Insurance Annuity Association, which was brought under
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC, in its interpretive
guidance of ADA regulations, provides that the term "employer" has the
same meaning under ADA as it does under Title VII.
In a brief filed in opposition to the fund's motion for summary
judgment, the EEOC also cited the Spirt case: "In Spirt, a tenured
university professor sued the independent insurance company and pension
fund that managed the university's retirement fund to challenge under
Title VII their use of sex-based mortality tables to compute lower
annuity payments for female retirees. Although the professor was not an
employee [of the insurance company or the fund] in any commonly
understood sense, the court of appeals held that the defendants, which
exist solely for the purpose of enabling universities to delegate their
responsibility to provide retirement benefits for their employees, are
so closely intertwined with those universities ... that they must be
deemed an employer for purposes of Title VII."
The Mason Tenders judge accepted EEOC's argument that the fund, too,
exists solely for the purpose of enabling contributing employers to
delegate their responsibility to provide health benefits for their
employees.
"These settlements send a clear signal to other insurers that they
cannot discriminate on the basis of disability," LaCheen said. "People
with disabilities should come forward and file complaints with EEOC
about disability discrimination in insurance they receive through work.
You don't need a lawyer to file a complaint."
Attorneys representing the Mason Tenders fund did not return phone calls
seeking comment on the case. EEOC officials could not be reached for
comment due to the partial government shutdown, which was ongoing at
press time.

In Settling Suit, City Agrees to Accelerate Installation of Curb Ramps

PHILADELPHIA -- The proposed deadline extension for the installation of
curb ramps appears to have come too late for the city. Then again,
perhaps that's not surprising. No other major city in the nation has
been the target of more litigation concerning the accessibility of its
streets and sidewalks under ADA's Title II.
Last year the city appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court a
lower court ruling that said it must construct curb ramps on all streets
it resurfaced since Jan. 26, 1992 -- the effective date of Title II.
The high court declined to review the 3rd Circuit case, Kinney v.
Yerusalim, 4 NDLR Paragraph 278 (3rd Cir. 1993).
And just last month, in settling a suit brought by 20 persons with
mobility impairments, the city agreed to adopt a new transition plan and
accelerate its schedule for curb ramp installation citywide. Under the
new plan, the city will install curb ramps on virtually all
intersections within the Center City district by Dec. 31, 1996. The plan
also calls for the city to install curb ramps throughout all
Philadelphia by Dec. 31, 2001 -- nine years earlier than stated in the
city's pre-lawsuit transition plan.
The proposed settlement agreement will not become effective unless it is
approved by a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania. A hearing is scheduled later this month.
Persons with mobility impairments sued the city last year, alleging that
its transition plan for installing curb ramps did not give priority to
streets near state and local government offices and facilities,
transportation, places of public accommodation, and employers -- as is
required by ADA regulations at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.150(d)(2). The plan
did not identify any specific priorities nor did it identify  the date
by which curb ramps would be installed, according to the suit.
Title II regulations required all public entities to set a transition
plan -- by January 1992 -- for areas where structural changes to
existing facilities were required to comply with the ADA. In addition to
establishing a plan to install curb ramps at existing facilities, the
ADA at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.151(e) requires that all newly constructed
or altered streets must contain curb ramps.
City officials could not be reached for comment on the settlement
agreement. However, when the suit was filed last year, officials said
the city was making progress on the curb ramp project, which it said
would take 10 years and $100 million to complete. Plaintiffs' attorney
Stephen Gold said the city had spent only $1 million installing curb
ramps over the last three years.
As part of the settlement agreement, the city will provide plaintiffs
with annual status reports containing detailed information about its
compliance with the new transition plan. Plaintiffs may remedy any
violations through motions to enforce the agreement if resorting to a
dispute resolution process proves unsuccessful.
Gold said the Justice Department's proposal to extend the curb ramp
deadline should have no effect on this case.

UPDATE

CLEVELAND -- A football fan who is hearing-impaired has failed to
convince the 6th Circuit that the National Football League is violating
the ADA when it "blacks out"  local TV broadcast of home games that are
not sold out 72 hours before game time. Thomas Stoutenborough was
appealing a district court's decision to grant the NFL's motion to
dismiss. In essence, Stoutenborough alleged that the blackout unlawfully
discriminates against persons with hearing impairments because they have
no other way to access the game. Thus, they are denied the
"substantially equal" access that they claim the ADA requires. The
appeals court, however, ruled that the blackout rule is not
discriminatory because it applies equally to the hearing-impaired  and
non-hearing-impaired population. The court also called "irrelevant" the
fact that hearing individuals may be able to listen to a blacked-out
game on radio. The NFL blackout rule does not affect radio broadcasts,
according to the court.
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has announced two settlements
involving restaurants. In northern Michigan, the owner of the well-known
Bear Lake Tavern agreed to make its restrooms accessible to persons with
disabilities. The settlement stems from a civil suit filed by the
department against owner James O. Moyes, who allegedly refused to make
the restaurant more accessible. In addition to altering restrooms, the
restaurant installed a ramp at the entrance, designated two accessible
parking spaces and lowered the public telephone. Moyes also agreed to
pay undisclosed damages. In Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., the Raindancer
Restaurant built a ramp and made its restroom accessible. Two
complainants also received $900 worth of gift certificates for meals at
the restaurant.
CHICAGO -- The Chicago Cubs professional baseball team has agreed to
make major renovations at Wrigley Field to bring the 83-year-old stadium
into compliance with ADA's Title III.  An elevator to the stadium's
terrace level will be installed, more than doubling the number of
reserved accessible seats. Cubs officials also agreed to correct alleged
deficiencies in Wrigley's washrooms and concession stands. Accessible
parking also will be expanded. The Cubs were sued by the Legal Clinic
for the Disabled last year after people with disabilities filed
complaints. The settlement agreement was finalized just two months
before a trial was set to begin. Under terms of the agreement, Cubs
management has until April to make the stadium accessible under the ADA.
The Cubs also agreed to publish a brochure describing the facilities and
arrangements made for persons with disabilities. Finally, the club will
pay Legal Clinic for the Disabled $20,000, which includes a
reimbursement to plaintiffs for the costs of the suit.

CZECH MATES?

HARD ON THE HEELS of complex changes in the ownership of major Czech
banks in November, one of the results of which was control of Kreditni
banka Plzen by Ceska pojistovna as, Prague (EEIR061/13), came some
major changes in the shareholdings of the Czech Republic's largest
insurer itself. Just before Christmas, it was revealed that PPF
Burzovni Spolecnost as (PPF Stock Exchange Co Ltd, PPF BS), a
subsidiary of Privni Privatizacni Fond as (PPF), had acquired an 11.72%
stake from Ceska sporitelna (EEIR062/14). Shortly thereafter, it also
agreed to purchase a further 7.69% from Interbanka, and PPF announced
that it intended to make further purchases in the market to bring its
stake up to 20%, the maximum permitted in a Czech financial institution
by a single investment fund or fund group.

The price was not disclosed, but banking sources estimated a price in
the region of Kc5,000 (US$192) per share, five times nominal value and
at a premium of just over 25% to the Kc3,990 quoted on the Prague stock
exchange on 15 December, the last trading day of the year. (CP shares
were at their 1995 high of Kc6,090 in January, with a low in April of
Kc3,660). Ceska sporitelna had sold its stake, it was speculated,
because of its need for funds to make an increase of Kc7bn in bad debt
provisions to a total of Kc23bn for 1995. It also sold shares in some
of its investment fund subsidiaries to Bankers Trust for Kc6.7bn.

PPF BS director Jaromir Proks stressed that the CP stake had been
bought for long-term investment purposes, and declined to comment when
asked if talks were under way with other CP shareholders. Some
observers retain suspicions that, as with the KBP/Agrobanka share
purchases, there is a "hidden hand" involved. Initial press speculation
that this was Allianz AG Holding, Munich, was quickly denied - and
indeed represented nothing more than the rounding up of the usual
suspects. The idea that the orchestrator is Ceskoslovenska obchodni
banka (CSOB) is perhaps more plausible (EEIR060/14, EEIR056/13). It has
a 14% stake currently, and may well be interested in increasing it.
CSOB's net profit for 1995 (on preliminary unaudited figures) was
Kc4.1bn, up 115% on 1994.

Transfer to PPF BS of the majority of the CP shares from Ceska
sporitelna, and those from Interbanka, was to be approved by the
control committee of the insurer (its supervisory board) on 11 January:
the 7.69% Interbanka stake, and the same proportion of the stake held
by Ceska sporitelna, are registered shares which can only change hands
with company approval. Control Committee chairman Pavel Kavanek (a
general manager of CSOB) had indicated in December that there were no
obstacles to the transfers, but in the event the committee declined to
approve it. Officially, a discussion took place between the 12 members
of the committee (of which seven represent shareholders) on whether to
retain the present diversified shareholding structure - which most
members probably support - or whether to allow a shareholder with
greater influence. After this, "the committee unanimously concluded
that it is first of all reasonable to reach a consensus of owners and
formalise it through an agreement."

In reality, it was later suggested, the implacable opposition of a
director representing a 10% shareholder had been at the root of the
committee's refusal. The two 10% shareholders are Komercni banka and
Investicni a postovni banka (IB), and the finger was pointed at the
latter as the one mainly opposing the entry of a large shareholder.
Other sources supposedly equally close to the negotiations suggested
that all the large bank shareholders were also opposed to it. (As it
happens, IPB was also the bank which was worsted in the Agrobanka
battle.)

Of CP's total shares, 73.08% are in the form of registered shares; of
the 36.92% freely tradeable bearer shares, 15% were held by the public
at the end of 1994. The largest single shareholder remains the National
Property Fund (26.27%), followed by CSOB (14%), Komercni banka and IPB
(10% each), Restitution Fund (3%) and employees (5%). National Property
Fund chairman Roman Ceska said on 16 January that it was not opposed to
the share transfers, but the decision was up to the other shareholders.

PPF Investicni Spolecnost responded by calling an EGM with the
intention of proposing board changes, executive director Ladislav
Bartonicek said in mid-January. Although its intended stake includes a
15.4% block of bearer shares, 4% of bearer shares acquired from Ceska
sporitelna and a proxy granted by Interbanka for its 7.69% in
registered shares gave it the 10% representation required to call an
AGM, the CP board said on 17 January. The EGM will also consider
changes to the company's articles of incorporation and executive
bodies. The supervisory board will hold an extraordinary meeting of its
own prior to the EGM, for which no date had been set as EEIR went to
press.

CP PROFITS RISE

According to unaudited preliminary results released this month, CP's
net profit in 1995 was Kc405.5m, up from Kc73m in 1994, and 45% up on
the original estimate for the year. The target for 1996 is Kc470m. Non-
life reserves increased from Kc10.6bn at the end of 1994 to Kc14.1bn at
the end of 1995, and life reserves from Kc48.3bn to Kc51.9bn.

CP INCREASES STAKE IN KREDITNI BANKA PLZEN

At the end of 1995, CP increased its stake in Kreditni banka Plzen
(EEIR062/14, 061/13) from 56% to 61.26% through a further issue of new
shares. With current paid up capital of Kc1.86bn (US$71.5m), Kreditni
banka is the sixth largest in the country.

CR: MTPL RATES

Thanks to the Czech reader who points out that the average increase in
1996 MTPL rates for cars in the Czech Republic is not 13% (EEIR062/12),
but 29% to 40%, while rates for motorcycles are 29% to 41% lower. The
13% figure (12.7%, in fact) represents the anticipated increase in MTPL
premium for Ceska pojistovna as, Prague, as monopoly carrier, which was
Kc3.6bn (US$132.5m) in 1994.

SR: MTPL TO BE FREED IN 1998?

In an article in the local press, Imrich Fekete of the Green Card
office of Slovenska poistovna as, Bratislava, said that he expected a
new system of compulsory motor TPL open to the whole insurance market
rather than operated as a monopoly by SP, to be introduced from 1
January 1998. The need for such a slow transition was partly due to the
social consequences of the change resulting from the expected sharp
increase in MTPL costs for private cars, but also because of a daunting
list of legal and infrastructure preconditions which had to be
completed first. Mr Fekete's list is worthy of study, especially in
countries of the FSU which are considering introduction of compulsory
MTPL from scratch in a short space of time.

1) New legislation on compulsory MTPL insurance which conforms with EU
guidelines.

2) Creation of a central register of all motor vehicles in cooperation
with the police authorities, including details of the insurance
carrier, and drawing up a sanctions scheme for uninsured vehicles.

3) Legal solution as on insuring vehicles for the preliminary period
between purchase of the vehicle and signing an insurance policy.

4) Categorisation of motor vehicles for rating purposes.

5) Issuing of a Finance Ministry order supplementary to the MTPL law
setting out insurance limits, the bonus-malus system, and indemnity in
case of loss caused by an unknown or uninsured vehicle, etc.

6) Issuing of a standard form of general insurance conditions for MTPL
insurance.

7) Signing of a framework agreement between MTPL and motor damage
insurers on apportioning losses.

8) Establishment of a Green Card Office of the Slovak Republic, a
Guarantee Fund, an Association of Frontier Insurers, and securing the
finance for these.

CR: NINE HEALTH FUNDS TO GO?

On 21 December, Parliament approved the 1996 financial plans of nine of
the country's 27 health insurance funds, in addition to the five
approved in November (EEIR062/13). The additional nine were Zeleznicni
ZP Gral, Garant Hospital, Vojenska ZP, Moravska ZP, Bankovni ZP,
Stavebni ZP, Revirni ZP, Crystal ZP, and REZAPO.

Four more - ZP Ministerstva Vnitra, Mendlova ZP, ZP Atlas and ZP Prima
- secured preliminary approval from the Health Ministry this month, but
after expected Finance Ministry approval will still need that of the
final Parliamentary hearing on the matter in February. Of those which
had still not secured approval, and are therefore expected to
disappear, Prima Plzen announced plans to merge with Crystal, subject
to Health Ministry approval, as are at least five of the others. Merger
will assist some of the approved but smaller funds to meet the minimum
requirement of 50,000 insureds.

CR: POOR RETURNS FOR PENSION FUNDS

According to Czech Statistics Office figures, in Q1-Q3 1995, the 40
active pension funds made a consolidated loss of Kc244m (US$9.4m), with
total costs and expenses of Kc3.2bn, premium income of Kc3.5bn and
other income for funds' own products and services Kc109m. Consolidated
equity capital (including operating results) totalled Kc3bn and pension
reserves Kc1.7bn. Membership totalled over 1m.

Average yields for 1995 year are expected to be between 5% and 10%,
barely above an inflation rate expected to turn out at 9.1%. According
to preliminary figures, the highest yields for insureds are expected to
be achieved by

* Penzijni Fond Multi (11%)
* Penzijni Fond Energie (10.6%)
* Podnikatelsky Penzijni Fond (Entrepreneurs PF) (minimum 10%)
* Penzijni Fond Ceske Pojistovny (Ceska pojistovna as, Prague) (10%)
* Vojensky Otevreny Penzijni Fond (Military Open PF)
  (minimum 8.5% to 8.7%) and
* Penzijni Fond Winterthur (8%).

Other funds are expected to provide much lower yields, including Zemsky
Penzijni Fond (Regional PF) (6%) and Penzijni Fond Thalie (5%), and
some such as Stavebni Penzijni Fond Ceske Republicky (Construction PF
of the CR) no yield at all, since they returned a financial loss for
the year. The largest fund in this position is expected to be
Sporitelni Penzijni Fond (Savings PF).

On 21 December, an "association agreement" was signed between Penzijni
Fond Energie, Penzijni Fond Koruna and Penzijni Fond Skoda. The three
are also interested in pursuing talks about co-operation or merger with
other funds.

BANK MERGERS

On 25 January, Czech National Bank deputy governor Pavel Kysilka said
that problems in the Czech banking sector affected some large banks as
well as smaller ones. In order to meet the requirements of future EU
membership, Czech banks "must undergo a process of more fusions and
megafusions, searching for foreign partners, raising basic capital and
being more specialized in their focus," he said. The future policy of
the Central Bank would take account of these necessities, he told a
seminar in Prague on preparations for EU membership.

Four banks have failed since 1989, and a rescue plan is currently
underway for Ekoagrobanka.

PLZENSKA BANKA SHARE OFFER

According to an opinion poll by the Institute for the Research of
Public Opinion, attempts by Plzenska banka to buy large quantities of
shares acquired by individuals during voucher privatization
(EEIR061/13) are unlikely to be very successful. It sent 5.5m letters
to shareholders. The poll found that 56% of respondents had little or
no interest in the offer, 25% some interest, and 7% very interested.

GRECO

A new entrant to the Czech intermediary market (as well as the 43rd
subsidiary of machinery and engineering company Skoda Plzen) is Skoda
Pojistovaci Management sro, Plzen, in which the local subsidiary of
GrECo International AG, Vienna, has a 26% stake. The new entity appears
to be the first German-style captive broker to be established in
central Europe, and will act as broker and risk management consultant
to the Skoda Plzen group, employees and associated companies, which
increasingly include activities unconnected with heavy engineering.

KOOPERATIVA

Dr Gunter Geyer, deputy general director of Wiener Stadtische
Allgemeine Versicherung, Vienna, and a board member of Kooperativa
druzstevna poistovna as, Bratislava, told the Austrian insurer's staff
magazine that Kooperativa Bratislava's premium income for 1995 would
reach approximately SK780m (US$28m), an increase of over 30% on 1994.

With reference to the 51/49 Kooperativa/Wiener Stadtische broking joint
venture InExCo, Bratislava (EEIR062/14), the same magazine noted that
it was intended to develop Kooperativa's industrial business, since
there remained a severe shortage of qualified brokers with experience
of risk management, risk analysis and loss protection in Slovakia.

HASICSKA (BRATISLAVA)

Hasicska poistovna as (Fire Brigade Insurance Co), Bratislava, has now
begun operating, with share capital of SK118m (US$3.9m), which was
expected to be raised by a further SK20m this month, and intended to
fund entry into life as well as non-life, ceo Peter Hargas said.
Shareholders include the municipalities of Bratislava and Kosice, and
the investment fund Karpaty. It has main offices in Bratislava, Kosice,
Banska Bystrica and Presov, and plans others in Nitra and Zilina.
Distribution will include sales through voluntary fire brigade members,
which are organised into 2,800 units throughout the country. Mr Hargas
is a former Bratislava brigade commander. He said the name had been
chosen partly to thwart efforts by the Czech Hasicska vzajemna
pojistovna as (Fire Brigade Mutual Insurance Co), Prague, to enter the
Slovak market.

VSZP

There was general chaos in late November and early January at the
Bratislava branch of state health insurer Vseobecna Zdravotna Poistovna
(VsZP) as clients waited in long queues to obtain new registration
cards. A number of private sector health insurers complained that
clients who decided as a result to change their health insurer were
hindered by bureaucratic obstacles erected by VsZP, a fairly common
sort of complaint (EEIR059/15).

The 1996 budget of VsZP anticipates income of SK26.25bn (US$870m) and
4.1m insureds, with monthly expenditure per insured of SK850.

COMPULSORY MTPL POSTPONED

The Latvian government has announced that the introduction of
compulsory motor TPL will be postponed until 1 July. The new
legislation is subject to a press campaign against its introduction, as
is also understood to be opposed by elements of the Finance Ministry of
the new government. A Latvian Motor Bureau has been established, headed
by representatives of Balta and BTA, both Riga.

In Lithuania, where new legislation is still being prepared, proposals
to introduce compulsory MTPL have also been put back. In Estonia, MTPL
losses ran at 120% to 130% for 1994-95, and rates have been increased
substantially this year.

The reinsurance of the Estonian Green Card Pool is probably the largest
reinsurance treaty from the region, led at Lloyd's with support from
Swiss Reinsurance Co, Zurich, Kolnische RuckversicherungsGes AG,
Cologne, and SOREMA, Paris.

The leading motor casco insurers in Latvia are Saules Laiks, Balta and
Pareks.

Motor theft in Estonia declined by 40% in the first six months of 1995
compared with the previous year.

ESTONIA: 1995 11 MONTH DATA

According to data from the Estonian insurance supervisor, non-life
premium for the first 11 months of 1995 totalled EK449.123m (US$38m),
and claims EK214.295 (47.7%). Motor TPL represented EK218.560m, 48.7%
of total premium, and MTPL claims EK129.367m, 59.2% of premium and
60.4% of total claims.

For the first ten months of 1995, for which life premium totalled
EK34.5m and non-life EK401.9m, RAS Eesti Kindlustus, Tallinn, had
premium of EK109.7m (a market share of about a quarter) and claims of
EK60.1m (54.8% of premium). ASA Kindlustus, Tallinn, was second
largest, with premium of EK82.7m (market share of 18% to 19%) and
claims of EK52.6m (63.6% of premium). ASA was partly responsible for
the scrutiny of all reinsurance contracts by the insurance superior,
following its inability to collect on a reinsurance placed with a
Florida-based company identified to EEIR as Olympia. This matter was
settled in ASA's favour by the arbitration court in Estonia, which is a
signatory to international arbitration conventions.

Commercial property market leader BK Baltic Insurance Co (BICO),
Tallinn, had premium of EK29.6m (market share of about 7%), with claims
of EK6.9m (23.3% of premium). Insurance supervisor Ellen Ridaste
estimated that non-life premium for 1995 would reach EK500m, increasing
to EK650m to EK700m in 1996.

FORTUNA

Dripdev reported just before Christmas that Fortuna Lebensversicherung
Ges, Adliswil, had acknowledged having made "regrettable mistakes" by
permitting the sale of insurance policies on an unlicensed basis in
Estonia through the Riga arm of pyramid sales intermediary Safe-Invest
(EEIR062/2, and passim). Dripdev said that the company had agreed to
cease any sales in Estonia, and make refunds on all contracts taken out
before 31 October 1995 according to Swiss law. Given the relatively
short time which the policies are likely to have been in force, the
refunds on a typical Safe-Invest-sold 10 or 15 year policy are likely
to be very small, or non-existent.

OREL/BALKAN

At a general meeting on 2 January, the shareholders of ZPK Orel AD,
Sofia, and SZPK Balkan AD, Sofia, a specialist insurer associated with
the Orel group, approved a merger between the two, and specialist
health insurer ZOZAD Zakrila, Sofia, approved merger with Orel life
affiliate ZPK Fenix AD, Sofia, which will vote on the proposal in
February.

The mergers are partly with the requirements of the Insurance Bill
currently being debated in Parliament in mind. This proposes an
increase in the minimum capital for insurers to Leva200m (US$2.75m) (a
figure of Leva100m is also being discussed), as well as increasing
credibility abroad: Orel, which is currently capitalised at Leva100m,
is said to be keen to secure the support of Swiss Reinsurance Co,
Zurich. Balkan began operations in 1994 with the minimum legally
required capital of Leva10m, with Orel G Holding AD, Sofia, as the
leading shareholder with 40%, along with TSBank (10%), Angel (11%), the
Sinit motor trading company, Postal Bank (2%) and some individual
investors. It was mainly aiming at the financial insurance market
(EEIR049/10), but by last Spring it had become clear that this market
was weak, and slow-growing. Nor could the shareholders reach agreement
on a development strategy, and some withdrew.

Zakrila was set up in 1993 with capital of Leva10m (EEIR026/6) by Orel
G, Sirbank, Feniks (which currently has registered capital of Leva50m)
and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions, and planned to offer
group medical insurance. This market did not develop as hoped either,
partly because of an absence of a legislative structure.

Other similar mergers are expected to accelerate, as the "back-kitchen"
insurers unable to raise minimum capital 20 times the current level are
faced with liquidation, sale or transformation into an agency of a
larger company.

DZI

Darshaven Zastrachovatelen Institut (DZI), Sofia, has announced its
1996 interest rates for life policies, which will be 34% for five year
policies (currently about 40% of the portfolio), 38% for six to 10 year
policies (about 30% of the portfolio) and 44% for policies over 10
years (also about 30% of the portfolio). Deputy chairman Valery Alexiev
said that such inflation-proofing could be offered because 75% to 80%
of reserves were invested in government securities. Mr Alexiev added
that the fastest-growing product is family and children's policies,
typically for terms of 14 to 18 years. In 1995 400,000 new customers
bought policies, yielding premium of Leva4.1bn (US$56m), Mr Alexiev
said. Life insurance had contributed a further Leva200m. 1995 premium
for both life and non-life is estimated to have reached Leva5bn.

DZI, as a major shareholder in Razvitie Investment Fund, announced this
month that it will set up a fund to participate in this year's voucher
privatisation programme. Other shareholders, including the State
Savings Bank, United Bulgarian Bank and the Intransmash engineering
company, are also expected to participate. Privatization funds must
have registered capital of at least Leva70m, at least Leva10m of the
total in cash. The remainder may be made up with vouchers, which have a
nominal value Leva25,000.

RUSSIA: AMENDMENTS VETOED AGAIN

On 3 January President Boris Yeltsin vetoed the bill amending the law
On insurance for the second time, a spokesman for the presidential
press service announced. In a letter to the Duma, President Yeltsin
said that it had ignored his criticisms of the bill made in October
(EEIR061/6). He again rejected the proposed restrictions on the
corporate form of insurers on the grounds that it is inconsistent with
"the equality of participants in civil legal relations" laid down in
the Civil Code (and originally intended, no doubt, to prevent the
private sector being discriminated against to the benefit of the state
sector. It is a fundamental principle of Russian jurisprudence, on a
Napoleonic as much as a Soviet basis, that subordinate legislation
cannot amend primary legislation. Thus broadly speaking the
Constitution takes precedence, followed by international treaties,
Codes, laws, decrees and normative acts.) Nor has the President
relented in his opposition to a compulsory separation of life and non-
life insurance, which he said "disregards the condition of the Russian
insurance market" - the "special circumstances" argument familiar to
anyone who has discussed economics with a group of Russians - and will
not enable the insurers to improve their financial position, but on the
contrary, "will split numerous insurance companies and, in the last
analysis, reduce the insurance market." President Yeltsin also objected
to the restriction of reinsurance to classes for which insurers have a
primary licence, which he said "contravened the general principles of
reinsurance". He made "numerous" other additions and amendments, the
spokesman said, which were no doubt equally insightful.

RUSSIA: FOREX POLICIES PERMITTED

From 1 February, Russian insurers will be more or less free to engage
in insurance in foreign currency both inside and outside the country,
when new procedures issued by the Central Bank come into force. The new
measures, for which insurers have been waiting for close on three
years, were announced by the Bank's head of foreign currency regulation
and control, Viktor Melnikov, in mid-December.

Insurers will be able to insure and reinsure with foreign parties free
of Central Bank restriction, and settlement in foreign currency between
insurers and resident insureds is permitted for a wide range of listed
categories of insurance. Potentially the most far-reaching change is
permission for insurers to settle claims in hard currency with resident
individual insureds for life, health, accident and voluntary medical
insurance.

For most of the other approved settlement categories, there is an
obvious foreign currency risk element. For individual resident
insureds, these categories are the luggage of individuals leaving the
RF, TPL for private vehicles going abroad, and defined real estate
outside the country.

For settlements between insurers and insured legal entities, the list
of permitted settlement categories is

* goods being imported into or exported from Russian customs territory
(the distinction may be important in view of the customs unions with
Belarus and Kazakhstan);

* ground vehicles, aircraft and river and sea vessels moved through the
customs territory of the RF and used in international transportation;

* liability to non-residents by owners of vehicles used in
international transportation;

* accidents to resident individuals leaving the country on business;

* CAR/EAR abroad;

* liability for export loans;

* transportation and storage of foreign currency, in cash or
securities;

* foreign-manufactured vehicles and equipment owned by resident
organisations and purchased for foreign currency.

At one time, insurers were permitted not only to insure foreign
equipment in hard currency, but also the loss of production from the
equipment. This appears to have been one of those areas which
subsequently became technically a breach of Central Bank instructions,
but remains unclear under the new regulations.

Mr Melnikov said the regulations had been amended partly to reflect
market developments and the introduction of new classes of business.
Some transactions had not previously been officially sanctioned, and
insurers engaged in them were technically in breach of regulations, he
said. Secondly, foreign companies had, he claimed, secured a large
share of the market, and the new rules, by putting foreign and domestic
insurers on the same footing, would help to reduce the outflow of
foreign currency.

BELARUS: PROPOSED LEGISLATION

The first meeting of the Insurance Council of the Cabinet of Ministers
of Belarus (EEIR062/5) discussed four draft government resolutions, On
Insurance Brokers, On the Investment Activities of Insurance Companies,
On Compulsory Insurance of Passengers and On Compulsory Insurance of
the Staff of the Taxation Service.

The latter two measures are both intended to apply on a temporary
basis. The Council recommended the adoption of the law on passenger
insurance, which was issued as a government resolution in mid-January.
Cover against accidental death is made mandatory for all forms of
public transport, whether state- or privately-owned introducing
mandatory, and covers all passengers in possession of a ticket from
arrival at the point of departure. The sum insured is 100 minimum
wages, or BR6m (US$520), with the premium set at 2% of the ticket price
and included in the ticket cost. The scheme will be administered by
Belgosstrakh SKARB, Minsk, but will be superceded at some point in the
future by new comprehensive legislation On Transporter's Liability.

The proposal on compulsory [life] insurance for taxation service
personnel stands in the same relationship to planned legislation On
Compulsory Insurance of Civil Servants, which will replace the
collection of measures left over from Soviet times or implemented
since, whether still put into practice or not.

A Cabinet resolution has also, as expected (EEIR062/5), instructed the
Ministries of Finance, Economy and State Property to draw up plans for
a "national system of reinsurance" in the form of a Belarussian
National Reinsurance Society (BNRS) as an open joint stock company with
minimum statutory fund of US$6m, and a state shareholding of at least
30%. Its activities will be supervised by Belgosstrakhnadsor, and
participation is planned to be open to foreign reinsurance companies.

The Council also discussed the funding of a training centre for
insurance. At the meeting of the German-Belarussian Insurance Working
Group in Berlin in November (EEIR062/5), the German government agreed
in principle to provide DM3.5m (US$2.4m) in funding, provided the
Belarus government considered it an immediate priority, Belarus Market
reported last month.

Currently, some insurance training is provided by the Minsk Academy of
Management, founded in 1991. Its two year course includes market
economics, management, the theory and classification of risks,
commercial insurance, reinsurance, the international insurance market,
regulation, and insurance company management, Vice Rector Alexander
Golovachkov told the local Insurance News. It works closely with
Belgosstrakhnadsor, which assists in course organisation and assessment
of diplomas, he added. The Academy plans in future to provide
specialist insurance education for professional in other fields, for
example so that doctors will be able to acquire expertise in medical
insurance.

In late 1995, there were 82 insurers operating in Belarus, according to
Belgosstrakhnadzor. Fifteen went bankrupt in 1994, and about the same
number were not expected to survive 1995. Belgosstrakhnadsor sent
letters to the owners of ten insurers ordering them to cease activity,
return their registrations and set up liquidation committees, on the
grounds of financial instability, assets below the legal minimum of
5,000 minimum salaries (BR300m, US$26,000), etc. The ten were Belavers,
Belvarta, Belvest-Grodno, Kredo, Lidors, Olimpium, Polar, Rabel, Raise

KAZAKHSTAN: NEW LAW "IRREVERSIBLE"

In an interview with Kazakhstanskaya Pravda this month, newly-appointed
chairman of Kazakhstan Gosstrakhnadzor, Oskar Ler, described the new
insurance law (EEIR060/1) as "a serious step forward" which
demonopolised the insurance industry and created the conditions for
free competition both for state and private sector and insurers. It had
been positively received by foreign companies and investors, and now
the domestic market was open to foreign insurers, they were considering
how to invest, he said.

The cynical interviewer asked whether the law would change anything, as
"It is well known that with normative acts any pro-market law can be
turned into its opposite." "That cannot be," Mr Ler replied. "Our
market needs to be integrated with the CIS economies, and enter into
the world market," he added, and the needed foreign investment would
not be forthcoming without a positive business climate, including a
fully-formed system of insurance and reinsurance. The law would
stimulate the formation of financially stable insurance reserves
companies backed by major financial and industrial groups and those
insurers which had already acquired sufficient capital, expertise and
assets. Gosstrakhnadzor would supervise, development policy and assist
with training. A seminar on insurance accounting was held in December,
and an international seminar on reinsurance was due to take place in
January.

Among Gosstraknadzor's proposals were the transfer of the guaranteeing
of financial risks from government to the insurance market. A truly
competitive environment lay in combining state and private sector,
compulsory and voluntary insurances, he said.

Insurance joint ventures and a system of reinsurance with foreign
reinsurers would enable the possibilities of the Kazakh market to cover
major risks to be utilised to the full, Mr Ler said. It was imperative
to use international professional experience to develop the market.
Local insurers would find it useful to work alongside the world's
leading insurers, consultants, brokers, and other professionals. The
entry of foreign insurers and reinsurers would, however, be conditional
on guarantees of solvency and financial stability, and before seeking
reinsurance abroad, the Kazakh market would have to be exploited to the
full through coinsurance and "other groupings of insurers".

A priority for the future was the development of long-term life and
pensions insurances, as well as compulsory motor TPL in line with
international practice, for both privately and commercially owned
vehicles. Development of compulsory medical insurance was the
responsibility of the state social insurance system, but voluntary
medical insurance would be an important complement to it, and "much
could be done" by co-operation between medical and insurance
professionals, he said. In the context of the new law the state
insurance company would also have to be reorganised to maximise the use
of professionalism and assets.

Mr Ler said that he saw the Union of Insurers of Kazakhstan as an ally,
not an opponent, since they shared mutual interests. A period of three
to five years would be needed for the formation of stable, solvent
insurers, and much depended on the progress of privatization, the
banking sector, and other factors, Mr Ler said. "We will have a
civilised insurance market, however, because there is a legal basis for
it, and a recognition of its importance. There is a great desire in the
government of Kazakhstan that we should have a normal insurance
market," he concluded.

BELINGOSSTRAKH

In the November issue of Belarussian Entrepreneur, Yuri Gavrilov,
director general of Belingosstrakh, Minsk, outlined some of the
operations of the company. It writes 19 voluntary classes, of which the
most widely distributed are motor TPL, health, motor casco, and
property insurance. Major domestic clients include Belvest, BelavtoMAZ
[motor manufacturer], Belmagistralautotrans [freight], tourist
companies and foreign embassies and trade representations. Annual
claims payments total in the region of US$400,000, but reserves are
close to $4m. Belingosstrakh also accepts domestic reinsurance.

Travel health is written both individually and on a group basis. A Blue
Card for motor liability in eastern Europe costs US$20 per month,
extendible for $10. It issues policies in its own name rather than
those of foreign insurers, as in addition to its nine offices within
the country it is the only Belarus insurer with a representative office
abroad [in Vienna, in association with MACH.) For motor, it has co-
operation or average commission agreements with Moldova, the Baltic
States, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Spain, Germany, Austria, Romania,
Hungary and Bulgaria, Mr Gavrilov said. The third meeting of the
participants in the Baltic Insurance Pool, the co-operative
organisation for insurers from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Belarus
in Minsk last autumn agreed to include SAO Ingosstrakh, Moscow, as a
member, Mr Gavrilov said.

CROATIA IC

A new general manager was appointed at Croatia Osiguranje dd, Zagreb,
this month. Suad Rizvanbegovic is an expatriate Croat, who left Croatia
in 1969. By the 1980s the owner of a New York tennis club, in mid-1984
- as he told the daily Vecerni List - contacts he made as a result
enabled him to enter the insurance business. In 1987 he joined
Alexander & Alexander of New York Inc, New York, where he was appointed
vice-president the following year, and remained until very recently as
number two. A&A sources confirmed to EEIR that Mr Rizvanbegovic was a
prodigious producer of business for its New York branch office, with
excellent contacts among the Wall Street investment community.

Two factors influenced his decision to take up his new post, he told
the newspaper: the desire to return home, and his friendship with
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. "Being an insurance expert, it was
only natural for me to come to the head of the biggest insurance
company in Croatia which covers 86% of the insurance market. Now that I
am in, I shall try to introduce the American system of doing business
in the Croatian economy," he said.

Asked whether Croatia IC should be privatised, however, his answer was
categoric. "No, it should not," he said. "I think it must remain a
state owned company. Privatisation is OK, but Croatia [Osiguranje] has
brilliant potential, so let the Croatian state get the benefit," he
added. Mass privatization throughout most of the rest of the economy
"only means that Croatia [Osiguranje] will have to be competitive. The
only strong suit it possesses and the basis on which it rests are
numerous branch offices and the strong net capital. A private owner [of
an enterprise] will have several opportunities - either to insure with
a small private company having small net capital, or to turn to a
large, strong company which will be able to cover each of his losses,
and reduce the risk of possible failure to be reimbursed. Here we shall
certainly have an advantage," Mr Rizvanbegovic continued.

Mr Rizvanbegovic said that he had already held discussions with members
of the Croatia IC supervisory board and made contact with members of
the government to inform them of his plans for the company. "I want to
revitalise Croatia [Osiguranje] and bring in young and capable people,"
he said. He also plans development of life insurance, which was what,
he said, interested him most. He was aware of specific problems in the
life sector - the "unsettled" position of Austrian insurances, for
example.

The interviewer suggested that collecting premium was not the only
problem. Local insurers suggested that government tax policy also
restricted development of the life market. "Taxes must be paid," Mr
Rizvanbegovic observed, and were paid on life and pensions insurance in
the US as well. "The essential thing is in which phase an insurance is
taxed, how it is treated," he said, adding that he was sure "this is
going to be settled in Croatia in the most satisfying way."

He was confident of the support of the Finance Ministry, he said, and
"Not only that, I am sure we shall have excellent co-operation with
both the Ministry of Finance and the government, as well as with the
rest of institutions." Mr Rizvanbegovic also made it clear that he
intended to recruit expertise from Croatians [and perhaps others] from
abroad. He already had an excellent offer on his desk from a young US
woman who was offering her knowledge to Croatia IC. She was not the
only person ready to come and help introduce new business criteria in
Croatia, and he intended to make use of such readiness, he said. A free
hand in hiring staff was one of the conditions he had made before
taking up his new post, he said, and he was counting upon "absolute
support" from government and ministries in all the developments he
planned.

The re-emerging insurance industry in Bosnia & Herzegovina - Bosnia
Reosiguranje dd, Sarajevo, announced that it would restart business
with the New Year - may also be interested in Mr Rizvanbegovic's
appointment. They will hope that the fact that he is by descent a
Muslim as well as a Croat will make the development of Croatian-B&H
Federation links in the insurance sector considerably easier to
facilitate.

MERGER OF SUPERVISORS PLANNED

In mid-January, a government spokesman announced that during cabinet
discussion of draft credit institutions and securities legislation, the
government had accepted in principle that the banking, securities and
insurance supervisory offices should merge, possibly as early as 1
January next year, to form a new body subordinate to the government
rather than to the Finance Ministry.  As a result, sections dealing
with supervision in draft banking legislation due to be discussed by
parliament shortly will be removed, and the operation of the new
unified supervision be dealt with in separate measures yet to be
drafted, president of the Banking Supervisory Commission Tamas Rusznak
said.

The government spokesman said that a draft of the unified supervisory
legislation would be considered by cabinet before the end of February,
and that capital and reserve requirements for financial institutions
would be amended. Other draft measures include licensing of banks for
trading in government securities, new licensing procedures for credit
institutions, and abolition of the requirement for foreign investors to
obtain government authorisation for stakes in credit institutions.

NEW VMBF LAW

In order to stimulate the development of voluntary mutual benefit funds
(VMBFs), a new law is under preparation, according to Dr Tibor
Parnitzky, deputy chairman of the supervisory body overseeing their
licensing. The changes come two years after the original legislation
came into force in November 1993, as - various optimistic announcements
notwithstanding - the growth of the movement has proved to be
disappointing (EEIR060/19), and coincide with the appointment of a new
president for the supervisory office, Dr Gyorgy Radnai.

By the end of 1995, the total number of funds was 197 (151 with
operating licences), of which 177 were pension funds, 14 mutual
assistance funds and only six health funds. The vast majority are
organised on a regional basis, 42 around individual enterprises, 14 by
economic sector and four by profession. At the end of October, total
membership was 114,610, with the end of year average likely to have
been at most 650 members per fund. Furthermore, despite the generous
tax concessions supporting VMBF contribution levels (by members and
sponsoring employers or other organisations), payments were well below
expectations. Accumulated funds of HUF5.5bn to HUF6bn (US$40m to $44m)
at the end of 1995 would have represented an average per fund of HUF28m
to HUF30.5m, or just over $200,000 each.

Dr Parnitzky told EEIR that the main aims of the proposed legislation
are to speed up the authorisation of new funds, reduce bureaucratic
burdens on their operation, tighten supervision of existing funds and
remove the contradictions between various sections of the current law.
One amendment will lift the restriction on formation of funds to a
common interest basis of workplace, profession or sector, enabling
general funds to be set up, and existing localised funds to merge.

The operation of health funds will be eased by clarifying their
relationship to the universal state health insurance system, which is
also under review. The supervisory body is also expected to take a more
pro-active educational and information role in promoting the VMBF
movement. Currently, much is done by financial institutions to spread
the concept, although in some cases the expansion is based on the
exploitation of an existing loophole which enables the largely tax-free
refund of contributions, within a short period for those who are
already past retirement age. At present pension fund members who retire
can receive their payments back while benefiting from tax allowances.
The new legislation will restrict lump sum or regular pension payments
to those who have been in the fund for two years, while permitting
those who retire to remain in membership.

It is hoped that new legislation will come before parliament during the
Spring and into force by the middle of the year. A second phase of
amendments is expected by the end of 1996 regarding VMBF fund
management activities.

The eventual rejection of a proposal contained in late drafts of the
recently passed new insurance law to bring the supervision of VMBFs
under the same office as that of insurance companies (EEIR059/20), is
regarded as a significant support for the independent development of
the movement. While insurance companies can perform services (such as
data processing, fund management, premium collection etc.) for VMBFs,
these must be performed by a separate subsidiary, such as that of AB-
Aegon tltalanos Biztosito Rt, Budapest (EEIR062/16), Aegon Nyugdijalap
Kezelo es Szolgaltato Kft (pension fund management and service co),
which will charge a fee of 5% to 15% fee, depending on the size of the
fund. Over 50 banks and consulting firms, including Budapest Bank,
Creditanstalt, ING Bank, Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank, Sedgwick Noble
Lowndes and William Mercer, offering similar services.

MTPL RATES

On 27 December, the government determined rates for motor TPL for 1996
were published in the Official Gazette. The basic rates for passenger
cars are modified by four bonus and four malus categories, each
representing 5% of the base premium.

MTPL insurers must have been pleasantly surprised: the average increase
average for cars was 21.56%, above the average 21.11% requested by the
insurers' association MABISZ (EEIR061/18) due to the government's
granting of a increase for the largest engine power (and imported) cars
2.6 percentage points above that requested by MABISZ while slightly
cutting back on MABISZ's proposals for the smallest and mid-range
(mainly domestically-produced) ones. Rates for the smallest buses were
increased by more than MABISZ's request, and larger ones by less.
MABISZ did not secure the doubling of premium for lorries with cargo
weight of over 6 tonnes which it wanted, but the average increase of
54.27% was above the 48% it had sought.

GROWTH AND COMPETITION IN LIFE

Premium income for the Hungarian market as a whole for 1995 would need
to be of the order of 30% above the HUF93.5bn (US$668m) total for 1994
for any growth in real terms to be achieved, Figyelo calculated late in
December. Despite the continued relative dominance of Hungaria
Biztosito Rt, Budapest, over motor and of AB-Aegon tltalanos Biztosito
Rt, Budapest, over household, a competitive market is continuing to
develop, the paper considered, predicting that Hungaria's market share
for 1995 would drop from 38% to 36% and that of AB-Aegon from 26% to
24%. Competition this year would be particularly strong in liability
and commercial property, it said.

It had been competition for the growing life market which has been
responsible for most of the shifts in company market share in 1995,
Figyelo said. Such had been the success of Nationale-Nederlanden
Magyarorszagi Biztosito Rt, Budapest, that there was a possibility of
its soon replacing Providencia Osztrak-Magyar Biztosito Rt, Budapest,
as market number three, having retained its overall share of 10% (life
only) while that of Providencia had slipped back a percentage point to
11%. Nat-Ned and AB-Aegon, at the same time, are both anxious to claim
the title of largest life insurer in Hungary.

Of the medium-sized companies, Generali Budapest Biztosito Rt,
Budapest, had around 6%, the Figyelo calculated, followed by OTP-
Garancia Biztosito Rt and Colonia Biztosito Rt, both Budapest, with 4%
to 5% each. Despite the increases in premium achieved by these
companies, however, in life they were experiencing difficulty in
competing with the market leaders, Nat-Ned and AB-Aegon, it suggested,
while in some non-life lines - motor casco for example - the market was
shrinking in real terms.

Nat-Ned's dominance, the paper said, was due to its focus on high-value
business, estimating 1995 premium at HUF12.3bn. In 1994, Nat-Ned had a
37% share of the Hungarian life market. Last year, company president
Gyorgy Bordas told EEIR, premium increased by a further 71% to
HUF12.5bn. New business written totalled HUF5bn, and the company has
253,000 policyholders. The premium target for 1996 is HUF17bn. Nat-Ned
also continues to reinsure a substantial proportion of its business
within the ING Group, mainly due to local capital adequacy
considerations, although the proportion is declining from the 79% ceded
in 1994.

While AB-Aegon continued to dominate long-standing group life business,
and was projecting HUF13bn, Figyelo suggested that business from the
CSaB group policy was dropping off rapidly, and would only be replaced
by new individual business with difficulty.

A number of other companies had been reluctant to disclose a
preliminary estimate for 1995 life premium, possibly, the paper said,
because they had concentrated on low-value life policies with premiums
between HUF10,000 and HUF15,000 annually. Those attracted by the
affordability (and tax benefits) associated with these policies were
those hardest hit by economic pressures, and cancellations were high,
it said. Providencia, for example, had once vied with AB-Aegon in terms
of new business sold, but now had difficulty generating enough to make
up for cancellations, the paper suggested, predicting life premium of
HUF5bn for 1995, at 22% up on the HUF4.1bn of 1994 below the rate of
inflation.

At Generali, the increase would be up by only 14.5% to HUF300m, mainly
group life business, it predicted. Among the smaller companies, the
increase at Europa-GAN Biztosito Rt, Budapest, from HUF349m in 1994 to
about HUF480m was, at 37.5% positive growth in real terms, but not
spectacular.

Hungaria, on the other hand, appears to have improved its position.
Having dropped to a low of HUF500m in 1992, the forecast for 1995 was
HUF1.9bn, two and a half times the 1994 total. However, Hungaria too
had targeted lower incomes, "a very volatile market", Figyelo said.

COLONIA

As expected (EEIR061/17), Colonia made a net loss last year largely as
a result of losses of its motor TPL portfolio of 130% of premium,
including expenses, Otto Csurgo, recently promoted from deputy general
manager to general manager, confirmed at the beginning of January.
Premium income increased by 48.4%, from HUF3.556bn (US$25.4m) to
HUF5.2bn, of which motor was responsible for HUF2.8bn (54%), up from
HUF1.774bn (50%) in 1994, motor TPL representing HUF1.2bn compared to
HUF863m, 23% and 24% of total premium income respectively.

Colonia Biztosito is now 51% owned by central European holding company
Nordstern Colonia Central Europe Holding AG, Vienna, and 49% by Colonia
Finance Holdings BV.

EUROPA-GAN

Europa-GAN Biztosito Rt, Budapest, is to increase its capital by
between HUF500m and HUF1bn (US$3.5m to $7m), general manager Miklos
Szendi said in mid-January. Although both Groupe des Assurances
Nationales (GAN), Paris (currently owner of 89.4%), and Soc
Assicuratrice Industriale SpA (SAI), Turin (10%), will participate,
negotiations are also in progress with a Hungarian bank and a third
foreign investor, he added. The increased capital will be devoted to
extending its branch network and developing motor business
(EEIR058/12).

According to preliminary data, Europa-GAN's premium income last year
totalled HUF1.1bn in 1995, up 29% on the HUF893m written in 1994, and
about on a par with inflation. Life contributed HUF480m (HUF250m
individual and HUF230m group), commercial and other property HUF520m
and liability HUF100m.

GRAZER WECHSELSEITIGE

Grazer Wechselseitige Versicherung AG (GWV), Graz, has finally received
approval to establish a Hungarian subsidiary, Prima Austria Biztosito
Rt (EEIR060/20), the Official Gazette revealed at the beginning of
January. Its previous application in September 1994 was blocked
(EEIR052/13), following a dispute over capitalisation and the status of
premium on GWV policies sold in Hungary illegally by pyramid sales
agencies. According to a report by the Hungarian news agency MTI-
Econews, it appears that GVW's application was granted by the Hungarian
government shortly before the new insurance law (Law XCVI of 1995) came
into effect on 1 January.

GWV re-applied for a licence in September (EEIR060/20). Under the new
insurance law, final responsibility for licensing insurers passes from
government to the Insurance Supervisory Office, which may refuse
applications, inter alia, because a founder has an unsatisfactory
business reputation. Previously, the ISO only made recommendations to
the legal and financial departments of the Finance Ministry, which then
studied the application independently and submitted recommendations to
a ministerial committee, which sent its report to the cabinet for final
approval of the application. Econews reported that GWV's application
was classified as "strictly confidential", but quoted Finance Ministry
Legal Department head Zoltan Molnar as indicating that this was "quite
common" for government documents.

Vilaggazdasag reported on 15 January that it understood that the
insurers' association MABISZ had asked Finance Minister Lajos Bokros to
explain why the incorporation of Prima Austria had been approved.

Econews gave an estimate of total foreign currency outflow to
unlicensed life insurers of HUF70bn (US$500m) from 50,000 policies,
which seems rather high.

WINTERTHUR

Winterthur Schweizerische Versicherungs Ges, Winterthur, received its

entry into force of the new insurance law permitting establishment of a
composite insurer. Registered capital was the old minimum of HUF1bn
(US$7.14m) is currently held 100% by Winterthur, but the European Bank
for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD) is expected to acquire 30%
during the year (EEIR060/20, 059/19), and operations are not expected
to begin before the autumn, initially in life and pension only.
Winterthur established fund management company Winterthur
Penztarszolgaltato Rt in September, with capital of HUF370m, and into
which the parent company is expected to inject a further HUF100m and
the EBRD HUF200m, and Winterthur National Pension Fund was set up on 8

UNOFFICIAL LIMIT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT?

Unnamed officials have confirmed to Rzeczpospolita that Poland is
operating an informal limit of 30% on foreign participation in local
insurers, the newspaper reported, as has long been suspected by
observers (EEIR056/4). The deputy finance minister responsible for
approving insurance company licences is apparently advised not to sign
if foreign participation exceeds this limit, the newspaper added,
suggesting that this would appear to be in contravention of the
obligations of the preliminary agreement to form the World Trade
Organisation signed by Poland last year, under which signatory
countries are not supposed to impose additional restrictions on the
activities of foreign investors in their financial services markets.

The Insurance Law, as newly amended, requires Finance Ministry approval
for insurers which are fully foreign-owned, and at six thresholds
between 15% (of voting or non-voting shares) to 75% of voting rights,
but also lays down that applications may only be refused on grounds
identical with those applied to Polish shareholders. However, these
include if "An important state economic interest is threatened"
(EEIR061/2).

Azur Ostoja SA, Warsaw, has an approved foreign shareholding of 84.6%,
the newspaper reported, and Gerling Konzern Allgemeine Versicherungs
AG, Cologne, 51.2% of TU Turystycznych ATU SA, Warsaw, but only 49% of
voting rights. Fourteen non-life insurers - one third of the total -
have an element of foreign capital, and seven out of 12 life insurers.

The decree holding VAT on insurance intermediary services at 7% for
1996 (EEIR 062/17) duly appeared in the final issue of Dziennik Ustaw
(Legal Gazette) for 1995, number 154. However, as the Finance Minister
has again applied a derogation to the statute imposing VAT, leaving the
underlying statute unchanged, a further derogation will be required if
the rate is not to rise to the standard 22% on 1 January 1997.

MOTOR RATES RISE

Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), Warsaw, has increased motor TPL
premiums by an average of 35% this year, its basic annual premium for a
Fiat 126 (with a 652cc engine) in Warsaw rising to ZL235 (US$94) and
for a car of 2,000cc engine capacity to ZL615. Last year, PZU sold
about 9m MTPL policies.

Other insurers are charging between ZL160 and ZL600 for the 126, and
between ZL308 and ZL919 for the 2 litre in Warsaw. Premiums for other
areas are lower: in Lublin (near the Ukrainian border), for example,
the premiums range from ZL 93 to ZL400 and ZL231 to ZL839 respectively.

No claims bonuses, and other discounts such as those for customer
loyalty or paying the annual premium in a lump sum, can yield a
reduction of up to 70% of the basic premium.

INSURANCE STICKERS

The Finance Ministry has abolished the need to display stickers on the
windscreen as proof of insurance. Henceforth the policy itself, which
must be carried by the driver, constitutes the only proof of insurance
required.

UNINSURED CAR FINES RISE

The Insurance Guarantee Fund, which compensates the victims of
accidents caused by uninsured drivers, has raised the fine for driving
an uninsured car from ZL800 to ZL1,100 ($440), an increase of 37.5% and
in line with that of PZU's premium increase. PZU president Roman
Fulneczek told a press conference that various estimates had suggested
that somewhere between 10% and 20% of Polish motorists drove around
without insurance.

MOTOR INSURANCE FRAUD

About 40% of Polish motor insurance claims are fraudulent, according to
a study by Wyzsza Szkola Ubezpieczen i Bankowosci (Insurance and
Banking Institute) quoted in the recent issue of the bulletin published
by the insurance professionals' association SUP, a figure comparable to
that prepared for Germany by the Federal Criminal Office, it said. The
Polish figures showed that as many as 76% of policyholders intended to
defraud the insurers, and that 78% approved of the practice.

OMBUDSMAN ON PROBLEMS

The main problems facing the Polish insurance market were the financial
weakness of the insurers and the excessive expectations of clients
together with their lack of knowledge and understanding of both the
insurance market and insurance law, newly-appointed Polish insurance
ombudsman Stanislaw Rogowski told a press conference. Mr Rogowski said
he intended to be a mediator between companies and their clients as
well as between the companies and the National

Insurance Supervisory Office (PUNU). Although he has no formal powers
of decision, he can draw attention to injustices being committed in the
industry.

WARNING ON EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS

Leon Kozicki, president of the brokers' association Stowarzyszenie
Polskich Brokerow Ubezpieczeniowych i Reasekuracyjnych, warned the
recent Insurers' Congress organised by the Polish Insurance
Professionals Association (SUP) of the dangers of excessive commissions
when competing for large clients. "If a company pays 50% commission,
the situation can last a year or two; after that the company will not
be there," he said.

GRYF

The late bid by Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), Warsaw, to
rescue Pomorskie TU Gryf SA, Bydgoszcz (EEIR062/1), appears to be being
still assembled, invitations to join an all-Polish consortium not being
sent out until after Christmas. A further potential obstacle remains
the attitude of the Anti-Monopoly Office, which may take a view on any
plan that involves increasing PZU's estimated 62.6% share of the Polish
non-life market, were it considered that such an increase posed a
threat to competition.

Nor is it yet clear whether other insurers which had expressed an
interest in taking over Gryf's insurance portfolio in full or in part
would still be interested if that involved joining a PZU-led
consortium. Also the subject of discussion locally is the effect of
assuming Gryf's portfolio on PZU's already-strained solvency margin,
which was still inadequate at the last count. Strictly speaking, Polish
law requires a company assuming the policies of another to have an
adequate solvency margin.

The decision by the insurance industry - formally under the auspices of
meetings of the Policyholders' Protection Fund and the Insurance
Guarantee Fund - to withdraw backing from the rescue plan formulated by
Winterthur Schweizerisches Versicherungs Ges, Winterthur, and TU PBK
SA, Warsaw, would appear to have been motivated by fear of allowing a
major foreign competitor into the market. The PZU plan may be slightly
cheaper, requiring a loan of ZL55m (US$21.7m) from the two funds (which
are due to be merged) rather ZL60m ($23.7m), but as a Winterthur
spokesman pointed out, the PZU plan did not propose to meet Gryf's
other obligations, such as those to the state, or to preserve its
network of sales offices.

At a press conference, TUiR Warta SA, Warsaw, president Henryk Chmielak
hedged when asked questions about the possibility of joining the PZU
consortium, saying only that Gryf's portfolio would be examined to see
whether there were any interesting parts. Warta would concentrate on
producing good financial results rather than chasing market share,
considering that fighting for premium without considering costs was a
short-term policy, he said, citing the experience of Pomorskie TU Gryf
SA (under administration), Bydgoszcz, and ZU Hestja SA, Poznan.

HESTJA (POZNAN)

ZU Hestja SA, Poznan (no connection with Sopockie TU Hestia Insurance
SA, Sopot), has reportedly failed to meet an extended deadline for a
capital increase to meet own funds requirements. While management
continued to try to raise the required funds, Dariusz Blaszczuk,
director of the Finance Ministry insurance department was quoted as
indicating that a number of companies were interested in taking a
strategic stake in Hestja. One of these is said to be Bankowe TUiR
Heros SA, Warsaw, which a company spokesman would neither confirm nor
deny.

In late 1994, a net loss of over ZL10m (US$4m) wiped out Hestja's own
capital of ZL3.3m, Rzeczpospolita. The company proposed a capital
increase of ZL24m to ZL55m ($9.6m to $22m) through the issue of new
Series D and E shares, and sale of the Series D shares took place in
October 1995, bringing in a notional ZL27m of which only about a
quarter was paid up. Hestja requested an extension until 15 December,
which appears was insufficient.

Hestja's leading shareholder is reported as Centralny Fundusz
Inwestycyjny Sp.zoo (in turn owned by Solaris Holding SA and Solaris
SA, EEIR041/17), which is also a shareholder in ZUiR Polonia, Lodz, and
in Pomorskie TU Gryf SA, Bydgoszcz (under administration).

POLISA

TU-R Polisa SA, Warsaw, has completed its new Series H share issue
(EEIR062/19), with 1,192,458 shares of up to 3.2m on offer at ZL8
(US$3.16) per ZL2.5 nominal share taken up. The main buyers appear to
have been Bel Leasing Sp zoo and Forin Sp zoo, both subsidiaries of
Bank Inicjatyw Gospodarczych SA (BIG), which took up between 500,000
and 650,000 of the shares on offer. Final details of the new
shareholders were due to be published once shareholdings had been
registered.

At one time, BIG held up to 30% of Polisa. Prior to the latest share
issue, the holdings of Bel-Leasing and Forin had been diluted to 6.4%
and 3.76% respectively. Following the stake-rebuilding, they are
expected to hold about 13%. Polisa deputy president Zygfryd Kielarski
was quoted as saying that a total of 656 individuals and companies had
taken up shares from the issue.

Polisa's share capital has therefore increased by ZL2.98m to ZL26.98m,
with the remaining proceeds of ZL6.56m earmarked for reserve capital to
obviate any difficulties with solvency margins.

Polisa may need to set aside reserves for the loss of up to ZL5.11m on
its stake in Tarpan Sp zoo, a motor company based in Poznan which
manufactures an all-terrain vehicle, and is on the verge of bankruptcy.
Polisa's shareholding was acquired when Tarpan's predecessor company,
Poznanska Fabryka Samochodow Rolniczych Polmo, failed to repay a credit
guaranteed by the insurer. The holding was originally valued at
ZL11.4m, but Polisa ceded part of it to Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen
(PZU) SA, Warsaw. Even so, it accounted for a substantial slice of
Polisa's investment portfolio of ZL22.14m as of June 1995, when it
sought permission from the Finance Ministry to maintain such a high
proportion in one stock. Both Tarpan management and Polisa blamed the
failure of the motor manufacturer on indecision by the Defence
Ministry, which took a long time to decide to buy the Tarpan's Honcker
all-terrain vehicle despite the fact that it had been designed in
collaboration with the army. Polisa and PZU may secure some return if,
as is hoped, another manufacturer is found to take over manufacture of
the Honcker.

TU na Zycie Polisa-Zycie SA, Warsaw, has announced that three companies
recently bought 31% of its shares (EEIR060/22), but has not yet
revealed their identities. Since it also announced that Michal Solowow
and Wojciech Ciesielski had joined the supervisory board,
Rzeczpospolita suggested that Echo Press SA and Polish Life Improvement
SA, in which Mr Solowow has controlling interests, may be among the new
Polisa-Zycie shareholders. Mr Ciesielski is a large shareholder in Echo
Press.

INSURERS SUE TO BLOCK PROPOSITION 103 IMPLEMENTATION IN CALIFORNIA

Insurance companies filed suit this week to block implementation of
California Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's emergency
regulations to implement Proposition 103.

The action by State Farm and Allstate marked yet another twist in the
tortuous journey to implementation of the initiative passed by voters
in November 1988.

It took more than a year for Gillespie to issue the regulations, and
in the interim she was criticized by advocates of the initiative for
delay and siding with the industry. Now the initiative's backers
accept Gillespie's rules but insurers don't.

"I view this whole thing as large insurance companies showing
themselves to the door of the California market, because they're just
infuriating the public," said Harvey Rosenfield, head of Voter Revolt
and principal sponsor of Proposition 103.

He said Jan. 5 that he hadn't seen Allstate's suit, but State Farm's
litigation is "basically a joke" that wouldn't pass scrutiny by a
first-year law student.

"This simply is another way to stall and delay," he said.

State Farm Insurance filed two suits Jan. 3, challenging not only
Gillespie's new regulations to implement Proposition 103, effective
in March, but also her decision to deny an increase in auto rates
under the state's assigned risk plan.

In a suit filed in San Francisco Superior Court, the company said the
"emergency regulations" issued last month were illegal because they
don't fairly implement the auto rate provisions of Proposition 103,
passed by voters in November 1988.

State Farm said Proposition 103 forbids rates that are inadequate,
excessive or unfairly discriminatory. But it said Gillespie's rules
would bring rates that are inadequate in some cases, excessive in
others and thus are unfairly discriminatory.

Allstate Insurance Co. filed suit Jan. 4, alleging that Gillespie's
regulations violate the state constitution and weren't supported by
substantial evidence.

It said the regulations would cost the company a 25 percent drop in
revenues and a $175 million loss during the next policy year.

The suit asks Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel to
bar enforcement of the regulations and order a return to the previous
system of setting rates.

"We're asking for a return to a cost-based system," said Michael
Carlson, an attorney for Allstate.

As in other states, insurers have based rates on motorists' place of
residence, age, gender and marital status. Gillespie's regulations
would forbid use of all those, although insurers could use other
factors that would approximate the same effect.

State Farm's second suit over the California Automobile Assigned Risk
Plan, or CAARP, was filed with Judge Vogel of Los Angeles, who
already has ruled that Allstate can raise its rates by 40 percent for
bad drivers covered under CAARP.

State Farm said it has experienced an underwriting loss of $3.5
million a week from assigned-risk coverage.

California law requires motorists to carry minimum liability coverage
and requires insurers to offer assigned-risk coverage based on their
share of the market.

But if it can't get a rate increase, State Farm is asking the right
to stop issuing the coverage.

In another development, consumer advocates and representatives of
minority groups held a news conference Jan. 3 to urge California Gov.
George Deukmejian and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to approve a bill
offering motorists a no-frills, no-fault auto insurance policy.

"Consumers today are far worse off for auto insurance than they were
a year and a half ago," said Judith Bell of Consumers Union.

"We've watched the insurance companies figure out how they can scam
those hearings" held by the Insurance Department on implementing
Proposition 103.

The plan by Democratic Assemblyman Pat Johnston would allow victims
of auto accidents to sue only in case of serious injury. Otherwise
they would recover medical costs and lost wages up to $15,000 from
their own insurance companies.

Doctors would be held to the fee schedule set forth in the state's
workers' compensation plan.

Motorists covered by the minimum policy would have to go to small-
claims court to recover costs of property damage.

Minimum coverage under the bill would cost $180 a year. If property
damage were covered, Bell said, rates would rise to about $300 or
$400 a year.

It is supported by many, but not all, insurance companies --notable
exceptions being State Farm and Farmers.

It also is backed by some consumer advocates but opposed by those
associated with Ralph Nader, as well as by the California Trial
Lawyers Association. They say no-fault diminishes victims' rights.

Johnston, chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee,
left his bill in committee in last year's session when he saw he
didn't have enough votes to enact it in preference to a substitute
bill offered by the Democratic speaker.

The Legislature passed Brown's bill over the vigorous opposition of
insurers, but the Republican governor vetoed it. Deukmejian said at
the time that he was willing to work with legislators to come up with
a compromise bill.

Consumers Union's Bell said Johnston's plan failed last year "due to
an extraordinary effort by the speaker and a lack of leadership by
the governor."

INSURERS JOIN TO OPEN AN ALL-INDUSTRY "HELPLINE" FOR CONSUMERS

The life, health and property/casualty insurance industries have
joined in an unprecedented effort to establish a toll-free telephone
line to provide consumers with information.

Main sponsoring organizations for the "National Insurance Consumer
Helpline" are the American Council of Life Insurance, the Health
Insurance Association of America and the Insurance Information
Institute, which represents property/casualty companies.

Staff based in Annapolis, Md., will be expected to handle a wide
range of quesitons, refer complaints to appropriate sources and send
brochures and educational materials upon request.

Such an effort has been discussed for years, but it gained impetus
from widespread consumer dissatisfaction with the industry.

The Helpline will operate from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time
Monday through Friday, starting Jan. 2. The telephone number is 800-
942-4242.

EVEN BEST LONG-TERM CARE POLICIES INADEQUATE, A.A.R.P. REPORTS

Even some of the best long-term care insurance policies fail to
provide adequate protection against costs of nursing home care,
according to a study released Jan. 3 by the American Association of
Retired People (AARP).

The study analyzed policies offered by 11 leading companies and
concluded many "failed to achieve the basic purpose for which they
were bought."

"Many of them failed to provide much protection against the
uncertainty of paying high out-of-pocket costs for nursing home
care," the study said.

It said there were wide variations and coverage options among the
policies, leaving "a great deal of uncertainty" over how many nursing
home costs would be covered.

Applying both strict and lenient interpretations, policies might
reduce out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes by anywhere between
12.1 to 62.6 percent, the report said.

The study was conducted by Thomas Rice and Kathleen Thomas of the
University of North Carolina and William Weissert of the University
of Michigan, under a grant from the AARP.

It analyzed policies marketed from May through July of 1988 and
acknowledged improvements in policies since then.

Most of the policies studied denied benefits to those who went into
nursing homes without first being hospitalized or provided benefits
only for skilled -- as opposed to custodial -- nursing home care.
Those findings confirm the wisdom of a December 1988 recommendation
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that states
prohibit sale of policies with such requirements, the report said.

It recommended that the NAIC expand its model regulations to require
that policies cover at least four years in a nursing home and offer
some kind of inflation protection.

The study named the companies whose policies were analyzed, but
didn't provide specific information on each policy.

Companies included Aetna, American Express-Fireman's Fund, American
Progressive, Bankers Life & Casualty, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of
Indiana, Equitable Life & Casualty, Great Republic, John Hancock,
Prudential, Transport Life and Travelers.

According to the Health Insurance Association of America, more than
100 companies now offer insurance covering long-term care.

WORLD'S REPORTED AIDS CASES TOPPED 200,000 IN 1989

The number of reported AIDS cases reached 203,599 by the end of 1989,
the World Health Organization reported Jan. 3.

The total included 36,942 new victims during the year.

U.S. cases totaled 113,211 by December.

Reports to the Geneva-based WHO seriously underestimate the actual
number because many cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
particularly in Africa, go undetected.

HEALTH COSTS CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION

Standard & Poor's Corp. says medical costs rose 8 percent from
October 1988 through September 1989, compared to an overall inflation
rate of 4.3 percent.

It said inflation has slowed in dental and eye care, but costs of
hospitals and drugs rose 11.8 percent.

S&P said it expected the inflation rate for health costs to outpace
overall inflation by "a wide margin" in 1990 -- matched only by an
increase in the 10 to 12 percent range for property/casualty
premiums.

TREASURY DECIDES TO SEND OUT MEDICARE REFUNDS IN FEBRUARY

Under pressure from members of Congress, the Treasury Department has
announced that it will send out refund checks in February and April
to nearly 27 million elderly Americans who are paying for benefits
they won't be receiving.

Congress acted late last year to repeal the Medicare Catastrophic
Coverage Act of 1988, which increased both Medicare benefits and the
premiums to pay for them.

Many Medicare premiums are paid through monthly deductions from
Social Security checks, and those deductions went up by $5.30 as of
Jan. 1. Treasury said it didn't have time to reprogram the computers
to reduce the deductions before May, but said it could refund the
money.

F.T.C. LETTER ON CRASH PARTS GIVES COMPETITIVENESS ARGUMENTS A BOOST

A letter from Federal Trade Commission staff to an Ohio legislator
gives a boost to arguments that there are anticompetitive effects
from laws restricting use of replacement crash parts made by other
than the original manufacturers.

The argument pits auto manufacturers, who decry use of "imitation"
parts, against insurers and consumer groups, who say competition
lowers prices of replacement parts.

The letter from FTC staff to Ohio State Rep. Joseph E. Haines, came
in response to a request for comment on an Ohio bill, H.B. 302. It
appears to mark the first time a U.S. government agency has taken a
position on the issue -- even though it represents staff views and
not those of the commission.

The Dec. 27 letter suggests that the Legislature "take into account
the possibility that the bill might unreasonably restrict consumer
choice in the market for auto crash parts. The Legislature may also
wish to take into consideration the benefits and costs of mandatory
disclosure."

The Ohio bill regulates marketing and use of aftermarket crash parts,
including a requirement that installers can't charge more for parts
made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) than they would
have for non-OEM parts.

"This provision attempts to equalize the prices of OEM and non-OEM
parts, thus eliminating perhaps the only attraction of non-OEM
parts," the FTC staff said.

The measure also requires disclosure that non-OEM parts, "most of
which are not made in the United States, may vary in terms of
quality, fit, performance and warranty from the original parts."

The FTC staff said it wouldn't address the question of poorer
quality, but added that some consumers might be willing to accept
lower quality in order to get a lower price.

The disclosure might add to costs without providing useful additional
information to consumers, the FTC staff said. And, it said, "there is
a risk that the language of a mandatory disclosure may mislead
consumers, creating a negative public perception where none is
justified."

GOVERNMENT PROPOSES EXTENDING AIRBAG REQUIREMENT TO TRUCKS & VANS

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed Jan. 4
that the current requirement for airbags or automatic seatbelts be
extended to light-duty trucks, vans and small buses.

The restraints would be phased in beginning with the 1994 model year
with full compliance by the 1996 model year. But vehicles with driver-
side airbags and manual passenger belts would be considered in
compliance through the 1997 model year.

Vehicles with only two seating positions also would have to be
equipped to secure a child safety seat on the passenger side.

NHTSA estimated that some 2,000 lives a year could be saved through
the proposal.

The action followed a NHTSA proposal last month to extend the door-
strength requirements for passenger cars to all minivans, small buses
and multipurpose vehicles.

NHTSA also reported that it opened a record 213 investigations into
possible auto safety defects during 1989 and influenced a record 77
percent of recalls.

AGENTS & CONSUMER ADVOCATES OFFER 100 WAYS TO CUT AUTO COSTS

The National Association of Professional Insurance Agents and the
Consumer Insurance Interest Group joined Dec. 27 to offer more than
100 recommendations on controlling personal injury and property
damage costs.

Suggestions include ways to improve driver responsiblility, speed and
alcohol control, highway design and improved state record-keeping on
accidents.

The groups also recommended improving vehicle safety by such means as
displaying crashworthiness ratings on new vehicles, improving
steering assemblies, enhancing side-impact protection and reinstating
the 5 mph bumper standard.

The Consumer Insurance Interest Group is headed by PIA National
consumer adviser Esther Peterson and includes Joan Claybrook of
Public Citizen, Steve Brobeck of Consumer Federation of America and
J. Robert Hunter of the National Insurance Consumer Organization.

The organization was formed at the behest of PIA National in an
effort to reach agreement on issues of common interest, such as
safety, while setting aside issues that divide the two groups.

"All the recommendations in this report should be looked upon
together rather than as isolated proposals," Peterson said.

The agents and consumer advocates agreed that another issue --
insurer efficiency -- also is important, but they couldn't agree on
how to achieve it.

The 40-page report, "Factors Contributing to Auto Insurance Claims
Costs," is available from PIA National at 400 North Washington St.,
Alexandria, VA 22314, telephone 703-836-9340.

HARTFORD EXPANDS DISCOUNTS FOR AUTO SAFETY

ITT Hartford Insurance Group, which claims credit for pioneering
discounts for airbags or automatic seatbelts in 1977, announced Jan.
4 that it is increasing those discounts.

The Hartford's discounts on personal injury coverage for occupants of
the insurance vehicles are 30 percent for automatic seatbelts, 40
percent for driver-side airbags, 50 percent for full front airbags
and 60 percent for a combination of both automatic belts and airbags.

They apply to personal injury protection (PIP) coverage in no-fault
staes and to medical payments coverage in other states.

In addition, cars with antilock brakes will get a 5 percent saving on
collision coverage.

"The discounts are substantially greater than those offered by most
auto insurers," according to Dale R. Comey, The Hartford's president
of property-casualty insurance operations.

The company said actual dollar savings will vary by state, ranging
from $102 in the no-fault state of Colorado down to $9 in Illinois,
where tort suits are allowed and first-party medical coverage is more
limited.

As of Feb. 1, the discounts will be available in 38 states on
policies sold by independent agents or through the American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), The Travelers said. They are
under consideration in five other jurisdictions.

CALIFORNIA QUAKE EXPECTED TO HAVE LITTLE LASTING ECONOMIC IMPACT

Last year's Loma Prieta earthquake won't have a severe lingering
economic impact and rebuilding will probably stimulate the San
Francisco Bay area, the Commission on State Finance reported
Jan. 3 in its budget projection for the 1990s.

Some businesses and households will suffer huge uninsured casualty
losses and some small retailers will go bankrupt because of a decline
in tourism, the commission said, but "the net loss in wealth and
income is not that large."

The panel estimated that the Oct. 17 earthquake will cost the state
$1.035 billion, most of it offset by a quarter-cent increase in the
sales tax enacted Dec. 1.

CALIFORNIA'S NEW WORKERS' COMP LAW GOES INTO EFFECT

California's new workers' compensation law went into effect Jan. 1,
raising maximum weekly benefits from $224 to $266 immediately and
more in later years.

The law also imposes requirements on employers to inform injured
workers of claims procedures and act on them promptly and contains
reforms intended to reduce the amount of litigation.

Insurers' uniform provision for expenses goes down from
35 percent to 34 percent this year, 33 percent next year and
32.8 percent in 1992.

DELAWARE GOVERNOR RENEWS PUSH FOR BANKS IN INSURANCE

Delaware Gov. Mike Castle has renewed his drive to win passage of
legislation that would allow some state banks into the insurance
business.

The Republican governor told the Wilmington Rotary Club Dec. 28 that
passage is important if Delaware is to continue to be a financial
center.

The measure would help encourage banks to stay in the state and
expand, Castle said, but he warned that California, Florida and
Illinois all are considering similar legislation.

"The first state in which national and regional banks are located, or
may locate, which grants these insurance underwriting powers to
commercial banks...will have foreclosed any need or reason for
similar action by other states," said Castle.

He said one major backer of the legislation, Citibank, has said it
would create up to 500 new jobs in Delaware if the bill passes.

Insurance agents oppose the bill, which would apply to banks
chartered in the state before 1933 and allow them both to underwrite
and sell insurance.

It was passed by the House but has been stalled in the Senate since
last summer.

GEORGIA COMMISSIONER PROPOSES LIMITS ON AUTO PERSONAL INJURY SUITS

Georgia Insurance Commissioner Warren Evans proposed Jan. 4 that the
General Assembly revise the state's no-fault law by allowing suits
only in case of defined injuries.

Current law now calls for accident victims' insurance companies to
pay medical bills, lost wages and burial expenses regardless of who
was at fault, but injured persons may still sue
if their medical expenses exceed $500.

Evans told a House-Senate study committee that the proposal would
allow insurers to cut costs and could lead to a 20 percent reduction
in premiums.

The effort to raise the tort threshold is being led by Georgians for
Responsible Insurance Policy, an industry coalition headed by Dedley
Moore of Atlanta's Omni Insurance Group.

"The exorbitant increase in tort litigation is one of the main
reasons Georgia's insurance rates have been climbing faster than the
national average," Moore said.

But the Georgia Consumer Center says that auto rate increases in the
state have outpaced the growth of claims.

The group's executive director, Debbie Schecter, said claims only
amounted to 69.4 percent of premiums in 1988, compared to 79.3
percent in 1984.

"It's further evidence of the inefficiency in the insurance industry
in Georgia and perhaps even price-gouging," she said.

In other areas, Insurance Commissioner Evans proposed:

* Requiring health insurers to pool policies for groups with fewer
than 50 members, in order to reduce the possibility of a large rate
increase resulting from one large claim on a small group.

* Making health maintenance organizations available to those covered
by Medicare or Medicaid who now lack that option.

* Expanding the Insurance Department's ability to investigate
insurance fraud. He said it's been estimated that at least 10 to 20
percent of the cost of premiums results from fraud.

* Extending the FAIR Plan providing property insurance to high-risk
applicants who have difficulty getting commercial coverage.

ILLINOIS MANDATORY AUTO INSURANCE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT

An Illinois law requiring motorists to carry auto insurance went into
effect Jan. 1, allowing state troopers to require motorists to prove
that they have personal injury liability coverage of at least $20,000
per person and $40,000 per accident.

The law also requires $15,000 in property damage liability.

Motorists without insurance face fines of $500 or more and vehicle
registration suspensions of at least two months. Reinstatement will
cost an additional $50.

ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT SAYS DRUNK EMPLOYE CAN'T GET WORKERS' COMP

The Illinois Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21 that an intoxicated employee
who was critically injured in a car crash while traveling between one
business meeting and another isn't entitled to workers' compensation.

Without dissent, the court upheld the ruling of the Illinois
Industrial Commission that the employee wasn't capable of working at
the time of the accident and therefore wasn't eligible for workers'
compensation.

The case was brought by the family of Bennie Johnson, a business
agent for the International Union of Operating Engineers. He had a
blood alcohol level of nearly .24 percent, more than two times the
legal definition of drunkenness, at the time of the 1983 accident
that left him incapacitated.

"The commission was free to infer from those circumstances that the
employee was so intoxicated that he could no longer follow his
employment and thus could not be said to be engaged in his employment
at the time of the occurrence," Justice Ben Miller wrote for the
court.

MARYLAND APPROVES BLUES' PLAN TO ENCOURAGE SAFE DRIVING

Maryland Insurance Commission John Donaho has approved a plan by Blue
Cross & Blue Shield of Maryland to encourage safe driving through
expanded benefits.

The plan applies to some 37,000 policyholders enrolled in
comprehensive major medical programs for individual consumers.

If a policyholder is injured in a traffic accident while using a
seatbelt, child restraint or motorcycle helmet, 100 percent of the
first $1,500 in covered medical costs will be paid.

Previously, the company paid 80 percent of such costs.

Donaho also approved a provision withholding benefits when a
policyholder is injured in an accident and convicted for the second
time of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of
unprescribed drugs.

Another provision extends coverage to policyholders for routine
mammography screenings.

"Our emphasis on safe driving, prevention and wellness place us and
the state of Maryland in the forefront of a national trend that
encourages people to take responsibility for actions that affect
their health," said Linda Benedict, vice president of the insurer's
individual market division.

MASSACHUSETTS LIMIT ON AUTO RATE INCREASE CHALLENGED IN COURT

Aetna Life & Casualty Co. filed suit Jan. 3 challenging  the
Massachusetts insurance commissioner's decision last month limiting
auto rate increases to 7.9 percent.

The suit filed in Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest, noted
that insurers had sought a 12.8 percent increase.

Aetna covers about 9.5 percent of the state's drivers, but a decision
in its favor would affect other insurers as well.

MICHIGAN AGENTS SAY INCREASING SAFETY COULD REDUCE AUTO RATES

The Michigan Association of Professional Insurance Agents is saying
government should increase safety regulation as a means of holding
down auto premiums.

Michigan PIA's proposals include reducing the maximum speed limit
from 65 mph and more funding for highway maintenance and safer roads.
The agents also propose increased funding for insurance regulation
and a new look at the territorial rating system.

"Our recommendations are designed to provide a credible base of
information that everyone can work on to reduce accidents and
injuries and hold the line on rising auto insurance rates," said
Michigan PIA President James Alexander.

The PIA recommendations are part of an effort to divert legislative
proposals to mandate reduced auto premiums by as much as 30 percent.

Although Michigan's no-fault system is held up as a model for other
states, auto rates there have been rising -- especially in Detroit.

Michigan Citizens Lobby has been leading a campaign for rate cuts.
The group's executive director responded to the PIA proposals by
saying they're a step in the right direction but shouldn't divert
attention from the push for a rate rollback.

MISSOURI SENATOR PROPOSES UPGRADING INSURANCE REGULATION

Missouri Senate President Pro Tem James Mathewson urged Jan. 3 that
the state constitution be amended to upgrade insurance regulation to
the status of a separate department.

"For too many years, our Division of Insurance has been the stepchild
of the Department of Economic Development," the Democratic leader
said.

"In order to assure Missouri consumers they are not paying
unreasonable rates and to make sure the insurance industry is
adequately related, we need to have a separate department in charge
of insurance regulation."

Under Mathewson's amendment, the proposed department would be
directed by a five-member commission.

"I have talked to officials with major insurance companies, fellow
lawmakers and consumer representatives," Mathewson said.

"We agree that in light of the growing public concern with insurance
rates and the increasing number of insurance company insolvencies, we
need improved regulation of the industry."

The amendment would have to be approved by both houses of the General
Assembly and then approved by voters.

NEW JERSEY BLUES WIN APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES

New Jersey Insurance Commissioner Kenneth Merin approved rate
increases in excess of 20 percent Jan. 4 for 600,000 residents of the
state who carry health insurance with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of New
Jersey.

Merin approved increases of 26.4 percent for 350,000 holders of
individual health insurance policies and of 21.3 percent for 250,000
who carry Medicare supplemental coverage.

The increases are expected to bring $97 million more this year to
Blue Cross & Blue Shield, which has reported a $230 million deficit.

If applied across the board, the increases would amount to about $950
above the current $3,600 annual non-group premium for family coverage
and $98 above the current Medigap average of $460. But Merin ordered
Blue Cross & Blue Shield to modify the demographic factors used in
setting rates.

The company had sought a 33.7 percent increase for individual
coverage and 28.9 percent for Medigap policies.

Merin said medical costs haven't risen as much as Blue Cross & Blue
Shield claimed.

About 3.4 million more residents of the state are covered by Blue
Cross & Blue Shield group plans, which aren't affected by the latest
decision.

NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSIONER ORDERS ANOTHER AUTO RATE ROLLBACK

North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Jim Long has ordered auto rates
rolled back by 6.2 percent, the third cut in less than two years.

"I have determined that the evidence and testimony justify a decrease
in the current rate level," Long said Dec. 28.

"Decreases are ordered for both liability and physical damage
coverage."

Long also ordered a 12.1 percent decrease for motorcycles.

The industry had requested a 4.2 percent increase.

"The order represents a 248 percent decrease from the industry's
request," Long said.

"The last six auto rate orders represent a total of $492 million less
than the increased rate levels proposed by the insurance industry."

Besides ordering three rate cuts, Long has approved three rate
increases that were smaller than those requested by the industry.

The industry has taken previous decisions to the North Carolina Court
of Appeals, and more than $115 million in premiums is being held in
escrow pending the outcome.

NORTH CAROLINA ANTI-THEFT PROGRAM PAYS ITS FIRST REWARD

North Carolina's Stop Thefts, Assist Recoveries (STAR) program has
paid its first reward: $2,000 to an informant who helped bring about
the conviction of six persons in Brunswick County believed
responsible for $120,000 in burglaries.

"This is the first money to be paid through the industry's STAR
reward program and we believe this is only the beginning of a very
effective program to assist North Carolina law enforcement agencies
in fighting burglary rings," said William L. Pollard, executive vice
president of North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. and
chairman of the STAR reward committee.

"Our target for STAR is the thief or theft ring that commits 10 or
more burglaries or steals 10 or more vehicles. We call them high-
volume thieves," Pollard said Jan. 4.

The North Carolina Rate Bureau, made up of property/
casualty insurers, will put up as much as $20,000 a year for rewards.
Co-sponsors of the program are the North Carolina Association of
Police Chiefs and the North Carolina Sheriffs Association.

OREGON SUPREME COURT REQUIRES BROAD COVERAGE BY AUTO POLICIES

The Oregon Supreme Court ruled Dec. 28 that auto insurers doing
business in the state must cover vehicles owned by the policy-holder
even when the vehicles are being driven by someone else.

Ruling in two different cases, both involving Viking Insurance Co. of
Wisconsin, the court said Oregon law requires policies to cover
vehicles all the time, not just when they are being driven by certain
people.

One case involved a policy held by an Oregon man, Grant Perotti, that
covered him when he was driving any vehicle but didn't cover his
truck when it was driven by someone else. An employee of Perotti's,
driving the truck with his permission, was involved in an accident
and Viking refused to cover damages.

The other case involved a policyholder who allowed his car to be
driven by a 19-year-old woman who was involved in an accident. Viking
said its policy didn't apply in this case because a clause in the
policy excluded a vehicle driven by someone under 25.

Medicaid paid for 42 percent of all births in Tennessee last year and
the proportion is expected to rise above 50 percent this year, State

28.

The other 58 percent of births were paid for by the parents and their
insurance or were written off by the hospitals as bad debts, Luna

VIRGINIA CITES LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT MANDATED BENEFITS RAISE COSTS

Virginia's State Corporation Commission issued a report Dec. 27
saying that it was unable to find clear evidence that removing
mandated benefits would make health insurance more affordable.

It told the General Assembly's joint subcommittee on health care that
all mandated benefits and providers account for, on average, no more
than 10 percent of the policy premium for individual coverage and 20
percent of the group premium.

The study said it's impossible to answer the crucial question of how
many people are uninsured as a result of mandated benefits, because
insurance companies don't normally keep such data.

The report was based on a survey of 100 companies.

Insurance Commissioner Steven Foster suggested that the General
Assembly enact legislation requiring insurers to keep such data for
future use, as seven other states have done.

Having such data might make it possible to consider options such as
allowing consumers to get cheaper insurance by agreeing to forgo some
kinds of treatment, such as mental health therapy.

The state now requires insurers to provide coverage, for example, for
newborn children and in-patient psychiatric services and it requires
them to offer coverage for mammograms, obstetrical care and alcohol
and drug dependency.

It also requires insurers to reimburse a variety of health-care
providers, including clinical social workers, psychologists,
chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists and opticians.

WISCONSIN BILL WOULD BROADEN POLICYHOLDER REDRESS AGAINST INSURERS

Wisconsin State Rep. Peter Barca introduced legislation Dec. 28 that
would call for hearing examiners to decide monetary awards in
contested cases and allow policyholders to recover attorney's fees
when they sue insurers.

The measure also would create a public intervenor in insurance cases
in the Wisconsin Justice Department as well as requiring insurers to
publish their rates and file an annual report showing premiums
collected, claims paid and court awards.

The Democratic legislator said he was introducing the bill in light
of a state audit critical of a lack of consumer protections.

BUILDING CODES HELP PREVENT HURRICANE DAMAGE, STUDY FINDS

Strong building codes, properly enforced, can greatly reduce damage
from hurricanes, according to a new report by the All-Industry
Research Advisory Council.

The study was undertaken in cooperation with the National Committee
on Property Insurance and covered Hurricanes Alicia (1983), Diana
(1984), Gloria (1985) and Gilbert (1988), as well as last year's
Hurricane Hugo.

It found evidence that counties with strong codes and enforcement in
some areas, such as Charleston County, held down damage. It also
found trees were a mixed blessing -- causing damage from falling
limbs but reducing the impact of hurricane-force winds.

Single copies of the study, "Surviving the Storm: Building Codes,
Compliance, and the Mitigation of Hurricane Damage," are available
free from AIRAC at 1200 Harger Road, Suite 310, Oak Brook, IL 60521,
telephone 708-572-1177.

RELATIONSHIP SELLING: A NEW YEAR'S TALE

IMMS would like to start off 1996 with IMMS Chairman George
Nordhaus recounting his experiences with his insurance agent:

"My agent and I have a relationship. He writes my Homeowners, my
Auto policy, the floater on my wife's wedding ring, and our Umbrella
Liability coverage. All in all, it's a pretty good account -- probably above
average, in fact. The bills arrive on a staggered basis once every quarter,
so nothing too big hits at once.

Copious Contacts

"At least once a month I hear from my agent or the companies he
represents. I get a quarterly newsletter that's full of meaningful, easy-to-
understand information -- not as good as the ones IMMS offers, but nice.
We also receive a desk calendar, birthday cards for my wife and me,
updates on insurance legislation, offers to provide other services -- and
sometimes just a personalized letter telling me that he's still aware I'm a
client. Once a year he calls to review our insurance needs for the coming
year. Although he doesn't write our Life or Health coverage, he always
asks if we'd like to discuss our needs in these areas.

Creating Karma

"Every two weeks or so I get a call from a prospective client who tells
me, 'Your agent tells me that IMMS (or the Silver Membership CD-
ROM service, or employee testing, or newsletters, or whatever) is just
what my agency needs.' There's absolutely no doubt that these referrals
generate far more business for IMMS than I pay my agent and his
companies in premiums.

Quality Conquers

"How do you think I react when I receive a solicitation in the mail asking
for a 'free quote on your insurance'? Or if I see the same type of offer
floating across my screen when I'm browsing the Internet? Or when I get
a phone call at home from some prospector looking for my X-date? Or
the next time I run across an electronic insurance kiosk or a manned
booth in a mall? What do you think I'd do if any of these price sellers
could save me 10% or 15% on my annual premiums?

"You got it. I ignore them because my agent has taken the time and
trouble to build a strong relationship with me. We at IMMS have made
our New Year's resolution to make the same commitment to you. And it's
not a bad resolution for you to make to your customers, either."

AUTO INSURANCE CRUISES THE I-WAY

Utah consumers can use their home computers to surf the Internet for
Auto quotes from Workmen's Auto Insurance Co. through the InsWeb
marketplace gateway service. The Workmen's-InsWeb connection marks
the first Auto insurance-buying program on the I-Way. Workmen's, based
in Los Angeles, wrote $30 million in high-risk Private Passenger Auto
premium through independent agents in 10 Western states in 1995.
"We're pleased to have Workmen's on board," says InsWeb Chairman and
CEO Hussein Enan. "They understand the importance of the Internet as a
logical distribution medium for insurance, and they want to be on the
cutting edge of technology, connecting their agents with consumers in an
efficient and cost-effective way." InsWeb and Workmen's launched the
program in Utah because of the state's high rate of computer usage (51%
of households own PCs, compared to the nationwide average of 27%)
and the fact that digitized signatures are considered binding under Utah
law.

Wired for Success

Workmen's President George Nevitt sees the Internet as a low-cost
distribution medium that can strengthen direct communications between
consumers and the company's agent base. "Right now, many of our
insureds make first contact with an agent after seeing a Yellow Pages ad.
Now they will be able to go on-line and search for agents or receive
quotes more efficiently." InsWeb has a variety of irons in the Internet fire,
including a nationwide Personal Watercraft program that's up and
running. Pilot programs in the works include Auto insurance in other
states, Term Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Short-
Term Medical coverages. Several Commercial Lines programs will be on-
line early this year.

THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS: CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM

Net income for the P/C industry took a quantum leap in the third quarter,
hitting $5.6 billion -- more than double the $2.4 billion of the same period
last year. According to data on 96% of industry volume compiled by the
Insurance Services Office, Inc. and the National Association of
Independent Insurers, earnings for the nine months more than tripled,
skyrocketing from $4.8 billion to $14.7 billion. The combined ratio for
the quarter fell from 107.7% in the year-earlier quarter to 103.7%, a level
that Insurance Information Institute Senior Vice President and economist
Sean Mooney called the lowest he's seen in the last 10 years. Analysts
credit the upswing to the superheated stock market's boost to investment
income and the lack of megacatastrophes during the quarter.

On the other hand, Mooney expects a downswing in earnings for the
fourth quarter, when the industry will take a $2.1 billion hit in losses from
Hurricane Opal. He's also concerned about evidence of under-reserving
for future claims. We're not out of the woods yet.

BANKS IN INSURANCE: SIX THREATS

The Consumers' Association of Canada has voiced doubts about banks
getting into the insurance business. The association is concerned that
expanding the power of financial institutions into insurance marketing
might lead to: (1) overconcentration in the financial services sector, (2)
the cross-subsidizing of banks' insurance businesses by their other
operations, (3) the danger of rejecting higher-risk customers, (4)
inadequate insurance expertise, (5) the possibility of abuse in cross-selling
or "tied sales," and (6) potential loss of privacy rights in exchanging
information between a bank's lending and insurance operations.

A side note: The nation's "Big Six" banks earned a record $5.18 billion in
annual profits this year. Royal Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce led the pack, earning more than $1 billion apiece.

MP Warns Against Banks

Liberal MP John Nunziata thinks the feds should block any expansion by
banks into the insurance business. "I don't think there's too much support
in Ottawa for that to happen. I believe Canadians want the banks to be
more responsible and, I think, unless the banks shape up, the government
will intervene," said Nunziata in a recent broadcast on the Baton
Broadcast System. The lawmaker also called for a government
investigation of the "outrageous" service fees charged by banks.

ICBC TO EXPAND BODY SHOP NETWORK

The Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (ICBC) will launch a province-
wide body shop accreditation program come spring. The "customer
assured repair" (c.a.r.) shops will meet industry standards, have trained
staff and up-to-date equipment, offer courtesy cars, provide customer
waiting areas -- and guarantee their work in writing. ICBC project
manager Stacey Bernier says that the program, created to meet
customers' demands for recommended repair shops, is "really trying to
build a trust relationship" with the body-shop industry, with focus on the
customer. Last year, ICBC shelled out $400 million for repair parts and
services, with policyholders often finding themselves caught in the middle
of an adversarial relationship between the insurer and a repair shop.

Kamloops has been hosting a pilot c.a.r. operation since last October,
with nine of the city's 22 body shops accredited. Policyholders are not
required to use accredited shops; unaccredited shops will still be free to
do ICBC work. Said Don Beck, the Automotive Retailers Association's
point man in developing the program, "This will lift the industry to a new
level."

WHOSE BONO IS IT, ANYWAY?

It seems that pro bono publico ("for the public good") cases in which
attorneys provide their services to the poor free of charge often wind up
pro bono advocatorum ("for the lawyers' good"). More and more law
firms are using "fee-shifting statutes" that let the winning legal eagles bill
their opponents (usually a government entity) at their customary -- often
lucrative -- rates. The result: Taxpayers pick up the tab, which may end
up in seven figures. The partners of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati
wound up splitting $3.5 million after the firm won a case that led to
major reforms at California's Pelican Bay State Prison. The patrician
Manhattan firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft sued New York State
on behalf of an inmate who was confined to his cell for four days after
snatching an extra piece of cake on the prison chow line. A court
awarded the inmate $200. The Cadwalader firm did a bit better, ending
up with $100,000. There's nothing like doing well by doing good.

VE-MAIL: VICTORY IN COMMUNICATIONS

The same principles apply to paper memos and electronic messages alike.
Because E-mail requires speed and clarity, remember these points before
you post your cybermessage:

ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE

There's no such thing as asking too many questions when you're dealing
with a prospect. Questions offer a variety of benefits: (1) They make the
prospect feel important, (2) they provide vital information, (3) they allow
you to highlight your products' strengths, (4) they encourage you and
your prospect to think, (5) they allow the prospect to talk, (6) they
provide direction for your presentation, and (7) they create a positive
"yes" momentum. Any questions?

PAYROLL DEDUCTION: IT'S ELEMENTARY

Payroll deduction for Personal Lines is on the move. Coverages include
Auto, Homeowners, Nursing Home, and other employee-paid policies.
The antiquated direct billing system -- inflexible for the agent, customer,
and employer -- is giving way to a method that satisfies clients, simplifies
CSRs' workflow, and offers the agency a cash flow system that nearly
eliminates cancellation and reinstatement notices. Keeping customers first
means offering them a convenient payment option: in plain words, payroll
deduction. A typical family insurance program that covers the home, two
cars, and a boat, plus an Umbrella policy, would require a substantial
premium (with down payments and installments). Payroll deduction, with
its smaller, predictable payments, simplifies budgeting.

Payroll deduction lets you deliver a quality benefit at no extra cost to
employers, while strengthening relationships with your Commercial Lines
clients. The Marketing & Management Group's Benefit Innovations
operation offers a turnkey deduction program tailored for independent
agencies and brokerages. It includes a complete set of marketing
materials, communications tools, and a program manual. You may also
enjoy a discount on Insurance Deduction Services (IDS), a powerful
multicarrier payroll deduction and electronic funds transfer software
package created by Agency Management Services (AMS). For more

TAX REFORM COULD BLAST BALANCE SHEETS

Tax simplification could have a drastic effect on corporate balance
sheets, wiping out as much as $3 trillion in equity, according to tax
experts at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants who have
just completed a major study of alternatives to the current system.
        Many observers in Washington and on Wall Street believe that
Congress will undertake a major overhaul of the tax system by the turn of
the century. But the new AICPA study indicates that the "unintended
consequences" of some of the tax reform plans that have been put forth are
so great that the proposals will collapse of their own weight.
        "The level of discussion in the last two or three years (about tax
reform) has gotten to be significant, but once you look at some of this
information you become less certain that people will want to jump into
that," said Deborah Walker, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner and chair of the
AICPA's Tax Executive Committee.
        "The AICPA has long been an advocate of tax simplification, but
there are many, many unanswered questions," said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA
president.
        Various proposals have been made in Washington, and they differ in
many significant ways. But in general they would do away with the current
income-based system of taxation and replace it with one based on
consumption.
        Byrle M. Abbin, a retired partner and now a consultant at Arthur
Andersen, warned of "dire" effects on financial statements from tax
simplification. First, there would be some gains from the elimination of
the corporate income tax. He noted that $600 billion in deferred tax
liabilities would no longer be owed while just $100 billion in deferred tax
assets would be wiped out by a flat tax.
        But the big crunch would become with the imposition of a
consumption tax.
        "Without transition relief, deductions for depreciation of existing
assets would not be allowed under the new tax, and the entire proceeds from
a theoretical sale of assets at the end of the reporting year for the
initial application of the new tax law would be included in the tax base,"
the AICPA said in its new study, "Flat Taxes and Consumption Taxes: A Guide
to the Debate."
        Assuming a 10% tax rate and given that corporations have $20
trillion in tax basis, "it is possible that $2 trillion of deferred tax
liabilities would be created upon the enactment of this new tax," the AICPA
said.
        Under FAS 109, this entire amount, which could be higher with a
higher tax rate, would have to be booked in the year of tax change.
        "This would more than wipe out total corporate profits in any one
year and severely reduce the amount of shareholders' equity," the AICPA
warned. "Thus financial statements would have to reflect the enormous
increase in future taxes that results from lost depreciation deductions or
taxable gain on sales due to the elimination of tax basis."
        "The desire for efficiency and simplification has to be balanced
with problems of fairness," Abbin said. He acknowledged that some of these
problems could be reduced or resolved with appropriate transition rules.
But he predicted a battle royal over those rules.
        "Even if you do have transition rules, first you are going to have
strong discussions involving FASB, the SEC, the accounting profession and
Congress," he said. "It would be a tough, tough confrontation."
        Tax simplification could present additional problems for insurers.
Not the least of these would be the loss of tax advantaged status for many
life products and for policy payouts. In addition, however, insurance
companies and other financial service providers may find themselves subject
to a special tax regime.
        "Because it is difficult to identify and value services provided by
financial institutions, no country with a consumption tax has been able to
tax financial services in a manner consistent with consumption tax
principles," the AICPA said. "Exemption of financial institutions from
consumption tax generally results in overtaxation of financial services
provided to businesses and undertaxation of services provided to
consumers."
        In general the tax burden would increase for labor-intensive
businesses, such as insurers, and decrease for capital-intensive ones, the
AICPA said. While tax rates may be cut dramatically, tax outlays could
actually increase.
        "Even though the (proposed) rates sound low, you have to remember
that people don't pay rates, they pay taxes," Abbin said. "There'll be a
whole host of companies with lower rates that will have higher taxes to pay
because major components of their business cannot be deducted."
        Another area where there could be surprising consequences to tax
reform is in international operations. "The exclusion of exports from gross
receipts provides large tax benefits to those firms that export," the AICPA
said.
        In addition, Abbin said that the "U.S. could become a tax haven"
under some of the reform proposals. "This could bring retaliation from
foreign countries where we have operations." --Miles Maguire

FAIR VALUE OF LIABILITIES STILL A CHALLENGE

It can be done, but it won't be easy.
        That's the clear message about setting fair values of insurance
liabilities that came out of last month's conference on the subject at New
York University.
        The two key challenges are that there is no active market for
insurance liabilities and that such liabilities typically contain embedded
options, which are best estimated through complex valuation methodologies.
        On the other hand, there is a general consensus that the current
lopsided approach to marking only one side of the balance sheet to market
is creating distortions in financial statements.
        "One can conclude that the current GAAP accounting environment is
subject to ambiguity and inconsistency with regard to the underlying
economics of transactions, can result in significant volatility of earnings
and/or surplus, is losing the goals of company comparability and
comparability over time, is not capturing all the risk exposures of the
company and so is not reflecting what has really transpired and the impacts
of a company's management actions on the firm," said David N. Becker,vice
president, chief actuarial officer and appointed actuary at Lincoln
National Life Insurance Co.
        He presented a paper at the conference describing a methodology
called the "option adjusted value of distributable earnings" (OAVDE), which
can be used to find the fair value of liabilities after determining the
present value of future earnings under various scenarios.
        "Applying finance and option pricing theory directly to liabilities
is a powerful and useful, but it is not a completely valid analogy for
insurance enterprises," Becker said.
        "While market value analysis  does provide insight as to the risk
posture, it does not provide all the insight into the risk/reward posture
of the value of the firm that OAVDE analysis does," he added. "This is due
to the omission from the market value analysis of significant economic
variables and their timing that affects the value of the insurance
enterprise."
        A similar point was made by Christopher D. O'Brien, appointed
actuary of Royal Life Insurance in Liverpool, England. "We usually consider
the 'main' liabilities under a life assurance policy as being the monetary
amounts contractually payable to policyholders in specified circumstances,"
he said. "However, life assurance is a long-term contract under which there
is also a continuing obligation of the company to provide future
'services.'" These include advising, administration and investment, he
said. He also proposed a method calling for consideration of future
revenues discounted to present value.
        Dennis L. Carr, executive vice president and chief product
development officer at ARM Financial Group Inc., provide a real-life
experience of developing fair value liabilities for an insurance company.
In 1994, he said, the company had negative equity under FAS 115 and was
facing questions from rating agencies, distributors and others.
        Using a draft paper from the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA),
input from the firm's outside auditors and its internal asset/liability
management models, ARM came up with a way to show fair value of
liabilities, which used a mixture of marking to market and making value
estimations. Using this approach, the $14 million in negative GAAP equity
at the end of 1994 became $115 million in positive equity.
        "Fair value was implemented, and the results have been reasonable,"
Carr said. "Questions remain, but they are easier to answer."
        Also at the conference the AAA distributed its white paper on fair
values of liabilities. This describes two general approaches to the matter,
a constructive one that focuses on valuing liabilities and a deductive one
that first sets the overall value of the firm, such as in OAVDE.
        "While both methods are theoretically defensible and appealing,
they can produce different answers and do not yield identical answers
except in the simplest, most contrived hypothetical case," the paper says.
        It adds that the constructive approach is "more consistent with
asset valuation and reflective of valuations in the thin secondary GIC
market" while the deductive approach may be more appropriate "in the thin
company or block acquisition market."

SURPLUS NOTES BACKED IN NEW REPORT

Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. says in a new report that surplus
notes spreads should narrow as investors come to understand them and their
similarity to the debt issued by insurance holding companies.
        "Understanding the similarity of 'double leverage' is important in
understanding the risk of surplus notes compared to traditional debt
instruments," the rating agency said. "Like their mutual counterparts that
have issued surplus notes in the 144a market, many stock insurers also
record equity capital on their statutory balance sheets that has been
financed in public debt markets."
        Because the market for surplus notes issued by healthy companies is
relatively young, many investors do not understand the true risk profile of
the instruments, DCR said. "Because of this, market spreads on surplus
notes appear higher than necessary," it said.
        The rating agency expects the market to grow as new risk based
capital rules are extended to the P/C sector. It also sees greater use of
the instrument by stock companies.
        "Stock insurers who have issued surplus notes have traditionally
done so privately to their holding companies for various tax reasons,
though DCR expects stock insurer issuance in the 144a market to begin
shortly," the rating agency said.
        In its view, surplus notes are very similar to holding company debt
in terms of subordination. "In a holding company structure, the insurance
company subsidiary's most junior obligation, common equity, is actually the
funding source for the holding company's senior debt," DCR said. "This
makes holding company senior debt a highly subordinated obligation from the
perspective of the organization as a whole."
        The rating agency argues that investors should evaluate surplus
notes on a company-specific basis, "by looking at both the credit rating on
the note and the claims paying ability of the issuer." DCR considers
surplus notes in much the same way it looks at debt-financed equity capital
in a holding company structure.
        "If DCR believes the positive effect on earnings, operating
leverage and RBC outweighs the future effect of debt service, the addition
of debt financed equity capital can improve an insurer's claims paying
ability," the rating agency said, adding that the same holds true with
surplus notes issued by mutuals.
        DCR acknowledges that there are some regulatory concerns that hang
over the market but says they are too often misunderstood. "Regulatory
risks can be more direct for surplus notes than for holding company debt
because of the ... ability of the regulator to directly suspend interest
and principal payments on a surplus note without putting the note into
default," the rating agency conceded.
        But it added that regulators would be mindful of the message that
such drastic measures would send in disrupting sales and the ability of an
issuer to meet policyholder obligations. It said suspension of surplus
notes payments will occur only "in extreme circumstances."
        DCR also said investors can largely disregard the NAIC's official
position, for RBC purposes, that surplus notes are equivalent to preferred
stock.  This "is not tied to the riskiness of surplus notes, but rather
reflects regulatory policy aimed at discouraging insurers from investing in
surplus notes." This could lead to an unhealthy pyramiding of capital,
regulators believe.

QUESTIONS TO BE RAISED

These are questions the AICPA says businesses should be asking
about the impact of tax reform.
         What will be the new recordkeeping and reporting requirements? How
should computer software and information be changed? How will tax staffing
requirements change? How will tax staff be retrained?
         Should businesses reconfigure their multinational operations that
are structured around current rules?
         How are plans for business reorganizations affected by the change
to a replacement consumption tax?
         Given that interest is unlikely to be deductible, should
businesses consider greater use of equity financing? Should businesses
continue to provide health insurance to their employees?
         Should partnerships and sole proprietorships consider
incorporating now that they are subject to the same tax as corporations?
         With all forms of savings tax favored under a consumption tax,
should pension plans be altered?
         Will the Internal Revenue Service administer the new tax? Will its
budget over the transition have to be increased?
         What are the additional administrative costs of transitioning into
a new consumption tax?

NEW YORK UNVEILS CROWD-PLEASING REFORM

In an effort to open the playing field in New York, the state
Department of Insurance and the governor's office have offered up over 100,
or two-thirds, of the 150 insurance regulations to either dissolve or
partially dismantle in the largest regulatory reform effort in the
department's history.
        Superintendent of Insurance Ed Muhl and Gov. George Pataki issued a
joint release that was a celebration of the marketplace and the
possibilities repealing 24 regulations and reforming 77 of them could hold
for new, more and better insurance products.
        The reform weighed critical remarks from the industry and trade
associations in its process.
        For example, an unnamed property/casualty insurer called for
modification of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices regulation because
"significant market conduct scrutiny" of the regulation means "insurers
doing business in New York devote inordinate resources to creating paper
files and record trails."
        Thus, the standard claims form of Regulation 64 was identified by
department staff as a subject of potential modification.
        Others were identified for reform because of the changing
marketplace, with the heavy growth of managed care being a chief element of
that change.The rule governing minimum standards for sale of health
insurance, for example, while still the "core of regulatory authority in
the oversight of accident and health insurance," must be modified to meet
the needs of an HMO environment, the department wrote.
        Regulations deemed repealable for reasons of obsolescence or burden
to insurers included those governing standard claims forms for health
insurance, investments in revenue bonds, mortgages as authorized
investments, underwriting discrimination against females, audited financial
statements and mass merchandising of personal coverage.
        The department estimated that the reform package will result in an
annual savings to the industry of $25 million to $40 million.
        "Regulation always imposes costs, both on the regulated industry
and the consumer.... Regulations that do not serve the public interest will
be either discarded or revised," Muhl stated.
        The reform effort was made at the mandate of Pataki to cut red tape
in business in an executive order early last year. The governor also
indicated then that new regulations would be subject to a "rigorous cost-
benefit analysis."
        Trade groups such as the Alliance of American Insurers are pleased
with the outcome of the governor's order.
        "We sent in quite a package of recommendations and are pleased to
say that some of them are in the areas that Pataki has slated for reform,"
said John Cucci, vice president of the northeast region for the Alliance.
        One, for example, that was of real concern was Regulation 68,
overseeing auto no-fault insurance.
        "Under the present provisions, a doctor could be treating a victim
for nine months before the insurer even knows about it. That creates room
for fraud. We suggested a 10 day report time," Cucci said.

TEXAS TO CURB WORKERS COMP

Aetna, Allstate, Zurich and 14 other insurer groups must cut their
workers comp rates or justify them to the Texas Insurance Department unless
they want to face possible rollback hearings, the TDI said.
        The TDI gave the insurers, which have a total of 74 companies
writing workers comp insurance, a Feb. 1 deadline to respond.
        Many companies cut their rates in response to savings from the 1989
reform law upheld by the Texas Supreme Court last February and losses
dropped dramatically, but some carriers have persisted in charging higher
rates, TDI Commissioner Elton Bomer charged.
        "These letters should come as no surprise to the insurance
companies. The carriers have known for months of my concern that workers'
compensation rates are too high, particularly rates for small businesses,"
Bomer said. "TDI's patience has worn thin."
        On average, rates are too high by 4% to 17% based on data from 271
companies, according to a recent analysis prepared by TDI's actuarial
consultant.But, losses in 1994 were more than half of what they would have
been without the reforms, the analysis showed. The state comp fund was also
included in the analysis.
        A Texas law that took effect in 1992 allows insurers to set their
own workers' comp rates. The law specifies, though, that rates may not
excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
        Bomer can disapprove rates that violate that standard and can fine
a company that consistently overcharges.
        Letters were also sent to American States, General Accident, Great
American, Gulf, Houston General, Indiana Lumbermens, Nationwide, Old
Republic, Reliance, Royal, Sentry, State Farm, Tokio Marine and Unitrin.

OCC LAYS PLANS FOR INSURANCE OVERSIGHT

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has created a task
force to examine how national bank insurance agency activities should be
supervised and examined if the industry wins the Barnett case, in which
oral arguments are scheduled before the high court Jan. 16.
        The OCC won banking industry support Jan. 4 to determine how it
should react if the Supreme Court determines that Section 92 of the
National Bank Act, which says banks can sell insurance from offices in
towns of 5,000 or fewer, preempts state laws barring certain banks from
conducting such activities. "They are laying the groundwork for determining
quickly how national bank insurance activities should be supervised," said
one banker familiar with the meeting, held at OCC offices.
        Among the questions asked at the session, according to one banker,
is whom the agency should consult before finalizing its rules. Among those
who should be involved, it was suggested, were state insurance
commissioners and bank and insurance trade groups
        The areas to be examined include what types of licenses should be
required of national banks selling insurance from offices in small towns.
        Another crucial area is whether the rules outlined by the OCC for
national bank insurance sales should be guidelines or regulations. The
difference is that violations of guidelines is subject to wrist-slapping;
violations of regulations bring down the whole panoply of fines, dismissals
and bank takeover mandated in potentially harsh federal bank enforcement
statutes. For example, violation of federal bank agency cease and desist
orders can bring fines of up to $1 million a day against institutions as
well as their officers and directors.
        The agency decided to proceed after a meeting with representatives
of the American Bankers Association and the Bankers Roundtable. According
to several bankers who attended the session, those briefing the bankers
included Konrad Alt, chief assistant to Comptroller Eugene A. Ludwig, and
Julie Williams, agency chief counsel. A decision on what to do next was
expected by Jan. 15.

HANCOCK FINED FOR CHURNING

Another life insurer has joined the ranks of those that have been
accused of being tangled in a culture of improper sales practices. This
time, it's costing $1 million.
        In the shadow of the looming New York State Supreme court decision
on the settlement of New York Life's sales practices, the New York
Insurance Department fined John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. Jan. 3
for more than a decade of numerous violations ranging from the company's
advertising practices to charges of churning.
        The Boston-based company admitted to the violations, signed a
stipulation and has paid the fine on violations occurring between 1983 to
1994. The stipulation listed violations for improper advertising, sales
practices and form filing. John Hancock also agreed to mend its ways so
such failures would not again occur. The company released a statement
saying there are now sales practice and advertising safeguards in place
that are working well.
        It also said the issues "raised by New York are no longer
problems." John Hancock tried to distance itself from the unauthorized
activities by noting they were primarily done by individual agents and
employees and "not John Hancock itself."
        The stipulation will also be provided to John Hancock's board of
directors and the company will cooperate with the department in any further
disciplinary actions against current or former agents, managers and
employees involved in the violations, according to the terms of the
stipulation.
        New York has announced a move toward deregulation, but violations
such as those identified at John Hancock are likely to come under closer
scrutiny. The department's Reg 60 is one of the few targeted for tougher
oversight by the department, which recently released a report promoting
modification or repeal of over 100 state insurance regs.

GEORGIA BLUES' CONVERSION GETS GREEN LIGHT

The conversion plan of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia Inc. has
been approved by the state insurance department with only minor adjustments
barely a month after a public hearing in November, pushing it closer to
becoming the first member plan to restructure and setting the stage for a
trip to the private placement market.
        One of the pair of conditions increases the number of directors
elected by the over 160,000 policyholders from two to six to increase their
voice, the department stated. The policyholders will become stockholders
when the conversion is completed.
        The second condition prevents the name from changing to Cerulean,
as proposed in the plan submitted by Blue Cross late in October.
        The approval of Commissioner John Oxendine, though expected, marks
one of the first approvals of a Blue Cross conversion to a for-profit. The
conversion process in other states such as California and Maryland has been
fraught with discord involving merger and acquisition terms and the use of
nonprofit funds in public charity foundations.
        "This could be the first, but we'll have to wait and see," said a
spokesperson for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
        "The climate is different in each state and in every state the
entities need to look at their own climate. What works in Georgia may not
work in another place" she said.
        "The next step is the private placement, and then the registration
statement needs to be approved by the SEC," the Georgia Blues spokesperson
stated.
        "Under the plan every effort has been made to protect policyholders
while paving the way for the company to stay competitive in the ever-
changing health insurance market," Oxendine stated.

KEMPER UPGRADE FOLLOWS MERGER

Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the senior debt rating of
Kemper Corp., to A1 from Baa2, the insurance financial strength rating of
its life subsidiaries to Aa3 from Baa1.
        The rating agency took the action after Zurich Insurance Group and
Investment Partners said it completed its acquisition of Kemper. It said
the action was based on the strength of the companies' ultimate parent,
Zurich Insurance Co., which plans to sell off Kemper's troubled commercial
real holdings.
        The two subsidiaries are Federal Kemper Life Assurance Co. and
Kemper Investors Life Insurance Co.

FASB EXTRACTS LEASES FROM HEDGING PROJECT

The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly the
scope of the hedging and derivatives project  Dec. 21 when it decided that
leases would not be included.
        The project, in its current form, provides the option of marking
derivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While other
financial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to account
for leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.
        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that it
would expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, a
FASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with the
issues that most concern hedging and derivatives."
        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of the
project, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not to
include leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to the
difficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the lease
from the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedging
project, he said.
        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack of
valuation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicated
issues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in the
derivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on the
capitalization or valuation of all leases.
        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change in
the value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,
should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and that
the interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.
        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,
related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earnings
on a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain on
a purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent that
expense has been recognized for the option premium paid.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TAKES TINY STEP FORWARD

The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how to
report accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments and
cumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should be
reported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.
        The decision represents at least another minor step forward in
FASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late fall
and seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in the
income statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when it
tentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive income
should be reported in one or more statements of income for financial
performance.
        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are by
examining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, of
which only the latter is currently included in net income. The matter
becomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported as
cumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-period
adjustments in others.
        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to develop
examples illustrating the three different approaches for reporting
accounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first one
is the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensive
income strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,
referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive income
broadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excluding
accounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report both
comprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustments
displayed as the difference between the two.
        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that any
of these three approaches would be workable if they were applied
consistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quo
approach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistent
with either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-
inclusive concept.
        The Board members expressed concerns about the effects on other
financial statements.

ACSEC TO EXPLORE BALANCE SHEET

The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a new
project to determine when various types of securities transactions should
be recorded on the balance sheet.
        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, in
accordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where the
counterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingent
transactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred to
as "to-be-announced" trades.
        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types of
transactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date or
on the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice as
to when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions among
users of the instruments.

ROYAL RESTRUCTURING PAVES WAY FOR MERGER

ROYAL INSURANCE, the UK composite insurer, appears to be taking a big
step towards merging its two direct writing operations as well as
beefing up their critical mass.

Royal is transferring all its personal line motor and household
business done without intermediation of an agent into Royal Direct, the
smaller of its direct writing operations. This move places Royal Direct
on an equal footing, in terms of number of policies, with The Insurance
Services (TIS), the group's other direct operation.

The latest restructuring of the Royal group's direct activities helps
pave the way for an expected merger of its two direct operations next
year.

Apart from enjoying the benefits of having an enhanced critical mass, a
merged operation would then be in a strong position to challenge
Churchill Insurance for the number two position among the direct
writers.

In fact, Sun Alliance Connections, the direct writing operation of
composite insurer Sun Alliance, formed earlier this year, had a ready-
made customer base of motor and household policyholders that exceeded
those of Churchill. Sun Alliance transferred its non-intermediary
business into its direct writing operation which now has about 400,000
motor policies and 500,00 household policies, compared with Churchill's
600,000 in motor and 250,000 in household.

Roy Randall, a spokesman for the Royal Insurance group, explains that
the business being transferred into Royal Direct is "all the stuff we
come by directly, by people coming into one of our 60 branches around
the country or responding to one of our ads with a coupon, without the
involvement of an agency."

He adds that, once completed, it would have about 400,000 policies in
force compared with 45,000 at present, putting it on a par with TIS,
which has about 430,000 policies.

Since Royal Direct was founded in 1994, stockbrokers', analysts and the
press have queried why the group is running two separate direct writing
operations rather than one.

Randall, while acknowledging the fact that "at a certain point in time,
a decision will have to be taken," says it would not have to be in the
near future. He adds, that for the time being "we feel there is scope
for two direct brands run by Royal in the market."

He supports his statement by explaining that the two direct writers are
perceived as quite different animals by the market. TIS is seen
primarily as a motor insurer, while Royal Direct inherits its parent's
strong brand image in the household insurance segment. Randall also
points out that the operations use different marketing techniques from
each other.

While the two operations do indeed maintain distinct personalities,
although the latest move could well blur that, Randall's argument is
something of a rationalisation after the fact. Royal started TIS in
1987 when direct writing was still something of a novelty. Concerned at
the potentially negative response from insurance brokers, Royal wanted
to break into this market, while distancing the direct operation from
the rest of the group.

After market research at the start of 1994, however, showed the
strength, in terms of brand recognition of the name"Royal", Royal
Direct was born a few months later. Randall maintains that Royal Direct
has fared better nationally than its parent had foreseen. It is now
being beefed up to acquire a higher profile in the market as a whole.

With concern for broker opposition a thing of the past, and its
awareness of the value of the Royal brand name, the group has to resort
to the argument that its two direct operations serve different markets
to justify their continued separate existence. A merger seemingly looks
inevitable.

HSBC CHANGES IMAGE IN MAJOR SHAKE-UP

THE HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) is undertaking a
major shake-up of its insurance activities in the Asia-Pacific region.
This move underlines the increasing importance to the HSBC group of
insurance as well as the growing importance of the region's insurance
market.

The restructuring is aimed at helping the banking group's insurance
businesses to accelerate their continuing expansion into the fast
growing markets in that region. It is also aimed at simplifying the
management of its insurance operations, yielding some cost savings.

All, bar one, of its operating insurance companies in that region are
changing their names to reflect that they form part of the HSBC group.
A new simpler corporate structure has been designed with a holding
company called HSBC Insurance formed under whose umbrella all HSBC's
insurance companies operating in the Asia- Pacific region will fall.

Directly below HSBC Insurance is now a 82.5 percent held non-life
holding company named HSBS Non-Life Holdings, previously known as
Carlingford Lombard, under which will be housed the group's five non-
life insurance operating companies.

Simon Brett, the former chief executive of Carlingford Lombard
Holdings, has been appointed chief executive of HSBC Insurance
Holdings. Brett noted that insurance was becoming an increasingly
important business for the HSBC group. He maintained that the
reorganisation will have the result of ensuring that the business rests
on a strong base, with effective control, investment and credit risk.

"Within the Asia-Pacific region, our new identity and management will
enable us to grow by drawing on Hong-kong's strengths and distribution
network. We intend to expand insurance sales both within Hong Kong,
where we are an important force in the industry, and in Southeast Asia,
where the bank continues to expand particularly in the retail sector,"
he added.

As part of the reorganisation, Kenneth Kwok is to succeed Brett as
chief executive of HSBC Non-life Holdings. He will, however, also
retain his current responsibilities as managing director of Lombard
General Insurance, which is to be renamed HSBC Lombard Insurance.

CHINESE MARKET BEGINS TO OPEN

CHINA revealed during a recent international insurance conference held
in the country that its insurance market will be opened to foreign
competition through a carefully regulated and managed process.

Wu Jie, vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economic Systems, speaking at the conference, said that the industry
must develop in accordance with the reality and needs of China and that
liberalisation must take place under the principles of equality and
mutual benefit.

Despite having 80 international insurance companies and some 120
representative offices, China's insurance market is still dominated by
the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC). PICC controls almost 90
percent of the country's insurance business with 225,000 branches and
agencies employing hundreds of thousands of staff nationwide.

In terms of foreign competition, American International Assurance (AIA)
of the US and Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance of Japan - have been
licensed by the People's Bank of China, the country's insurance
regulator, to conduct restricted business in the country. Both
companies are restricted in their activities to the Shanghai
municipality.

However, AIA received permission two months ago to underwrite policies
in Guangzhou. Since it began underwriting life policies in Shanghai two
years ago, AIA has been able to wrest 30 percent of the city's market
from PICC.

Yang Wenyou, director of the Foreign Financial Institutions Department
of the People's Bank of China, disclosed at the same conference that
the central bank would increase the number of cities open to foreign
insurance companies in the next couple of years. And by the turn of the
century, liberalisation would affect all major coastal cities.

China's insurance market remains vastly undeveloped. Since 1949,
insurance - along with all other social welfare benefits - was managed
within the domain of state-organised rural collectives and urban work
units. Insurance liberalisation began only in the mid-1980s, when
China's economic reforms demanded considerable availability of personal
insurance products.

Today, total insurance revenue nationwide amounts to only $8 billion a
year. National per capita life insurance expenditure is $1.40. By
comparison, per capita life insurance expenditure in India is $3.50. In
Japan, per capital life insurance expenditure is $3,457.

US INSURERS FAIL TO INVEST IN PEOPLE

IN CORPORATE America, investment in human resources generally rivals or
exceeds capital spending. However, a recent survey has revealed that
while US insurance companies say people are critical to their success,
they rank investment in human resources well below other business
issues.

Completing a survey of 251 leading companies, the New York consultancy
of Towers Perrin found that an $80,000-per-year employee can represent
a million dollar investment over a ten- year period.

Considering the costs involved, Towers Perrin managing principal
Jeffrey Schmidt, urged companies to treat the hiring of employees as a
capital investment, evaluating the costs against the contributions of
their staff.

Schmidt warned that while people costs are a means of investing in a
company's future, few corporations actually measure the fiscal value of
their prospective employees, or consider how those same employees will
help the company reach its strategic goals.

In the insurance industry, he noted that executives fail to invest in
staff according to their perceived importance. One hundred percent of
the 300 senior insurance executives who were surveyed by Towers Perrin
said improving employee performance would improve business. Eighty-six
percent said employees are one of the most important variables in their
company's success.

However, only about one-third of those respondents listed performance
enhancement and people-related investments as key strategies.

"While executives believe that employees are critical to the execution
of their companies' strategies, other investments to enhance corporate
performance are still taking higher priority", said Towers Perrin
principal, Rick Berry.

The Towers Perrin insurance survey questioned senior line and human
resource executives from 28 leading insurance companies, who rated
customer satisfaction and financial performance as the top two
strategic issues, at 86 percent and 75 percent respectively. Meanwhile,
employee investment in people ranked third and fourth in importance, at
39 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Berry warned that insurers may be overlooking the connection between
employee performance and customer satisfaction and financial success.

"To achieve their goals, insurance companies must have the right people
in the right places, doing the right things, at the right cost," said
Berry.

PHILIPPINES SET FOR FOREIGN FIRMS

FOLLOWING AN enlargement of the banking sector earlier this year, the
Philippines will open its insurance market to foreign companies from
next year.

Insurance Commissioner Eduardo Malinis has said that the opening of the
industry is part of the Filipino government's economic liberalisation
policy and is an effort taken towards complying with World Trade
Organisation rules.

The government amended its Foreign Investment Act a year ago to allow
ten new life insurance licences and ten new general insurance licences
to foreign firms. The rules for investment in the insurance industry
will be reviewed again in October 1996.

No firms have yet applied for the general insurance licences, although
eight companies have indicated interest in the life insurance licences,
while one other, Aetna Life Insurance, has already been granted a
licence. There are currently about 100 general insurance companies
operating in the Philippines.

UNITED STATES:  CHUBB TO DEVELOP INTERNET LINK

JOINING THE rush to the Internet, Chubb is working with Sun
Microsystems of California and Sedgwick, the sixth-largest US
brokerage, to develop an on-line system to link insurers with risk
managers and brokers.

According to Thomas Cornwell, a vice-president and manager of Chubb's
global electronics and technology unit, the project is still in the
pilot stage, but the three companies have agreed to work together to
develop a method of swift electronic communication that will allow them
to share claims information and other data.

They will start by sharing claims data via e-mail, according to Sun
Microsystems, which initiated the trilateral partnership based upon its
ongoing relationships with Sedgwick and New Jersey-based Chubb.

Sun, a $5.9 billion computer corporation, envisages an interactive, on-
line marketplace with a full range of insurance and risk management
products and services accessible via the Internet.

The World Wide Web has become the new marketplace of choice for
insurers, and according to Stephen Lowe, principal for Tillinghast-
Towers Perrin, electronic marketing and distribution systems will
eventually alter operation and compensation structures throughout the
industry.

Kemper and Northwestern Mutual are among the large insurers which have
recently established sites on the Web, offering information regarding
ratings, assets, products and services, the companies' organisational
structures, and agent/broker information.

Kemper, along with American RE, UNUM and several other insurers, has
established a centralised Web site, known as Insweb, which serves as an
electronic hub for multi-company services.

Cornwell noted that while Chubb is expecting to put its entire company
on the network within the next year, the insurer is moving cautiously
in terms of on-line security issues, and is currently working to devise
computer security systems that will protect its proprietary data.

LLOYDS AND TOUCHLINE TO TEAM UP

In what is probably the first and certainly the biggest UK deal between
an independent direct writer and a banking group, Lloyds Bank has
teamed up with Touchline Insurance Company to offer private motor
insurance

THE TEMPERATURE in an already overheated, overcrowded and fiercely
competitive UK private motor insurance market is set to rise still
higher. Lloyds Bank, a major banking group that already has well in
excess of 1.2 million general insurance customers, is to enter this
market at the start of next year.

Lloyds Bank, through its insurance arm Lloyds Bank Insurance Services,
has forged a strategic partnership with Touchline, in order to extend
its product portfolio into the motor insurance market. The new product
will be marketed by Lloyds Bank Insurance Services under the Lloyds
Bank Insurance Direct brand name.

Touchline, owned by the giant French insurance group GAN, will do both
the underwriting and administration of the service, including premium
quotations and claims handling. Touchline is a direct writer in the
household market as well.

This new venture is yet another example of how increasingly banking
groups are forging new links with insurers through establishing
strategic alliances. It also underlines the trend by banking groups to
offer an ever wider range of personal insurance products to their
clients.

In one important sense, this partnership breaks new ground in the
direct writing field in the UK. It looks to be easily the most
significant, if not the only major one, judged in terms of winning
potential customers that has been struck between two independent
parties, both of which are part of unrelated financial services groups.
The partners, however, do not share in each other's profits or losses
generated by their respective operational functions.

More recently, the route chosen by other banking or building societies
is to set up joint ventures with traditional insurers to sell into the
personal lines insurance market. Moreover, as in the cases of Abbey
National, a banking group, which has teamed up with Commercial Union
and the Woolwich, a building society, with Legal & General, both have
an equity stake in the underwriting company run by their respective
insurer.

The framework does allow for these initially relatively small stakes in
the underwriting company to change markedly in the longer term.

Both the Abbey National and the Woolwich will do all the marketing, but
their customers will not be in direct contact with the insurer as in
the Lloyds/Touchline set up. But, apparently, the people employed by
Touchline to handle incoming calls re- routed from Lloyds Bank
divisions will have been partly trained by the bank to ensure they know
about the other services on offer.

According to Sandy Dunn, managing director of Touchline, no discussions
with regard to setting up an operation along similar lines of the Abbey
National and Commercial Union joint venture took place. Nor for that
matter did "we look at it." Obviously, he thinks the way the
partnership with Lloyds has been structured reflects "a sensible
strategy in a highly competitive market."

Clearly Lloyds Bank Insurance Services has decided to stick with its
preferred way of doing insurance business, in that at this stage, at
any rate, it does not want to get involved with the underwriting side.
It uses a panel of insurers for the range of insurance products,
including mortgage related products, travel insurance, but works solely
with Sun Alliance for a particularly successful contents product
offered.

The set-up with Touchline is noticeably different from its arrangement
with other insurers. Both Touchline and Lloyds Bank Insurance Services
will be competing directly with each other when it comes to winning
household business.

Naturally, Touchline is pleased that it was chosen by Lloyds Insurance
Services as the partner for this venture ahead of rivals. At first,
Lloyds Bank ran a pilot scheme with Landmark, the US giant insurance
group AIG's direct writing operation in the UK, for several months to
offer motor insurance to its customers. Landmark was the underwriter,
but there was no full marketing campaign to Lloyds' customers. In
October Landmark was replaced by Touchline. However the test runs will
continue until the end of this year before the fully-fledged operation
goes live. Dunn maintains that Touchline's own customers who were won
through its usual direct writing communication channels will "not pay
more" but "the same" for an identical policy marketed under the Lloyds
Bank Insurance Direct brand.

Understandably, no information as to how the contract between Lloyds
Insurance Services and Touchline has been structured with regard to the
terms, such as commission paid, is being divulged.

Presumably, for Touchline this deal is an attractive way of helping it
secure critical mass, estimated to be in the region of 500,000
policyholders for non-niche players. It will only have been in business
for three years by the end of this year. At present it has only 150,000
policyholders, both motor and household.

Based on the assumption that Touchline has done its homework properly,
after paying commission to Lloyds it will still be able to acquire new
customers profitably over the longer term. One advantage could be that
Lloyds Bank customers may prove, on average, to be more loyal than
those generally acquired through the normal channels by a direct
writer.

Dunn says Touchline was chosen "not on the basis of size but for the
quality of our service." In a statement issued to the press, Keith
Gibbs, marketing director at Lloyds Bank Insurance Services
comments:"Lloyds Bank aims to provide customers with quality products
and excellent customer service at competitive prices. I am delighted
that Lloyds Bank Insurance Services will be entering the motor
insurance market in partnership with Touchline, who share our focus on
quality, customer service and competitiveness."

The banking group has some 6 million customers to whom it can sell
motor insurance. In time, the marketing approach adopted as well as the
level of intensity of the advertising campaigns should become clear. No
doubt, the fact that GAN has the financial muscle and expertise to back
Touchline was viewed favourably by the Lloyds banking group. GAN, which
is undergoing restructuring, is among the world's ten largest insurers
and the third largest in Europe. In part the Lloyds/Touchline
partnership underlines a trend that is gaining momentum. More direct
writers are looking to cement links with affinity groups, such as
professional bodies, especially with competition so strong, while a
proliferation of recent entrants fight hard to achieve critical mass
with leaders determined to increase market share.

In some respects, the Lloyds/Touchline partnership does resemble that
of an affinity group type set up, acknowledges Dunn. The benefits of
picking up a large number of customers through the affinity group type
route is generally seen as attractive by direct writers.

It is certainly not going to be plain sailing for Lloyds Insurance
Services to make serious headway into the motor market. It does have a
potentially huge customer base to cross-sell into as well as an
established Lloyds Bank brand name to exploit. However, if both parties
get their act together, the Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct brand could
yet become a major force in the marketplace.

A RISKY BUSINESS

The findings of a study completed by the Insurance Services Office does
not make pleasant reading for US property-casualty insurers

THE PROPERTY-CASUALTY insurance industry in the US appears to contain
greater risks and generate less profit than non-insurance industries,
according to a study recently completed by the Insurance Services
Office (ISO). It found that while property- casualty (PC) insurance
companies are less profitable than other firms, they share the same or
greater risks.

The ISO study measured risk as the variability in return on year- end
net worth for the 20 largest insurers and 20 largest firms in 30 non-PC
insurance groups, including life and health.

According to ISO, the 1979 to 1993 median rate of return for the 20
largest PC insurers was 9.6 percent, 1.6 percent less than the average
of the corresponding medians for the 20 largest firms in each of the
non-insurance groups.

Risk was determined to be higher among insurers than most non-
insurance groups by about three to one, based on the following three
factors: variability in rate of return; variability adjusted for
industry cycles; and an ISO composite index that measures the average
of the first two.

The ISO study also found that stockholder-owned insurers earn higher
returns but face greater risks than mutuals, that commercial lines have
been more profitable but face more risk than personal lines, and that
agency companies are generally more profitable and riskier than direct
writers.

PC companies also have a higher failure rate than other industries,
according to ISO research, which found that while the annual failure
rate for the economy as a whole averaged 0.7 percent between 1969 to
1994, the property-casualty insurer's failure rate for the same period
was 0.9. Failure rates for PC are also more variable than the general
economy, owing to catastrophe losses.

Despite the high risk factor, the ISO pointed out that the US PC
industry has enjoyed its lowest combined ratio since 1988.

According to figures just released by ISO and the National Association
of Independent Insurers (NAII), the industry's 1995 nine-month combined
ratio was 105.4, with an after-tax income of $14.7 billion for the same
period. That sum more than triples the $4.8 billion netted during the
first nine months of the previous year. While premium rates have not
risen, some of the improvement can be attributed to a reduction in CAT
losses.

Analyst Jay Cohen of Merrill Lynch noted that reduced losses,
particularly in workers' compensation claims, have also contributed to
the overall improved performance.

DARK DAYS LOOM ON UK HORIZON

Bacon & Woodrow's analysis of the motor insurance business results of
the leading UK players is revealing. It provides both a good insight
into what has been happening in the  motor insurance market, as well as
drawing conclusions about where it is heading

THE UK motor insurance market has been enjoying the best of times as
the findings and principle figures presented by Bacon & Woodrow show.
But the market is undergoing dramatic change with dark days seemingly
looming.

Indeed, this independent firm of consulting actuaries, the largest in
Europe, expects that insurers' motor profits will plunge in 1996, with
many players racking up losses.

In the private motor insurance sector, the direct writers continue to
increase competition. Many of the traditional insurers that do both
commercial and private motor insurance have set up or are in the throes
of setting up direct writing operations to stay competitive. Moreover,
a continual trickle of new entrants, often backed by rich foreign
parents, add competitive pressure.

Bacon & Woodrow has produced a range of graphs, tables and some bullet
points under key headings in a report (containing no written
commentary) that provides a clear picture of the major aspects of the
motor insurers' business results.

It is their fifth annual in-depth analysis of the motor market that
highlights major trends, and arrives at important conclusions about the
possible future direction of the market. Naturally, there is a special
focus on 1994 figures.

Their study of the 1994 DTI returns for 43 leading companies and 28
Lloyd's Insurance Market Syndicates, showed that profitability was
marginally higher on the previous year's record profits. Companies that
did well in 1994 by improving both their profitability and market share
include Direct Line, London & Edinburgh, Preferred, Royal, CIS, GAN
Minster and Churchill.

What is surprising is that in 1994 the companies released a significant
chunk of their reserves, that boosted their profits to yet another
fresh peak. The benefits of the sharp reduction in reserves, the first
since 1987 is shown by the graph that charts the reserving effect,
measured as a percentage, on the bottom line (profit figure).

Indeed, the natural expectation is to find confirmation that companies
(no matter what type of industry or market they operate in) generally
use their reserves for claims to smooth their profit flow, and not to
accentuate the troughs and peaks. Actually, the adjustments made by the
motor insurers to reserves over the past decade largely are counter
cyclical to their profit or loss performance in many of those years.

The Bacon & Woodrow study concluded that the companies made 16 pence of
insurance profit (underwriting profit plus investment income) for every
#1 of insurance premium in 1994.

But James Rakow, an associate working in the general insurance area at
Bacon & Woodrow, points out that the equivalent of about 3 pence of
insurance profit for every #1 of earned premium came from reducing
reserves in 1994. In other words, more than a fifth of the market's
total profits were generated by writing back reserves established in
1993 and prior years.

Rakow notes that when the insurance cycle was at a bottom in 1990 and
1991, reserves were strengthened noticeably. This had the effect of
depressing really poor results even further. Most observers think there
was a general recognition by the companies at the end of 1991 that they
had not made nearly enough provisions, by way of example for bodily
injury. The sceptics argue that once the results were so awful, it did
not make much difference that they were made worse by pushing through
provisions to cushion future performance.

Rakow takes the view that what happened in 1994 "is a sound natural
release from prior years. Their reserves are really quite strong"
compared with the past, given a background of improving claims
experience.

Bacon & Woodrow has developed its own benchmark for determining the
adequacy of existing reserves. "If our benchmark is correct, there will
be future releases in future years. The motor insurance industry is
sitting comfortably above the benchmark. Against our benchmark further
reserves to the tune of seven pence (for every #1 earned insurance
premium) could be released over the next few years," maintains Rakow.

Meanwhile, the top ten players have consistently dominated in terms of
the market share they have had over the past decade. That is despite
the jockeying for leading places with Direct Line emerging from nowhere
over this period to secure pole position in the private motor market.

But in terms of net written motor insurance premiums, a few traditional
insurers that also have large books of commercial motor business wrote
more business in 1994 than did Direct Line. The leader was Eagle Star
followed by Norwich Union, although Direct Line is fast closing the
gap.

Another major underwriter of motor insurance business is a range of
syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market, which together have about a
15 percent market share. No split between the syndicates' commercial
and private motor business is available, although some estimates
suggest that more than half is for personal motor. This implies that
the Lloyd's syndicates collective share of personal motor market is
probably a couple of percentage points more than that of Direct Line's
12 percent share.

Most, if not all, of the top ten have critical mass (for the standard
insurer it is about 0.5 million). They usually enjoy decent economies
of scale benefits that give the biggest insurers a big competitive
advantage. In a market where competition is expected to remain intense,
size will be important.

Not surprisingly, those players that can maximise cost savings, have a
strong brand and good distribution, are at a distinct competitive
advantage. One area where insurers, with critical mass, could reap
major benefits but do not at present is through using own large-scale
repair garages.

Bacon & Woodrow estimate that if insurers use their own repair garages,
annual cost savings benefits equivalent to about 11.5 percent of
premiums could be enjoyed. But it will probably take about five years
for an insurer to establish a full network of own garages.

Meanwhile, Direct Line and Churchill have taken the lead by opening own
repair centres and have plans to open several more over the next few
years. The rest of the pack have so far not announced any moves on this
front.

The idea of using own garages is borrowed from car hire firms that were
the first to go down this cost savings route. In the past, insurers
have owned garages that were not, however, exclusively for their own
repairs. This approach did not work.

Rakow admits that more research needs to be done as"the premium savings
do not necessarily take fully into account the payback on capital
investment." Nonetheless, the savings would still be significantly
higher than other approaches.

Benefit can also be gained from using a focused network approach by
using a small number of recommended repairers, equivalent to premium
savings of about 4 percent, he points out.

The class of the insurer, be it best of breed, average or poor, as well
as whether it uses the direct or broker route are key factors shaping
the cost profile of the insurer and determining success. This is put
into sharp perspective by an analysis showing the cost of buying one
policy for differently categorised insurers as well as future costs,
depending upon retention rates.

It shows on all counts that the direct route for the best of breed
enjoys a strong comparative advantage over the others with the buying
cost #45 per policy, #12 in a future year when retention is 85 percent
and #21 when 55 percent. Whereas for the best of breed via the broker
route the buying cost is #54, #40 when retention is 85 percent and #44
when 55 percent.

Interestingly, an average insurer using the broker route is generally
much better-placed than an average direct writer. Similarly, this is
the case for poor insurers using brokers compared to poor direct
writers. In fact, the cost of buying one policy for a poor direct
writer is a high #300, nearly as much as the average premium of a
comprehensive private motor policy.

Rakow estimates that on average the better-rated companies retain their
customers for between four to six years with the middle- ranked
companies keeping them on average for between two to four years.

What all of this analysis suggests is that certain insurers, especially
those some way towards achieving critical mass and achieving decent
brand awareness, are faced with making a tricky decision as what is the
best strategy to adopt. It may even be to leave the field.

As Rakow says, each company has to look at its own strategy, its
position in the marketplace, the cost of acquiring policies and expense
dynamics. Certainly, in some cases spending more money on advertising
may prove less cost effective than providing focused incentives to
retain existing customers. Rakow makes the point that niche players can
have critical mass which only amounts to a fraction of the number of
policies others need to have critical mass.

Consolidation in the industry has not as yet happened as Bacon &
Woodrow predicted. The firm still expects it to take place. Rakow notes
that one of the major reasons why this has not occurred so far, is that
there is no squeeze on with only two out of the 43 insurers monitored
making a loss in 1994.

Another reason is that different insurers have different strategies.
Some, particularly a number of new entrants, are in the market for the
long-term, despite making heavy losses in the short-term.

Rich parents, especially those foreign giants, can afford to bide their
time while absorbing the pain in the meantime. But if the bleeding gets
worse and no end is in sight, some will surely head for the exits.

As the accompanying graph for the companies' average adjusted operating
ratio (where 100 percent is a breakeven insurance result, taking
underwriting profits and investment income into account) shows,
excellent profits were made in 1993 and 1994 and bad losses in 1990 and
1991. This graph suggests that in the 1990s the swings in the cycle
have become considerably sharper.

With average premium rates down noticeably since 1994, while underlying
costs are still going up, market profitability on the underwriting side
has deteriorated considerably.

Rakow notes that underwriting profits were pretty small in 1994 with
the bulk of insurers' profits coming from their investment income.
Moreover, they can no longer rely on the claims frequency continuing to
improve, he adds.

Already the likes of Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, are
sounding off about how nearly all of their competitors will be making
underwriting losses.

Against this gloomy background, there is the prospect that companies'
investment income will fall, with interest rates still heading lower. A
big dipper plunge in the insurers' profitability, with a shake-out to
come, looks to be underway.

INSURERS RUN FOR EVEN MORE COVER

After re-evaluating their asbestos and environmental exposures, US
insurers are finding that they have to strengthen their reserves
significantly. Tess Critzer reports

TO BOLSTER its resilience to asbestos and environmental claims,
Nationwide has added $1.1 billion to its reserves. The sixth- largest
US property-casualty (PC) insurer, Ohio-based Nationwide, has become
the latest leading insurer to take stock of its asbestos and
environmental (A&E) exposures.

Earlier this year, Aetna Life and Casualty, the 12th-largest PC insurer
in the US, shook up the industry by announcing an environmental
liability of $1 billion. The insurer nearly tripled its loss reserves
for pollution claims by making a pre-tax addition of $750 million,
bringing its total environmental reserves to $1.2 billion.

Firemen's Fund and Cigna also boosted their reserves this year, by $1.4
billion and $1.2 billion respectively. According to the Insurance
Information Institute (III), insurers have begun to take on $35 billion
to $50 billion in liability.

Nationwide's $1.1 billion addition brings its total reserves to $1.5
billion, and generates a "perception of strength", according to Eric
Simpson, a spokesperson at ratings agency AM Best.

Nationwide is a mutual, like most of the other companies which have
boosted reserves this year. Its reserve enhancement is expected to
increase 1995 policyholder surplus to more than $5 billion, up $0.2
billion from last year's figure. Premium-to- surplus ratio is expected
to remain strong, increasing by 0.1 to about 1.5, according to
Nationwide.

The company boosted its reserves not only to cover possible exposures,
but to assert its position of market strength, and AM Best senior vice
president, Jack Snyder, said the insurer has the financial strength to
carry off its reserve action. However, he noted that smaller insurers
might not survive their future reserve needs.

AM Best has estimated that pollution costs in the US will top $132
billion, or 72 percent of the industry's current capital and surplus.
According to Snyder, the worst-case scenarios could see a number of
insurers experiencing surplus depletion over the next two decades, with
some being forced into insolvency or mergers with stronger companies.

Snyder noted that the US Environmental Protection Agency has identified
more than 36,000 hazardous waste sites in the country, most of which
will require remediation.

"It is hard to overstate the potential extent of the
environmental/asbestos liability problem for the insurance industry",
said Snyder, adding, "environmental liability . . . represents the
single largest threat to the property/casualty insurance industry's
financial health for the next several decades. Its financial impact
could exceed the costs of continuing natural disasters".

Indeed, the sum could equal the cost of a major catastrophe every year
for the next 30 years, according to Allan Levin, managing director of
Standard & Poor's ratings service.

Ratings companies have led the way in urging accountability of
insurance liabilities in the US pollution crisis. S&P's has conducted
studies and ratings adjustments for companies based on their pollution
exposures, noting that 39 US insurers are now carrying the greatest
percentage of those exposures.

AM Best expects environmental and asbestos exposures to total about
$260 billion, spread over 15 years for asbestos claims, and 25 years
for environmental claims. According to Snyder, these projections assume
that reserve additions will add an average of 1.8 points a year to the
industry's combined ratio.

Amy Bouska, a principal and consulting actuary for Tillinghast/Towers
Perrin, noted that insurers can expect four types of costs relating to
environmental/asbestos clean-up. Those include the actual clean-up
costs, legal costs, including costs for coverage litigation against the
potentially responsible parties (PRPs, in this case referring to
insured corporations which have generated pollution), amounts paid to
third parties claiming bodily injury, property damage or other loss,
and natural resource damage.

The Superfund solution

The 1980 Superfund Act, which heavily taxed polluters such as chemical,
mining and forest product companies, was seen as the solution to
America's pollution problem. Superfund, or CERCLA, was established in
response to the 1978 Love Canal crisis in upstate New York, where
residential ground water was contaminated by blow-off from the Hooker
Chemical Company.

CERCLA was reauthorised with more punitive changes in 1986 as the
Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, SARA, and again in 1990 by
President Bush with no significant changes.

The 1990 authorisation for Superfund expired last year, but the
programme had enough surplus capital to operate until the end of 1995.
However, Congress has vowed it will not reauthorise the act unless
significant changes and reforms are made, and the Clinton
administration has called for significant cuts to the programme, which
gobbled up $1.3 billion in EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
appropriations during 1995.

Current reform initiatives call for a reduction in 1996 spending to
$1.16 billion, based on projected costs. According to an EPA
spokesperson, up to 60 of the nearly 1,300 Superfund sites might not be
funded if the reduced budget is passed.

The December 16 shutdown of the Federal Government, due to a budget
impasse between Clinton and the Republican Congress, has further
delayed the progress of reform and reauthorisation for Superfund,
although the programme does have trust funding based on industry taxes
(85 percent of financing for the fund is gained from taxes on chemical
feed stocks).

According to Bouska, the ultimate Superfund reform bill is likely to
include increased community participation, increased certainty in
regard to share allocation, as well as implementation of a national
standard for site remediation and new guidelines for future land and
water use.

Levin is sceptical that the industry will receive significant
assistance from the government in meeting its future environmental and
asbestos claims losses."We believe right now that Congress will not
relieve insurers, though they could surprise us", he said.

MID-OCEAN TAKES OVER BROCKBANK

MID-OCEAN, a large Bermudan reinsurer, has acquired 51 percent of the
equity of an enlarged Brockbank Group, one of the most successful
Lloyd's market managing agencies that also owns Admiral, the UK direct
motor insurance writer.

Mid-Ocean has invested #50 million in the enlarged group to get control
and provide capital support to the syndicates managed by Brockbank. Its
syndicate 253 provides much of its capital for underwriting UK private
motor insurance, particularly business from Admiral.

Brockbank controls 80 percent of the equity of rapidly- growing
Admiral, which expects to write more than 130,000 new motor insurance
policies in 1995. Apparently, some of the new capital from Mid-Ocean
will be used to fund the expansion of Admiral's business and Mid-Ocean
has no intention of selling Admiral.

The Mid-Ocean deal highlights that the changes made by Lloyd's to its
regulatory system are encouraging insurance companies to acquire
control of a managing agent or set up operations in the market. Mid-
Ocean, however, can unscramble the Brockbank deal if Lloyd's rescue
plans fail.

In other recent deals, that are changing the face of Lloyd's, Terra
Nova, a UK-base reinsurer, has acquired the continuing business of the
Octavian managing agency; Cox Insurance Holdings, a corporate investor,
has bought the 75 percent of the Cox managing agency it did not own; a
Bermuda-domiciled insurance company, Western General has bought the
holding company of Catlin, a managing agency.

A GAME OF CRITICAL MASS

Churchill Insurance, one of the fastest growing UK direct motor and
household insurers, launched in June 1989 is now the second largest
direct writer in the market. III spoke to David Hiddleston, executive
director in charge of new business and sales, about Churchill's
strategy

CHURCHILL INSURANCE is determined to remain a leading player in the
intensely competitive and increasingly overcrowded direct writing
field.

The gap between it and the largest, Direct Line, is wide when it comes
both to number of policyholders and profitability. But there is a pack,
including some newcomers such as Norwich Union Direct with ready-made
customer bases, that will be chasing hard after Churchill's tail.

Armed with #65 million of capital and employing about 1,000 people, it
has quickly become the second largest direct writer in the private
motor sector, a position it intends to hold. It has the backing of a
rich parent, Winterthur, a giant Swiss-based insurance company. Last
year Churchill made profits of about #1.5 million with gross premiums
written of about #130 million on private motor and about #16 million on
household. Since start-up it has sold more than 1.5 million policies.

This insurer remains committed to a strong sales and profit growth
strategy that will keep it moving forward at a healthy pace. A two-
pronged sales growth approach is being pursued at present. The number
of its customers is moving up through both organic and acquisition
growth. The strategy is also focused on extending the range of allied
services and products provided which, in turn, helps increase profits
as well as strengthen customer loyalty.

Churchill's strategic thrust is aimed at keeping the growth momentum
going. This has recently been underlined by what appears to be well-
timed good moves on two different fronts.

Firstly, the deal to buy Refuge Insurance's household insurance
portfolio, beating Direct Line, the biggest direct writer, and others,
to the finishing line. For about #5 million Churchill expects to pick
up about 160,000 household policyholders, almost trebling the household
customer base in one fell swoop.

Secondly, the entry, the first by a direct writer, into the credit card
market. Churchill expects its card to deepen its relationship with its
policyholders and bring marketing benefits.

"Our view," says Hiddleston, " is that direct writing is a game of
critical mass. Critical mass is probably in the order of 0.5 million
policyholders." Churchill with 600,000 motor policyholders and nearly
250,000 household policyholders, post the Refuge transaction, with the
numbers still rising, has easily passed the low water critical mass
mark.

He points out that merely taking the word "direct" and adding it to the
name of a business or describing the business as a direct writing
operation is insufficient. "Direct writing, in our view, is as much a
philosophy and culture as it is just owning an operation. You need to
create a rapport with the customer. Customer service, including the
claims side, is fundamental." He notes that if the 0.5 million customer
base critical mass criterion is applied then it becomes evident that
few players have achieved this. "Everyone else is struggling."

He adds that apart from Direct Line, with 2.8 million, and Churchill,
there is only Royal Insurance's two direct writers, which together have
about 0.5 million policyholders. "The rest fall away." Royal is in the
throes of deciding whether or not to merge the two operations, namely
The Insurance Service and Royal Direct, and trade under one brand name.

There is also Sun Alliance, with a ready-made direct customer base of
about 400,000 customers in motor and about 500,000 in household.
Earlier this year Sun Alliance formed its own direct writing business
under the name Sun Alliance Connections. This is non-intermediary
business but, for Hiddleston, is does not count as most of its business
has not been won by a stand-alone direct writing operation.

In terms of Churchill's growth plans, "getting 1 million customers is
easily achievable before the turn of the century. I suspect if you add
up everyone's growth plans you probably get to about three times the
size that the direct writing market will be by 2000."

Hiddleston stresses that low premiums and better service than that
provided by competitors are of major importance to the company.
Churchill describes itself as offering "competitively- priced premiums,
often at considerably lower cost than its competitors, with the very
highest levels of customer service." But he admits that he does not
"believe we can catch up Direct Line when it comes to market share
size. We need to be better than them."

In what he sees is "a very overcrowded private motor insurance market a
number of people are not going to make it. You effectively have at
present 1992 premium levels with 1996 expenses."

He hopes as well as believes that "rates will move higher next year. As
rates rise, it should bring relief." He points out that market
conditions are so tough that it is difficult to predict what will
happen to rates, and that if they do go up whether someone will break
ranks by holding them. "There is always someone who holds back."

But whether the rate increases will be enough for hard-pressed players,
particularly the marginal ones that do not have parents with deep
pockets, is most questionable.

Hiddleston notes, that the players, have in recent times " been through
a honeymoon period with regard to their claims ratios. If we have a bad
winter it would be horrific for some new groups, as they would suffer
from sharply higher claims costs." As he says, "when the cycle changes,
then the problems surface. More people will then exit from the market
because they either get rated out, sell their portfolios or withdraw."

Moreover, when premiums begin to go up, "more people start to move
around and retention rates suffer if you are not slick." Perversely,
under this type scenario, with premium rates rising, life would
seemingly get tougher not easier for the weak.

Given the competitive state of the market, getting new customers
through advertising is proving much more expensive these days. That is
even after taking into account the fact that advertising rates are much
higher than a few years ago. With so many more competitors all trying
desperately to achieve critical mass or increase sales, " response
ratios are not as good as they were two or three years ago. People now
are ringing up many more companies. The trick is to make those people
ring us."

In this game, "retention is a key, just as important as acquisition
(winning a new customer through the traditional sources)." More so
given that the cost of getting a new customer has gone up noticeably in
recent years. At least one company is at present paying well over the
odds to buy new customers, he points out.

"Keeping a customer is critical. Our retention rates are good with
conversions holding up. In fact, our retention rate went up in October.
We are working hard at retaining our customers, and are good at keeping
customers."

Creating a strong brand name awareness helps enormously in attracting
new customers. The more established and bigger players with decent
reputations are at a distinct advantage to new entrants, as they
benefit tremendously from personal recommendations. This lowers
significantly their costs of getting a new policyholder, especially
compared to the embryonic players.

Churchill claims that " approximately 40 percent of new business now
comes from personal recommendations and its retention rate is well
above the industry average." Hiddleston maintains that Churchill is
still increasing its share of the motor market.

Churchill is on the acquisition trail and, at the right price, is keen
to snap up the right businesses. "We would be more than happy." Once
critical mass has been reached, with fixed costs acceptable and largely
static, then additional sales bought at appropriate prices can prove to
be highly profitable.

In time more companies are expected to come onto the market for sale,
especially when the expected consolidation in the personal line sector
gathers more momentum. Hiddleston says Churchill would be keen to do a
similar deal to the one struck with Refuge. He remains tight-lipped
about what prospective deals may be in the pipeline but does admit "we
are talking to all sorts of people."

In the meantime, with the going really hard in the market place,
Churchill continues to work hard at launching and developing products
that it can cross-sell to customers or be used to attract new
customers. But Hiddleston says it does not always pay off financially.
"We had a flurry into mortgages from which we learnt a lot."

But he stresses " we have a few other things we are going to test. We
have looked at a number of products and found some that look attractive
to us."

Churchill is focusing on developing further relationships and share
customer bases with other groups that are not competitors. "We are
working with car distributors." Churchill has had some good success in
recent months from the move to get new business from affinity groups.

It has built its own large-scale repair garage in Rotherham, and plans
to open several more in the next few years. These are expected to
produce significant economic benefits for Churchill. Hiddleston notes
that there are not many direct writers that have sufficient critical
mass to set up their own repair garages.

In an innovative drive to generate new business, Churchill has opened
multi-media kiosks with Camden Motors,the UK's 7th largest car retailer
and a subsidiary of Barclays Bank. These kiosks provide customers with
a wide range of information, including the cost of insurance before
deciding on their car and enabling them to obtain the best deal when
buying a car. This saves customers both time and money.

What has also helped is the greater use of more sophisticated
assessment of the insurance risk profile of customers through the use
of linear modelling, he notes.

There are figures bandied about in the marketplace that suggest that
when it comes to financial performance Churchill is performing poorly.
Churchill provides the public with little data about its financial
performance.

Indeed, included in Direct Line's returns to the DTI is an analysis
that clearly shows that of the major insurers in 1994 Churchill had the
worst private car operating ratio and worst relative operating ratio.

It did show, however, that Churchill has the fourth lowest expense
ratio. Hiddleston contends that "unless you look at the whole picture
you can not make direct comparisons. We have two companies: one is a
management company and the other an underwriting company." For people
not privy to the right information, he suggests that it is virtually
impossible for them to form a proper and complete picture as to how
Churchill is really performing.

Meanwhile, Winterthur (Churchill's parent) is looking to set up a
direct writing operation in Switzerland and is, no doubt, drawing on
Churchill's expertise. Churchill does help manage Winterthur's Danish
direct writing operation, Tell, which originally was not the case.

According to Hiddleston, Tell is now " a clone of Churchill."
Meanwhile, Tell, which has been in the private motor insurance business
for about 18 months, started selling household insurance in August.

But Hiddleston points out that Churchill, will probably only be used in
an advisory capacity should Winterthur set up more direct operations in
Europe - something that looks to be very much on the cards.

The main reason why "we have adopted an advisory role" is the danger
that "we could take our eye off the ball if we became too involved with
other operations." But a replicant type Churchill can lower the Swiss
giant's entry costs into new markets. As Hiddleston says "the formula
is here" as well as the systems, although he is not "sure the formula
does translate into every country."

He maintains that the parent "has a very hands-off management style
provided their planning requirements are complied with. We always have
performed to their requirements."

Interestingly enough, as to whether a move into the commercial
insurance sector is on the cards, Hiddleston maintains "we are not even
looking at it. We are sticking to our knitting. We know we are good at
personal products." He adds, with a twinkle in his eye,"if we find
something that we can sell to make a bob or two we will sell it."

Sales - "the nerve centre"

THE SALES team is seen as "nerve centre and life blood of our
organisation," according to sales manager Carrie Moore.

There are at present about 140 people employed in the sales division,
made up of 14 teams each of ten people, including one team leader. The
majority are full-time employees.

Everyone works in a single large open plan office that occupies almost
an entire floor of a building located in Bromley in Kent, which is
relatively easy commuting distance from central London.

At present, there are only 13 teams operating, including two working
night shifts, as November and December are traditionally the quietest
months of the year. Busiest months are August, with new registrations
at a peak, and March, when there was the collapse of an insurance
company some years back.

Incoming calls from potential customers are automatically diverted by
the sophisticated switchboard system to the appropriate teams.

At present there are just three teams that quote only on household,
three teams which are multi-skilled (both household and motor),
including those that handle affinity group calls, and the rest only
motor.

Moore says the objective is"to have everyone trained to handle both
household and motor insurance queries by the end of March." Multi-
skilled sales persons can see on their individual telephone screens
whether the enquiry is for household or motor insurance or from an
affinity group member.

Staff are paid a fairly good basic salary on top with the possibility
of receiving commissions once certain sales ceilings are surpassed.
Thanks to their commissions, top sales people earn considerably more
than senior management.

A PICTURE OF HEALTH

The Singapore insurance industry is booming, with insurers profits and
premium income growing impressively. The outlook for further strong
growth looks promising.  Foo Boon Ping reviews the industry and its
prospects

THE LATEST Insurance Commissioner's annual report in Singapore showed
that insurers in Singapore had a splendid year in 1994 - particularly
those operating in the general insurance sector. And all the evidence
so far suggests that 1995 will be another good year for them. (The
Commissioner's annual report is normally published some eight months
after the current year).

The Singapore insurance industry has attracted numerous foreign
insurers, with about three-quarters of all direct insurers foreign-
owned, including those that operate as branches or subsidiaries of
insurers. Firms from more than 12 countries have been attracted to this
market, and most of the professional reinsurers registered in Singapore
are also foreign-owned.

Of the 141 direct insurers, reinsurers and captive insurers operating
in Singapore, 119 are involved solely in the general insurance
business. Another 12 operate as composite insurers.

Insurance representative offices in Singapore may not become involved
in the business of insurance. The main activities conducted by the
representative offices are servicing of existing clients,
communications and liaison work on behalf of their head offices, and
market research. There are currently 16 insurers with representative
offices in Singapore.

During the year, in line with efforts to develop Singapore as a premier
regional reinsurance centre, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
rationalised its policy on the establishment of representative offices
by overseas insurance and reinsurance companies.

In particular, the MAS believes that reinsurance representative offices
would be able to play a more significant role in the development of
offshore reinsurance business in Singapore if they upgrade their
operations to a branch or subsidiary level.

Hence, the five insurance and reinsurance representative offices in
Singapore were encouraged to upgrade their operations. These companies,
if they wish to continue their presence in Singapore, are required to
upgrade by January 1 1997, by submitting a formal application to the
authority for approval.

The MAS has also required that in future all general direct insurers
and reinsurers submit an annual statement attesting to the adequacy of
loss reserves.

In filing the statement, the principal officer is required to examine
all aspects of the company's or branch's loss reserving systems and to
satisfy himself that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the loss
reserves are adequate.

Since 1990, the General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) has
implemented a scheme requiring all agents contracted by its members to
be registered with the Agents' Registration Board of the Association.
By January 1995, there were 890 corporate agencies and 5,263 individual
agents registered with the GIA.

The total number of persons involved in general insurance selling was
estimated at 7,100. However, only 12 percent were considered full-time
general insurance agents. Most of the individual agents registered with
the GIA are also life insurance agents.

A primary objective of the GIA's registration scheme for agents is to
ensure that those engaged in selling general insurance have insurance
qualification and competence. All prospective agents must therefore
attain the Certificate in General Insurance (CGI) or equivalent
qualifications before they can be appointed by general insurers.

By January 1995, about 60 percent of general insurance agents had
attained minimum insurance qualifications, up from 55 percent on the
previous year. The others were deemed to be qualified because of their
experience.

The Singapore Insurance Brokers' Association (SIBA), working with the
GIA to upgrade professionalism in the general insurance industry,
requires its members to meet certain minimum standards on insurance
qualification.

By January 1 1995, there were 66 general insurance brokers employing
484 broking staff. Of this number, about 92 percent had insurance
qualifications equivalent to or higher than the CGI.

In addition, general insurance brokers must comply with certain minimum
financial and solvency standards stipulated by the SIBA. On July 1
1994, all insurance broking companies were required to have a minimum
paid-up capital of $200,000.

The minimum paid up capital will be increased progressively over the
next two years to $300,000. All insurance companies must also maintain
a minimum surplus of assets over liabilities equal to 50 percent of the
stipulated minimum paid-up capital.

The Singapore general insurance business sector has continued to
perform well as it continues to ride on the back of the fast- expanding
Singapore economy, and 1994 was a good year. Overall turnover of the
industry measured in terms of gross premiums of domestic and offshore
general business topped S$2.6 billion ($1.8 billion), representing an
increase of 10.1 percent over 1993.

This was largely due to the good performance of the domestic sector, as
opposed to the offshore sector where plenty of business is conducted in
other countries in the region. As a result, the share of domestic
general business to total general business had increased to 53.5
percent.

In line with the robust performance of the Singapore economy, domestic
business expanded strongly by 13.6 percent in 1994. Consequently,
general insurance expenditure per capita rose by a healthy 11.2
percent.

Like the economy, the growth of the domestic insurance business sector
was broad-based. All classes of business recorded premium increases,
ranging from 6.5 percent to 20.6 percent. Motor and miscellaneous
accident business, which together accounted for 62 percent of total
domestic insurance business, were the main engines driving growth.

Motor business, the largest class written by general insurers,
contributed significantly to the overall growth in domestic business.
Gross premiums grew by 15.7 percent to $482 million.

Insurers attributed the strong performance to premium rate increases
for third-party insurance and covers for certain types of vehicle as
well as a general increase in car values. But premium rates for private
motor insurance remain highly competitive.

Miscellaneous business continued to enjoy good growth in 1994. This was
largely because of the buoyant construction industry, which in turn led
to an increase in the demand for construction- related insurance. Some
insurers also reported an increase in the amount of professional
indemnity insurance they write.

A directive from the MAS to limit the amount of stand-alone accident
and health insurance policies that can be written by life insurers led
to a significant transfer of business from life insurers to general
insurers.

Composite insurers had to transfer the accident and health business
from life insurance funds to general insurance funds. The 1994
estimates revealed that about half of the working population had
insurance coverage provided by their employers, a big improvement from
less than a third in 1989.

As miscellaneous business had, over the past few years, grown faster
than the other classes, its share of total domestic gross premiums had
increased significantly to 27.5 percent in 1994. It remained the second-
largest class after motor insurance, which accounted for over one-third
of total domestic business.

On the other hand, fire business had decreased in importance, with its
share down from 16.6 percent in 1990 to 13.5 percent in 1994. For the
other classes, the shifts in their share of the total market were
insignificant.

In terms of net premiums, similar shifts in the composition of domestic
business were evident in recent years. Motor and miscellaneous business
are easily the two largest classes, together accounting for 68.1
percent of the industry's total net premiums.

In 1994 the general insurance business sector staged a dramatic
recovery. The players collectively turned in an underwriting profit of
$102 million compared with a loss of $34.2 million in 1993.

This was the first time that underwriting profits from domestic general
business had exceeded the $100 million mark. Also, professional
reinsurers writing domestic business reported an underwriting profit
after notching up losses for many years.

The impressive turnaround was largely due to the significant
improvement in overall claims experience and to a lesser extent, some
improvement in commissions and management expense ratios.

Some insurers took the view that the standardisation of the commission
rate for workmen's compensation business to 10 percent contributed to
the improvement in the overall commissions ratio to 14.3 percent. But
others said they had received higher profit commissions from their
treaty reinsurers during the year.

Apart from the significant improvement in underwriting results, net
investment income from domestic business also increased by 22.2 percent
to $93.7 million. Besides focusing on underwriting profitably, insurers
had also realised the need to maximise returns on their assets without
sacrificing prudence and safety. Consequently, the industry reported a
substantially increased operating profit of $195.7 million in 1994.

In 1994, offshore business continued to grow, with premiums up 6.4
percent. Unlike previous years, this growth was largely attributed to
the growth generated by both the direct insurers and captive insurers.
Professional reinsurers, on the other hand, registered only marginal
growth in 1994.

The double-digit growth in offshore business achieved by professional
reinsurers during the past four years, was not sustained in 1994.
Offshore business written by professional reinsurers expanded by a mere
0.4 percent in 1994.

As a group, reinsurers remained the major writers of offshore business,
accounting for $747.7 million or 61.7 percent of offshore business
written.

Growth arising from business brought in by newly-admitted reinsurers
and rate increases in certain markets was dampened by the adoption of a
more selective underwriting policy by a number of professional
reinsurers. It was also blunted by a reduction in the premiums reported
by a few reinsurers in run-off.

In contrast, offshore business written by direct insurers advanced
impressively last year by 23 percent. The buoyant economic growth
generally enjoyed by the countries in the region, and the emergence of
new markets such as China, Myanmar and Vietnam have created much
increased opportunities for direct insurers to expand their offshore
business.

Offshore business written by captive insurers grew at a faster pace of
15.4 percent in 1994. Growth was supported by the contribution from
newly-admitted captive insurers and increases in coverage and premium
rates.

According to sources at the Insurance Commissioner's Department, the
outlook for the general insurance industry for 1995 is generally good.
General insurers are optimistic that the expansion of the domestic
insurance business sector will keep pace with the expected good growth
of the economy.

Indeed, the economy grew by a surprisingly robust 9.1 percent in the
third-quarter of 1995. Competition in the market place is expected to
remain keen, but insurers caution that this might have a dampening
effect on their premium growth.

Likewise, growth prospects for offshore general business are good.
General insurers and reinsurers continue to be upbeat about their
growth prospects, especially given expectations of much stronger
economic growth from a number of countries in the region.

DIRECT WRITERS MAKE THE RUNNING

A report on the UK insurance industry prepared by Price Waterhouse for
the Association of British Insurers assesses thoroughly the current
shape of the industry, its achievements, strengths and challenges

IN THE European Union, the UK insurance industry is the clear leader
not only taken as a whole, but also when it comes to the separate life
and general insurance market. This was the conclusion arrived at by
researchers at Bournemouth University when they recently published a
report on the international competitiveness of EU insurance industries.

The claim by the researchers accurately reflects the achievements and
strengths of the UK insurance industry, maintains the Price Waterhouse
report on the UK insurance industry commissioned by the Association of
British Insurers (ABI). The report by the management consultants looks
at the UK industry's achievements and strengths as well as identifying
the criteria for future success.

The conclusion that the university researchers drew was formed after
they judged the various EU members' respective industries using four
principal measures, namely: the absolute size of the industries as
measured by premium income; the relative size of the industries
measured by premium income relative to GDP; the adjusted overseas
business share and the perceived competitiveness ranking derived from
survey responses. Briefly, the Price Waterhouse report outlined the
industry's major achievements as: making widely available insurance
protection; providing competitively priced and attractive products;
promoting savings across a wide social spectrum; contributing to the UK
balance of payments and providing finance for industry and government.

The report described the industry's strengths as having: a long track
record of innovative product design and distribution; a strong
regulatory framework; a competitive market with low entry barriers;
technical expertise and international focus with UK insurers having the
highest overseas business share in the EU.

With regard to the UK having a highly competitive market, there have
always been low entry barriers as the existence of 821 authorised
insurance companies show (according to the DTI's 1994 report). Of these
companies, 573 are in general business only, 191 in life business only
and 57 are composites, undertaking both life and general insurance.

In total, at least, 600 are actively writing new business. The market
is highly fragmented with no dominant players. The largest has only a 7
percent share of the domestic market. There are 150 foreign-owned
insurers with close to nearly half from the EU.

The consultants note that "unlike the building society sector, there
has been only limited rationalisation in the insurance industry. The
number of authorised and active insurance companies has remained
relatively constant over the last ten years."

The consultants also make the point that dramatic growth has come
largely from banks and building societies breaking their ties with
insurance companies and setting up their own operations.

Bancassurers, on the other hand, have so far shown limited interest in
underwriting general insurance business even though they are important
distributors of these products. Importantly, "this situation is likely
to change."

Not surprisingly, the report concludes that the direct writers have
been the major new form of competition in the personal motor insurance
market over the past decade. "The direct writers have demonstrated that
they can achieve considerable competitive advantage by adopting a
completely new approach to the market."

As the accompanying graphs show the direct writers have clearly made
major inroads into the private motor insurance market. Their share by
the end of 1994 was 25 percent, more than doubling in just four years.
The evidence to date suggests that they are continuing to grow their
market share strongly.

The direct writers have only really started targeting the household
insurance market in recent years. Indeed, in 1994 they managed to more
than treble their market share, albeit from a very low base, to 7
percent from 2 percent at the beginning of that year.

The management consultants outline the reasons why the direct writers
have been successful, but do not provide any new breathtaking insights.

They point out that their success is because of their "ability to price
very competitively due to their lower cost base and provide streamlined
and customer friendly telephone based services. Direct writers have
made innovative use of technologies to create centralised and efficient
administration centres, avoiding the need for costly branch networks."

They add that the majority of established and traditional insurers have
now set up direct operations to complement their sales through brokers
and have also centralised functions such as claims handling.

What is rather interesting is that they note that after success of
direct writing in the personal lines general insurance market many
direct writers are already turning to commercial lines general
insurance products. The direct writers are also turning to less complex
life assurance and other savings.

With regard to the overall criteria for future success of the UK
industry, the report identifies these as: improving public confidence;
increasing customer orientation; working with government and
regulators; harnessing new information technology developments; cutting
costs and seizing opportunities to expand into foreign markets, notably
those in the developing economies of Asia, Eastern Europe and South
America.

The consultants do venture to take a bold peek into what the future of
the industry might look like. They think that a rationalisation of the
UK market is inevitable, especially with more than 800 insurance
already licensed and new competitors still entering the market.

Among the more interesting predictions is that a new breed of financial
"Supermarkets" will emerge where customers will be able to get all
their insurance needs. But they do expect, however, "that most
customers will prefer to shop around and the industry will be dominated
by large specialist providers, who sell more selectively to carefully
defined customer groups."

IL APP. CT. AFFIRMS
CARRIER WIN ON LATE
NOTICE GROUNDS

     A company that waited 14 months to notify its insurers that
it might be partly liable for cleaning a hazardous waste site
cannot claim insurance coverage, the Illinois Appellate Court,
First District stated in an opinion published Dec. 14.
Industrial Coatings Group Inc. v. American Motorists Insurance
Co. et al., No. 1-94-1491 (IL App. Ct., 1st Dist.).

     Industrial Coatings Group Inc. learned in February 1986 that
it faced potential liability for hazardous waste contamination at
a site in Griffith, IN, where Industrial's predecessor had sent
used machinery solvent for processing and return.  The appellate
panel wrote that the policyholder should have notified its
carriers at that time.

     The predecessor Joanna Western Mills Co. sent dirty solvent
to the American Chemical Services site from 1959 to 1985.  In
operating the site for more than 25 years, American Chemical
buried more than 20,000 drums containing hazardous materials at
the site.  Many of the drums leaked or were punctured while other
hazardous materials were pumped into retention ponds on the site.

     After testing by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
the American Chemical site was designated as a Superfund site.
Industrial Coatings' insurance policies provided that in the
event of an occurrence, written notice to the insurers giving the
particulars was required "as soon as practicable."  The insured,
however, did not give written notice to the insurers until more
than 14 months after it had received the EPA's letter requesting
voluntary participation in the site cleanup.

     The Cook County Circuit Court found that Industrial Coatings
gave its insurance companies late notice, that it thereby
breached a condition precedent to coverage under its insurance
policies and that the company therefore had no right to obtain
coverage for the pollution claim which had been asserted against
it.

     The state appellate panel affirmed, finding that the delay
in notice precluded coverage.  "Under Illinois law, a delay of
even a few months in giving notice breaches the policy as a
matter of law, defeats coverage and justifies the entry of
summary judgment for the insurance company," the court said.

SD NY DENIES CARRIERS
JUDGMENT ON TRIGGER OF
COVERAGE, LOST POLICY

     U.S. District Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of the Southern
District of New York on Nov. 22 denied summary judgment to
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.
on a policyholder's coverage demands stemming from environmental
liabilities at a North Carolina site.  Unimax Corp. et al. v.
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. et al., No. 92 Civ. 6115 (KTD)
(SD NY).

     The judge rejected the carriers' contention that North
Carolina law should be construed so as to find that no
occurrences triggering coverage happened during their policy
periods.

     In 1968, the insured Unimax Corp. purchased for its
subsidiary JFD Electronics Corp. a television antenna production
facility sited in Oxford, NC.  JFD leased the site and operated
the facility over the ensuing 11 years.  In 1979, JFD sublet the
site to an affiliate of Ventura Electronics Corp., which also
assumed the facility's operations.  The following year, JFD
purchased the remainder interest from Unimax and conveyed the
site to Ventura.

     In 1986, volatile organic compounds were discovered in the
site's groundwater; the state and the EPA commenced a cleanup the
following year.  In 1988, Ventura's successor brought a
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act cost recovery action against Unimax and JFD.  The
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified the insureds that
they were regarded as potentially responsible parties with
respect to the site in the fall of 1989; the policyholders
asserted they first learned of the contamination in August 1988.

     That same month, the insureds tendered notice to both
Lumbermens and Liberty Mutual; both carriers refused coverage.
Lumbermens had written Unimax and JFD umbrella comprehensive
catastrophe liability coverage over 1969-1971; the insureds
asserted that Lumbermens had also issued them primary policies
covering 1968-1972.  Liberty Mutual issued the policyholders
primary comprehensive general liability (CGL) coverage over 1975-
1979.

     Judge Duffy first considered the insurers' bid for summary
judgment on the ground that under North Carolina law, an
occurrence does not take place until discovery of contamination,
and that such discovery did not occur within the policy period.
The insureds rejoined that New York law should be applied, and
that an injury-in-fact trigger should be recognized.

     The court preliminarily concluded that no conflict existed
between the laws of the interested states.  "This case," wrote
the judge, "is centered on insurance policies -- i.e. contracts -
- and the appropriate conflicts analysis begins with each State's
contract laws.  New York and North Carolina apply the same rules
for contract interpretation."

     In looking to the policy language, the court found that it
"clearly states that an occurrence takes place if physical injury
results during the policy period."  The judge further noted that
under either state's precedents, "contamination is deemed to be
physical injury."  The court further rejected Liberty Mutual's
contention that the insureds never responded to its summary
judgment with evidence demonstrating that contamination occurred
within the policy period.  "The focus of Liberty Mutual's motion
was that contamination was not considered under the law to be
property damage until the discovery of the damage," Judge Duffy
stated.

     The court then considered the policyholder's cross-motion
for summary judgment on the issue of the carriers' duty to
defend.  The judge granted the motion as to Lumbermens, finding
the insurer to have made no argument beyond the trigger issue.
Liberty Mutual's policy contained a pollution exclusion clause,
which the insurer argued would void coverage if New York law were
applicable to the dispute.

     On the present facts, however, the court noted that "an
endorsement to the contract specifically deleted the pollution
exclusion clause with regards to operations in North Carolina.
If New York law governs these policies, that endorsement was
misleading and created, at least, an ambiguity [that] must be
construed in favor of the insured."

     The court ultimately refused the insureds judgment against
Liberty Mutual, finding the insurer had raised a genuine of
material fact as to the plaintiffs' knowledge of their claims.
JFD had knowledge of its potential liabilities as early as 1972,
Liberty Mutual had argued, and therefore its notice was untimely.

     The policyholders claimed that Liberty Mutual waived its
late notice defense by not raising the defense in its 1990
disclaimer of coverage; the carrier responded that it had
insufficient knowledge of the underlying facts until discovery
had commenced.  Judge Duffy denied the insureds summary judgment
on the waiver issue.

     The court lastly denied Lumbermens summary judgment with
respect to the two CGL policies it asserted were lost.  With
respect to the 1968-1971 policy (1ZL policy), the court noted
that the insureds proffered some 100 pages bearing the 1ZL number
that were turned over by Lumbermens during discovery.  "The only
pages known to be missing are two endorsements and the policy
jacket," wrote the court.  "I find it incredible that Lumbermens
would retain this file, which imposes liability, but lose the
documents that may have relieved Lumbermens of liability."  Judge
Duffy stated that liability would be measured according to the
terms of the policy as discovered in the insurer's files.

     As to the 1971-1972 policy (8ZL policy), the judge found
that the plaintiffs had demonstrated its existence, due to a
reference to it in Lumbermens' umbrella policy.  The court denied
the insureds summary judgment, however, finding that material
issues of fact remained concerning the 8ZL policy's content.

     Bruce Bienboim and Aidan Synnott of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison, New York, represent the insureds.

     Frank Torres of Evans, Orr, Pacelli, Norton & Laffan, P.C.,
New York; and Judith Fournie Helms, Catherine M. Connelly-Warren
and Katherine E. Tammaro of Tressler, Soderstrom, Maloney &
Preiss, Chicago, represent Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.  Robert

NJ APP. CT.: CLEANUP
COVERAGE CASE TO PROCEED
IN BOTH NJ AND NY

     After granting leave to appeal to 76 insurers who challenged
the New Jersey Superior Court's refusal to stay or dismiss an
environmental cleanup coverage dispute, the New Jersey Superior
Court Appellate Division found that the trial court properly
refused to stay or dismiss the case even though an identical case
involving the same parties is pending in New York state court.
American Home Products et al. v. Adriatic Insurance Co. et al.,
No. A-5209-94T2 (NJ Super. Ct., App. Div.).

     In rejecting the insurers' argument that the trial court
erred in applying a forum non conveniens analysis in its decision
to allow the case to proceed, the appellate panel held that New
Jersey's interests in this case constituted sufficient special
equities to justify denying the comity-stay application.

     American Home Products (AHP), a Delaware corporation, is a
manufacturer and distributor of agricultural, food and healthcare
products.  In April 1991, AHP and its subsidiaries filed actions
in Delaware state court, seeking coverage for various government
and private actions stemming from contamination at 32 sites in 11
states.  One of these sites is located in New York; there are no
sites in Delaware.

     The New York action was filed on June 27, 1991, by Employers
Insurance of Wausau, which sought a declaration that it is not
obligated to provide coverage for contamination under its eight
excess policies.  Wausau named AHP and the remaining 76 insurers
as defendants.  AHP moved for dismissal of the New York action,
and 14 of the insurers moved for dismissal of the Delaware
action. The New York Supreme Court stayed AHP's motion pending
the outcome of the dismissal motion in the Delaware court.

     The Delaware court dismissed the action on forum non
conveniens grounds in November 1991.  Upon termination of the
case, the New York trial court dismissed as moot AHP's motion to
dismiss the New York action.

     On June 1, 1992, AHP filed an action in the Superior Court
of New Jersey, seeking declaratory relief against 80 insurance
companies.  Forty-three insurance companies are the appellants in
this appeal, which involves the same issues and the same parties
as the case pending in New York.  One month after this action was
filed, AHP moved to dismiss the New York action on forum non
conveniens grounds.  Wausau and other insurance companies opposed
AHP's motion and cross-moved, seeking an order enjoining AHP from
filing an action in any other district but New York.

     In December 1992, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the
action except as to a single New York site.  Several insurance
companies appealed, and in December 1994, the New York Supreme
Court Appellate Division reversed the dismissal, reinstating the
New York action in its entirety.  The appellate court did not
enjoin AHP from proceeding in New Jersey.

     Meanwhile, AHP moved its corporate headquarters from New
York to Madison, NJ.  Several of the insurers moved to dismiss or
stay the New Jersey action on the basis of comity and the entire-
controversy doctrine.  The New Jersey Superior court, however,
permitted the action to proceed, finding there were "special
equities" involved.  The court then granted the insurers' motion
for leave to appeal in June 1995.

     In refusing to stay or dismiss the action, the New Jersey
Superior Court noted that although an action involving the same
parties and similar issues is pending in New York, this does not
bar the New Jersey court's jurisdiction; however, the New Jersey
action can be stayed until the New York action is adjudicated.

     The trial court referred to the New Jersey Supreme Court's
decision in Yancoskie v. Delaware River Port Auth., 78 N.J. 321
(1978), which held that when an identical action is pending in
another state, the court "which first acquires jurisdiction has
precedence in the absence of special equities."

     In the appeal, the insurers contended that the court "made a
clear error of law" when it did not stay the case pending the New
York action.  They further maintained that the court erred in
applying a forum non conveniens analysis, which relieved AHP of
its burden to prove special equities to avoid a stay based on
comity.  Under a forum non conveniens application, the defendant
must prove that serious inconvenience would occur if the case is
tried in the plaintiff's chosen forum.  Under this application,
it is also required of the defendant to prove that the plaintiff
will not suffer hardship if the case is transferred.

     The insurers sought to have the case dismissed on comity
grounds, and that AHP needs to prove the existence of "special
equities."  However, the appellate panel noted that the forum non
conveniens factors such as convenience, fairness and connections
with the respective forums can be examined in a comity analysis
to determine whether making a stay in New Jersey would be unjust
or unfair to the interests of the parties.

     In affirming the trial court's holding, the panel noted that
1) AHP was formerly headquartered in New Jersey, 2) 10 of the
sites allegedly covered by the policies are located in New
Jersey, 3) six of the defendant insurers are headquartered in New
Jersey, 4) one-third of the estimated $89 million in cleanup
damages may be attributable to New Jersey sites, 5) New Jersey
law will probably be applied to the coverage issues regarding the
New Jersey sites, and 6) the New Jersey case was "well along" and
discovery has been proceeding for the past two years.  The panel
also found that AHP has a "legitimate presence" in New Jersey.

     "We think the judge fairly and within his sound discretion
concluded that New Jersey's interests in this case constituted
sufficient special equities to justify denying the comity-stay
application," held the panel.  "These factors would be relevant
to a forum non analysis and would have justified a denial of a
motion to dismiss...," the panel continued. "However, we find no
abuse of discretion in also considering these factors as "special
equities" for comity-stay purposes."

SECOND CIRCUIT RULES IN
DISPUTE OVER NATIONAL
GYPSUM COVERAGE

     In a lengthy opinion issued Dec. 13, a panel of the Second
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on numerous issues affecting
the scope of insurance coverage available to Asbestos Claims
Management Corp. (ACMC), formerly known as National Gypsum Co.,
for asbestos-related personal injury and property damage claims.
Stonewall Insurance Co. v. Asbestos Claims Management Corp. et
al., Nos. 93-7314(L) et al. (2nd Cir.);  see Insurance Industry
LR, July 23, 1992.

     Some of the rulings -- those concerning trigger of coverage,
the expected or intended exclusions, and coverage for settlements
paid by National Gypsum through the Center for Claims Resolution
-- appear to favor ACMC.  Other rulings -- those concerning the
allocation of liability for periods during which National Gypsum
was uninsured and the calculation of deductibles for property
damage claims -- appear to favor the insurers.

     Some of the panel's rulings apply only to coverage for
asbestos personal injury claims.  In particular, the panel:

--      ruled that the district court correctly determined that
under applicable New York and Texas law, the occurrence-based
policies sold to National Gypsum could be triggered throughout a
gradual disease process where injury can be shown by a
preponderance of the evidence to be occurring at each point in
that process;

--      affirmed a jury finding against Commercial Union
Insurance Co. that injury occurred continuously from first
exposure through claim or death for all asbestos diseases;

--      upheld a trial court finding applicable to other insurers
that injury occurred continuously from exposure through
manifestation for non-cancer cases but not for cancer cases, and
remanded for further consideration of the court's finding with
regard to cancer claims "in view of the ambiguity in the District
Court's application of the injury-in-fact approach to cancer
claims";

--      upheld the district court's allocation to National Gypsum
of the pro rata share of liability attributable to those periods
during which National Gypsum was uninsured;

--      affirmed a district court ruling that National Gypsum did
not expect or intend bodily injuries from its products; and

--      upheld district court rulings that payments made by
National Gypsum through the Asbestos Claims Facility and the
Center for Claims Resolution in settlement of asbestos claims
were reasonable and are covered by the policies sold to National
Gypsum.

     Some of the court's rulings apply only to coverage for
asbestos property damage claims.  Specifically, the panel ruled
that:

--      the costs of removing and replacing asbestos products
from buildings are properly considered "property damage" as the
term is used in the policies;

--      the district court properly determined that National
Gypsum could not establish by a preponderance of the evidence
that property damage was occurring continuously or at any given
point following installation of National Gypsum's building
materials; and

--      the district court erred in holding that, for purposes of
"per occurrence" deductible provisions in the policies, all the
asbestos property damage claims arose out of a single occurrence
-- National Gypsum's decision to manufacture and sell asbestos-
containing building materials.  Instead, each installation of
National Gypsum's products was a separate occurrence, requiring
the application of another deductible, the panel said.

     The Insurance Environmental Litigation Association (IELA), a
trade association of 20 major insurers, applauded the rulings
requiring National Gypsum to assume a share of liability for
periods during which it was uninsured and requiring application
of another deductible for each installation of National Gypsum
asbestos building products.

     The Second Circuit's decision "properly limits insurers'
liability to the their fair share of the risk," said Thomas W.
Brunner, counsel to IELA and a partner at Wiley, Rein & Fielding
in Washington, DC, in a prepared statement.

     "The Court's formula enforces a policyholder's conscious
business decision to forgo insurance and rejects the
policyholder's attempt to obtain a windfall of coverage for its
uninsured periods," he added.

     The court ruled in an action brought by Stonewall Insurance
Co. for a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to indemnify
National Gypsum for property damage claims arising from asbestos
products made by the company between 1931 and 1981.  The action
also named other National Gypsum insurers.  National Gypsum later
counterclaimed for coverage of asbestos personal injury claims
against it.  All of the policies at issue in the action are
occurrence-based, that is, they are triggered by personal injury
or property damage which occurs during a policy period.

     Commercial Union opted for a jury trial to resolve its
coverage dispute with National Gypsum.  All of the other insurers
opted for a bench trial.  After the two trials, the district
court entered a series of partial declaratory judgments which
determined coverage for asbestos personal injury claims under
Commercial Union policies involved in the jury trial, determined
coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims under insurance
policies involved in the bench trial, and determined coverage for
asbestos property damage claims.  The district court also
certified its rulings for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1292(b).

     Asbestos Claims Management Corp. assumed liability for
National Gypsum's asbestos liabilities in the company's Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings.  It is represented in the action by
Thomas M. Reiter, Donald E. Seymour and Gail Kamnitz with
Kirkpatrick & Lockhart of Pittsburgh.

     Twelve different insurance companies participated in the
proceedings in the Second Circuit.  Amicus briefs were filed by
Mid-American Legal Foundation, Insurance Environmental Litigation
Association, Armstrong World Industries, Inc., The Flintkote Co.,
Western MacArthur Co. and Owens-Illinois, Inc.

CA HIGH CT. RULES
SURETIES NOT EXEMPT
FROM PROP. 103

     The California high court ruled Dec. 14 that the surety
industry is not exempt from Proposition 103, a 1990 act imposing
a 20 % rate rollback on premiums, because the exemption did not
further the purpose of the initiative.  Amwest Surety Insurance
Co. v. Wilson et al., No. SO37405 (CA Sup. Ct.).

     "It is true that excluding some forms of insurance would
allow the commissioner to focus greater resources upon the
remaining forms of insurance...but this premise cannot further
the purposes of Proposition 103 because voters did not limit its
provisions to a few forms of insurance of greatest concern to the
public...," the panel held, affirming a state appeals court
decision.

     In 1988, California passed Proposition 103, or the Insurance
Rate Reduction and Reform Act, which imposed a rate rollback, and
required any subsequent rate increase be approved by the state
insurance commissioner.  The proposition states that it may not
be amended by the state legislature "except to further its
purposes."

     Two years later, the California legislature enacted Section
1861.135 of the state insurance code, thereby exempting surety
insurance from Proposition 103.

     On Nov. 9, 1988 -- one week after Proposition 103 was
enacted -- Amwest Surety Insurance Co. filed a suit against
Governor Pete Wilson and Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
in Los Angeles Superior Court, challenging the validity of
Proposition 103 as applied to surety insurance.  In 1990, Voter
Revolt, the organization that drafted Proposition 103, intervened
in the suit to challenge the validity of Section 1861.135,
asserting that it did not further the purposes of
Proposition 103.  The superior court disagreed, finding the
section valid.  Voters Revolt and the insurance commissioner
appealed.

     A divided California Court of Appeal panel reversed the
trial court's opinion, holding that Section 1861.135 was, in
fact, invalid.  The panel noted that under the state
constitution, the legislature cannot amend an initiative statute
without voter approval unless the statute specifies otherwise.
The panel found Proposition 103 permits legislative amendments
that further the purposes of the initiative, but that Section
1861.135 did not serve such purposes.  Amwest appealed to the
state Supreme Court.

               The high court agreed with the appeals panel, holding that
"exempting surety insurance from the rate rollback provision of
Proposition 103 [did not] further the purposes of the initiative
for the reason that a rate reduction was unnecessary in the case
of surety insurance."

     Amwest and its amicus curiae, Surety Company of the Pacific,
argued that the high court is limited to Proposition 103's
express statement of purpose, which is to protect customers,
encourage competition, and ensure that rates are fair and
affordable.  The panel disagreed, referring to California Housing
Finance Agency v. Patitucci, 22 Cal.3d 171, 177, which held that
"when a constitutional amendment is subject to varying
interpretations, evidence of its purpose may be drawn from many
sources."

     Amwest further contended that clarification of Proposition
103 is needed, because the materials about the proposition which
was distributed to the voters did not mention surety insurance
and did not include a summary of Section 1851.  Thus, Amwest
argued, the voters probably did not understand that the
proposition applied to surety insurance, and that "it would
further the purposes of the proposition to make it say what the
voters thought it meant."

     The panel struck down the surety's argument, holding that it
is "merely a collateral attack upon [the proposition] which has
been adopted by a majority vote of the people who must be assumed
to have voted intelligently...."  The panel further noted that
the insurance regulations set forth prior to the passage of the
proposition applied to surety insurance, and that the initiative
"altered the substance of those regulations, but did not purport
to alter the scope."  Thus, the panel concluded, Proposition 103
applied to surety insurance.

     Amwest then maintained that exempting surety insurance
furthers the purposes of the proposition because the rates for
surety insurance "have long been stable and reasonable" and it
was thus unnecessary to apply the provisions to surety insurance.
Once again, the panel disagreed.

     "If the rates for surety insurance already were fair and
reasonable, the rate rollback might, in large part, be avoided,"
held the panel.  "Exempting surety insurance from this provision
does not further [the proposition's] purpose."

     The panel added that exempting surety insurance from the
requirement that the commissioner approve any rate change prior
to its use likewise fails to further the provision's purpose,
because the requirement is to prevent future abuses in setting
rates.

CA CT. APP.: LENDER
MUST BEAR LOSS FROM
PHONY PREMIUM FINANCING

     Losses stemming from a fraudulent insurance premium
financing transaction arranged by an agent which is not
authorized by the insured must be borne by the lender, not the
insurer, the California Court of Appeal, First District, ruled
Dec. 13, upholding a state Superior Court decision.  California
Indemnity Insurance Premium Finance Co. v. Fireman's Fund
Insurance Co., No. A068421 (CA Ct. App.).

     The panel found that because the transaction was not
authorized by the insured, the lender must bear the loss under
the California Insurance Code.

     In 1992, an insurance agent used unauthorized premium
financing transactions in an attempt to convert funds to his
personal use.  The agent signed the premium financing documents
"on behalf" of the insureds without obtaining their
authorization, then kept the cash proceeds of the unearned
premium without paying the required monthly payments to the
lender, California Indemnity Insurance Premium Finance Co. (CII).

     When CII tried to cancel the insured's policies, issued by
Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., it discovered that the insureds did
not seek premium financing, and that the policies were already
paid in full by the insureds.  Thus, Fireman's Fund refused to
cancel the policies.  Meanwhile, the agent filed a bankruptcy
petition, leaving a $36,000 loss to be absorbed by either CII or
Fireman's Fund.

     The matter was tried in Marin County, CA, Superior Court,
which held that CII must bear the loss.  CII appealed.

     The California Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the
trial court, referring to Pacific Auto Insurance Co. v. Wolff,
which noted that Section 2309 of the California Civil Code, which
was amended in 1973, provides that "an insured could not escape
from a premium financing agreement, which the insurance agent had
been orally authorized to sign, merely because the insured did
not give that agent written authorization to cancel the policy
thus financed."  (Pacific Auto Insurance Co. v. Wolff, [1977] 72
Cal.App.3d 537, 541.)

     However, the appellate panel noted that Section 2309 does
not allow insurance agents to make legally binding premium
financing arrangements which were not authorized by the insured;
rather, it allows the insured to authorize another party to
execute the right to cancel.  "In light of [this], we are not
impressed by CII's argument that the implicit intention of the
1973 amendment was that authorization by the insured was no
longer necessary," held the panel.

     CII maintained, however, that the Doctrine of Latent
Equities provides that "where an assignee purchases an assignment
for value in good faith...the assignee takes the claim free from
equities of all others except the original obligor."

     The panel refused to apply the doctrine to this case, noting
there was no valid assignment of rights to CII; thus, there is no
question of latent equities following a valid assignment.

     CII also argued that the trial court erred in its decision
because the agent received the funds "in a fiduciary capacity"
under Section 1733 and was guilty of theft.  While the panel
agreed with this conclusion, it dismissed CII's argument, holding
that the agent received the funds from CII as proceeds from a
fraudulent financing arrangement, not from the insureds as
premium payments.

     The panel also found CII's additional arguments to be
without merit.

     Arguing for CII were Todd F. Haines and Joshua N. Willis of
the Law Offices of Raymond A. Greenberg, Calabasas, CA.  Arguing
for Fireman's Fund was Arthur D. Levy of Ewell & Levy, San
Francisco, CA; and Douglas Cole Grijalva of Fireman's Fund,
Novato, CA.

D AK: INSURER CANNOT
RESCIND POLICY BASED
ON BOUNCED CHECK

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 22 that
an insurer is obligated to pay an uninsured motorist claim even
though the policyholder's premium payment check was not honored
by her bank, because the policy did not expressly provide that
coverage would be resinded in such a situation. Davis v.
Criterion Casualty Co., No. 94-36141 (9th Cir.).

     Plaintiff Mary Davis' car insurance policy with Criterion
Casualty Co. was canceled in Dec. 1992, when Davis failed to make
a premium payment.  After purchasing a new car, Davis went to
Criterion to reinstate her policy.  She paid the premium by check
on January 13, 1993, which was deposited by the insurer.

     On January 28, Davis was hit by an uninsured driver.
Unfortunately, on the same day of the accident, Davis' check
bounced.   Criterion mailed Davis a notice of cancellation and
refused to pay her claim.  Davis filed suit against the insurer
in Alaska state court, seeking uninsured motorist coverage.
Criterion removed the case to U.S. District Court for the
District of Alaska based on diversity of citizenship.  Both
parties moved for summary judgement.

     Criterion maintained that because Davis' initial policy was
not immediately reinstated, the second policy was not a "renewal"
of the first policy, but rather a new policy.  Thus, the insurer
argued that it had the right to rescind the new policy because
Davis' check did not clear.

     The district court granted Criterion summary judgment,
finding no Alaska statute precluded the insurer's "common law
right of rescission," and that the Alaska Supreme Court would
find that the policy in this case was properly rescinded.  Davis
appealed.

     The Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's grant of
summary judgment.

     First, the panel found that the second, disputed policy
explicitly provided that a service fee of $10 would be added to
the insured's account if her check were not honored by her bank.
"This language clearly signals that the penalty incurred for
bouncing a check is a $10 fee, not the absence of coverage," the
panel noted.

     The panel concluded that the facts of this case favor Davis
more strongly than the "intermediate doctrine" outlined by John
A. Appleman's Insurance Law and Practice, which states that if an
insurer accepts a check as payment of a premium and issues a
receipt, it waives its right to rescind the policy even if the
check is dishonored.

     "Under these circumstances," the panel held, "the honoring
of Davis' check was not a condition precedent to Criterion's
provision of insurance.  Accordingly...there was coverage until
cancellation."

     The panel noted that Criterion could have protected itself
by simply providing in the policy that no coverage would exist if
the insured's check is not honored.

     The panel also found that Criterion did not meet Alaska's
20-day notice requirement for cancellation when it rescinded
Davis' policy.

DE SUPER. CT.: NONPARTY
INSURER OBLIGATED FOR
UNDERINSURED COVERAGE

     An insurer is obligated to make underinsurance coverage
payments to a policyholder after a state Superior Court
arbitrator determined that her injuries were caused by a third
party, even though the insurer was not a party to the
arbitration, ruled the Delaware Supreme Court, thereby reversing
an opinion by the state Superior Court.  Sutch v. State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., No. 183 (DE Super. Ct.).

     In its Dec. 28 opinion, the court found that the insurer had
ample notification of the policyholder's suit against the third
party and thus would have been able to defend its interests.

     Deborah Sutch was injured in a three-car accident on Dec. 5,
1991.  Sutch filed a negligence suit in Delaware Superior Court
against a third-party tortfeasor.  After arbitration, the trial
court found in favor of Sutch for $100,000.  Sutch's carrier paid
half of the award, which was the limit of the third-party's
liability coverage.

     Sutch demanded the remaining $50,000 from her underinsured
motorist insurer, State Farm Mutual Insurance Co.  When State
Farm refused, Sutch filed suit against the insurer in Delaware
Superior Court, contending that she was entitled to the sum under
Delaware insurance law, and that the collateral estoppel bar in
Delaware Superior Court Civil Rule 16.1(j) "does not entitle
State Farm to relitigate the issues of liability and damages."

     Sutch and State Farm then filed cross-motions for summary
judgment.

     After an arbitration hearing, the trial court granted
summary judgment to State Farm, holding that the judgment entered
against Dale was not binding because State Farm was not a party
to the underlying suit.  Sutch appealed to the Delaware Supreme
Court, contending that the superior court erred in holding that
State Farm had shown prejudice resulting from Sutch's failure to
comply with the notice provisions of her policy.

     The court reversed the decision of the trial court, holding
that Rule 16.1(j) is not applicable to this case because the
parties did not request a trial de novo after the arbitration
decision became final.

     The court noted that Rule 16.1(j) expressly provides that
when an arbitrator's award is entered as a judgment, "after the
time for requesting a trial de novo has expired, the judgment
shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of the
superior court in a civil action except it shall not be subject
to appeal."

     Regarding the issue of collateral estoppel, the court held
that although State Farm was not a party to the arbitration, it
was notified of the decision a month before the entry of judgment
in the superior court.  "Thus, State Farm had the opportunity to
intervene in the proceedings between Dale and Sutch to protect
its interests, once it was notified of the demand for payment of
underinsurance benefits," noted the court, holding that the
arbitration decision was binding upon the insurer.

     In addition, the court disagreed with State Farm's
alternative argument that Sutch did not notify State Farm of her
suit against the third party until the arbitrator's decision was
rendered, as required by her policy.
               "This court has held that the lack of notification to a
carrier does not necessarily relieve the carrier of making
payments pursuant to the policy," noted the court.  "When the
insured fails to comply with a notification provision, the
carrier has the burden of showing it was thereby prejudiced."

     The court found that because State Farm had notice of the
suit, it did not show such prejudice.

     Arguing for Sutch was David H. Erisman of Erisman & Curtin,
Wilmington, DE.  Arguing for State Farm was Francis J. Jones Jr.
and Eileen K. Anderson of Morris, James, Hitchens & Williams,
Wilmington, DE.

MI CT. APP. ALLOWS
DEPOSITION OF LEGISLATIVE
AIDE IN INSURANCE CASE

     A state Senate aide must give deposition testimony
concerning disclosure of confidential information about an
investigation by the state Insurance Bureau, a Michigan Court of
Appeals panel ruled Nov. 14, holding that the aide is not
shielded by the Speech and Debate provision of the state
Constitution because the questions do not concern matters within
the legislative sphere.  Michigan Education Special Services
Association v. Insurance Commissioner et al., No. 171303 (MI
Ct. App.).

     The nonprofit Michigan Education Special Services
Association is a third-party administrator for a teachers union's
Blue Cross/Blue Shield health plan; the union is politically
active, primarily on behalf of Democrats.  The association sued
the state insurance commissioner in Ingham County, MI Circuit
Court, alleging that an Insurance Bureau investigation was
politically motivated.

     Judge James R. Giddings issued a temporary restraining order
prohibiting the bureau from releasing any information about the
investigation.  However, a Republican state senator learned of
the investigation and issued a press release announcing that the
bureau would soon investigate the association.

     Senate aide John Prange was deposed but refused to disclose
how the senator's office learned of the investigation.  Prange
contended he cannot be constitutionally compelled to answer
questions regarding the content of statements the senator made to
him because they were made in the confines of the senator's
office and not disclosed to the public. Judge Giddings disagreed
with Prange and granted the association's motion to compel
discovery.

     In an opinion by Judge Kathleen Jansen, the Michigan Court
of Appeals panel rejected Prange's argument that the information
sought is privileged under the Speech or Debate Clause of the
Michigan Constitution.  The communication between Prange and the
senator in the senator's office was not within the sphere of
legitimate legislative activity because it related to an
administrative agency's actions, the panel held.

     Even if the senator had been involved in introducing
legislation concerning health care coverage for teachers, the
questions asked of Prange were not an integral part of
legislative deliberations, noted the panel.

     On the insurance commissioner's cross-appeal, the panel
declined to overturn the temporary restraining order against
releasing information about the investigation to the public.
However, it found the commissioner may raise the issue on remand.

INSURER NOT LIABLE
FOR FAILURE TO SETTLE
MALPRACTICE SUIT

     An HMO's malpractice insurer is not liable for more than its
$2 million policy limits although it refused to settle for that
limit until jury deliberations began, a federal judge in Missouri
ruled Nov. 3, holding that the insurer's obligation to tender the
policy limits at the time of negotiation was not certain enough
to make its insistence on a release from the HMO wrongful.
Humana Kansas City Inc. v. Continental Casualty Company,
No. 93-1248-CV-W-6 (WD MO).

     In 1989, Humana Kansas City was sued in Jackson County, MO,
Circuit Court for obstetrical malpractice.  It sought defense and
indemnification under its $2 million professional liability
policy from Continental Casualty.  Humana initially assessed the
settlement value of the case at $100,000, but the patient
demanded a settlement for the policy limits.

     As the malpractice trial opened and started to go poorly for
the HMO, Humana demanded Continental tender its policy limits;
later in the trial, a lawyer predicted a verdict of about
$2 million and a $1.5 million settlement value.  The patient then
offered to accept $3.25 million by a specified deadline or
$4 million after the close of evidence.  Continental refused to
tender its policy limits unless Humana waived indemnification for
any amount above $2 million; Humana agreed, allegedly only if the
case were settled, not if it went to verdict.

     Before the jury returned its $13 million verdict, the
parties settled for $5 million.  Humana then filed a
diversity-based complaint in U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Missouri alleging bad-faith refusal to settle.

     Senior Judge Howard F. Sachs granted summary judgment in
favor of Continental.  First, he found sufficient evidence that
the parties had mutually agreed that Continental would tender the
policy limits in exchange for Humana's release of any
indemnification claim, even if Humana had no other choice under
the circumstances.

     Furthermore, the judge found the insurer's obligation to
tender the policy limits had not been established at the time of
the negotiations because there had not yet been a verdict of at
least $2 million.  As a result, the insurer's agreement to do so
furnished adequate consideration to support Humana's release, he
said.

     Next, the judge rejected Humana's argument that a release
from liability for a bad-faith claim is not a proper subject for
contract and violates public policy.

     Although the estimated settlement value of the case began to
rise from less than $2 million once the trial began,
Continental's obligation to tender $2 million was not so certain
that its demand for a release was wrongful, Judge Sachs held.  He
also rejected Humana's duress claim, saying any economic exigency
that existed cannot be attributed to a wrongful act by the
insurer.

     John E. Turner of Kansas City, MO, and Donald W. Vasos of
Kansas City, KS, represented Humana.  James D. Griffin and
M. Courtney Koger of Overland Park, KS, represented Continental.

CA SUP CT.: INSURERS
REQUIRED TO NOTIFY
PUC OF POLICY EXPIRATION

     A divided California Supreme Court panel ruled Dec. 29 that
a highway carrier insurer is liable for an accident that occurred
nine years after the policy expired, because the insurer failed
to provide the state public utilities commission with the
required 30 day cancellation notice after the policy's
expiration.

     The panel found, however, that an insurer is entitled to
seek reimbursement from the carrier under the public utilities
commission's regulatory scheme.

     In 1989, an Amtrak train and a truck owned by Tab
Transportation, Inc. caused three deaths and several injuries,
resulting in $6 million in legal claims against Tab for wrongful
death, personal injury, and property damage against Tab.  Tab
sought recovery under three insurance policies.  Two of the three
insurers contributed a total of $1.6 million to a global
settlement.  Transamerica Insurance Co., however, did not
participate in the settlement.

     Transamerica filed an action in May 1992 for declaratory
judgment in the San Francisco County Superior Court, asserting
that it was not liable for damages under the $500,000 one-year
liability policy it issued to Tab for the period between February
1, 1980, and February 1, 1981.

     The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) of California requires
that liability policies issued to highway carriers may only be
canceled after 30 days' written notice is submitted to the PUC.
Transamerica did not give the PUC the required notice of
cancellation when Tab failed to renew the policy. Although Tab
replaced the Transamerica policy with a new policy issued by
another insurer, neither party notified the PUC of the
cancellation of the Transamerica policy.

     Transamerica asserted that if it were liable for damages, it
was entitled under PUC regulations to be reimbursed by Tab for
any payments made under the policy.  Tab filed a cross-complaint
contending that it was entitled to coverage under the policy
because Transamerica had filed with the PUC expressly stating
that its policy was effective in 1980 until canceled.  The trial
court granted Tab's motion for summary adjudication on this
basis.

     The case was tried on the remaining issue of whether
Transamerica was entitled to reimbursement by Tab.  The trial
court ruled in favor of the insurer, referring to a PUC
endorsement attached to the Transamerica policy providing for Tab
to reimburse Transamerica "for any payment made as the result of
obligations arising under the endorsement."

     Both parties appealed.  Transamerica challenged the trial
court's summary adjudication in favor of Tab on the coverage
issue, and Tab cross-appealed on the issue of Transamerica's
right to reimbursement.  The California Court of Appeals reversed
on the coverage issue, concluding that the Transamerica policy
had, in fact, expired on Feb. 1, 1981 and that Transamerica had
no obligation to give written notice of cancellation to the PUC.
Tab filed a petition for review in the California Supreme Court,
which was granted.

     The high court panel reversed the appeals court's
determination, referring to Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Allstate
Ins. Co., supra, 234 Cal.App.3d, which held that a 30 day notice
of cancellation submitted to the PUC is required before a policy
covering a highway carrier is terminated.

     "In addition to providing an efficient means for the PUC to
administer the financial responsibility requirements imposed on
highway carriers, the policy on file with the PUC serves as
assurance that the public is protected...," noted the panel.
"These important considerations far outweigh the slight burden
imposed by the statute on an insurer of providing the PUC with 30
days' written notice of cancellation."

               On the issue of whether Transamerica is entitled to
reimbursement by Tab for payment of damages resulting from the
accident, the panel found that the regulatory scheme of the PUC
allows highway carriers to pay damages to the public, but
prevents the carriers from "reaping an undeserved windfall" by
allowing the insurer to seek reimbursement from the carrier.

     However, the panel noted that if the carrier is insolvent
and cannot reimburse the insurer, the risk of loss falls on the
insurer.

The Dissenting Opinions
     Judge Armand Arabian and Judge Marvin Baxter dissented with
the majority.  "I agree with the holding of the Court of Appeal
on the coverage issue," Judge Baxter wrote, "and would affirm the
judgment of that court.  Since the Court of Appeal determined the
issue of coverage in favor of Transamerica, it did not reach or
address the further issue of Transamerica's right to
reimbursement under the terms of the standard form endorsement.
I would likewise refrain."

     Judge Baxter noted in a similar case that the Ninth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals found a distinction between "non-renewal"
and "expiration" of a policy, and held that notice is only
required in the event of cancellation, not expiration.

     Judge Arabian agreed with Judge Baxter on the issue of
reimbursement, but added that although Transamerica

     "The reimbursement 'consolation' plainly and unjustly
ignores the reality that resort to expired insurance coverage
will only be necessary if the insured...is insolvent.  If for
this reason an injured claimant cannot recover full damages, an
indemnitee insurer obviously will fare no better," Judge Arabian
contended.

ATTORNEY NOT ENTITLED
TO LOSS OF INCOME FROM
THEFT OF EVIDENCE

     A personal injury attorney is not entitled to recover
damages resulting from loss of income after $433 worth of
evidence he was planning to use in court was stolen from his
office, because he could not show his practice was suspended or
harmed by the theft, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled Dec. 29, upholding a California federal court decision.
Winters v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. et al., No. 93-56412
(9th Cir.).

     Jack Winters was representing a man who was injured while
using an electric-powered handsaw purchased from J.C. Penney,
Inc.  Winters purchased five handsaws to aid in arguing his case,
and kept them in his office.  Unfortunately, they were stolen
from the office and never recovered.  The court ruled in favor of
J.C. Penney.

     Winters submitted claims for theft of the saws and lost
income to his business insurer, State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.
The insurer paid Winters $433, the cash value of the saws, but
denied his loss of income claim.

     Winters filed a claim in the San Diego County Superior Court
against State Farm, alleging breach of contract.  State Farm
removed the action to U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of California and moved for partial summary judgment.

     The district court granted summary judgment to the insurer,
holding that the business personal property loss provision of
Winters' policy "covers only the value of the property involved,
and does not cover the insured's potential legal liability to
third parties in contract or in tort."  The court concluded that
Winters' recovery was limited to the cash value of the saws.

     The lower court further determined that Winters failed to
demonstrate that the theft of the saws prevented him from
continuing to practice law, and that Winters' claim did not
constitute recoverable "extra expenses" because the losses were
not sustained during a "period of restoration," as required by
the policy.

     Winters appealed, contending that the court erred in
awarding summary judgment because the value of the saws is a
disputed issue of material fact.  Moreover, he argued that the
term "legally liable" is ambiguous.

     The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the district court's
decision, finding that courts interpreting policy language nearly
identical to the State Farm policy held that coverage is only
provided for the cash value of the property -- not for liability
to third parties.

     In addition, the panel found that the personal property
coverage section of the policy requires property loss to be
adjusted on the basis of actual cash value.  Furthermore, if
"legally liable" were interpreted as Winters urged, the personal
property section "would be redundant of the business liability
portion of the policy," held the panel.

     The panel also determined that under the "limit of
liability" provision, Winters is only entitled to actual cash
value where he did not inform State Farm he had replaced the saws
within one year of the loss.

     Finally, the panel upheld the district court's holding that
any loss stemming from the theft is "speculative" because he
could not prove that he would have won the case if the saws had
not been stolen.  Furthermore, because Winters' practice was not
suspended, he is not entitled to losses under the policy, the
panel found.

     Arguing for Winters was Robert E. Adams of Winters &
Associates, San Diego, CA.  Arguing for State Farm was Stephen E.
Smith of Ramsay, Johnson & Klunder, Irvine, CA; and Peter
Abrahams and Holly R. Paul of Horvitz & Levy, Encino, CA.

MI APP. CT. UPHOLDS
$374,319 AWARD TO BUSINESS
FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT

     The Michigan Court of Appeals Dec. 1 affirmed a $374,319
award against an insurer that failed to honor a policyholder's
business interruption claim, holding that the policyholder
presented sufficient evidence that its business losses were
caused by physical damage to its insured computer system.
Synchronized Design & Development Company Inc. v. Chubb Group of
Insurance Companies, No. 164340 (MI Ct. App.).

     Synchronized Design & Development Co. obtained a broad
insurance policy from Chubb Group.  The policy covered business
interruptions caused by damage to a covered risk.  After
lightning storms caused power surges and outages that damaged
Synchronized's computer equipment, the company filed a claim for
damage to the equipment and for several thousand dollars in
business interruption losses.

     A dispute arose over the amount of loss, and Chubb
eventually rejected the proof of loss after paying out $114,294.
A breach-of-contract complaint was filed in Macomb County, MI,
Circuit Court. Chubb counterclaimed to void the policy on the
basis of an allegedly falsified and inflated damage claim and to
recoup its $114,294.

     At trial before Judge Deborah A. Servitto, the jury awarded
Synchronized $291,777 and rejected Chubb's counterclaim for fraud
and false swearing.  Judge Servitto denied Synchronized's motion
for sanctions.  Judgment was entered for $374,319 plus costs and
post-judgment interest.

     The Michigan Court of Appeals panel affirmed in a per curiam
opinion, finding that Chubb was not entitled to a directed
verdict because the jury could reasonably conclude that the
physical damage to the computers caused the claimed business
loss.  Nor was there an abuse of discretion in the trial judge's
denial of post-trial defense motions on the fraud counterclaim,
the panel held.

     On procedural issues, the panel rejected defense challenges
to the admission of evidence from Synchronized's experts, to the
jury instructions on Chubb's counterclaim and to exclusion of
evidence about the tax fraud conviction of Synchronized's
majority shareholder.

     On cross-appeal, the panel upheld the denial of sanctions,
holding that Judge Servitto had not clearly erred in ruling that
the counterclaim was not frivolous.

VA HIGH CT.: SEPARATE
POLICY LIMIT APPLIES TO
EACH MOLESTATION VICTIM

     A per-occurrence policy limit applies to each victim
molested by the same assailant even if the attacks were part of a
pattern of criminal conduct, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled
Dec. 13, setting the maximum exposure of an insurer at
$7 million, or $1 million per purported victim, rather than at
the $1 million policy limit collectively for all the victims.
S. F. (Doe) et al. v. West American Insurance Company, No. 950120
(VA Sup. Ct.).

     West American issued a business liability policy to the
owners of Harbor View Apartments, whose resident manager
allegedly molested seven children on multiple occasions.  The
policy provided up to $1 million coverage per occurrence.

     The victims sued the Harbor View owners on a theory of
negligent hiring, selection, retention and supervision of the
resident manager, who was previously convicted of child
molestation and was on parole when hired.

     West American filed a declaratory judgment complaint in City
of Norfolk Circuit Court.  Judge John E. Clarkson ruled the
insurer is at risk for only the $1 million policy limit because
the allegedly negligent hiring constituted only a single
occurrence.

     The state high court reversed in an opinion by Justice Leroy
R. Hassell Sr.

     The policy's definition of occurrence was ambiguous and thus
must be construed against West American and interpreted in a way
that grants rather than withholds coverage, the court held.  For
example, as written, an occurrence could be deemed as the
insureds' negligent hiring, or their negligent supervision or
their negligent retention of the resident manager, noted the
court.

     Moreover, the court held that although each victim was
molested more than once, those attacks constituted only one
occurrence per victim.

MO APP. CT. FINDS
INSURER NOT LIABLE
FOR MOLESTATION JUDGMENT

     A homeowners' insurer is not liable for a molestation-
related judgment because child sexual abuse is inherently
intentional misconduct, the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled
Dec. 5, rejecting a victim's attempt to garnish his assailant's
insurer.  M.A.B. et al. v. Nicely et al., Nos. WD 50462 &
WD 50528 (MO Ct. App.).

     The panel also ordered the victim to pay the insurer's
attorneys' fees and costs in the garnishment action and appeal.

     M.A.B. claimed he was sexually abused by Kenneth Nicely
while Nicely's homeowners' policy from Union Mutual Insurance Co.
was in effect.  The policy included bodily injury coverage but
excluded damage "which is expected or intended by the insured."

     M.A.B. won a $100,000 personal injury judgment against
Nicely, then brought a garnishment action against Union Mutual in
Jackson County, MO, Circuit Court to collect.  Judge Jon R. Gray
rejected Nicely's denial of the assaults but quashed M.A.B's writ
of garnishment.  He also denied Union Mutual's motion for
indemnification of attorneys' fees and costs.

     The Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, modified
the lower court's ruling in an opinion by Chief Judge Gary A.
Fenner.

     The panel agreed with Judge Gray that Union Mutual is not
liable for the underlying judgment because of the exclusionary
language in the policy.  In the context of child sexual abuse, an
inferred-intent standard applies, the court held, so the
molestation of M.A.B. is deemed by law to have been intentional
on Nicely's part, noted the panel.  Intent to molest is the same
thing as the intent to harm, the panel noted.

     On the insurer's cross-appeal, the panel said M.A.B. is
required to pay Union Mutual's fees and costs for defense of the
garnishment action.  In an unsuccessful garnishment action or
appeal, court rules require taxing the garnishor for the
garnishee's expenses, said the panel.

MO CT. APP.: RES JUDICATA
BARS EX-DIRECTORS'
SUIT AGAINST INSURER

     Res judicata bars former officers and directors of a
corporation from suing the company's insurance broker for failing
to obtain adequate coverage for securities fraud claims, the
Missouri Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 28, finding a prior Kansas
decision blocking the ex-directors' suit on statute of
limitations precludes relitigation in Missouri.  Bendis et al. v.
Alexander and Alexander Inc., No. WD 50698 (MO Ct. App.).
               The four plaintiffs were officers and directors of
Comprehensive Health Care Systems Inc., a Kansas corporation.
Alexander and Alexander, a Maryland corporation authorized to do
business in Kansas and Missouri, procured insurance for
Comprehensive, including an officers and directors policy.
Coverage was obtained from Federal Insurance Co. and Hartford
Accident & Indemnity Co.

     In 1986, Comprehensive merged with TBG Inc.  TBG later filed
a federal court complaint accusing the ex-directors of
misrepresenting Comprehensive's financial status and violating
securities laws.  When Federal and Hartford refused to defend or
indemnify, the ex-directors sued them in the District of Kansas;
the insurers won on summary judgment.

     The ex-directors sued Alexander and Alexander in the
District of Kansas for failure to perform a risk evaluation for
Comprehensive and for failure to obtain insurance to defend and
indemnify them against the underlying securities and common law
claims in the TBG case.  Alexander and Alexander won summary
judgment based on the Kansas statute of limitations.

     The ex-directors then filed a petition against the broker in
Jackson County, MO, Circuit Court, with the same allegations as
their unsuccessful Kansas federal complaint.  Judge Jon R. Gray
granted summary judgment in favor of Alexander and Alexander.

     The Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, affirmed in
an opinion by Judge Laura Denvir Stith, finding the suit barred
by res judicata.  There was an identity of parties, underlying
facts, causes of action and issues in the Kansas federal and
Missouri state litigation, held the panel.

     A potential difference over whether the Kansas or Missouri
limitations period applies does not preclude res judicata, found
the panel, because the statute of limitations is an affirmative
defense and has no effect on subject matter jurisdiction.  In
addition, adopting the ex-directors' position would allow
plaintiffs to forum-shop for a state with a longer limitations
period, defeating the purpose of the res judicata doctrine.

     The court denied the broker's request for damages for a
frivolous appeal.

     David W. White, Alan V. Johnson and William F. Logan of
Overland Park, KS, represented the ex-directors.  Eric T. Swanson
and Theresa Shean Hall of Kansas City appeared for the insurance
broker.

NAIC: 'RE-ENGINEERING' NEW BUZZWORD

The NAIC era of heavy growth and large regulatory nets is over,
marked by the resignation of David Simmons, the NAIC executive vice
president, and the embracing of "regulatory re-engineering," as the
association's new strategy.
        The upcoming annual commissioners retreat beginning Jan.19 will
carry regulatory efficiency forward under the guidance  of Brian Atchinson,
the NAIC's new president, Kansas Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius and Iowa
Commissioner Terri Vaughan, according to Atchinson.
        Happy to leave regulation to the regulators, Simmons is working on
arranging to take a position as a lawyer in private practice.
        Simmons remarked that during his tenure, the NAIC experienced a lot
of growth while improving the quality of service to its membership.
        The rate of growth will now abate considerably, he said, which it
perhaps should. "I think its time to slow the rate of growth," he said.
        Whether or not that is adopted as an official strategy, those who
are championing regulatory re-engineering appear determined to prune
excessive regulations.
        The project picks up where last year's regulatory efficiency effort
left off, according to the regulators involved.
        Atchinson pointed to the comments and suggestions made by the
industry on how to improve and streamline insurance supervision during the
December meeting of the Regulatory Efficiency Special Committee as a
guideline in configuring the re-engineering effort.
        Sebelius serves as chair of the newly-formed Regulatory Re-
engineering Special Committee, Vaughan as vice-chair. They were appointed
by the officers in December.
        "We're going to put our energy into that," Atchinson said. He said
insurance deregulation, the focus of a recent New York study, is but one
issue involved.
        Others issues to be considered or resolved by the NAIC according to
the minutes from the Regulatory Efficiency meeting in San Antonio include
the coordinated market conduct examinations due to the expense of market
conduct examinations and their redundancy, simplification of agent
licensing standardization requirements for admission and licensing.
        "Re-engineering needs to be done because we have limited resources
but global market. The demand of a global marketplace truly presents
challenges," he said.
        It will be done "in a manner that doesn't compromise consumers," he
added.
        While noting the new direction of the NAIC, Simmons' denied his
decision to leave was in any way related to the new leadership  and
budgetary priorities that could leave favored activities such as the
producer database and system for electronic rate and form filing (SERFF)
out on a limb. Instead, he just became fatigued with NAIC work, he said.
         In fact,he said he told Utah Commissioner Robert Wilcox that even
if Wilcox was elected NAIC president, he would leave. Wilcox later withdrew
his challenge of Atchinson for the chief regulatory position (See IR Nov. 6
);.
        Simmons gave notice fellow regulators about a week ago that he will
leave the association March 15. He first vocalized his intentions to the
membership during the NAIC Winter meeting in early December during a closed
meeting of the Executive Committee.
        "I don't consider myself a regulator," Simmons told IR. "I'm
basically a lawyer." Simmons had been general counsel for the NAIC in
Kansas City before rising to the executive position four years ago.
        "The position wears you out," Simmons said, noting that he was
thinking of leaving last year but decided to stayed on a while longer
because he could serve as an "institutional memory" for many of the new
regulators.
        "Now they are seasoned and I feel freer to leave," he said.
        Meanwhile, the NAIC's general counsel in Washington, Kevin T.
Cronin, will assume the position of acting executive vice president while
the NAIC conducts a national search for someone to replace Simmons. Cronin
has already become the point-man on several issues that require information
sensitive to the NAIC.

FLA. BILL TO EXPAND POLLUTION LIABILITY

The Florida House of Represent-atives is preparing a draft for a
pollution liability bill that would force insurers to rewrite policy
language  to expand their exposure and possibly reduce premiums.
        The bill targets insurance industry language describing liability
parameters for pollution claims and is being drafted by the House Insurance
Committee under the watch of its chairman, Rep. John F. Cosgrove, D-Miami.
It is intended to  bind insurers to statements made to regulators in 1970.
        Proponents of the bill at the Tallahassee law firm of Greenberg,
Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff Rosen & Quentel submitted a white paper to the
House through their involvement in the Coalition to Preserve Environmental
Insurance Coverage that details a proposed amendment enforceable through
the state insurance department.
        The paper argues that the 1993 state Supreme Court case, Dimmitt
Chevrolet v. Southeastern Fidelity Insurance Corp., 17 Fla. Law W. S 579,
on rehearing, undermined the state's pollution abatement efforts and
shouldn't be allowed to influence the outcome of litigation over an
insurance claim.
        The final Dimmitt decision upheld insurers' denial of gradual
pollution claims and ruled that the language of the pollution exclusion was
unambiguous and didn't cover events that were "unexpected and unintended,"
only those that were "abrupt or instantaneous."
         The problem is that insurers had vouched to regulators that they
would still cover events that were unexpected and unintended, i.e., gradual
unintentional pollution, in seeking to exclude intentional pollution acts
in 1970, according to arguments and amicus briefs cited in the white paper.
        In 1970, the insurance industry had made representations to the
insurance department that although liability would exclude intentional acts
of pollution, it would still cover events that were "unexpected and
unintended," according to a Dimmitt amicus brief filed by the attorney
general's office.
        The phrase was supposedly a clarification of "an abrupt and
instantaneous event," which is a covered claim.
         However, the court ruled that statements made to state regulators
by insurers couldn't be considered by the state courts because the language
of the exclusion itself was unambiguous.
        Therefore, Fred Baggett, a partner at Greenberg, Traurig is urging
Cosgrove's office to include in its bill:
         That liability insurers, upon receipt of a claim for coverage for
environmental damages, construe the policies under which the claim was
brought in accordance with the statements they have made to state
regulators in 1970 regarding the language of those policies.
         A right of action in the event an insured is damaged by its
insurer's failure to comply with this requirement.
         Make violations of this requirement an act that may be prosecuted
by the insurance commissioner.
         The rules would not apply retroactively to closed claims and
wouldn't require an insurer to take into account oral statements made
outside the regulatory record; only written statements on the record would
serve as the basis for coverage.
        "If Dimmitt is allowed to stand, it will mean that there was a
massive reduction in coverage provided to insurers in 1970 with no
reduction in premiums for over two decades, the white paper asserts.
        Furthermore, the author suggests that Hurricane Andrew's aftermath
drew sympathy from the courts towards the policies of insurance companies.
        The possibility "that such considerations did have an influence
requires increased scrutiny and immediate action by the legislature," the
white paper.

        While the draft of the bill by Cosgrove and the insurance committee
is underway, it probably won't be ready for a few weeks. The Florida
legislature's session begins in early March.
        The proposed amendment to 18 Fla. Law W. S 400  shouldn't cause any
financial burden on insurers in Florida, Baggett argues in his paper.
        Since insurers haven't "been issuing policies with the 'sudden and
accidental' exclusion since the mid-1980s, the amendment directly addresses
largely historical policies, not current policies, and will have no effect
on current underwriting," it concludes.

MISSOURI LOSES GRIP ON STOP-LOSS

Missouri became the first state to lose its stop-loss jurisdiction
altogether after a recent court decision, potentially setting a damaging
precedent to other states seeking to amend their stop-loss statutes to
approach the NAIC model act.
        In a decision that marked a victory for employers and some insurers
to keep the NAIC out of the self-funded health care market, a Cole County
circuit court judge ruled that the Missouri insurance department has no
statutory authority to regulate stop-loss coverage issued to employers on
behalf of self-funded, noninsurer health plans.
        The department was seeking to implement terms of the model law on
stop-loss adopted by the NAIC in September when it was sued by a life
insurance company and three state business associations in November.
        In Associated Industries of Missouri, The Missouri Chamber of
Commerce, General American Life Insurance Co. and St. Louis Area Business
Health Coalition v. the Missouri Department of Insurance and Jay Angoff,
Director, No. CV195-1326CC, the court said the proposed regulation is
directly pre-empted by Erisa.
        The plaintiffs had only sought to enjoin the amendments to the
rule, not the rule itself, and the department has been talking with them
since the decision to clarify that point as a basis for future legal
action, according to a department spokesperson.
        Other departments such as Maryland's have sought to adjust their
stop-loss provisions and are responding to lawsuits over their
implementation of the NAIC model act,and if not, according to the position
of the Self-Insurance Institute of America, soon will. (See IR, Nov. 20).
        The Missouri rule, set to take effect on the first of the year,
would have established when stop-loss coverage would be deemed a medical
expense, established that the purpose of stop-loss coverage is to cover
catastrophic losses and specified which insurance laws are applicable to
stop-loss coverage.
        The NAIC set a $20,000 attachment point for employee group health
claims, under which they are considered health insurance. But stop loss
coverage is issued to an employer or self-funded health plan to pay for
catastrophic losses over and above the expected claims for the plan, so is
not under the rubric of employee-benefiting group health insurance,
according to the judicial opinion.
        Missouri's rule would have raised the attachment point to $10,000
from $7,500 as a compromise. Now, no attachment point exists, meaning group
health insurance plans could have a lower limit as low as $1 theoretically,
according to a department spokesperson.
        But adding stop-loss group health insurance to the definition of
group health insurance, Angoff is "illegally usurping authority over stop-
loss coverages under the guise of regulating group health insurance,"
according to the opinion.
        The department will appeal, saying the decision due to go into
effect Jan. 27, will affect hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people
and threaten the viability of group health market.

DEFINITION OF TERMS

NAIC President Brian Atchinson came up with the loaded buzzword
"regulatory re-engineering," but now it will be up to the other NAIC
members to define it  and put it into effect.
        In business, re-engineering typically has referred to redesigning a
company's working structure from the ground up, rather than an effort to
peel costs and staff off the core, although a reduction in costs is often
the result. However, the "increasingly limited resources" of the NAIC, as
one regulator put it, will probably result in some old-fashioned down-
sizing. According to Terri Vaughan, vice chair of the regulatory
reengineering committee. Atchinson and Kathleen Sebelius, the committee's
chair, re-engineering includes:
         Streamlining and consistency: Consistency in reporting forms is
one element of re-engineering. Variations in forms such as annual statement
and continuing education forms will be examined for creating more
consistency among them.
        However, total uniformity is not the goal, just eliminating those
areas that are a result of failure to better coordinate.
         Deregulation: There is a proposed charge to look at the
feasibility of deregulating some commercial lines of insurance.
"Deregulation is perhaps an exercise that each of the states will evaluae
depending upon where they are," Sebelius noted.
         Reassigning limited resources: There will be a push to focus on
the big picture and draw back from nit-picky activities, Sebelius
suggested.
        For example, pulling employees away from rote file approvals and
refocusing them on market conduct records.

CONN. AGENTS PUSH LANGUAGE COVERING BANKS

Insurance agents in Connecticut are proposing regulatory language
addressing bank sale of annuities in a 15-16 page working draft soon to be
circulating among state insurance and banking department officials.
        "The goal is not to inhibit the banks but instead have them realize
their unique position among financial institutions," according to an
industry representative working on a draft for the department.
        Meanwhile, the banks are waiting and remain in the dark about
developments in the working draft, according to a banking lawyer, who has
not yet seen an internal insurance department working draft, whose next
stop is said to be the state banking department.
        "There is no draft," an insurance department spokesperson said.
        New regulatory language is necessary to guide the way for national
banks in Connecticut to sell annuities. Banks have been able to apply for
licenses since a partial settlement was reached with Shawmut National Bank
last fall, but no bank has yet applied because institutions are waiting to
see the regulatory language, the department's director of licensing has
said before.
        That's not entirely true, suggested Rob Taylor of the Hartford law
firm Day, Berry & Howard.
        Some banks are delaying as they await the outcome of the Shawmut
and Barnett Bank decisions as well as the completion of the Shawmut/Fleet
National Bank merger, he said. But if banks would apply, perhaps the
department would feel pressured to promulgate the regulatory language soon.
The department has said that it would deliver a decision on a bank's
license within two to three weeks of receiving an application.
        Taylor helped represent Shawmut when the insurance department sued
it for attempting to sell insurance from one of its local branches.
        "Our position is to make sure that the bank people are properly
trained," said Warren C. Ruppar, the executive vice president of the
Independent Insurance Agents of Connecticut.
        Other provisions the agents have been trying to work into the draft
include consumer protection language that would prevent banks from
accessing a bank customer's personal financial records and minimizing the
potential for coercion. "For instance, if you are applying for a loan, the
issue of separation is very, very important," he said.
         The access to personal financial records worries the industry
because it is worried about a level playing field, Ruppar noted. For
instance, if you are applying for a loan, the issue of separation is very,
very important.
        He isn't sure which of the various suggestions to level that field,
which include exclusion of records or equal access to them, will make it
into the final regulatory language.
        "We're in the midst of a regulatory discussion on whether it should
be a straight and full prohibition of access or various other ways," he
said.
        Also, the assurance that there is full disclosure and a signed
customer acknowledgement that the insurance products aren't FDIC-insured
should be necessary, according to the agents.

NEW YORK SNAGS TWO AUTO INSURERS

A Pennsylvania insurer got slapped with $142,590 fine from the New
York Insurance Department for myriad claims violations in connection with
its automobile insurance policies, while a New York company received a
$105,520 fine for similar violations.
        Worldwide Underwriters Insurance Co. of Frazier violated the law
when it failed to send to insureds initial and follow-up no-fault
applications and verification forms in a timely manner, the department
charged.
        The department's charges are based on a market conduct
investigation of Worldwide that revealed that violations occurred between
May 1991 and April 1992.
        Country-Wide Insurance Co.'s slighter smaller fine reflects a
slighter smaller list of offenses uncovered in a market conduct exam
conducted between June 1993 and May 1994. Country-Wide, of New York City,
for example, didn't get cited for failing to report losses to the National
Insurance Crime Bureau within specified time limits, as was Worldwide.
        Among the other charges included in the stipulation signed by
Worldwide include failure to resolve claims within specified time frames
and provide insureds with notices explaining delays in claims.
        The company also failed to follow guidelines for the inspection and
documentation of damaged vehicles and failed to make timely good faith
offers to policyholders.
        The company also committed calculation errors. It failed to
appropriately calculate overdue no-fault benefits and reimburse claimants
for lost wages up to their policy limits. It also failed to use the correct
figures in calculating the value of lost or stolen vehicles.
        Worldwide must review all no-fault and total loss payments made
between July 1994, and December 1995. Country-Wide must conduct similar
reviews and also perform quarterly self-audits.

NORTHEAST ZONE: MAJOR REFORM SLATED FOR N.Y. WORKERS COMP

The governor of New York has announced he is directing state
regulators to introduce a sweeping reform plan for workers compensation
during the 1996 legislative session.
        In his state-of-the state address Jan. 3, Gov. George E. Pataki
challenged the existing workers comp laws by stating that "they do not
fairly serve either workers or employers."
        "In recent years, costs skyrocketed, and the injured worker
received no better service or medical care," Pataki stated.
        Pataki was riding the theme of creating more jobs and greater
opportunity and diminishing "pointless" regulation in his speech, a
continuing theme for his administration whose early momentum brought about
a recently concluded plan for regulatory reform in the state insurance
department.
        There appears to be a lot of force behind the push to reform in New
York.
        The industry has been working closely with the business community
to make sure that workers comp reform and other problems that plague.the
industry are dealt with, said a representative for the American Insurance
Association's Northeast region. "Other attempts at change were Band-Aids;
more serious surgery is required," she said.
        Pataki has charged Labor Commissioner John Sweeney and Workers
Compensation Board Chairman Robert Snashall as well as his director of
regulatory reform, Bob King, with submitting a reform plan to him within 90
days. The governor will be proposing a bill to both the state Assembly and
Senate.
        The New York Workers Comp Action Network of Syracuse, which
organized two years ago to produce reform, will also be introducing a bill.
        Last year, managed care was introduced into workers comp and rates
decreased by 5%, according to Pataki.

MIDWEST ZONE: KANSAS HMO BILL HEADED TO LEGISLATURE

Kathleen Sebelius, the Kansas insurance commissioner, is calling
for a major update of the consumer protection elements of the state's
managed care market months after she defined insurance to create more
clarity in the marketplace.
        And she's looking to her neighbor in Missouri HMO law for help.
        The state legislature opened its chambers for the 1996 season last
week and Sebelius was there with her legislative agenda, which includes
notice of a bill draft on the Kansas HMO act.
        The act has not been significantly amended since it was first
approved by the legislature in 1974, Sebelius has pointed out. Sebelius
issued a bulletin in late November outlining the parameters of "insurance"
for managed care regulatory purposes, a step both Ohio and Florida have
also undertaken. (See IR, Dec. 11).
        The draft bill will include provisions found in the current NAIC
model act, except in the areas of solvency and deposit requirements and
grievance procedures, where the bill will follow the provisions in the
Missouri HMO law.
        Additional disclosure requirements of the financial agreements
between providers and managed care organizations are also on the agenda.
        The solvency standards in Missouri are done on a sliding scale
based on revenues detailed in the company's marketing plan and has run over
$1 million in capital, according to a spokesperson for the Missouri
department. To enter the state, a group health plan's capital threshold
must be $150,000.
        HMOs in Missouri must have an internal grievance procedure for the
first wave of complaints, the spokesperson noted, referencing the 1983
state law and its further provisions.
        Sebelius also hopes to follow the route Missouri took for enrollee
participation in the business operations of the HMO and for payment for
emergency room care.
        Enrollees in Missouri receive the annual statement of their HMO's
financial condition, full descriptions of organizational changes, where and
how to obtain services and a detailed description of the complaint process.
All these requirements are fleshed out through market conduct procedures,
the spokesperson said.

WEST ZONE: TEXAS BRINGS VIATICALS TO REGULATORY TABLE

The Texas Department of Insurance is closer to joining almost a
dozen other states that have implemented viatical settlement protection
rules with a hearing Commissioner Elton Bomer held Jan. 9.
        The proposed rules to protect terminally ill Texans who sell their
life insurance policies for immediate cash were described as "bare bones"
reporting standards by a department spokesperson.
        The reporting would have the viatical company reveal such
information as the location, size and key employees of a viatical company.
The department would also seek enough information to ascertain whether
customers were being treated fairly, according to the spokesperson.
        Misleading advertisements and marketing schemes would be ruled as a
violation of departmental regulations, as would dishonoring the privacy of
the applicants. All advertising material, forms and marketing plans must be
approved by the department, under the proposed rules.
        Insurance companies no longer could hold the policy for longer than
they should when they find out it is to be used for a viatical settlement,
as some have, the spokesperson said.
        The viatical policies must also reveal the tax consequences of
settling to the applicant, as well as other consequences,such as loss of
welfare or Medicare benefits. The company must also notify applicants of a
15-day right of rescission in their decision to sell their policies under
the proposed rules.
        However, no capital requirements of viaticals will be necessary in
Texas.
        Companies will need a certificate of registration to do business
without which they will be in violation of regulations and be subject to
revocation of their certificate. The department may deny certificate of
registration.
        Bomer is reviewing the testimony of the 16 parties who testified at
the hearing will make a decision on the final rules in the near future, the
spokesperson said.

TAX SIMPLIFICATION COULD BLAST BALANCE SHEETS

Tax simplification could have a drastic effect on corporate balance
sheets, wiping out as much as $3 trillion in equity, according to tax
experts at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants who have
just completed a major study of alternatives to the current system.
        Many observers in Washington and on Wall Street believe that
Congress will undertake a major overhaul of the tax system by the turn of
the century. But the new AICPA study indicates that the "unintended
consequences" of some of the tax reform plans that have been put forth are
so great that the proposals will collapse of their own weight.
        "The level of discussion in the last two or three years (about tax
reform) has gotten to be significant, but once you look at some of this
information you become less certain that people will want to jump into
that," said Deborah Walker, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner and chair of the
AICPA's Tax Executive Committee.
        "The AICPA has long been an advocate of tax simplification, but
there are many, many unanswered questions," said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA
president.
        Various proposals have been made in Washington, and they differ in
many significant ways. But in general they would do away with the current
income-based system of taxation and replace it with one based on
consumption.
        Byrle M. Abbin, a retired partner and now a consultant at Arthur
Andersen, warned of "dire" effects on financial statements from tax
simplification.
        First, there would be some gains from the elimination of the
corporate income tax. He noted that $600 billion in deferred tax
liabilities would no longer be owed while just $100 billion in deferred tax
assets would be wiped out by a flat tax.
        But the big crunch would become with the imposition of a
consumption tax.
        "Without transition relief, deductions for depreciation of existing
assets would not be allowed under the new tax, and the entire proceeds from
a theoretical sale of assets at the end of the reporting year for the
initial application of the new tax law would be included in the tax base,"
the AICPA said in its new study, "Flat Taxes and Consumption Taxes: A Guide
to the Debate."
        Assuming a 10% tax rate and given that corporations have $20
trillion in tax basis, "it is possible that $2 trillion of deferred tax
liabilities would be created upon the enactment of this new tax," the AICPA
said.
        Under FAS 109, this entire amount, which could be higher with a
higher tax rate, would have to be booked in the year of tax change.
        "This would more than wipe out total corporate profits in any one
year and severely reduce the amount of shareholders' equity," the AICPA
warned. "Thus financial statements would have to reflect the enormous
increase in future taxes that results from lost depreciation deductions or
taxable gain on sales due to the elimination of tax basis."
        "The desire for efficiency and simplification has to be balanced
with problems of fairness," Abbin said. He acknowledged that some of these
problems could be reduced or resolved with appropriate transition rules.
But he predicted a battle royal over those rules.
        "Even if you do have transition rules, first you are going to have
strong discussions involving FASB, the SEC, the accounting profession and
Congress," he said. "It would be a tough, tough confrontation."
        Tax simplification could present additional problems for insurers.
Not the least of these would be the loss of tax advantaged status for many
life products and for policy payouts. In addition, however, insurance
companies and other financial service providers may find themselves subject
to a special tax regime.
        "Because it is difficult to identify and value services provided by
financial institutions, no country with a consumption tax has been able to
tax financial services in a manner consistent with consumption tax
principles," the AICPA said. "Exemption of financial institutions from
consumption tax generally results in overtaxation of financial services
provided to businesses and undertaxation of services provided to
consumers."
        In general the tax burden would increase for labor-intensive
businesses, such as insurers, and decrease for capital-intensive ones, the
AICPA said. While tax rates may be cut dramatically, tax outlays could
actually increase.
        "Even though the (proposed) rates sound low, you have to remember
that people don't pay rates, they pay taxes," Abbin said. "There'll be a
whole host of companies with lower rates that will have higher taxes to pay
because major components of their business cannot be deducted."
        Another area where there could be surprising consequences to tax
reform is in international operations. "The exclusion of exports from gross
receipts provides large tax benefits to those firms that export," the AICPA
said.
        In addition, Abbin said that the "U.S. could become a tax haven"
under some of the reform proposals. "This could bring retaliation from
foreign countries where we have operations." --Miles Maguire

EUROPE'S PENSIONS TIME BOMB IS STILL TICKING

RANIERO VANNI, Commissioner for Financial Services, has made good his
threat to withdraw the draft Pension Directive. Vanni had warned last
year that this might be necessary, after the June 1994 Internal Market
Council failed to make any progress towards adoption of the Directive
on Freedom of Management and Investment of Funds held by Institutions
for Retirement Provision.

Instead, the European Commission has issued a Communication on Freedom
of Management and Investment, stressing the "urgent need" to clarify
its intentions in the pensions field.

The Commission will ensure, it said, that any restrictions that apply
in particular Member States will be "fully justified on the prudential
and other grounds upon which such restricutions have been applied and
they are proportional to their objectives".

The Communication said that the Commission had to withdraw the proposal
because it"refused to make the text acceptable to a majority of member
states by inserting certain amendments which risk to completely change
the sense of the Directive".

The draft directive was dogged by conflict on the issues of scope,
localisation of assets and currency matching. The currency matching
provision - requiring that a minimum proportion of funds should be
invested in the currency in which pensions would be paid - was most
troublesome and was the main contributor to the downfall of the draft.

Most member states wanted to keep the power to require 80 percent
currency matching, ensuring consistency with the insurance Directives.
The Commission, backed by the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, was
determined to give pension funds the ability to invest freely in
whatever markets they wanted - subject to prudent limits. Sixty
percent, the commission felt, was a reasonable limit - given that those
with complete freedom to invest rarely exceed 40 percent.

The Commission's move comes as European think tank, Federal Trust,
released a report The Pension Time Bomb in Europe, which predicts that,
without radical changes, maintaining level of benefits provided by Pay-
As-You-Go schemes in line with present expectations will impose an
unacceptable burden on future generations of taxpayers, will worsen the
competitiveness of industry and will harm the prospects for employment
and the economy.

The three original aims of the draft Pension Fund Directive - freedom
of cross-border membership, freedom to provide the service of managing
pension funds and freedom of cross-border investment of fund assets -
should not be abandoned, the report argues, but should be pursued by
other means.

Drastic cuts in benefits or rises in contribution, it maintains, can be
avoided by establishing a partnership between Pay-As-You- Go and
privately-funded pension schemes. Maximisation of benefits and the
minimisation of costs under private schemes requires that fund managers
have the maximum freedom to invest, subject to prudential safeguards.

THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES

The New Year may herald a new era in the UK life insurance business,
with onerous new disclosure requirements. Alison Jarman reports

AFTER A year which saw the UK life industry's reputation shredded by
the scandal of mis-sold pensions, 1995 is widely expected to bring big
changes as insurers begin providing full details of fees and charges
and the effect these have on the return to investors.

Prompted by consumer complaints that front-end loading of fees resulted
in minimal surrender values - almost non-existent generally during the
first five years of a 25 year policy - the Securities and Investments
Board (SIB) has finally put in place a disclosure regime which gives
the customer a clear idea of the return of a policy and the factors
affecting it.

January 1 saw the introduction of the long-awaited commission
disclosure rules, but while pundits have welcomed the greater
transparency, insurers are now waiting to see how the public reacts to
the latest rattling of skeletons from their closets. Aware that
brazenly admitting that in the case of many policies, the first two
years of premium is eaten up in commission and other charges would not
be wise, companies have been working hard to create a structure which
will make the new regime workable and limit the damage as far as
possible.

Under new SIB rules, before customers buy a life or pension product,
they must be presented with paperwork outlining the type of product,
its workings and, where appropriate, surrender values. A key feature of
this is to illustrate how commission charges and other fees affect the
policy, how much of the premium goes to the salesperson and return for
early surrender at certain dates. After July the information will have
to be even more specific, relating directly to the customers own
financial circumstances and lifestyle, rather than the insurers'
generic models.

Although easily explained, the process of introducing these features
has been taxing the industry throughout 1994, and has resulted in
revamping of products and restructuring of salesforces and the way
these and independent financial advisers are paid. With comparative
tables likely to become widely available, enabling customers to shop
around for competitive products, companies have been forced to address
not only the question of front-end loading but the nature of commission
payments themselves.

They have also been forced to take a hard look at the types of products
on offer. During the final months of 1994, Allied Dunbar, the
Prudential and Clerical Medical all launched flexible life and savings
schemes. Allied Dunbar, one of the country's leading pensions
suppliers, went so far as to withdraw its product range and replace it
with a smaller selection of new products. Other insurers are expected
to follow this shake-up as they struggle to cope with changing customer
needs.

New style policies reflect the changing labour market which
increasingly relies on short-term contracts. The concept of a job for
life is becoming rarer. Essentially the change means that, for the
industry, the standard sale now longer exists.

Potentially the greatest threat stemming from disclosure is that public
reaction to the charges will result in a switch entirely away from life
and pensions products. Research conducted by consultants National
Economic Research Associates (NERA) forecasts that sales will drop by
10 percent following the introduction of disclosure.

Last year's public reaction to concern over mis-selling was to stop
buying, a public vote of no confidence which hit profits and share
values. There is little to suggest that providing more information will
prevent the same thing happening again.

Within a smaller market, public awareness of costs will force companies
to cut costs further, with a resulting squeeze on profitability. But
these cuts are likely to be achieved through greater use of technology,
particularly EDI systems, and a squeezing out of less competitive
players on both sides of the selling line. Behind the factfinds and
reams of new customer- friendly information is the knowledge that
commission levels remain largely unchanged - only the way they are paid
has been altered.

Commissions paid during 1992 are estimated at #2.5 billion ($3.96
billion or half the total cost of winning new business in that year.
According to NERA, the disclosure shake-up will cut industry costs by
#800 million. Part of the commission bill will be cut by smaller
salesforces, but commission levels are not falling.

How commission is taken has become as flexible as the new-style
policies. How much a product will cost in future and how much it will
generate for company and salesperson will depend on the agreement
between the company and the seller. It will reflect the complexity of
the product and a willingness to buy add-ons.

At Standard Life, commission levels to Independent Financial Advisers
(IFAs) are being maintained, although surrender values are also being
increased. In this case, the company is financing the initial costs
itself, deducting them over the life of the entire policy. IFAs are
being allowed to pick and choose between level commission, indemnity
commission or any combination of the two. If they decide to rebate
commission this will not cause problems.

Clerical Medical, which distributes its products through IFAs, is
committed to protecting its salesforce, and has introduced a complete
range of flexible products and commission structures. "We believe that
our commission flexibility options meet the majority of IFA's
requirements," says Mike Elcock, Clerical Medical's disclosure product
manager.

"Once the new regime is in place and IFAs can measure the impact of
these changes on their business, we will need to review our initial
arrangements to ensure that IFAs get the help and service they need to
operate efficiently and effectively."

While the possible initial reaction may be to drive some customers away
from the market, the impact on the shape of that market in the long-
term is not limited to 10 percent of business. Bacon & Woodrow
forecasts that the number of companies operating in the market will
drop by 40 percent by the end of the decade, as price competition
forces them out. Changes in the IFA market are expected to arrive far
more quickly, as many move to become member of larger networks.

"We're likely to see growth in networks, with perhaps fewer, bigger
networks," predicts Geoff Show, life and pensions financial controller
at Norwich Union, which draws heavily on the IFA sector for its sales.
The advantage to the customer of larger networks will be that greater
size and income means that "they will be able to offer more talent,
research and skills", providing a competitive edge to smaller firms.
"IFAs will be able to decide how best to present commission charges,"
according to scales of commission previously registered with Norwich
Union, and ask for a quotation as they feel appropriate.

The IFA's key sales point - the independence to choose products from
across the entire market - should also provide them with an advantage,
providing the service matches the cost.

Switching to operating on a fee-only basis appears a strong
possibility, although customers are being warned that depending on the
complexity of the work accumulated hourly fees could outweigh
commission charges unless a substantial portfolio is involved. Tony
Shepherd, chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning (IFP),
comments: "Typically, most members of the IFP register charge between
#75 and #125. If any adviser is charging more than #150 per hour, there
needs to be a good reason for it."

The dilemma facing many IFAs as well as members of direct salesforces
therefore is not whether commissions will drop, because sufficient
structures have been put in place to protect this, but whether they
will see commissions at all. Pressure will fall this year on the IFA
sector where competition on pricing will force many into networks or
out of business altogether. Direct salesforces felt the first pain of
disclosure last year.

Banks, building societies and insurers forced to withdraw salesforces
for retraining took the opportunity to reduce them in size at the same
time and switch them from commission-only to salaried status.

In its annual survey of industry employment, the Life Insurance
Marketing and Research Association (LIMRA) reported that the industry
salesforce declined by one-sixth in the first nine months of 1994. For
every six salespeople at the beginning of the year, there were five by
October. Its findings suggest that the trend will continue downwards.

Leavers are not being replaced on a one-for-one basis and recruitment
is far more stringent. "What we are seeing is a steady upgrading of the
quality of the salesforce," comments Frank Fletcher, LIMRA Europe's
research director. "Companies are being increasingly selective in the
people they retain and even more selective in the quality of people
they take on."

Although it doesn't anticipate heavy job cuts, Midland Bank has taken
the decision to integrate its 850-strong life and pensions salesforce
into its branch network (see page 6), which will bring about economies
of scale.

It is impossible to judge how the public will react to the increased
amount of information which the industry has so assiduously provided,
but undoubtedly perceived value for money will be an important sales
factor.

Research undertaken for consulting group Merchants indicates that
consumers are increasingly proactive when it comes to purchasing
products, indicating that the industry adage that products are "sold
rather than bought" is a false one.

Up to two-thirds of customers approach companies to make a purchase, a
factor which demolishes many arguments that an established sales
relationship will generate more business. The highly stable market of
recent years has meant that "the nuances and foibles of consumers have
often been shielded from the life assurance companies by intermediary
salesforces", Merchants concludes.

In the survey, only 22 percent said that commission levels are a "very
important" factor when choosing a product, although overall value for
money is an important factor. As a result, consumers may use the new
disclosure information to take a longer-term view of their investment
choice, rather than leaping at the lowest commission figure. "The
companies which are most likely to suffer a consumer reaction . . . are
those with uncompetitive charges or return on investment record - not
those companies which operate high commission channels," says
Merchants. Soft factors, such as speed and accuracy of response, and a
complete answer to queries, also rate highly, indicating that attention
to pricing and good service will help companies build their competitive
advantage.

For the increasing numbers of customers familiar with purchasing
financial services over the telephone, direct sales of life and
pensions products will offer an attractive low-cost high-service
package. In addition to established direct writers such as Direct Line,
1995 has seen the news that entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group
will be launching a direct life and pensions company, Virgin Direct
(see page 5). A spokesman for Virgin said that the new company will
beat all traditional suppliers of pensions and life cover on price and
costs.

Norwich Union, which is joint, equal partner in the operation,
providing third-party administration and fund management expertise,
will in return benefit from connections with an organisation built on
strong service-led principles and affordable products. It should also
be borne in mind that Branson has assiduously avoided getting involved
in any business which would damage the Virgin brand, indicating that he
will avoid the structures which have hampered and harmed the rest of
the life industry.

Virgin's low-cost approach will be followed by that of another trusted
UK brand, Marks & Spencer. Its concept of reliable quality at slightly
above average pricing is likely to prove a success in this sector as it
has in others. It has an extensive network of shops in the UK, which is
also growing worldwide. Like Virgin, and perhaps unlike the industry,
it too is strong on brand protection.

Disclosure represents a major step change which will alter the face of
the industry. Its supposed new transparency which will be of such
benefit to the consumer is largely cosmetic compared with the knock-on
effect for the industry itself. For well-known new entrants, like Marks
& Spencer, disclosure offers an opportunity and a shock as it enters
the only industry which legally has to admit by how much a product is
marked-up between wholesale and retail price.

PRUDENTIAL MOVES INTO THAILAND

PRUDENTIAL CORPORATION of the UK has broken into Thailand, buying a
24.99 percent stake in a small local insurance company, Thai Sethakit
Life Assurance PLC (TS Life), at a cost of some #13 million ($20.2
million). Prudential is acting through a joint- venture company Staple,
set up with local businessman, Roan Asvinvichit and other affiliates.
It plans to bid for the remaining shares of TS Life in a tender offer
through Staple. Thai insurance law prohibits foreign entities from
owning more than 25 percent of a Thai insurance company.

Eventually, Asvinvichit will acquire between 15 percent and 20 percent
of TS Life, while the rest will go to minority shareholders, predicted
sources at advisers Peregrine and Morgan Grenfell. The tender offer,
priced at Baht 65 ($2.59) per share, will be made in February.

Prudential may give a new lease of life to languishing TS Life. It may
also provide competition for American International Assurance (AIA),
the only wholly-owned foreign entity of the 12 life companies operating
in the country.

Thailand has some 6 million life insurance policyholders, with total
premium for 1994 forecast to reach Baht 37 billion. Thai insurers have
teamed up to combat the threat posed by AIA, which has carved out a
market share estimated at 58 percent of the total life premiums and 20
percent of policyholders. Last year, AIA quit the Thai Life Assurance
Association, citing irreconcilable differences with the members.

Most recently, Thai insurers have charged that AIA infringed Thai
insurance law by opening offices outside Bangkok, the capital. Overseas
insurance companies are restricted from conducting their insurance
business outside the capital city, but AIA contends that the offices
have no relation to its insurance operations, are not connected to the
activities of the Bangkok head office and do not contribute financially
to it.

AIA has established a superior branding image, backed up by a more
efficient organisation and an aggressive salesforce.

To boost efficiency, domestic companies have agreed not to poach sales
staff from each other. The association is committed to spending up to
Baht 1 million in training and has roped in US- based Life Insurance
Management and Research Association (LIMRA) to assist.

Soontorn Boonsai, president of the association and Ayudhya Life
Assurance plc, said that all these measures cannot ensure that local
companies will be able to compete effectively with AIA.

POLAND:  TAX ON COMMISSION STARTS ROW

THE JANUARY 16 introduction of 22 percent VAT (value added tax) on
commissions of Polish insurance brokers and agents has stirred the
Association of Insurance Brokers to write a letter of protest to the
Ministry of Finance.

Chairman Leon Kozicki, objects to the tax largely because insurance
companies are exempt. It is too early for such a tax as brokers have
not yet reached full profitability," he said. Brokers have been
operating in Poland for two to three years. "This is a three-pronged
problem," argued Grace Zrodlowski-Kabat, managing director of Sedgwick
Poland."A new developing industry is being curbed; the move is
inconsistent with EC law on VAT registration; and it will stifle the
entire insurance market."

Polish insurance premiums are not subject to VAT, and the question
arises now as to whether they will have to go up to compensate.

CU GETS PAKISTAN PERMIT

COMMERCIAL UNION (CU), the UK's largest composite insurer, has been
granted permission to write life business in the newly- opened Pakistan
market.

CU is the largest non-life foreign insurer in Pakistan and has been
keen to get a life licence since the market, nationalised in 1972, was
opened up to local life insurers in 1991, Steve Corfield, life
development manager in CU's overseas division, told LII.

It is the second foreign life insurer to win entry - in May last year,
American International Group, the largest international US insurer, was
granted initial permission to set up a life company.

"We still have plenty of work to do as the penetration of life
insurance is very low," Corfield said. Only 2 million people, out of a
population of 120 million, have life insurance cover."We will now go
into a stage of developing our infrastructure for a life operation,
working on product development, systems and so on," he said.

Corfield said CU expects to build its own distribution network as the
state company has a substantial tied agency force .

The company also hopes to build on its non-life contacts - it has a 5
percent market share, with approximate net written premiums of 160
million rupees ($5.2 million) last year.

AIG WINS RUSSIAN LICENCE

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL Group (AIG), the US's leading international
insurer, has become the first American insurer to receive a licence to
operate a sizeable partnership business in Russia.

AIG's Russian partners are Moscow-based Stolichny Bank of Savings and
the recently-formed, joint-stock company Garant- Invest.

The new company, RUS AIG, will be managed by AIG, which capitalised the
$3 million venture. AIG's central European senior executive Bengt
Westergren, will chair the board. Russian insurance expert, Andrei
Saznov, will act as general manager in Moscow.

RUS AIG, which will open in St Petersburg later this year, will offer
individual health, travel and motor insurance, as well as commercial
insurance.

Russian partner, Garant-Invest, was formed in September 1992 to provide
financial and investment services. Stolichny Bank of Savings is one of
Russia's largest retail and commercial banks, with 30 branches - it
also has the Federation's largest network of automated cash dispensers.

VIRGIN CHALLENGES `NEANDERTHAL' INSURERS

AFTER REVOLUTIONISING the airline industry and taking Coca-Cola head-
on, entrepreneur Richard Branson is to tackle the UK's "Neanderthal"
financial services industry.

Virgin Direct, a joint venture between Virgin Group and Norwich Union,
will begin selling its first product, a no-fee Personal Equity Plan
(PEP), at the end of February.

Virgin aims to be a niche player in the life and pensions market, with
no intention of becoming "a mainstream direct banker", according to
spokesman Will Whitehorn. He stressed that the company would "like to
be a major player in a non- essential market".

Virgin targets niche markets for non-essential products, placing its
emphasis on bettering rival services at a lower price. Operating a
direct telesales service is an astute move on cost grounds and this,
combined with Virgin's service reputation and strong brand, will
attract custom - as will Richard Branson's image for challenging the
status quo. The group claims that there are 18 million Britons working
without pensions provisions.

Norwich Union is providing fund management and third-party
administration for the 50:50 joint venture, with the Virgin fund being
managed exclusive of Norwich Union business.

Speculation has surrounded Norwich Union's recent research into the
direct market - despite its widely stated commitment to the broker and
Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) market.

Before Christmas, the insurer said it was keeping up to date on
developments in the direct market. Once news of the Virgin joint
venture broke on January 1, a Norwich Union spokesman said that the
launch does not rule out further direct ventures, but at the same time
said the company remains "committed to the intermediary market".

Initially, telesales staff will operate from Norwich. The product
range, designed to Virgin's specifications, will roll out over the next
year to provide four or five cost-effective products, including a
single premium life and pensions product and a unit trust.

The inclusion of a flexible life and pension policy suggests that
Virgin has spotted this niche quicker than established insurers who are
only just beginning to design products which reflect today's flexible
employment market.

Virgin earlier rebuffed several approaches to bring its high- service,
low-cost approach to the financial services market, but a combination
of 1994's pensions scandal and the disclosure regime had suggested an
opening in the market for Virgin, Whitehorn said.

"This highlighted the expensive, Neanderthal selling structure of the
industry, while disclosure represents a major regulatory change which
breaks down barriers to entry. There was obviously an opportunity for a
`green field' operation to dramatically reduce costs across the
market."

LIFE COMPANIES EXPLOIT DIRECT LEADS

UK LIFE companies are using rival direct insurers to drum up sales
leads. Standard Life, which generates most of its life and pensions
business through independent financial advisers, has confirmed its
links with direct writer, Churchill Insurance.

Churchill, with 600,000 policyholders the UK's second-largest house and
motor direct writer after Direct Line, is acting as an introducer for
Standard Life. The direct insurer follows up sales leads from customers
who have requested further financial services information on publicity
and proposal forms. Telesales staff explain different products and
arrange an appointment with a Standard Life salesperson - although in
some cases they complete sales of products such as term assurance.

In addition to contributing towards the training of Churchill telesales
staff, Standard Life pays Churchill commission on sales generated.

The arrangement is not the only one of its kind. Sun Life uses
Prospero, the direct arm of Provincial insurance, to generate leads,
while Admiral, the Lloyd's of London direct insurer, was an appointed
representative of Scottish Amicable until the middle of 1994.

A spokesman for the Scottish Life house said that Admiral had
investigated whether it was possible to"cold-sell term assurance
products". Admiral is now pressing ahead with its own direct life
insurer.

HALIFAX SETS DIRECT TARGET

HALIFAX BUILDING Society plans to move into direct life and general
insurance sales if a proposed direct personal banking service takes
off, according to general manager David Gilchrist. Both developments
partly depend on whether the planned merger between the UK's biggest
building society and Leeds Permanent goes ahead.

Gilchrist said that both societies are interested in telephone banking,
and providing this service as a merged operation would reduce the
expense. Developing this to offer classes of insurance is also a
possibility, he said.

The two societies announced merger plans in November 1994. Should they
gain the support of members, they would then convert to a PLC (public
limited company) to become the country's third- largest bank.

Failure would not preclude developing the service: both societies have
fledgling life insurance arms (Halifax launched its company on January
9), and, following changes to the Building Societies Act, are able to
write housing-related general business.

Bradford & Bingley has announced plans to launch a telephone mortgage
service in spring. It will target borrowers with substantial equity
with an exclusive discounted mortgage, unavailable through its branch
network.

ZURICH SCORES ALLFINANZ COUP IN ITALIAN MARKET

ZURICH INSURANCE'S Italian branch office is to establish a life company
in conjunction with Banco di Napoli, Italy's sixth- largest bank.

The new company will sell its products at over 800 Banco di Napoli
branches. It has yet to get a licence, but should be operational by
autumn, according to Peter Schenker, Zurich senior vice-president for
Southern Europe.

Zurich will sell simple life products through the bank branches, he
said."As there is still a legal barrier in Italy, preventing banks from
selling products for which advice is necessary, it is only possible to
sell standard products."

The insurer already had some local co-operation agreements in Italy but
was keen to develop a countrywide distribution network - Banco di
Napoli was the last of the top eight Italian banks without an allfinanz
link.

Zurich, with a network of about 600 agents, is a small player on the
Italian life market - last year's estimated premiums written of L260
billion ($159.6 million) represents a market share of about 1.5 percent
- and Schenker said the company hopes the new agreement will help it to
break into the top ten life insurers. The market leaders, Generali, RAS
and INA, have market shares of 10 percent-15 percent.

SWEDEN:  TRYGG-HANSA PLANS BANK

TRYGG-HANSA, the leading Swedish life insurer, has received a banking
licence and is to open a niche bank focusing on deposits and individual
pension-savings products. Trygg-Banken, which will open in the second
quarter of 1995, will target Trygg-Hansa's 1.7 million policyholders.

Lars Thunell, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, noted that the move will
allow the company to operate on the same terms as other Swedish
insurers. Rival insurer Skandia, with 1.5 million policyholders,
launched SkandiaBanken on October 3 1994 (see LII 64).

Skandia created the bank both to expand its product range to include
deposit accounts and other standardised banking products and to allow
it to offer higher rates to its pensions customers.

AUSTRIA:  DIE ERSTE LAUNCHES FUND-LINKED PRODUCT

DIE ERSTE Osterreichische Sparkasse, the fourth-largest Austrian bank,
has become the first bank to introduce a fund-linked insurance product
on to the market. The launch in December, was in conjunction with
German insurer Nurnberger Lebensversicherung.

The bank's insurance subsidiary, Versicherungs Makler Gesellschaft,
will manage the product - the insurer already offers traditional life
insurance and some general insurance products and 99 percent of its
business is with individuals.

Die Erste's 240 outlets will be used as the distribution channel,
according to Anton Freitag, Die Erste's head of market segmentation.
The development of fund-linked insurance products in Austria will, he
predicts, be similar to that in Germany. Freitag envisages that it will
be a niche product.

Nurnberger Lebensversicherung AG is the biggest provider of fund-
linked insurance products on the German market.

UNITED KINGDOM:  MIDLAND REVAMPS SALESFORCE

MIDLAND BANK, the UK's third-largest, is integrating its 850- strong
life insurance and pensions salesforce into its network of 1,740 bank
branches.

Midland is retraining staff to meet the new rules on product and
commission disclosure which came into effect on January 1 (see pages 10-
11).

The bank recently revamped life, pension and investment business and
claims that it is going beyond the regulations by including commission
disclosure on life and non-life regulated products and client-specific
illustrations. Midland investors will be informed about surrender and
maturity values and the effect of charges.

Midland has also made unit trusts and PEPs more competitive, reducing
the initial charge from 6 percent to 4 percent, and halving the minimum
regular savings contribution from #100 to #150 ($155.35-$233).

At the same time, Midland has introduced a new payment structure for
its salesforce, based on a considerably higher salary compared with
commission.

POLAND:  WARTA AND PKO LINK UP

WARTA, POLAND'S second-largest insurer, is to create a life insurance
company with the state-owned bank PKO BP. Both will hold a 40 percent
stake in the new company, Warta-Vita.

Warta-Vita intends to compete with Panstowy Zaklad Ubezpiecen (PZU),
which controls 95 per cent of the market and concentrates on group
insurance.

Warta-Vita will emphasise"western-type" individual products, said
Warta's Olga Doan, who has been involved in planning the venture for
three years and will be on the board of directors of Warta- Vita. It
will also introduce one new group product.

Fund-linked insurance products are a definite consideration for the
future - Thomas Klaricki, director of banking investment at PKO BPK,
noted that the bank should have important input in fund management.

Klaricki believes the venture will influence product design to suit
customer needs. Allfinanz is not a new notion for PKO BP, which before
the war offered life insurance products to its customers.

Products will be distributed through Warta insurance agents and the 800
branch network of PKO BP. Warta-Vita has applied for its licence and
expects to start operating in April.

AIG LINKS WITH ITALIAN UNION

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL Group (AIG) has teamed up with an Italian trade
union, Cisi, to access the growing demand for private pensions and
insurance cover in the market. Unionvita, owned 51 percent by the trade
union and 49 percent by Alico, AIG's Italian life subsidiary, was
authorised at end-December - its management will come from the American
insurer.

Guido Laudini, Unionvita managing director, said the joint venture
should be highly beneficial to both parties. "Alico does not have a
sales network or any existing agreements so we were keen to fill the
gap," he said.

"In many ways the venture will be similar to a bancassurance link, with
upfront costs reduced to the minimum and a large captive market to
which the requisite products can be offered."

Cisi was keen to find an international partner, Laudini said. "They
preferred a foreign company because a similar link-up with an Italian
operator would find itself competing with the partners existing sales
network."

The union has 4 million members and already operates a consultancy
service for pensions, insurance and fiscal matters -
 also available to non-union members.

"Italy is significantly underinsured as a country," Laudini noted."In
1992, only 0.8 per cent of Italian GDP went on life insurance premiums
so the prospects for growth are very good. In addition, the range of
products is likely to expand because most life insurance is still used
as a saving instrument rather than as cover against a person's death."

BERLUSCONI GROUP SEEKS BANKING STATUS

PROGRAMME ITALIA, the Italian financial services group which owns one
of Italy's leading life operators, Mediolanum Vita, has decided to
restructure and seek banking status. The ownership of the group is also
under discussion.

Managing director, Ennio Doris, has expressed a desire to acquire a
majority stake from Fininvest and the outgoing Italian prime minister,
Silvio Berlusconi, with whom he started the company in 1982.

The decision to convert to a bank, according to Doris, is "a natural
evolutionary step to exploit the company's expertise in various sectors
of the Italian financial services market". As a bank, he pointed out,
Programme Italia will be in a better position to focus on core
businesses and to widen the range of products and services.

Programme Italia will not open banking branches for its clientele,
preferring to operate almost exclusively through its extensive sales
network - the current 2,000 consultants will be increased to 3,000 by
the time the bank is launched in 1996.

Mediolanum Vita, Italy's sixth-largest life company, saw its premium
income rise by more than 30 percent to L552 billion ($338.8 million) in
the first ten months of 1994. Sales of Programme Italia's 15 mutual
funds increased by more than 40 percent over the same period and the
group's total turnover grew by 27 percent to l,909 billion.

Doris said it is likely that there will be a reorganisation of the
group and this will affect the shareholding structure. "I am ready to
take the leading role in the company if that is the result," he
said."If necessary, I will look for partners to help finance an
eventual acquisition."

BELGIAN POST OFFICE SEEKS PARTNER

THE BELGIAN post office, De Postcheque, is planning to distribute
products such as insurance, mortgages and loans through its post office
network and has narrowed the choice of candidates down to the last few.

In late 1994, De Postcheque invited 260 financial companies in Belgium
to tender. Among the final contenders are Belgian insurer Royale Belge
and ING, the Dutch allfinanz group, which recently decided to develop
its international allfinanz operations (see LII 64), according to
Freddie Weyers, project manager at De Postcheque.

ING Group has a 100 percent-owned subsidiary, Postbank, which sells
products through the Dutch post office and "would like to apply this
experience elsewhere", according to a company spokesman. The
conglomerate already has a life office in Belgium, La Patriotique,
offering financial services including insurance.

De Postcheque is prohibited by law from acting as a bank,"so if we want
to offer more sophisticated products to our customers, we must enter
into a partnership", said Weyers.

De Postcheque has between 1,700 and 1,800 offices throughout Belgium.
If it enters into a co-operation with a financial group, such as ING,
it is only permitted by law to have that one partner. It can, however,
have as many insurance partners as it wants.

AMB AND AGF PULL CLOSER

AACHENER UND Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest
insurer, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the second-largest
composite insurer in France, are pulling closer together.

AMB, which currently holds 2.57 percent of AGF's share capital, will
increase its holding to 5 percent on or before June 30 1995. In future,
a representative from AMB will be entitled to attend meetings of AGF's
administrative council. AGF must maintain its stake in AMB at 33.55
percent until December 31 1999. In the first half of 1994 this stake
contributed Fr106 million ($19.72 million) to AGF's net earnings,
almost twice the amount recorded the previous year.

A working group of experts from both companies is being formed to
define and develop areas of co-operation. AMB is keen to look at AGF's
experience with market segmentation, while AGF is interested in AMB's
direct selling knowledge, gained through its associate direct insurer
COSMOS.

On an international level, AMB and AGF will be formulating combined
strategies, although it is not yet clear what form these strategies
will take.

AMB has set up a building society in Strasburg and this is a business
area AGF may develop in France.

ALLIANZ, BERNER TO CO-OPERATE

ALLIANZ, EUROPE's largest insurer has sealed a co-operation agreement
with Berner Insurance of Switzerland, in which it bought a 31.5 percent
stake last year, giving it a sizeable foothold on the Swiss market.

The essence of the Berner agreement is exchange of information, Allianz
spokesman Emilio Galli-Zugaro told LII. Gerhardt Rupprecht, Allianz
board member, is in charge of know-how transfers within the group and
Berner will participate in working committees focused on the European
market.

"On the investment side, they can be part of our financial committees,
deciding where to allocate resources, investment etcetera," Galli-
Zugaro said. "International investment know-how is not as big at
Berner." Information exchange will extend across the board - in
electronic data processing, for example, the Allianz sales force in
Germany is equipped with lap- top computers and this could be a
possibility for Switzerland.

On the product side, Galli-Zugaro argued that the potential for
innovation may not be huge. Fund-linked products are already available
in Germany but are not popular, he pointed out.  "We would be ready to
launch them tomorrow - we have our own investment management, but we
don't want gimmicks." Information exchange on mortality and actuarial
tables will be important.

The companies will be looking at all processes. Berner has been
carrying out a cost-cutting programme in recent years and this will
continue.

NEW YORK AND ST. JAMES CAPITAL LINK

NEW YORK Life Worldwide Holding, a subsidiary of New York Life
Insurance Company, has announced the formation of a new company with UK-
based, St. James Place Capital (SJPC), to pursue its UK acquisition
strategy.

The company, Life Assurance Holding Corporation (LAHC), will be
capitalised at $100 million, with New York Life Worldwide and SJPC each
contributing $31.25 million.

Capital commitments have also been made by financial institutions such
as Chase Investment Bank, PosTel, Scottish Amicable, Invesco, and John
Rothschild Assurance Holdings. "LAHC is designed to help us participate
in the consolidation which is taking place in the UK life market," said
William Mowat, executive vice president and chief financial officer of
New York Life, who compared the new company to Conseco, a leading buy-
out firm in the US.

One of the largest life insurance companies in the US, New York Life's
previous UK acquisitions include Windsor Life Assurance Company, in
1989; Gresham Life, in 1992; and US Aetna's UK life business, which it
bought in 1993.

The Windsor Life Assurance Company, sold to LAHC by New York Life (UK)
as part of the transaction, will serve as the LAHC vehicle for life
acquisitions. Windsor's chairman, John Wybrew, will act as chief
executive; SJPC chairman, Sir Mark Weinberg, was appointed chairman;
and William Yelverton, chief executive officer of New York Life
Worldwide, is vice- chairman.

BRADESCO MOVES INTO ARGENTINA

BRAZIL'S LARGEST insurer, Bradesco, has bought a 70 percent stake in La
Rosario Companhia Argentina de Seguros, an inactive Argentinian
insurance company belonging to that country's Roberts allfinanz
conglomerate.

The move is part of a trend started by the economic integration of the
two countries into the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosul), which
came into formal existence on January 1 and also includes Uruguay and
Paraguay.

Already, other major Brazilian players, such as Bamerindus and Sul
America, have set up operations in Buenos Aires, as have multinational
insurance groups, such as AGF and Mapfre, with their Brazilian
subsidiaries managing the operations.

Bradesco's move into Argentina is noteworthy, given the size of the
Brazilian insurer. It has a net worth of $1.5 billion, more than double
the collective net worth of all the 220 companies operating in
Argentina.

Even in Brazil, Bradesco dwarfs the competition - its annual premiums
amount to over $300 million, twice that of the number two on the
market. The Argentinian market had total premiums of about 4.5 billion
in June 1994, some 64 percent the size of the Brazilian market.

The new company will be headquartered in Buenos Aires, with the
operational side run by La Buenos Aires, the largest insurer in the
Roberts Group.

CZECHS SLATE NEW PENSION PROPOSALS

CZECH TRADE unions staged a 15-minute national strike on December 21,
the first since the 1989 revolution, protesting against a pensions
reform bill recently submitted to Parliament.

Pension fund management has become a boom industry in the Czech
Republic, especially for banks, but it's a bone of contention for
unions and pensioners opposed to reforms which also affect the health
industry.

Unions and pensioners are concerned that the bill gives the government
powers to alter pension rates without indexation and to raise the
pensionable age for men to 65 years. Men currently retire at age 60 and
women from age 54 to 57, depending on the number of their children.

The basic pension is around half of the worker's previous salary, but
with monthly salaries averaging only CK7,000 ($200), 62 percent of all
pensioners complain they cannot cope, according to a poll by the
Chamber of Trade Unions. Of these, more than half supplement their
pensions from their savings, according to the poll.

The debate has helped boost the profile of newly-formed private
pensions and fund managers claim demand has been strong among the few
workers to be offered the schemes to date. Most schemes are run by
Czech banks and other institutions with large employee or client bases.
Since October, when private pension funds were first allowed to
operate, 21 licences have been granted and a further 23 applications
are pending.

Many leading funds are run as joint ventures, often between a bank and
one or more financial specialists such as insurance companies, although
notable stand-alone operations include those of Komercni Banka and
Winterthur Life (see LII 65).

Among the largest non-financial firms offering pensions are a group of
construction firms based in Prague (Stavebni penzijni fond) and a joint-
venture between trading companies in Northeast Moravia (Bansky a hutni
penzijni fond Trinec).

Minimum capital is CK20 million, but Penzijni fond Ceske Pojistovna,
run by the Czech Insurance Company, has the largest base capital at
CK90 million. Pension funds can offer products including standard
retirement incomes, disability and inheritable pensions and lump-sum
contributions.

Employees select their own fund and manage their own contributions.
Employers may supplement payments, but are not required to. The
government is offering supplementary payments, depending on the
employee contribution.

All pension funds must be open to all Czech citizens and are restricted
to conservative investments, including government securities, property
and blue chip shares listed on the Prague Stock Exchange. The law also
requires 85 per cent of funds to be distributed and a further 5 per
cent to be held as reserves.

Some funds are offering rates of return of up to 10 percent - recalling
the feverish competition between investment privatisation funds which
bid one another up until they were offering rates of return which
failed to materialise.

BRITISH GOVERNMENT MAKES FRESH PENSIONS MOVE

PROMPTED BY recent high-profile cases of plundering of company pension
schemes, the UK government has placed new pensions legislation before
Parliament.

It proposes a new regulatory authority far larger than that anticipated
in an earlier White Paper. With 200 staff and a seven-member
controlling panel, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority
(OPRA) will be bigger than the financial services watchdog, the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB).

The bill includes many of the findings of the Goode Committee, which
recommended widespread change to pensions legislation to prevent cases
such as that of the Maxwell Pension Fund, which was raided by chairman
Robert Maxwell prior to his death three years ago (see LII 64). It also
equalises pensions ages for men and women at 65.

Among the changes are index-linking of pensions fund benefits to the
Retail Price Index (RPI) or 5 percent a year - whichever is smaller -
and a requirement for minimum solvency standards for pension funds.

The latter has already generated debate. The bill contains no actual
figures and some MPs are concerned that some companies may keep their
funds to the bare minimum and avoid the build-up of large surpluses.

Overall, the cost to the pensions industry of index-linking benefits,
meeting solvency requirements (still to be decided), plus establishing
OPRA has been estimated at #165 million ($256.3 million) a year, plus a
#400 million one-off charge.

UNION TO SUE OVER UK PENSIONS SCANDAL

A UNION representing members who were mis-sold pensions during the
1980s has said that it will not wait for official investigations to be
completed before taking legal action against life and pensions
companies.

Bill Day, National Pensions Officer for the GMB union, which represents
general and municipal employees including teachers and health workers,
said that the union had identified more than 100 cases where
individuals were wrongly advised to opt out of union or company schemes
into personal pensions.

Although the entire UK life and pensions industry is reviewing
potential mis-selling, following the Securities and Investments Board's
(SIB) report that more than 250,000 pensions customers were wrongly
advised, GMB has said that it will not wait until the end of the 18-
month review. "We're not happy with the level of compensation that the
SIB recommends in the review and there is no suggestion of damages,"
said Day. "We want to test it in court."

When the action reaches court, expected to be in several months time,
it will test SIB's approach to the mis-selling scandal and increase the
bad publicity surrounding the industry.

Concerns were expressed in October 1994 that SIB's schedule might
prevent some individuals from taking legal action due to the statute of
limitations. The GMB move may result from such concerns, although a
spokesman would not confirm this.

VITAL, NORWAY'S second-largest insurer, saw some turbulence in early
January. On January 4, the company, which has a 20 percent market
share, asked the Oslo stock exchange to suspend trading in its shares
after the share price was hit by rumours that it was in negotiations
with international insurers.

Vital, which reported a loss of NKr97 million ($14.27 million) for the
third quarter of 1994, compared with a profit of NKr2.3 billion the
previous year, admitted that it was "considering various structural
alternatives, including international options". This is motivated, the
company said, by the internationalisation expected as a result of the
European Economic Area (EEA) and the termination of its co-operation
with Den norske Bank in October last year.

Last year's losses were largely as a result of rising interest rates,
which hit the value of Vital's bond portfolio. Premium income at the
end of the third quarter stood at NKr2.8 billion, up from NKr2.3
billion.

Trading resumed on January 11 - Vital has said that discussions are
closed for the moment and that it will initiate no new talks, although
a spokesman said it would "give all approaches consideration".

PRUDENTIAL MAKES FRAUD PROVISION

PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE Company, the US's biggest life insurer, is
injecting its securities division with $365 million to help buoy it
against the spiralling expense of fraud settlements.

Prudential Securities has cost its parent company $1.6 billion since
1981 through settlements with defrauded investors, many of whom bought
limited partnerships presented as being "safe" but actually high-risk.
So far, Prudential Securities has paid over $650 million to a
restitution fund established by the Justice Department and the
Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). To date, a relatively small
percentage of 56,000 claimants have received total settlements of $397
million. However, reports from law firm Storch & Brenner indicate that
claims total about 152,000 - and growing.

The firm, selected to assist with fund administration, said claims
filed against Pru Securities doubled to almost 3,000 a week, as the
January 10 filing deadline approached.

IRISH LIFE FINED BY LAUTRO

IRISH LIFE has been fined #300,000 by Lautro, the UK life insurance
disciplinary authority, and ordered to pay Lautro's #85,000 costs. The
fine related to charges of: failure to deal satisfactorily with
complaints; failure to adhere to Lautro recruitment requirements for
some appointed sales representatives; inadequate monitoring of company
representatives; and failure to keep proper records. Up to April 1994,
Irish Life UK had also failed to implement a satisfactory training and
competence scheme.

Lautro conceded that Irish Life, Ireland's top life insurer, remedied
these breaches quickly and fully - the life company said it was
disappointed by the reprimand, given this acknowledgement and the fact
that most of the offences were more than 12 months ago.

Of Irish Life's total premium income of more than #800 million, about
#100 million is generated in the UK.

CORPORACION MAPFRE FORECASTING RISE IN PROFITS

CORPORACION MAPFRE, of Spain, is forecasting a rise in consolidated
profits for 1994 of more than 25 percent. The group's life subsidiary,
Mapfre Vida, was the main contributor to profit growth, contributing
about Pta6 billion ($4.48 million).

Mapfre Vida was listed on the Spanish exchange on December 23 1994,
after 1.2 million of its shares - 7.5 percent of share capital - were
placed at a price of Pta4,750 in a public offer exclusive to
shareholders of Corporacion Mapfre, Spain's leading insurer. The issue
was oversubscribed 4.8 times. The proceeds will be used to strengthen
Mapfre's international activities.

TRAVELERS GROUP SPREADING ITS NET

TRAVELERS GROUP has been spreading its net, recruiting the head of a
failed US investment house to two senior positions. Michael Carpenter,
who resigned his chief executive post at the faltering securities firm
of Kidder, Peabody in June, has been named an executive vice president
of business development and strategic planning at Travelers Group. He
will also take responsibility for the life and annuity businesses of
Travelers Insurance.

Carpenter left Kidder, Peabody in the wake of rising interest rates
which were deflating the bond market and an inside trading scandal
which forced Kidder's parent company, General Electric (GE), to reduce
its after-tax earnings by $210 million. Kidder Peabody went on the
auction block earlier this year and will reportedly sell most of its
business to another Wall Street securities firm, PaineWebber.

Carpenter is an interesting choice for the Travelers life post. While
he has no direct experience in insurance, he managed several company
acquisitions and buy-out deals when working for Kidders' parent
company, GE. Travelers does not currently admit to acquisition plans,
but Travelers Group president James Dimon, said the company's life
business is"expected to grow" and Carpenter said he expects "new
opportunities" from industry consolidation.

In his new positions, Carpenter will report to Robert Lipp, chief
executive of the company's insurance division, and to Sanford Weill,
Travelers Group chairman.

Based in New York, Travelers Group is the parent of the Primerica
Financial Services term insurance network, and Travelers Insurance, the
company which recently made headlines when it merged its group health
care business with Metropolitan Life's, creating MetraHealth Companies,
the largest commercial managed health care network in the US, with a
customer base of about 13 million customers (see LII 61).

IMPERIO ALLIES WITH BCP TO BID FOR BPA

IMPERIO, PORTUGAL'S largest insurer, has allied with Banco Commercial
Portugues (BCP), in a bid for the country's second- biggest bank, Banco
Portugues do Atlantico (BPA). BCP made a failed takeover bid for a 34.5
percent stake in the bank last summer.

Imperio already owns the small Banco Mello and sells the bank's
products through its network - a spokesman said that the BPA bid could
be useful in developing the insurer's allfinanz strategy, but no
details were available.

Under the terms of the tender, approved by the Ministry of Finance on
January 12, BCP is offering Esc300 billion ($1.87 billion) for BPA, or
Esc2,730 per share, considerably lower than the Esc3,000 it offered
last year.

BCP would acquire just over 50 percent of BPA's capital and Imperio the
rest of the shares sold off.

With BPA go two smaller banks it controls - Banco Commercial de Macau
and Uniao de Bancos Portugueses - as well as BPA's life insurer, BPA
Vida.

INSURERS SANGUINE ON EU

If Austria's EU membership as of January 1 means tougher competition
for the life insurance market, domestic companies seem unperturbed.
George Hamilton reports from Vienna

AUSTRIA HAS technically been open to outsiders for the past year, under
the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, but no sweeping changes
have occurred. Over two years ago, Austrian life insurers showed no
anxiety over possible competition and nothing has happened to support a
reversal in their laid-back attitude.

Insurance regulations were redrawn last summer to conform to EEA/EU
practice, greatly liberalising the market. Any insurer registered in an
EEA/EU country may offer products in Austria, regardless of whether the
firm has an Austrian subsidiary.

Non-Austrian firms must be approved by the finance ministry's insurance
supervisory authorities before products may be sold. Nor may Austrian
agents legally offer products of non-approved insurers.

If an insurer is not approved, "please don't ask me what happens in the
case of a claim", says one Austrian insurance broker. The registration
is no problem to serious companies and is intended mainly to protect
policy purchasers and proscribe money laundering. About 30 companies
registered outside Austria have filed their intent to sell insurance
within the country - how many of these might offer life policies is not
clear.

While conditions indicate opportunities for companies new to the
Austrian life insurance market, other factors work towards maintaining
the status quo. The market is dominated by a handful of domestic
insurers or the long-established subsidiaries of Italian and German
concerns.

Helping to maintain the situation is a Sch40,000 ($3,600) "special
expense" personal tax deduction, available only against premiums paid
to Austrian insurers. Life policies, whether bought in Austria from a
domestic insurer or purchased outside the country, are subject to a 4
percent insurance tax.

Furthermore, policies written in currencies other than schilling or
Deutschmark carry an exchange rate risk - sterling and even the Ecu,
for example, have plunged against the schilling in recent years.

The threat of competition has resulted in gradual lowering of premiums
and greater policy flexibility on the part of domestic life insurers.
Policyholders in some cases may cancel policies or switch without
penalty between different life types.

New policyholders are able at any point to shift their life insurance
from annual premiums to a paid-up policy, subject to a limit placed on
the minimum paid-in premium under which this option is available.
Policy language has been greatly simplified and footnotes eliminated.

Rates by domestic insurers have been reduced gradually to more closely
meet those of potential competitors and to conform to updated actuarial
tables. Indeed, earlier last year, Wiener Allianz, member of the German
Allianz group, estimated that rates for life policies could drop by as
much as 20 per cent.

The single main factor which continues to reserve the market to
domestic insurers is the conservatism of the public, coupled with the
assumption that the generous government retirement pensions will
continue. The well-established vast network of company-tied local
agents is also a help. Few life insurers could afford to build up the
agent networks which the top half-dozen life insurers operate, each
with some 3,500-4,000 agent-employees.

This cost element admittedly contributes to higher premiums, but the
direct personal service is expected by the insured public. The agents'
cost can be spread over a number of products and services such as
claims adjustment, helping to justify the expense while supporting an
unusually high level of service.

"Austrians have a curious fascination with the subject of death, but
don't talk about it in a direct personal way," contends one observer
writing about the Austrian personality. The observation is verified by
experience of the life insurance industry, which finds it considerably
easier to sell annuities or single-premium term policies than pure life
policies with pay-out upon death.

This fact has led to considerable creativity on the part of insurers in
packaging the more traditional policies as investments rather than
insurance and in developing new products. Single-premium term
insurance, for example, was the industry sales hit last year.

On a direct basis, the local company agent can often sell life policies
in conjunction with other insurance coverage. A term life policy is a
relatively easy add-on for banks when providing personal or home loans -
 this accounts for the high life market share of Wustenrot building
society, for example, where insurance is a secondary but hardly
unimportant product.

Indeed, Austrian insurers are finding banks increasingly important
beyond their own sales networks in selling life policies. There is
cross-ownership between the number one life insurer Wiener Stadtische
Versicherung and the number one bank, Bank Austria.

The same is true of the number two in each category, Generali Leben and
Creditanstalt-Bankverein. The latter not only sells Erste Allgemeine-
Generali products but shares a joint company, CA- Generali, with the
insurer.

The CA tie has become so important to EA-Generali that it worries over
current moves to privatise the bank. German competitor Allianz is
amongst those considering a bid for a shareholding in CA - such a move
presumably would preclude further links between CA and Generali.
Generali has given notice that it would be prepared to increase its
stake in Creditanstalt before going to the expense of recreating the
sales capacity which the present bank connection offers.

Appearances would suggest considerable market potential for life
insurance. Each Austrian allegedly has about $73,000 in savings set
aside in investments of one form or another, generally in savings
accounts, often at minimal interest rates. By tapping some of this
potential, total life insurance written has been growing at an average
cumulative rate of 9 percent-10 percent, with premiums reaching $3.6
billion in 1993. Nonetheless, Gregor Kozak, spokesman for the insurance
industry, notes that "Austrians are not a particularly insurance-
friendly people. Internationally, Austria lies well behind."

No great invasion of new insurers is expected as a result of EEA/EU-
inspired entry liberalisation. As Dietrich Karner, general director of
EA-Generali observes:"The prominent insurance groups are long since
present in Austria and have carved out their market share".

Karner contends that Austria is oversupplied, relative to the number of
insurers already in the market, and that lower rates can be achieved
only at the expense of services which the Austrian policyholder
expects. Given these conditions, market entry is clearly no casual
affair. Even entry via direct mail- order, probably the least expensive
approach, offers limited opportunities.

Well-established leader in health and hospitalisation, Austria-
Collegialitat, tried a broad-brush mail-order sales programme for
health insurance several years ago with only modest success; even at
that, the firm had follow-up capabilities via its rank of agents.
Currently only the German mail-order house, Quelle, offers life
insurance by mail.

The relative complacency of the current group of 35 domestic and
international subsidiary firms offering life insurance in Austria may
be exaggerated - but the market has been fought over long enough and
hard enough that the existing insurers will not yield territory to
newcomers without a good fight.

GATEWAY TO ASIA

Australian life insurers face new challenges of stiffening regulation
and emerging Asian markets. Tess Critzer reports on the issues
preoccupying the industry

THE AUSTRALIAN life insurance market enjoys the singular distinction of
being the only European model market in its region. Ranked eleventh in
the world, it is the third-largest market in the Asia Pacific region,
surpassed in size only by Japan and South Korea.

Companies entering the Australian market, or any of the emerging Asian
markets, must be prepared to look deep and make market and cultural
allowances, argues James Cochrane, managing director of Oceanic
Holdings.

"The British designed the Australian market, and have grown with it,
and Europeans in general are used to adapting to different markets.
American companies, however, have not fared as well here. I think the
reason is that while Australia appears to be very similar to the US,
there are actually important subtle differences, and we have very
entrenched notions of how we go about doing business."

Cochrane points out that the Australian life industry is dominated by
Europeans. "It is a western economy with a consumption per capita
almost identical to the US and it has 17 million consumers. Any
overseas companies moving into the market must first recognise what
those consumers want."

Unlike in the US, both the life and non-life industries are regulated
federally. Currently, there are 41 direct insurers, employing 20,000
people, and five reinsurers, according to the Life Insurance Federation
of Australia (LIFA). About 80 percent of the life business is currently
written by ten of those 41 insurers, 22 of which are Australian-owned.

The three largest direct insurers are mutuals - Australian Mutual
Provident (AMP), the leading company, National Mutual and Colonial
Mutual. Seven of the 41 insurers are bank-owned, and three are
government-owned. Of the foreign insurers, eight are from the US and
six are of UK origin. There is one company each from the Netherlands,
Switzerland and New Zealand, as well as one Belgo-Dutch company and one
UK/Dutch venture.

As of September 1993, Australian life offices held $96 billion in
assets, up 11 percent on the previous year, more than half of which are
controlled by the three large mutuals. Indeed, the ten biggest
companies control more than 80 percent of overall assets. Overseas,
Australian life offices, located primarily in Asia and Europe, hold
assets of about $16 billion.

Career agents have traditionally been used for the distribution of
personal lines, with the industry employing an estimated 8,000 agents.
Many direct insurers, particularly the three market leaders, employ
independent or multi-agents, who sell the products of more than one
company, resulting in a strong, independent market of self-employed
agents.

The industry is facing new regulatory and operating hurdles, Cochrane
points out:

Allfinanz:"In general now in the Australian market, banks are the
winners, particularly since distribution has developed in investment
markets. The largest of these, Bankers Trust, sells investment products
and annuities, and it has the greatest share of retail funds management
in the country.

"Four years ago the three big mutual companies had about 70 percent of
premium income. That's changed now. They still have a good share of the
risk business, but bank-owned companies have undercut them on other
products.

"Banks came into their own in the Australian industry in the late
1970s, then they got into the pension fund market in the 1980s. The
banks did not replicate traditional insurance companies. Rather, they
sought to deliver life products at lower costs, and they found they
could sell insurance investment products, which enjoy preferential tax
treatment.

"Banks have the advantage of generating business through their branch
networks, and they also have access to a great deal of customer
information, so that when a customer walks into a bank and deposits a
cheque, the bank representative can cross- sell that individual,
convincing them to invest their savings in annuities or insurance
bonds.

"Australian banks have very high security, with almost no failures
whatsoever in the country's banking history. However, banks do not
guarantee their insurance products, and customers can lose a percentage
of their money without realising it. I also believe that banks should
issue disclosures of how they're managing their administrative costs.

"We've also seen the emergence of a broker market. Until recently, life
brokers were non-existent in Australia, but certain regulatory changes
have made brokerage attractive. The brokers control the group life
market in our industry, but I don't believe that commercial-strength
groups like brokers will branch out into individual products."

Regulatory Change: "The genesis of Australia's latest round of
regulations stems from the inability of the current regulations to
accommodate the needs of the country's current life products, because
in fact, 60 percent of these products did not exist when the old
regulations were written. For example, the old laws didn't even require
profit/loss statements.

"Within the next two months, a whole new raft of regulations will be
enacted in Australia, affecting company conduct as well as agent and
consumer issues. The regulations for company conduct will be fairly
standard, allowing for the establishment of an actuarial standards
board to oversee corporate control. The big difference is that
directors of life companies will owe primary allegiance to
policyholders, rather than shareholders.

"The regulations relating to agents and consumer issues are more
dynamic. The new rules will revolve around `Needs Analysis', very
similar to the British system. In other words, an insurer will not be
able to sell a policy without a complete analysis of the customer's
needs (unless a customer refuses to give out the information and
thereby signs a release).

"There will of course be a raft of regulation in regard to controlling
sales methodology. Many regulations have been introduced over the past
year and we have rules that prescribe complete illustration of fees,
charges and earnings (the regulator prescribes rates for earnings and
inflation purposes).

"Agent commissions have also been cut back significantly in recent
years, and the general requirement is to move to a flatter commission
scale and thereby lower the front-end load, although no one has yet
devised a method for making up the inevitable income loss.

"New laws will help consumers know what they're buying. For example,
the disclosure laws will help consumers recognise levels of agent bias.
Agent bias usually takes the form of commission, or other methods of
payments and benefits, and this naturally renders the agent biased in
favour of certain products. Now, agents must show their commission
bias, and the company also issues a report in conjunction with policy
issuance, informing the customer how much commission or what benefits
that agent got for selling him the product.

"Another aspect of the new regulatory proposals concerns agent quality.
At the moment, there are no qualifications other than industry
experience. However, some of the current proposals relate to agent
licensing, and movement toward greater education and improved
competency through training. In fact, steps are being taken to
establish a nationwide standard, enforced by training centres, at an
estimated cost of about A$300 (US$229.88 million) per agent.

"A much feared aspect of the new regulations relates to joint and
several liability, designed to make companies responsible for an
agent's underwriting actions. This provision would relate most
specifically to multi-agents - those who represent several companies.
It would require such agents to notify all their employer companies
when applying for a new agency, or when one of their agencies are
cancelled. This law is designed to better protect consumers from
unsuccessful or unscrupulous agents."

Costs and Profitability: "The costs of regulation are variable,
stemming from the nature of the regulation. However, it is often
difficult to balance off consumer interests against production costs.

"For example, the law now prescribes that an insurer's board of
directors must set up a compliance committee comprised of a majority of
outside, non-aligned directors who will certify that the company's
approved materials for market release comply with regulations.
Legislation prescribes that consumers can directly sue the members of
the compliance committee, so those external directors will seek to
protect themselves during their preparation and review of documents.
The result is that everything done today must be checked by a team of
lawyers. So, we turned things like advertising and promotion into
activities which need to be checked by lawyers.

"Likewise, new requirements for customer brochures have made it
virtually impossible to print out total disclosure and illustration
tables on less than 30 pages, which is driving up the costs of
advertising.

"Reduced agent commissions and other agent-related provisions have
resulted in a nearly double-digit reduction of agent numbers, industry-
wide. Many agents saw the market contracting and they got out. The more
experienced agents found renewed enthusiasm for selling risk products,
because there is no commission disclosure on a risk product unless it
has an investment element."

New Markets: Cochrane, like many other Australian life insurers, is
hopeful that Australia may become a regional centre for the
Asia/Pacific countries, along with Singapore and Hong Kong. Australia
offers a viable alternative to Asian bases because it is politically
non-aligned, he argues.

Australia has more than a century-old history of doing business in Asia
- one hundred years ago, four Asian insurers were also operating in
Australia: North China Insurance Company, Shanghai; China Traders
Insurance Company and the Canton Insurance Office, Hong Kong; and The
Straits Insurance Company, Singapore.

Today, only eight non-life Japanese companies represent Asia in
Australia. The tide is flowing the other way, with Asia the chosen area
of expansion for today's Australian insurers, according to Michael
Wansley, chairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's National Insurance
Industry Group.

"Every year sees Australian insurers opening more offices in Asian
countries," says Wansley. The big three mutuals already have
capabilities in countries like Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and
the Philippines, he points out. Already 17 direct insurers based in
Australia have offices in the Asian/Pacific countries: two are in
China; eight in Hong Kong; three in Indonesia; six in Japan; two in
Malaysia; twelve in New Zealand; one in Pakistan; four in the
Philippines; eight in Singapore; two in South Korea; and three in
Taiwan.

The increasingly profitable Asian markets have"scarcely been tapped",
argues a report by LIFA, compiled by specialist writer, Florence Chong.
Australian life insurers have just begun establishing long-term,
mutually profitable relationships throughout the region.

Virtually all the Asian markets are experiencing double-digit growth
and Chong predicts that Asia will become a significant contributor to
Australia's total life revenue by the year 2000.

AMP offers a good illustration of the trend. Although it was the last
Australian company to venture into Asia, AMP estimates that about 80
percent of its income will originate in offshore European and Asian
markets by the end of the decade, as opposed to the current proportion
of 55 percent.

The strongest future growth in Asia will stem from Australia's life
sector, rather than non-life insurance, Chong forecasts. In 1992, for
example, total life insurance premiums (US$283.7 billion) were more
than double those of non-life premiums (US$110.4 billion).

Most Australian insurers in Asia seek long-term ventures with local
partners - a recent example was the agreement between Australia's MLC
Group and PT Asuransi Jiwa Simas Life, a subsidiary of the Indonesian
mega-conglomerate, Sinar Mas.

Asian companies are seeking out foreign partners in order to protect
their market share against other joint venture companies, Chong notes,
arguing that long-term thinking and market adaptation are the key
requirements for achieving success in the region.

The greatest growth potential lies in the Thai, Indonesian and Indian
markets, according to LIFA research. A ten-year growth period for Hong
Kong is predicted, and an ever-increasing demand for investment
products is forecast in Singapore. LIFA warns, however, that the China
market will not be ready for foreign entry for three years, because of
the inadequate legal framework, currently under revision by a drafting
committee.

FRENCH BANKS TURN TRADITIONAL

Allfinanz has transformed the French life market. Jean-Pierre Daniel
international development manager of French research body CREP (Centre
de Recherche sur l'Epargne et le Patrimoine) traces the stages of
development

TWENTY YEARS ago, France was from the insurance point of view a very
"continental" country - very traditional, with few innovations in
products, a widespread front-end commission system and under the firm
control of the state. Most of this has changed in the last few years
and the growing role played by banks in distribution of insurance
personal lines explains many of the changes.

We had an old tradition of bancassurance with the Assurances du Credit
Mutuel (ACM), a subsidiary of the powerful co- operative bank, which
started in 1971 to sell general insurance products through the bank
branches. It started in the Eastern part of France, close to the German
border and gradually extended its network.

Today, ACM is very strong in Alsace and present in most of the
provinces. But strangely, probably because in the first years they
limited their influence to some regions, the Credit Mutuel has not been
considered as a danger - or an example - by the other actors in the
French market.

The origin: Apart from the ACM, bancassurance started in France in the
1960s when banks decided to sell insurance products as add-ons to
banking services. They had three objectives: to improve their relations
with their customers; to protect themselves, for instance in the case
of the borrower's death; and, of course, to earn extra commission.

The most typical product of this period is a death insurance guarantee
which covers a possible deficit on the bank account and is paid to the
surviving spouse if the account is in credit. The premiums are very
small, directly debited from the bank account each month, and the
results are excellent for the bank.

The tax factor: A second phase started in the 1970s when banks decided
to sell financial products under the insurance tax system. The typical
product is a deferred-capital contract, with a duration calculated to
optimise the tax treatment. Today, this is eight years.

Often, the product is a single premium or a scheme where the customer
is totally free to pay additional premiums when he wants to. Of course,
if it's a regular premium contract, premiums are debited monthly from
the bank account.

The offer is based only on: profitability, or rate of interest paid on
the invested capital; flexibility, or freedom to pay additional
premiums or to make withdrawals; and tax advantages under French law.
Nowhere does advertising refer to classical insurance objectives, to
the protection of the family or to pension plans.

These products still exist and, indeed, represent the huge majority of
contracts at present sold by banks - the turnover of French
bancassurers is made up 90 percent of products of this generation.

From a marketing point of view, these products can be classified
according to their target market. For lower-income customers, banks
sell very simple monthly premium contracts, emphasising tax relief and
a guaranteed rate of interest. For medium-range customers, they offer
single premiums or non- compulsory premiums. And, for top-level
customers, they offer very sophisticated financial products, with an
interest rate linked to a stock exchange index, or multi-fund contracts
or contracts with guaranteed results which are very high in comparison
to what the market offers.

Changing traditions: The third stage of bancassurance started in the
1990s. It is not a substitution of one stage by another one - it's an
addition. Banks are still widely distributing deferred- capital
policies but are also selling other products.

On the life side, some subsidiaries of banks have started to sell death
insurance. Individual term insurance is under-developed in France,
mainly because the French over-estimate the protection provided by
Social Security and by the group contracts which result from collective
agreements between workers' unions and employers.

Entering this market, banks have what I would call an accounting
approach. While traditional insurers explained that a good husband and
father had to provide security for his widow and orphans, banks analyse
for the customer the financial consequences of death, aim to minimise
the effects - and remain on the financial field where they have their
legitimacy.

At the same time, banks have reduced medical requirements as much as
possible, trying to avoid delay between the time when the customer
agrees the contract and the point when the medical and administrative
department of the company officially accepts the risk. Often the sums
insured are relatively small and the acceptance of risk is made at a
very low level in the hierarchy of the bank.

The rewards: For the French banks, bancassurance is a very successful
diversification. They are selling new products and they have learned a
new business. They have earned more commission and strengthened their
relations with their customers. They have kept most of their staff -
otherwise technological evolution would have forced them to reduce the
number of employees. Indeed, the French banking industry was foreseen
as "the steel industry of tomorrow".

In France, there has been a serious debate on the profitability of
bancassurance, centring on "cannibalisation". As most of the money
invested by customers in life products was previously held in a bank
account in the same bank, the argument is that bancassurance is non-
productive for the bank.

It's a very interesting theory but it doesn't have any practical
meaning. In truth, a bank had no choice. Because of the mobility of
customers, if a bank had not adopted a bancassurance policy, its
customers would have moved to a competitor.

The market impact: Traditional insurers have not really lost anything
with the emergence of bancassurance. The products banks have sold were
not sold - at least to any great degree - by agents, brokers and direct
salesforces.

And since many customers have not realised that in purchasing one of
the investments offered by banks they have bought an insurance product,
traditional insurers still have an opportunity in the field of pension
plans, for example, where people look more to insurers.

The impact of bancassurance on products has been very important.
Changes in product design largely explain the success of this new form
of distribution: banks were forced to sell very simple contracts
because they had to convince and train their commercial networks before
convincing their customers. Where insurers were at that time selling
endowment policies, mixing savings and family protection, banks have
sold deferred capital and adopted a definitely savings-oriented
attitude.

Even today, although they sell term insurance, they separate protection
and savings. As a consequence of the banks' attitude, endowment
policies have almost disappeared from the French market.

Another effect of bancassurance on new products is that they are now
much cheaper for the buyer. As newcomers to a market, banks had to be
in some way "better" than traditional insurers. At that time the
consumer press, which is very powerful in France, carried a lot of
criticism of the front-end commission system.

The banks, to be different and because it was more suited to their
culture, offered contracts with a low cost for the customer - for
instance a 5 percent charge on each premium, with almost no additional
charges. They have also improved the transparency of the contracts. The
client can very easily see how much of the premium is really invested
in his or her name and how much is eaten up by the company in costs.

A third impact on the product results from banks' use of more financial
technology in insurance products. They have reached a very high level
of sophistication and now the French market offers all the products a
consumer might dream of.

The sale of financial products by banks under the life insurance tax
system has been very successful. Life insurance is now the most popular
investment in France - more than 50 percent of French households'
savings are invested in life products.

An interesting point may be underlined here. The surveys we carry out
at CREP show that the number of French consumers who declare that they
have bought a life insurance policy is relatively flat, at around 34
percent of households. In spite of the tremendous growth of life
insurance turnover - Fr378 billion ($70.3 billion) in 1993, up from
Fr59 billion in 1983 - this figure increases very slowly. Many of the
consumers who buy a life insurance contract in a bank are convinced
that they have made "an investment with tax advantages", but not they
have purchased a life policy.

The reason consumers are so fond of life insurance is that products are
much better and much cheaper than they were 20 years ago. There are
still"bad contracts" on the French market but as a whole quality has
improved.

In 1980, commissions and administrative costs represented 30 percent of
life insurance premiums; in 1993, they represented no more than 11
percent. This reduction is attributable to the entry of banks on to the
market. The banks' costs were lower but, most importantly, traditional
insurers have had to follow the move started by the banks, which acted
then as challengers.

The future: I would suggest two issues which French banks and their
life insurance subsidiaries are facing or may face in the near future.

In an environment of decreasing interest rates, newcomers which have a
more recent portfolio of stocks and shares, are disadvantaged. This is
the position of life insurance subsidiaries compared with traditional
insurers, which have very old and diversified portfolios of financial
assets. This will impact on the profitability of life policies. One may
ask whether the consumer will still prefer the convenience of the bank
network to a better return on investment offered by a traditional
company?

The other question arises from the fact that many consumers have
realised only that they have bought a tax-relief financial product, not
that they have agreed a life insurance policy. What will happen if the
tax system changes? The billions which have so easily switched from a
bank account to a life contract could very easily swing the other way,
switching to another product offered by the bank and leaving the life
insurance subsidiary a skeleton.

This danger explains to a certain extent the desire of some life
subsidiaries to sell products such as term insurance or general
insurance. It is the one way that these subsidiaries can have their
identity recognised by their clients - and by their shareholders.

MARKET BRIEFING

This two part issue of PPG describes policies relating to motorcycles
and uninsured loss recovery (ULR).

Motorcycles

While the market for insuring motorcycles remains fairly limited,
established participants NIG Skandia and Norwich Union have introduced
additional policies with Cornhill Insurance also entering the market.
Norwich Union leads the market with around 300,000 customers accounting
for around two-thirds of policies written.  The recently launched
Norwich Union Direct offers a motorcycle policy and existing
policyholders may see advantages in buying direct in the future.

Premiums fell again last year, reflecting increasing competition as
well as a significant fall in biking accidents.  In 1994, these
totalled 25,100, a reduction of more than half the figure of 65,300
recorded for 1984.  As the number of motorcycles also halved over the
same period, the statistics are not as encouraging as they might
appear.  However, there are signs that insurers are beginning to revise
their view of motorcyclists as high risks, particularly as a new breed
of more mature "enthusiast" motorcyclists is emerging.  The current
premium value of the market is estimated at #150m.

In the wake of Norwich Union's introduction of group-rated cover in
1994, Lombard General followed suit last year, with rates designed for
20 different categories.

Uninsured loss recovery

The ULR policies described are for legal expenses associated with
private motor and marine risks.  They all have to be purchased and in
force before the insured event takes place apart from Motorists Legal
Protection's After the Accident policy.  This is a stand-alone policy
designed for purchase by an accident victim - motorist, cyclist or
pedestrian - following an accident to cover the future legal costs of
pursuing a claim arising from that accident.

Motor ULR insurance is now widely sold in the UK, with most motor
insurers offering their policyholders the chance to add on legal
expenses cover.  Both DAS Legal Expenses Insurance and Cornhill
Insurance have recently produced upgraded versions of their standard
products, while DAS also offers a more basic policy.

Introduction of the conditional fee system in the UK last year,
accompanied by the launch of a conditional fee insurance scheme backed
by the Law Society,  led to some confusion among brokers as to the
continued need for ULR cover.    For #85 premium, the Law Society's
scheme - Accident Line Protect - pays up to #100,000 of costs awarded
against plaintiffs if they lose a personal injury case.  It is arranged
by Johnson & Higgins in association with the insurers' agents Abbey
Legal Protection, and placed with Lexington Insurance, part of AIG.

Motoring Uninsured Loss Recoveries Association (MULRA) chairman Paul
Asplin has responded with assurances that conditional fees will not
make any impact on the desirability or need for ULR cover.  Over 80% of
non-fault motor accidents do not involve personal injury and in such
cases the conditional fee system is not available.  He also pointed out
that, under the conditional fee system, plaintiffs are left to pick up
the costs awarded against them if they fail their case.  He stated
that, with the new conditional fee insurance scheme, plaintiffs might
find that the full amount of damages recovered was swallowed upon in
costs before the insurance cover came into play.

NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEM

Hiscox Underwriting is pioneering a revolutionary system, provided by
the British Geological Survey (BGS), for rating the subsidence risk of
individual properties.  The computerised system - known as the Geo
Hazard Susceptibility Package 2 (GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's
1:10,000-scale geological maps, the most detailed information on geo
hazards available across the UK.  It enables the underwriter to
pinpoint the precise bedrock beneath individual properties, even where
situated close to other properties.

Hiscox says that the system represents a major advance on other current
methods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on the first
three or four digits of a postcode and give only the average risk for
groups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP 2 will
lead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders with
lower risk properties that are currently included within higher risk
postcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to the
underwriter from other insurers.

The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 High
Value House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rate
properties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptible
locally to a wide variety of geo hazards.

RIAS DISCOUNTS

The Retirement Insurance Advisory Service (RIAS) is giving discounts of
up to 15% to customers taking out a joint contents and buildings policy
as part of the RIAS Home Insurance Plan.  David Holden, RIAS general
secretary, said that its research showed that customers who choose to
cover their home contents and structure together under one policy are a
better risk than those who take out separate contents or buildings
cover.  RIAS home insurance policyholders can also add a special Home
Help Benefit to their existing cover for only #1 per month.  This
provides up to #50 per week for eight weeks should the policyholder
accidentally break or fracture a bone.

RATES WARNING

Specialist motor insurer Insurance (GB) warns that changes in
reinsurance rates and the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put
pressure on rates.  Recent legal developments have introduced the use
of actuarial evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a
discount rate linked to the yield of index linked government
securities.  These combined factors will have an enormous impact upon
the claims burden falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the
insurer.

Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and the
Civil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogden
multipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all future
cases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claim
for an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,
Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.

It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a general
increase in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.
Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currently
pleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.
This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns Insurance (GB), as
otherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.

The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase in
insurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in many
reinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in the
future.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue year
will see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior year
claims.

Significant effects are already being shown on quotations for
reinsurance for 1996.  Insurance (GB) concludes that these increases,
coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almost
certainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry early
this year.

WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIME

British motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolen
than drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annual
European Car Crime study by Eagle Star.  The study, compiled from the
latest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, compared
the number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total number
of cars in use.

The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22
cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly double
the level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars per
thousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowest
in Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.
The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three per
thousand cars went missing.

Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.
The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.
In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.

COMBATING CAR "RINGERS"

A Code of Practice for the Disposal of Motor Vehicle Salvage has been
produced by the Association of British Insurers and Lloyd's Motor
Underwriters' Association to help eliminate the practice of "ringing",
whereby the identity of a written-off vehicle is transferred to a
stolen vehicle by criminals.  The Code sets out the steps to be taken
by insurers and salvage dealers in the disposal of vehicles which
cannot be economically or safely repaired.

All total loss vehicles are placed into one of four categories,
depending on the extent of the damage, with the necessary action to be
taken in each case.  Vehicles in Category A are suitable for scrap
only; Category B should be broken for spare parts.  DVLA is notified
and the police are asked to investigate if the vehicle is relicensed or
an application for a registration document made.  Categories C and D
cover vehicles which can be repaired.

COMPUTER TRACING

Absolute Software Corporation, Canada, has introduced CompuTrace TRS,
which it claims is the world's first computer tracing technology and
theft retrieval system.  Absolute Software monitors the location of its
customer's computers using CompuTrace, a software program which is
undetectable once it is loaded onto the hard drive of the computer.
The program takes control of the computer's modem once a week, turns
the modem's speakers off and then secretly dials Absolute Software's
toll-free monitoring centre where the call is logged.

If a computer is lost or stolen, the customer contacts the CompuTrace
Theft Retrieval Centre to report the incident.  Once the theft is
reported, the customer's account is changed to alert status, so that
the call will be traced.  If a thief connects the stolen computer's
modem to a telephone line, when CompuTrace makes its scheduled call,
the Theft Retrieval Centre tracks the call using advanced equipment
that cannot be interfered with by call-blocking methods.

CompuTrace does not disrupt work while it makes a call.  If the modem
is in use or disconnected, the system waits until a telephone line is
open or connected.  It does not show up in the file directory, and will
survive even if the hard disk is formatted.  CompuTrace works with any
DOS or Windows 3.1 based computer as long as it is equipped with a
modem.  Absolute Software will release Windows 95, Macintosh and OS/2
versions of CompuTrace this spring.

ESCALATING MEDICAL COSTS, SKI RESORTS

The cost of having an injury treated in the world's most popular ski
destinations continues to climb rapidly, according to the second annual
study of medical costs by Home & Overseas, specialist travel subsidiary
of Eagle Star.  The study, based on an analysis of claims for medical
expenses submitted by skiers, shows that Britons can expect to pay at
least 10% more than last winter for treatment in their resort - the
second year running that costs have risen at this level.

Topping the table of the most expensive places for medical treatment
are resorts in Switzerland and the USA.  For example, the cost of
treating a damaged knee cartilage, requiring three days in-patient
care, now averages around #4,000 in Switzerland and #6,000 in the US.
Helicopter rescues now cost around #60 for every minute the helicopter
is in the air.  In France and Italy, typical costs for treating a torn
ligament in ski resorts are between #200 and #500 for around an hour's
consultation.

QUADRIPLEGIA AND PARAPLEGIA COVER

Swire Fraser has launched what it claims is a unique personal accident
programme for schools and sports clubs, providing 24 hour cover for
pupils/members for permanent total disablement resulting in
quadriplegia or paraplegia.  This cover can top-up an existing policy
to a total limit of #1m per pupil.

Director Graham Reid said: "The risk of quadriplegia or paraplegia is
of increasing concern to authorities today, where existing policies are
totally inadequate.  This policy now offers a realistic level of
indemnity for sportsmen and women who will, in the main, have their
full life in front of them".  More than seven million people receive
hospital treatment as a result of accidents each year and it is
estimated that of these 1.8m are sports related.

CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 1)

SACRAMENTO - The assembly is in the hands of conservative Republican Curt
Pringle of Garden Grove. The state senate is controlled by a liberal Democrat,
Bill Lockyer of Hayward. There is a very significant election - from a
legislative standpoint -coming up this fall. And so the California workers'
comp insurance lobby is taking a reality check on the chances of any important
bills being passed this year.

The general thinking is that any significant improvements in the system have a
better chance of coming from new or improved regulations that implemented or
should have implemented reforms passed in 1989, 1990 and 1993.

One lobbyist told the Executive,"I don't think public policymakers feel the
need to do any major workers' comp reform. So efforts at improving the
workers' comp system should be viewed as: What can we do? What can enough of
the stakeholders agree to so that they can put something on Wilson's desk?"

Other lobbyists agreed that major reforms are unlikely, but that some cleanup
bills from last year are a possibility. Assemblyman David Knowles,
R-Placerville, has informed the lobby that he is interested in the permanent
partial disability issue and looking at ways to legislatively enact the
American Medical Association guidelines as the impairment rating system.

The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation reportedly is
considering a study on the schedule to determine whether or not it has a major
impact on the cost of workers' comp and whether or not it adequately
compensates the injured worker, says Barry Carmody, president of the
Association of California Insurance Companies.

According to Mark Webb, senior counsel for the Coalition of California
Compensation Companies, the assembly-man's exposure PPD draft, that is making
the rounds, would also make some significant revisions to the med-legal
process. While the measure is gaining support by the day, Webb feels it is
also the type of bill that would likely face difficulty getting passed this
year.

At the top of the list of 1996 legislative goals for the Alliance of American
Insurers happens to be an effort to pass two of their bills from 1995 - AB
1046 and AB 1859.

"What they have in common," says Pete Gorman, assistant vice president of the
Alliance, "is that they reduce the discretionary authority of the Department
of Industrial Relations. One (AB 1046) brings them in under the OAL (Office of
Administrative Law). The other prohibits them from assigning out the lien
service process."

A second top priority item for the Alliance is one that is on everyone's hit
list, effective action on the Tricor v. State Fund case.

"I don't think the bureau's (WCIRB) weighting scheme (frequency based
experience modifications) does it," says Gorman. "It just flies in the face of
every traditional way of developing X-Mods."

Gorman is also leery of a proposal to give the insurance commissioner
administrative authority to review disputes before they went to litigation.

"We don't agree with that approach," he says. "I think it's too bureaucratic.
And the cost-benefit probably isn't there. What we may do...It seems to me to
be much easier just to run a bill that declares legislative intent that
elevates the standard for litigation from one of injury to one of bad faith."

He explains that an aggrieved employer would have to demonstrate that a
workers' comp carrier had taken a certain action in bad faith in order to have
it actionable. As it is now, he says, the employer can say unintentional or
intentional, "we suffered an injury and so therefore we can sue."

Gorman says, "So just raise the bar on where you can sue. That would be a much
better way to do this, because I don't think the legislature ever intended
this consequence of Tricor. They wanted only to give employers access to the
files." A third Alliance legislative goal is an updated medical fee schedule.

"We've already filed a letter saying we think it's going to end up being a
floor instead of a ceiling," Gorman fears. "And for small companies, we're
placed at a disadvantage. We don't have the leverage and the bargaining power
to get it down below that floor, whereas the big companies do."

The American Insurance Association has a list of specific issues on which it
would like to see action taken during 1996. Terry Miller, assistant vice
president, expresses concern over one of the first issues that needs to be
dealt with, the hospital fee schedule proposed by the Division of Workers'
Compensation.

"The AIA says we should postpone it," Miller relates. "We believe there is
currently insufficient information to accurately gauge the impact of the
schedule on workers' comp hospital costs."

Miller also notes that there appears to be no hospital fee schedule anywhere
in the US that is widely supported as THE model.

The AIA is also involved with PPD and the benefits of permanent partial
disability. It is working on a PPD bill but that the effort is in a very
embryonic stage at this point. Miller said that there were several bills on
the subject being floated around for comment.

A third key issue for the AIA is fraud. Miller says that the AIA has been
discussing the subject with the Department of Insurance "because it wants some
fraud legislation." Exactly what it should be, how broad it should be and
whether it should be geared just to workers' comp is still not determined.

Given the possibility of legislative gridlock, Webb of the CCCC sees the
principal focus for the year should be on reviewing all that's been put in
place over the last five years and seeing "what we can do with Casey Young,
Chip Aubrey and Chuck Quackenbush to make at least the best world we can with
what we have to deal with."

It's no surprise that Tricor is on CCCC's list, and Webb says, "We will work
closely with the California Workers' Compensation Institute and see what types
of things can be done to, at least, bring it into sharper focus - what the
courts need to look at in dealing with these types of bad faith lawsuits.."

CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 2)

Webb said that he felt it was significant that the CWCI board in December
decided to "take a step back" on any actions toward Tricor. The question they
had in mind was whether or not there would be any more such suits once the
system had completely shifted to competitive rating. The practices that had
come under fire in Tricor were a phenomenon of the minimum rate law era soon
to be in the dim and distant past.

Webb adds, "At the same time, let's look at ways that insurance cases can be
better made in the courts so that potentially we don't have 12 jurors suddenly
becoming claims managers."

The CCCC plans to present testimony on the permanent disability schedule to
the Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation at its hearing
on January 18 in Los Angeles. The hearing should be a packed house.

Webb says the association will then look at vehicles currently in place,
including Senator Steve Peace's SB 622 which was designed last year to make
the Chula Vista Democrat's 1993 health care organization law more effective.

The CCCC has been working with the California Association of HMOs to invent a
noncontroversial means for implementing managed care in a more effective way.
Webb notes that it's a task that's easier said than done.

"If we have some good treatment guidelines promulgated by the Industrial
Medical Council (and we're able) to combine those with...good utilization data
guidelines already in place, we may be able to get somewhere," Webb reasons.
"And that goes back to saying we need to get 1989, 90 and 93 implemented
before we can come back (to the legislature) and say this doesn't work."

In order to make the HCO process work, there will have to be changes in the
structural flaws - "multiple offerings, the multiple time frame, the ability
to opt out," Webb observes. They make it difficult for a capitated arrangement
to work. "All those are reasons why it has not received much of a response in
the marketplace."

But the point Webb wanted to stress was that there were other medical cost
containment devices that were put in place in 1993, "that aren't there, that
aren't being done right now." Webb says, "That goes back to the IMC and
treatment guidelines which could make managed care work even better under just
30-day control. And we're seeing a lot of managed care marketing using that
30-day control."

The ACIC's Carmody wants to champion a review of regulations. "There are just
too many regulations," says Carmody, "that cost too much money and that don't
provide any additional services to workers, attorneys, insurers or anybody
else." The way to get the ball rolling, he suggests is to get all of the
stakeholders to ask the questions: "Why am I getting this report? Why am I
producing this report? Why do I have to have this report?"

He said you need to take the reporting alone, forgetting the conduct of
business, and evaluate what is really critical and essential, and what is not.
Then you make recommendations to the administration "saying we think these
regulations, these records, this material required by regulation is
unnecessary, and it's a cost-driver. And let the administration make a
decision on whether it wants to repeal the regs or not."

Carmody observes that it doesn't mean the regulations are going to be changed
automatically but it does mean that those being regulated will have the
opportunity to provide their perspective on the value of the regulations.

"The governor basically called for this," Carmody notes. "He called for all
agencies to review their regs. The problem is the agencies do it alone. They
do it in a vacuum, a bureaucratic one in which they decide what is right and
wrong, or what is good and bad for the regulated public."

Carmody emphatically adds, "Frankly, they're not elected. And the public ought
to have some input on whether or not these regulations are needed."

The ACIC president feels there are kindred souls out there who aren't fond of
all the reports they have to fill out and submit to bureaucrats.

"I remember after the '89 and '93 reforms, the moaning from all of the
attorneys about all the paper one has to go through. And all of the reports
that are thrown in the trash can because their workers don't understand them,"
Carmody said. "Perhaps the benefit notices report process is the most
ludicrous of them all. They started out at about 15 and are up to 150 now.
Why? Why!"

AIA, CCCC CONFIRM W/C EXEMPTION FROM 1995'S EXPERT WIITNESS LAW

SACRAMENTO - An opinion by the California Legislative Counsel has put smiles
on the faces of more than just a few members of the workers' comp insurance
community in California.

The Counsel has determined that legislation passed last year does not subject
employers and insurers to additional expert witness fees in cases before the
Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. The legislation, AB 1204, was strongly
opposed by several company trade associations which requested the governor to
veto. He didn't.

Once the measure was chaptered, representatives from the American Insurance
Association and the Coalition of California Compensation Companies jointly
requested that Assemblyman David Knowles (R-Placerville), chairman of the
Assembly Insurance Committee, seek a Counsel clarification on whether the law
resulting from passage of AB 1204 applied to workers' comp.

"This opinion puts to rest any question about the testimony of medical
witnesses in workers' compensation cases," said Terry Miller, AIA assistant
vice president, western region. "It is clear that the director of the Division
of Workers' Compensation has the authority for setting witness fees by
establishing a medical-legal fee schedule."

The Legislative Counsel's opinion specifically states: "The fees for witnesses
providing medical testimony before the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board or
in other workers' compensation proceedings are not affected by the amendments
to Section 1034 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by Chapter 797 of the
Statutes of 1995 (AB 1204)."

Miller explained, "The expert witness fee is exactly the kind of hidden cost
that we sought to eliminate with the 1993 reforms. The insurance industry must
continue working together to ensure that those reforms are fully implemented.
Cooperative efforts, such as confirming the witness fee workers' comp
exemption, will ensure that cost savings for employers are realized."

The AIA and the CCCC have asked Casey Young, administrative director of the
Division of Workers' Compensation, to review current Workers' Compensation
Appeals Board rules regarding witness fees to make certain that they are
consistent with the provisions of Section 5307.6 of the Labor Code, which
authorizes the director to establish the medical-legal fee schedule.

CA-BASED W/C CARRIERS RANKED BY DIRECT LOSS RATIO, 1994 3RD QUARTER

SAN FRANCISCO - The third quarter 1995 workers' comp insurance figures for
California-based carriers, a regular feature in the Executive, are reported on
page 3.

The carriers are ranked according to their direct loss ratios with the highest
at the top of the page, lowest at the bottom. Keep in mind, the figures
represent each company's, or group of companies, total business writings, not
just those for California.

Fremont Indemnity of California, at the request of its management has been
separated from the other members of its group in order to reflect a more
accurate picture. Readers' attention is drawn to a boxed section, Direct
Premium Change, which reflects the percentage change between the current YTD
and previous YTD premiums.

FIRST W/C BILL, SB636, SCHEDULED FOR HEARING

SACRAMENTO - Amid the turmoil of Assembly leadership fight, the second half of
California s 1995-96 biennial legislative session got underway last week, and
the first workers' comp bill, SB 636 by Sen. Raymond Haynes (R-Murietta), is
scheduled for a hearing today, January 8, in the Senate Transportation
Committee.

SB 636 would require a driving school owner who employs one or more driving
instructors to file proof of workers' comp coverage with the Department of
Motor Vehicles. The measure is opposed by the Association of California
Insurance Companies.

A bill supported by the workers' comp insurance community in general, AB 1859
by Assemblywoman Valerie Brown (D-Sonoma), would, if passed and signed,
rescind the Division of Workers' Compensation's exemption from the
Administrative Procedure Act in adopting regulations. It is scheduled and can
be considered at any time for concurrence in senate amendments. The bill is
pending without a date set for action.

COALITION OPENS DOOR TO ALL W/C CARRIERS IN CALIFORNIA

LOS ANGELES - John Pasqualetto, president of Great States Insurance Company,
was reelected chairman of the Coalition of California Compensation Companies
at its fourth annual meeting.

The coalition's board of directors unanimously approved a change in its
by-laws opening membership to all admitted workers' compensation insurance
companies doing business in California.

Commenting on the change in the by-laws, Chairman Pasqualetto said, "We
recognize that the dynamics in both the market and the legislature that led to
the creation of the CCCC have changed dramatically. The new competitive rating
environment has certainly delivered greater volatility and diversity in the
marketplace. We intend to refine our focus in the coming year and work to
support and facilitate the continued transition to open rating."

Stan Braun, president of Pacific Rim Assurance Company, and Mary Lou Misrahy,
president of USA Casualty Company, will continue in their positions of
treasurer and secretary, respectively.

The primary focus of the CCCC for 1996 is one of the most vexing issues
affecting workers' comp companies in California today, the rise in bad faith
litigation. The key court case on the issue, Tricor v. State Fund, tends to
dominate the debate over virtually all aspects of insurer operations, not just
reserving practices, the CCCC notes.

Any solution to the problem, the CCCC opines, must acknowledge the need of
policyholders to have legitimate complaints resolved while at the same time
balanced with the legitimate interest of insurers and producers to provide
quality services to employers and timely payment of benefits to injured
workers.

COMMISSION TO PUBLISH SAFETY COURSE ON INTERNET

SAN FRANCISCO - The California Commission on Health and Safety and Workers'
Compensation is developing a comprehensive list of workers' compensation,
health and safety related courses offered by colleges, universities and
community colleges. The list will be posted on the Internet as well as printed
for members of the public without on-line access.

The commission's new service will include the name of the institution,
information on degree and certification programs, course names and
descriptions, schedule of classes, tuition costs (if any) and referrals and/or
instructions on how to obtain additional information.

The commission plans for the project to be ready for the winter and spring
1996 courses. The list of courses will be available on the commission page
under the Workers' Compensation and Division of Occupation Safety and Health
categories of the DIR (Department of Industrial Relations) Home Page at the
Internet address http://www.dir.ca.gov, and they welcome visitors. The
information will be updated each semester.

MISSOURI LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WORKERS' COMP REFORM AGAIN

JEFFERSON CITY - A workers' comp reform bill, similar to one that died in
committee last year, will be introduced in the Missouri legislature in the
upcoming session.

The 1996 version of the reform bill will attempt to more clearly define
workplace accidents, give administrative law judges less leeway in their
decisions and institute other reforms aimed at reducing fraud and speeding up
payments.

The opponents of the bill last year are reported to have the same objections
to the new version. They claim the bill is too pro-employer.

Legislators may lack the appetite to push forward since premiums have been
coming down, and there seems to be little perceived need for additional
reform.

MISSISSIPPI W/COMP RATES TO DROP 11.3%

JACKSON - George Dale, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner, says workers' comp
insurance rates will drop an average 11.3 percent starting March 1 for the
state's employers. This reduction is recommended by the National Council on
Compensation Insurance.

The commissioner predicts that the rate decline will save the state's
businesses an estimated $25.5 million in 1996. NCCI spokesman Robert Maxwell
said safer workplaces and attacks on insurance fraud were helping to
contribute to the improving cost situation. The 11.3 percent applies only to
the voluntary market rates, not the assigned risk plan.

OREGON WORKPLACE INJURY, ILLNESS RATE CONTINUES DECLINE STARTED IN 1988

SALEM - Just released 1994 Oregon workplace injury and illness data show that
new record lows have been set for both public and private employers.

Last year's public sector rate was 6.3 cases, which includes all work-related
accidents and ailments recordable under Oregon OSHA, per 100 full-time
workers. For the private sector it was 8.7 cases per 100.

The 1994 rates continue a downward trend that began in 1988, coinciding with
the state's effort to reform the workers' comp system, cut costs and improve
safety. Last year's public sector rate fell 29.2 percent in the last seven
years and 21.6 percent for the private sector.

NINE MONTHS RESULTS ARE STUNNING

Some interesting developments appear as far as premium decreases. The average
for all California-based carriers reporting on a timely basis (note: Alistar
Ins.. did not) is a net premium decrease through the first nine months of open
rating of 22.1%.

Among the most newsworthy is California Compensation Insurance, a unit of
Foundation Health, which changed from a growth position of 4% second quarter
year-to-date, to a net decrease of 7.3% in premiums at the end of the first
three quarters. This represents a change in premium position of 11.3%.
California Compensation is reporting a direct loss percentage of 54.8% which
appears to compare favorably with the average reported figure of 59.3%.

Allianz Insurance Company and Unicare Insurance are now the only two carriers
of significance which are reporting premium growth. Allianz 15% YTD and
Unicare 10.3%.

NOW COME THE PREMIUM INCREASES

Clearly putting the writing on the walls, many carriers have filed new rates
for 1996. Most do not take effect until February, well after the competitive
January renewals. The loss ratio debacle predicted by all in the early days of
open rating seems to be in the offing, albeit fairly well covered up.

With premiums down some 22 percent and pure loss ratios being reported at 60
percent the actual combined loss ratios we will see - after development - will
prove this year mighty unprofitable for many carriers. Will combined ratios be
reported in the 130s to 150s like so many pundits predicted? Nope, they will
not be reported in this year's results. But they will develop.

According to the Compline rate analysts (actually they can also be called
rate-icidal maniacs because they seem to actually enjoy the monitoring of this
stuff) there have been some significant changes in the rate basis from many
carriers. Here is a brief recap.

Fremont Group filed a 33.2% increase and re-calculated its own rates again.
State Compensation Insurance Fund increased manual rates 8% resulting in a
6.8% increase in collectable premium. SCIF is maintaining its current premium
discounts. Allianz Insurance is adding a 24-hour pilot program and taking a 4%
increase. Fairmont/TIG Insurance filed a 14.7% increase in rates. Citation
Insurance has taken a 9.3% increase. National American Insurance Company of
California is maintaining its '95 rates but dropped its split rating which was
based upon EAP over or under $10,000. Great States Insurance, a unit of FHP,
has instituted an 11% rate increase. Liberty Mutual Insurance Group filed
increases of from 9.7 to 15.2 percent depending upon the company. Safeco has
provided for an 11.3% increase, although it is using the same multipliers as
last year. Golden Eagle Insurance calculated a change of 10.782% and
recalculated its own rates again. Kemper Companies took a 10.1% increase.

So there you have it.

REGULATORY LOBBYING

We tend to think of lobbying as being a function of exerting one's will or
wishes (or at least attempting to) on the legislative process. But those whose
institutional memories or practical experience remember the legendary Clayton
R. Jackson, know that lobbying is also a function of the manipulation of the
regulator's process. Rules and Regs make up the real game sometimes, not the
laws passed by elected representatives.

And this year, more focus will be on changing, amending and deleting
regulations than the legislative-type reforms. One of the leaders of this
process is Ed Woodward, honcho over at the California Workers' Compensation
Institute. He is clearly emerging as one of the chief architects of what may
very well become a key reform year in California.

DOI'S FRAZIER TO HEAD INITIATIVE

Rex Frazier, the chief of the Legislative Bureau for the California Department
of Insurance in Sacramento, has been given a temporary assignment heading up
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's initiative to ban non-economic payments to
uninsured motorists and drunk drivers.

The commissioner filed the initiative, "Personal Responsibility Act," for
inclusion in the November 1996 ballot. While the at-fault driver would have to
pay medical expenses, lost wages, etc. to the uninsured, he would not pay
anything for pain and suffering. The commissioner says it will save at least
$300 million a year in auto insurance costs.

Some industry lobbyists hope that, win-lose-or-draw, the assignment won't
affect Frazier's return to his post. Reportedly, Greg Butler, Quackenbush's
deputy for policy and research will fill in for Frazier.

MID OCEAN IN NEW WAVE

THE INEXORABLE TRANSITION of Lloyd's from a market to something more
resembling the food court of a shopping mall, sheltering under its
franchising umbrella insurance companies rather than syndicates of
merchant venturers, took a major step forward at the end of 1995.  The
commercial future of the managing agencies involved now appears to be
assured, whether the Lloyd's rescue plan works or not, and so do
comfortable futures for the agency principals who will no doubt have
benefitted from the purchase of substantial goodwill.

On 13 December, Mid Ocean Ltd, Hamilton, announced the effective
acquisition of Brockbank Group plc, London (WICR180/18), Terra Nova
(Bermuda) Holdings Ltd, Hamilton, that of Octavian Syndicate Management
Ltd, London, and CNA Reinsurance Group, London, the creation of CNA
Corporate Capital Ltd, a subsidiary of CNA Management Ltd, which will
provide #25m (US$38.75m) in underwriting capacity to three managing
agencies through the creation of four parallel syndicates.  The total
commitment of capacity is #225m, added to which is a further #18m from
single corporate member syndicate 1211 backed by USF&G Corp, Baltimore
MD.

Mid Ocean and Brockbank will create a group which brings together the
existing Brockbank managing agency businesses with Baltusrol, a US$78m
Mid Ocean subsidiary created as the holding company for two new Lloyd's
dedicated corporate syndicates underwriting in parallel with
Brockbank's existing syndicates.  Mid Ocean will have a 51% share of
the enlarged Brockbank Group, and $50m of Baltusrol's capital will
provide capacity for the two corporate syndicates.  Brockbank's
business will substantially be transferred into a new unit, Brockbank
Holdings, which will exchange shares with Baltusrol, the latter taking
51% in Brockbank Holdings and Brockbank Holdings 49% in Baltusrol.  A
shareholders' agreement between the two groups includes undisclosed
undertakings providing Brockbank with equally undisclosed "additional
rights" for a limited period, while Mid Ocean received a commitment
that the transaction may be unwound if certain "trigger events", mainly
related to the acceptance of the Lloyd's rescue plan and the future
stability of the market, occur or do not occur before 1 September.
Otherwise, Mid Ocean will acquire all but one share of Brockbank by 1
September 1997 at a price independently determined, in cash or Mid
Ocean shares, or loan notes.  Brockbank executives representing 28.6%
of issued shares have already committed themselves to accept the offer.
 The merger was approved by Brockbank shareholders at an EGM on 29
December, irrevocable commitments from 56.7% of its shareholders having
previously been made.

Mid Ocean reported a net profit of US$182.9m for the year to 31
October, up from $91m in 1994.  Gross written premiums were $445.8m, up
from $358.6m.  Net income for Q4 included a provision of $21.5m for
losses arising from Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn, partly by a reduction
in Mid Ocean's provisions for the Kobe earthquake from $10m to $5m.
Net investment income totalled $73.8m for the year, up from $51.5m,
with net losses on investments down from $18.2m to $1.5m.

Terra Nova acquired the ongoing business of Octavian for an undisclosed
price.  A new managing agency, Octavian Syndicate Management Ltd, will
be created for 1996 and beyond, operating as an independent business
unit within the Terra Nova group.  The existing Octavian agency will
continue to be responsible for its syndicates until 1995 and prior
years are closed.  Nigel Rogers will continue as Octavian m/d, and join
the Terra Nova Bermuda board.  Terra Nova Capital Ltd, a newly created
corporate capital vehicle, will provide capacity to each of the five
Octavian syndicates (non-marine 702, aviation 959, marine 1009, marine
329, Abbey Motor 554).

CNA Re's new subsidiary CNA Corporate Capital Ltd, a subsidiary of CNA
Management Ltd, will provide #25m in capacity to Claremount
Underwriting Agency Ltd, London, syndicate 2506, Tower U/W Agents Ltd
(Archer Group plc, London) syndicates 923 and 947, and Cox Insurance
Holdings plc (Energy & Marine) syndicate 658 (#5m).

USF&G is the sole corporate member of syndicate 1211 through new
subsidiary F&G UK Underwriters Ltd, London, which has initial capacity
of #18m.  The syndicate will be underwritten by John Dendy, formerly
underwriter of syndicate 546 (Sturge Non-Marine Syndicate Management
Ltd).  At the same time, USF&G has formed and funded a new managing
agency for the syndicate, F&G UK Agency Ltd, London, as a joint venture
between F&G Holdings Ltd and managing agents Ashley Palmer Holdings
Ltd, London, which will provide support staff in accounts and
reporting, claims and credit control and reinsurance security
monitoring.

CER

Cie Europeenne de Reassurances, Paris, has announced an increase in
capital to SF106.673m (US$91.m) as part of a reorganisation plan which
will result in the unit trading under the new name of CER Paris.  As
part of that plan, Geneva-based financial holding Intercasings SA and
Penmore SA, Geneva, formerly the captive of the HEP power provider
Penhold Group of Canada, have acquired 100% of CER Paris.  Penmore was
sold, free of any liability, to Intercasings, and assumed the name of
Cie Europeenne de Reassurances (CER) at the beginning of December.

A capital increase of SF42m for CER in the form of convertible bonds
will be underwritten by Caisse Inter Professionnelle d'Assurance
(CIPAV), Paris, a non-profit organisation, effectively the holding and
operating company of 12 pension funds for French professions.  CIPAV is
putting up CF28m towards the capital increase and will take a 23.14%
stake in CER.  Ultimately Intercasings will only hold around 12.5% of
the equity of CER and about 10% of CER Paris when the bonds are
converted into CER shares.  Intercasings will retain the voting
majority in CER which has been delegated to the management of CER
Paris, with an agreement not to intervene in underwriting or investment
strategy.  All new and renewal risks will be underwritten in the name
of Cie Europeenne de Reassurances, with the exception of risks from
French ceding companies where CER Paris will remain the issuing
company.

CER Paris said in a statement that a further capital increase at CER
was currently being finalised, which will ultimately bring the total
equity of the group to SF125.2m.

DAI ICHI KYOTO RE

Philip Singer of Coopers & Lybrand and Mark Riley of Clark Whitehill
have been appointed joint provisional liquidators to Dai Ichi Kyoto
Reinsurance Co SA and Kobe Reinsurance SA, both Brussels.  They were
appointed by the High Court on the petition of the Belgian curator,
Jean-Michel Derick, in order to protect assets in the UK jurisdiction.
Mr Derick was appointed curator of the companies by the Belgian courts
in November.  The appointment of the provisional liquidators
effectively halts all legal actions involving these two companies
including the suit launched by CRM Insurance Services Ltd, London,
which managed a contact office for the two reinsurers (WICR161/16).

shares held by the Limmat Insurance Co Ltd, Zurich, and Patria Life

SCOR

Shareholders in SCOR SA, Paris, have approved plans for the absorption
of its largest shareholder HCS, the holding company which controls 48%
of the group's shares held by the major French insurance groups
(WICR178/17).  Following the merger Cie UAP SA, Paris, will have a 39%
direct stake in SCOR, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), Paris, 11%
and AXA SA, Paris, 10%.  SCOR said in a statement that the move
streamlines the legal and financial structure of the SCOR Group without
any dilution effects and will improve the liquidity of its shares.
SCOR also confirmed that its results for 1995 would be up strongly on
the net profit of about Fr280m (US$56.9m) earned in 1994.

SWISS RE

In keeping with its strategy of making Asia its third main operational
area, Schweizerische Ruckversicherung Ges (Swiss Re), Zurich, together
with ten Thai insurers, has formed a joint venture under the name SR
Risk Management Services Ltd, Bangkok.  The ten Thai companies in the
joint venture are Bangkok Insurance Public Co Ltd, The Dhipaya
Insurance Co Ltd, Insurance One Ltd, Muang Thai Life Assurance Co Ltd,
Phatra Insurance Public Co Ltd, Safety Insurance Public Co Ltd, The
Samaggi Insurance Public Company Ltd, The Siam City Insurance Company
Ltd, The Thai Commercial Insurance Public Co Ltd, and Thai Insurance
Public Co Ltd.

The venture has now received government approval.  Swiss Re will own
49% of the new company, and the ten local companies 5.1% each.  Thus
the company elegantly overcomes legal restrictions in Thailand, which
make it nearly impossible to set up a branch office in the country.
Swiss Re said "the partners aim to enhance reinsurance know-how and
related services in the Thai marketplace" through the venture.

In addition, the insurance authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore have
approved Swiss Re's plans to upgrade its local representative offices
to branches.  Following the start-up of operations in Bangkok towards
the end of this month, Swiss Re will be represented by eight offices in
Asia.  In addition to the outposts in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Manila,
Singapore, Taipei, Seoul and Beijing, offices are planned for Kuala
Lumpur, Shanghai and Jakarta.  The company is also closely watching
Vietnam and might enter that market soon, too, according to spokesman
Hermann Hefti.  At present the Swiss Re group as a whole writes about
SF1.4bn to SF1.5bn (US$1.2bn to $1.3bn) in the Asia Pacific region,
some 10% to 12% of its income, Mr Hefti said.

CIGNA

Linda Kaiser, the insurance commissioner of Pennsylvania, is to deliver
her decision on the proposed restructuring of CIGNA Corp, Philadelphia,
shortly after 12 January.  Despite three public hearings, American
International Group Inc (AIG), New York, Chubb Group, Warren NJ, and St
Paul Fire & Marine, St Paul MN, are still fiercely contesting CIGNA's
plans on the grounds that they are unfair, illegal and not in the
interests of policyholders because all of the documentation supporting
them has not been made available.  CIGNA has responded that the only
documents kept out of the public domain had been those which contained
information about policyholders currently in litigation over asbestos
or environmental claims.

-  CIGNA has been fined US$442,500 by the Insurance Department of
California for ratings errors and violations in its documentation after
it was discovered that the insurer had failed to file proper rate
increase applications for 255 of 468 policies, thereby overcharging a
small number of clients by US$1.3m.  CIGNA has repaid over $1m in
refunds to twenty Californian  mainly D&O policyholders.

GAN

Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), Paris, intends to dispose of up
to Fr9bn (US$1.8bn) in additional assets to meet its debts and the cost
of its defeasance operations.  As part of this programme chairman Jean-
Jacques Bonnaud said that GAN was willing in principle to give up its
majority stake in banking subsidiary Credit Industrial et Commercial
(CIC), the first time that GAN has publicly acknowledged that its
shareholding in CIC could fall below 50%.

M Bonnaud said that the state had endorsed plans for GAN's
restructuring prior to sale at a board meeting in December.  He had
taken the acceleration in asset disposals to mean a greater commitment
towards privatization on the part of the government, and suggested 1997
as a possible date.  Additional assets to be sold off have yet to be
decided, with sales to take place over the next four to five years.

HDI/CITIBANK/TRANSATLANTISCHE

HDI Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie Versicherungsverein aG,
Hanover, appears to be on the verge of a major alliance with another
mutual, with a candidate most likely to be found in the life sector.
According to WICR's correspondent in Germany, this is the conclusion
which can be drawn from the reorganisation initiated by HDI, and from
remarks by chief executive Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl.

HDI has been busy in recent months.  It has signed a wide-ranging co-
operation deal with Citibank Privatkunden AG and Citicorp Deutschland
AG and, with effect from 1 January, took over the German insurance
operations of Citibank, Citi Lebensversicherung AG and Citi
Versicherung AG, both Dusseldorf.  It acquired Transatlantische
Lebensversicherungs-AG (Transleben), Hamburg, in December from Lloyds
Abbey Life plc, Weybridge, which it will merge with its own life
company, HDI Lebensversicherung AG.  However, the company's life
business itself will be moved away from that company into a new,
Hamburg-based life insurer, leaving HDI Leben as an empty shell with a
considerable tax-loss to carry forward.  HDI Leben will be renamed and
converted into a sub-holding under the parent HDI VVaG, and into which
all operational insurance interests outside the actual HDI VVaG will be
bundled, including those of reinsurer Hannover Ruckversicherung AG,
Hanover, and its subsidiary Eisen und Stahl Ruckversicherung AG.

Such a setup (parental mutuals, sub-holding for other interests) is the
classic model for a "Gleichordnungskonzern", a group formed of two
mutuals which cannot formally merge.  The group is then held together
by a joint management for both, and by stakes in the sub-holding, into
which the mutuals bring their non-mutualised insurance business.  Mr
Baumgartl does not deny that this could be a model and although he says
that there are "no current talks going on", it seems likely that such a
move towards an alliance with a life mutual would not be unwelcome to
him.

Following the signing of the deal with Citibank, Mr Baumgartl said that
"In order to be a global player on the life market, you need premium
income of about DM2bn" (US$1.4bn).  His present life companies are far
short of that: to 30 November, Citi Leben reported premium income of
DM322m for 1995, so the total for the year will be below DM400m.
Transleben reported DM216m for 1994, and the 1995 total is likely to be
below DM300m.  HDI's own life company is still struggling with the
problems of being relatively new, and premium income will total only
DM36m. Together, therefore, the whole HDI life group will write not
more than DM650m - and it is difficult to see where HDI will gain the
DM2bn it is seeking, if Mr Baumgartl does not have a major partnership
up his sleeve.

The deal with Citibank was not surprising, and aimed as much at volume
as the sales channels offered by the two companies.  Citi Leben has a
total life portfolio of DM16.7bn and Citi Versicherung gross premium of
DM23.5m.  The former Citibank insurers will continue as companies in
their own right, and will change their names to CiV Lebensversicherung
AG and CiV Versicherung AG.  Product names like "Citi Leben Plus 4"
will also remain unchanged, and policies will continue to be sold
exclusively through the sales channels of Citibank Privatkunden.  Those
channels - reaching at present about 2.5m customers - were of key
importance for HDI, Mr Baumgartl stressed.  "That is why we were only
interested in an exclusive and long-term cooperation with Citibank.
Without Citibank's salesforce, the two insurers would be of no value
for us!" he said, adding that by co-operating with Citibank, HDI had
completed its range of distribution channels.  HDI had no interest in
becoming an Allfinanz group, Mr Baumgartl said.

HDI will sell banking products exclusively for Citibank, and in return
Citibank will only offer CiV and other HDI policies in the insurance
sector.  Mr Baumgartl said that there would be no assimilation between
the Citi and HDI products.  "The CiV products will remain tailor-made
for Citibank's demands," he said

According to Mr Baumgartl, HDI's moves to strengthen its life business
were needed to counterbalance the sharp swings in the profits of the
industrial, motor and portfolios which were the group's major lines of
business.  "What we need is the broad private life business with a
relatively balanced development," he said.

The HDI deal with Lloyds Abbey Life was also confirmed in December, at
a price of about DM110m, according to sources at Lloyds Abbey Life.
The company has life business in force of about DM7.2bn.  For 1995, the
company again forecasts losses, although the expected DM7m is a strong
improvement over the DM11m loss in 1994.  Transleben, which
concentrates on broker-produced business, has suffered from high
cancellation ratios.  In 1992, it began a reorganisation, including a
drastic restructuring of its sales network.  HDI said that its 1995
premium income rose 9% from DM2.78bn to DM3.03bn, with motor being the
main earner, up by 140,000 risks to 1.8m at the year-end, and giving
HDI a market share of 4% - one of the winners in the present price war.
 1995 motor results had been excellent, but following massive price
cuts, an underwriting loss was likely for 1996.  Industrial fire, too,
was suffering from weaker prices, board member Gunter Wager said.

HDI officials confirmed that the company is one of four insurers
bidding for the business acquired by the UK's Automobile Association
(AA) from its members, more than 1m policies a year. Originally, HDI
had been the only bidder.  They also indicated that the acquisition of
a small insurer in Italy was likely soon, but did not specify any
candidate.

INDEPENDENT/LA PALATINE

Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs-AG, Aachen, has finally managed to
rid itself of La Palatine Assurance SA, Suresnes, the source of much
distress for another of its more recent disposals, Aachener
Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG (Aachen Re), Aachen.  Independent Insurance
Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Independent Insurance Group plc, London,
has taken over Palatine from Groupement Francais d'Assurances IARD
(GFA), Suresnes.  GFA was a subsidiary of the old Aachen Re, which has
now been renamed AM Konzernruckversicherung AG after being transformed
into a purely in-house reinsurer.

GFA has transferred a major portion of its business to Palatine and
sold this business with the company.  Palatine has been active in the
French personal lines market since 1990 and has mainly sold motor,
property and accident policies via brokers and multiple agents.  The
net assets of Palatine were worth Fr35m (US$7.1m) on transfer to
Independent, which secured guarantees particularly regarding reserve
adequacy and Fr140m in order to restructure Palatine.

KANSA

Former managers of the bankrupt Kansa Pension Insurance Co. Ltd (Elake-
Kansa), Helsinki, were served with writs for damages towards the end of
December, the last possible moment before the statute of limitations
took effect (WICR159/24).  The suits, covering events in 1992, sought
an estimated FM240m (US$55.2m).  Liquidators are suing, among other
things, over property deals which were allegedly sometimes approved by
the boards in retrospect, and sometimes with not all board members
present at crucial meetings.  Further suits could follow concerning
events in 1993 and 1994, and these could raise the claims to FM1bn.
One matter awaiting clarification is the disappearance of FM700m in the
summer of 1993, without the authorisation of the board.

Seven of the Kansa companies have been the subject of extraordinary
audits and all of them are nearly complete.  The administrators have
asked some of the larger creditors for comments, which are expected
this month, but should not change the assessment of management's
responsibilities.  The auditors' reports have also been submitted to
the insurance department of the ministry of social affairs and health.

The bankrupt companies are Elake-Kansa, Kansa Life Insurance Co Ltd
(Henki-Kansa), Helsinki, two reinsurers, Kansa International Corp,
Kansy-yhtyma, and Finansipalveluosakeyhtio Kansa.  The pension company
is in the worst financial condition, with non-guaranteed credits, and a
deficit of around FM1bn (WICR159/24).  The situation of Henki-Kansa
appears better, but depends heavily on the outcome of the legal action.
 Indeed, the state of both companies will only be clear when the legal
actions have been settled, and decided which assets belong to which
company.  The general aim is to reduce the deficits of the bankrupt
companies through selling the Kansa Group's US-based subsidiary
Clarendon Group.  According to Mr Jaatinen the sale is progressing, and
should be finalised during 1996.

London Insurance Market Investment Trust plc (LIMIT), London, has
increased its capacity allocated to the Lloyd's market by 5.2% to
#610.25m (US$946m) for 1996.  The increase means that LIMIT now writes
6.5% of Lloyd's total capacity.  LIMIT said that it will be providing
capacity to two syndicates which it has not previously supported,
#0.25m going to non-marine (mainly nuclear risks) syndicate 1176 (Cox
Newton & Harman Ltd) and #3m to syndicate 1206 managed by Owen & Wilby
Underwriting Agency Ltd, a new managing agent for 1996 formed to manage
the syndicate which will be similar to that of syndicate 718 in the
sphere of accident & health risks, with the exception that no London

NATIONAL (CALCUTTA)

National Insurance Co Ltd, Calcutta, introduced India's first package
insurance policy for farmers in West Bengal on 25 November.  Union
Minister of State for Finance, Dr Debiprosad Pad, described the scheme
as a significant milestone and urged the other insurance companies to
introduce similar policies.  The scheme will be extended to other areas
if it proves successful in West Bengal.  The package covers 12 frequent
hazards in rural areas, including fire and allied, burglary, electronic
equipment such as TVs and VCRs, bicycles, livestock, poultry and
handcarts.  The fire and burglary sections are compulsory, with an
annual premium of Rs152.50.  Taking five or more sections generates a
premium discount of 15% to 20%.

ORIENTAL

Oriental Insurance Co Ltd (OIC), New Delhi, closed the year 1994-95
with an overall profit of Rs437.1m (US$12.3m).  Motor claims cost it
Rs1,950m.  Chairman KC Mittal said that although there was an
underwriting loss of Rs1,307.9m for the year after a profit of Rs118.5m
in 1993-4, this was essentially due to provisions for motor TPL claims
of Rs5,040m on 21 March 1995, compared with Rs2,730m int he previous
year, and resulting from changes to the Motor Vehicles Act and a trend
towards higher awards by claims tribunals.  He described MTPL claims as
"a bleeding wound" for the company and said there was a dire need for
increasing the third party insurance premium for buses and trucks.

Gross domestic premium income was about Rs11bn, up from Rs10.06bn.
Results in both fire and marine had substantially improved.  Foreign
operations in Nepal, Kuwait and Dubai yielded a revenue surplus of
Rs14.2m against a deficit of Rs40.8m.  Total investment earnings
increased by 20.9% to Rs1,785.1m.

PROVINZIAL

German insurance agents are becoming increasingly worried about the
trend for established agency distribution insurers to set up direct
sales operations.  The agents' association Bundesverband Deutscher
Versicherungskaufleute said that more and more companies were becoming
"unfaithful".  The latest example was the plan of the Rhineland savings
banks, represented by Rheinischer Sparkassen- und Giroverband, together
with Provinzial Feuerversicherungsanstalt der Rheinprovinz, Dusseldorf,
to set up "S Direkt" in Spring this year to offer cheap motor cover.
According to a marketing analysis undertaken by the initiators, 14% of
potential customers were prepared to sign up with a direct sale
insurer.  The idea is also to increase penetration: while the 52
savings banks have a market share of close to 50% of households,
Provinzial has only 9%.  The savings banks will in future be major
shareholders of Provinzial.

SKANDIA

Forsakrings AB Skandia, Stockholm, offshoot Skandia Assurance &
Financial Services (AFS), which runs around 400 unit-liked insurance
funds, has set up a service company on the offshore tax haven of
Labuan, as well as in Borneo, which is currently home to 560 offshore
companies and 46 banks.  Skandia AFS South East Asia will be the
company's largest sales office in SE Asia, targetting Indonesia, the
Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, and
Korea.

Elsewhere in Asia, the group has Royal Skandia in Hong Kong, which
sells unit-linked policies to expatriates working in the colony.
Skandia Asia chairman Bjorn Hall has forecast that pension monies would
grow by between 4% and 5% in real terms in the markets of Hong Kong,
China, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia Thailand, Korea, the
Philippines, and Australia in the coming years, and described India,
Burma, Sri Lanka and Cambodia as other up and coming markets.

Closer to home, Skandia's board has decided to take a more active role
as shareholder.  It will press for the establishment of nominating
committees, which propose candidates to boards, advise on their
remuneration, and propose auditors, in all joint stock companies.
Skandia will also encourage companies to give shareholders more
opportunity to prepare themselves for their AGMs by announcing them a
month in advance and publishing an agenda.  With over 30% of the
Stockholm stock exchange value in foreign hands, this should include an
English translation.

TRYGG-HANSA

Trygg-Hansa AB, Stockholm, is aiming to double its premium income over
the next four years.  Ceo Lars Thunell believes that Swedish insurers
face tough competition from niche and foreign companies, and to survive
must halve their costs.  His method will be to double income while
holding expenses unchanged.  To achieve this, Mr Thunell plans new
distribution channels, simplifying products, improving services to
larger customers, as well as international expansion.  For the non-life
market the watchwords will be simplification and standardised products.
 Mr Thunell was resigned to slow progress at home, "nibbling half a
percent a year" in Sweden.  In addition, non-life products would
increasingly be sold by telephone and over the Internet, which should
allow penetration into Finland and Norway.  Slightly further afield, Mr
Thunell believed that the future markets were in the Baltic area.

Many of the lucrative opportunities were in the life market, he said,
as cutbacks in Sweden's social security and pension system opened the
way for new products combining savings and insurance.  This was a
further reason for the joint stock company (Trygg-Hansa AB)
strengthening its grip on Trygg-Hansa Liv (WICR177/18, 178/23, 183/22).
 A major step towards this consolidation was taken when the shareholder
agreement between SPP and Trygg-Hansa Liv was dissolved in late
December (WICR183/22).  This agreement involved Trygg-Hansa Liv and SPP
undertaking not to sell shares to third parties before the year 2000,
and thereafter offering first refusal to the other until 2010.

This paved the way for Trygg-Hansa Liv to pay SK626.5m (US$94.7m) to
buy 632,000 A shares and 5m B shares of Trygg Hansa AB from SPP.
Together with its existing holding of 19.4% of capital and 28.1% of
votes, this will give Trygg-Hansa Liv all of the 2m A shares in Trygg-
Hansa AB, and leave it with 26.2% of the capital in the company and
39.2% of the votes.  Trygg-Hansa Liv's chairman Gosta Wiking indicated
that the life company did not intend to take up any more Trygg-Hansa AB
shares, so that the outstanding packets were large enough to be
attractive to other institutional investors.

SPP still holds 16,447,512 B shares in Trygg Hansa AB, which have a
market value of around SK1.8bn at a market price of around SK110 a
share.  SPP has already adjusted these to SK98 per share on its balance
sheet (from SK 80), and a substantial proportion is likely to be sold.
The 16.44m shares represent 19.9% of Trygg-Hansa AB's capital and 16.3%
of the votes.  SPP spokesman Klas Rasater indicated that SPP was
unlikely to want to retain more than 5% in the long term.

are to reorganise their current shareholding relationship within a
general co-operation agreement.  UAP will sell its 40% stake in
Interamerican Holding, which controls the interests of Interamerican
Property & Casualty Insurance Co, Athens, to Europolitan, Luxembourg.
Simultaneously, UAP's subsidiary Banque Worms, already a majority
shareholder in Interamerican Group member Interbank with 60%, will

Interamerican Group and Interbank to enhance their joint capacity for
selling insurance products and banking services.  The Interamerican

UAP is proceeding with the restructuring of some of its main businesses
into two holding companies as announced at the end of last year

board met for the time on 3 January.

The minister of economy and finance (MoF) has also agreed to the
formation of UAP Collectives, which will be responsible for group life
within UAP France.  The MoF also authorised the transfer to it of the
portfolios of group assurance policies from UAP-Vie and UAP Incendie-
Accidents as of 1 January.

Members of the United Kingdom Mutual Steam Ship Assurance Association

favour of the International Group of P&I Club's proposal to limit each
member's liability to pay catastrophe calls to 20% of an owner's
limitation fund for property damage claims under the 1976 Limitation
Convention.  This will result in a potential total claim on all members
in the International Group of between US$18bn and $20bn.  It must be
accepted by a minimum of ten clubs in the International Group,
representing at least 85% of International Group's tonnage.  According
to the UK Club, a number of other clubs are holding meetings of members
along the same lines, with a representative picture of shipowners'
views hopefully becoming apparent by the end of January.  The
proposals, if approved by all members of the group, will be adopted for

WEST OF ENGLAND

The West of England Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association
(Luxembourg) has warned that an "even greater level of self-insurance
is the only option" for members of the International Group if
uncertainty surrounding the future of the Lloyd's market continues and
no viable alternative is found.  In its annual review for 1995 the club
said that concerns remained about the International Group's heavy
dependence upon Lloyd's, which still writes up to 80% of the combined
layer of the International Group's reinsurance contract.  While there
had been "some optimism during recent months that Lloyd's would be
restructured", delays in Equitas meant that there was continuing
uncertainty over the future of the leading reinsurer for the club and
the Group and the prospect that "even greater levels of risk will have
to be retained within the industry", it said.

P&I providers could not expect to be immune from the type of litigation
that has "so bedevilled" the Lloyd's market over the past few years.
One way to prevent or defeat such litigation was for a club's
underwriters and committee to have a basic underwriting plan which
analysed potential exposure, laid down a policy to limit that exposure
acceptable to its members and then communicated that policy to them.
The club said that "unless and until the International Group introduces
a realistic limit on cover, a major overspill claim would inevitably
lead to litigation."  While the International Group had recognised the
need for limiting catastrophe liability calls to an "economically
collectable" level, its intention to have that level determined by an
independent expert after an event was troubling.  The club suggested
that a glance at the Lloyd's experience of trying to collect monies
owed from names would provide a "salutary lesson" to the International
Group about such a course.

Another challenge lay in the International Group's own Pooling
arrangements.  Since the individual club retention had increased
substantially in recent years from $1.2m per loss in 1989 to $5m in
1995, it was possible that the pattern of development of incurred pool
claims data will be different to that of the 1980s.  Whereas a claim
for $900,000 would have taken less time to appear in the pool, in 1995
a significant loss might take much longer to develop to the point where
it will concern the pool.  Claims information may therefore appear
unnecessarily optimistic.  The West of England concluded that "time
alone will tell", but urged club underwriters to take measures to
ensure that any negative impact may be minimalised.

COLONIA LEBEN

Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL), Cologne, is set to turn its
Deutsche Crzte-Versicherung (DCV) branch operation into a company in
its own right.  According to its chairman, Carl Hermann Schleifer, CL
was currently discussing the legal and fiscal aspects of the
separation.  "By carrying out the spin-off, we break new ground," Dr
Schleifer said.  DCV will receive one-third of CL's existing portfolio,
which totalled DM62.5bn (US$43bn) at the end of 1995.  Dr Schleifer was
confident that a satisfactory solution would be found by this Spring,
and that DCV will then be turned into a separate joint stock company
retroactively from 1 January.  One major problem seems to be the offer
that has to be made to independent CL shareholders.

It is expected that DCV will eventually seek close co-operation with
Deutsche Apotheker-und Crztebank, Dusseldorf, the specialised bank for
the medical professions.  The small property and casualty unit Deutsche
Crzte-Versicherung Allgemeine AG, Cologne, which is already
independent, would not be affected by the separation.

Dr Schleifer, who also heads Nordstern Lebensversicherungs-AG and
private health insurer Colonia Krankenversicherung AG, also announced
another project of holding company CKAG Colonia Konzern AG,
establishment of a specialised consultancy and sales organisation to
concentrate on investments for customers over the age of 45.  A sales
force was currently being recruited in the banking sector who would not
only sell CKAG life insurance, but also funds, investment certificates
and other products.  Dr Schleifer said that former majority owner
Bankhaus Sal Oppenheim would certainly be a co-operation partner for
the new project, but that CKAG was also negotiating with other banks.
He added that the new organisation was one step in CKAG's strategy of
aiming at a new target group, the generation of the "young elderly".

Dr Schleifer displayed optimism regarding the prospects of life
business in Germany.  In his view life insurers would again benefit
from an improved economic environment and record growth in new business
in 1996.  He expects new business for both companies to rise by about
7% in 1996.  One major factor for the upturn would be the estimated
rise in the purchasing power of German consumers, which was expected to
be up by DM11bn (US$7.65bn) on 1995.  Germans were becoming
increasingly aware of the value of life policies as a provision for
their old age, Dr Schleifer said, adding that German life insurers had
not felt any effect from foreign competitors offering life policies in
the German market hitherto.  In his view, European Monetary Union would
bring no disadvantages for German insureds.

In 1995, Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL) suffered an 8.7% decline in
new business to DM7.5bn in sums insured.  "The market as a whole
anticipates a 13% fall in new business, so Colonia held firm and gained
market share," Dr Schleifer said.  He expected premium income for the
year to rise by 5.2% to DM1.9bn.  The cancellation ratio deteriorated
by 0.1 points to 4.7%, "but is still markedly below the market average
of above 6%", he said.  Sales by pyramid-sales company Proventus AG,
Bremen, accounted for less than 10% of newly sold business.  The
organisation did particularly well in selling private health cover in
eastern Germany.  "Overall, we are very satisfied with this sales
channel," Dr Schleifer said.

CL's cost ratio improved from 3.8% to 3.7%, mainly as a result of the
merger of the Colonia and Nordstern back-offices.  Dr Schleifer
expected a gross profit of DM593m for Colonia Life, up 4.4%.  Sister
company Nordstern Leben (NL) will outperform the rest of the market in
1995, the ceo said.  It maintained new business at the 1994 level, with
DM4.7bn in sums insured.  Premium income was expected to rise by 14% to
DM1.4bn, compared with an average growth of 7% in the German market,
although the cancellation ratio worsened from 3.7% to 4.3%.  NL's gross
profit will rise from DM276.7m in 1994 to an expected DM315m.

The boards of Sampo Pension Insurance Co Ltd (Elake-Sampo), Helsinki,

on what form the reorganisation would take and methods of calculating
profits from the assets (WICR181/23).  The regulator, the ministry of
social affairs and health, had insisted on unanimity over the merger
arrangements as a precondition of its own approval.  A joint communique
stressed that auditors had found that there were no significant
differences in the financial situations of the companies, a move
designed to quash doubts over the soundness of the financial position
of Elake-Varma.

According to unofficial reports, one bone of contention was that Elake-
Varma wanted to assume a 10% future yield on shares, which others
considered unrealistic.  There were also differences over how to
estimate profits from hydro-electric power stations, which tend to be
heavily influenced by inflation expectations.  Elake-Varma owns several
such plants.  Consequently, there was some incredulity when the company
announced that the surplus of its insurance and investment activities
would increase from around FM40m (US$9.2m) for 1994 to nearly FM270m.

Elake-Varma managing director Paavo Pitkanen declined to speculate
whether another attempt to reorganise the two companies would be made,
while Elake-Sampo managing director Risto Kausto considered the matter
closed.

The other merger within the Sampo group, that of Kaleva Mutual
Insurance Co., Helsinki, and Nova Life Insurance Co Ltd, Helsinki, is
to proceed.

R+V

Germany's highest administrative court Bundesverwaltungsgericht in
Berlin, has issued an important ruling affecting demutualisation in the
country.  The court said that the German insurance supervision
Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, had acted
correctly when it allowed the 1989 transfer of the life portfolio from
the mutual R+V Lebensversicherungsverein aG to the joint stock company
R+V Lebensversicherung AG, Wiesbaden.

Several insureds of the old mutual had taken legal action against BAV,
complaining that the compensation paid to members was too low and did
not take the hidden reserves of the mutual adequately into account.  At
that time, a total of DM218m (US$152m) was paid to members to
compensate for their loss of that status.  The plaintiffs argued that
the hidden reserves totalled "a multiple" of that sum.

The court said that the BAV had taken sufficient care of the interests
of policyholders.  The legal and effective material situation of the
plaintiffs had not been worsened to a noteworthy degree.  As far as
they had suffered losses at all, they had been compensated.  The
transfer of the portfolio was no reason to dissolve the hidden
reserves.  The BAV's agreement to the deal did not prevent members from
suing for higher compensation.

The judgement is of considerable importance because it eases the
transformation from mutuals to joint stock companies.  Many mutuals
suffer from inadequate equity, and must increase capital through
profits.  The EU directive on the solvency of insurance groups which is
in preparation would aggravate the problem for life mutuals, as
reserves for premium repayments to policyholders would no longer count
as equity.

EURO THOUGHTS

WITH THE DEADLINE of 1 January 1999 fixed by the Cannes Summit at the
end of June 1995, European insurers have begun to consider the
consequences for them of a move to a single European currency.  All
studies have reached the same conclusion: most of the costs generated
by the move to the single currency will occur during the preparatory
phase whereas the majority of benefits will only appear after the
implementation of the single currency, the Comite Europeen des
Assurances (CEA) said in a preliminary commentary.  There is therefore
a real economic interest in limiting the transitional period for the
move from one system to the other, while allowing the necessary time
for adaptation, it said.

Recurrent monetary crises in Europe over the last three years, have
largely shown that despite the EMS, Europe regularly suffers from
unbridled speculation aimed in particular at weaker currencies.  The
creation of a single currency in Europe would in theory be one solution
to such attacks and the only one capable in limiting such destabilizing
behaviour.  That participating states should meet on a sustainable
basis the criteria of convergence born when they join and in future is
a sine qua non for the success of the process but not insufficient in
itself, the CEA concluded.

Although technical differences exist between life and non-life
insurance, globally the prospect of monetary stability in Europe is
very much in the interest of insurance, especially life insurance.  The
reinforcement of monetary stability should achieve a fall in long-term
interest rates and greater confidence by the public in the single
currency which should, eventually, gain status as a reserve currency
like the dollar.  An end to exchange rate manipulation, the
disappearance of exchange rate risks between member states and the
optimum allocation of financial resources permitted by a single
currency were particularly important for European insurers as they may
now invest assets anywhere in the European Economic Area, the CEA said.
 A more favourable business climate should result and European insurers
would also be able to propose contracts in a single currency to clients
outside the EU.

At a micro-economic level, a single currency will reduce the cost of
transactions and bank transfers to insurers and make for better price
comparability and improve the quality of service offered.
Supplementary costs would be incurred because of modification of
computer programmes and financial management systems, re-denomination
of policies and other documents and some staff reorganisation.
Although the CEA found it probable that these changes will eventually
bring about gains in productivity and competitiveness, "it is
undeniable that they will represent, in the short term, a major
outlay".  Most insurers, however, would consider these costs as
investments, if the return on costs incurred was reasonably guaranteed
by firm and irrevocable commitments by governments on the continuity of
the process, it suggested.

Among obstacles likely to cause difficulties are the absence of a
precise, detailed timetable or a firm political commitment to conform
to it, which creates uncertainty, the CEA said.  Even if commitments
are given in this respect, insurers fear that insufficient co-
ordination of monetary policies, or sudden economic and/or social
difficulties in one or more states would have disastrous effects on the
process as a whole.

The absence of harmonisation in taxation (as well as in state social
security schemes) could also cause tension and constitute a barrier to
expected developments, the CEA considered.  The problem is the absence
of harmonisation of indirect taxation on savings and co-ordination of
fiscal provisions on overall assets and benefits.  The CEA raised a
number of issues with members with regard to the Green Paper on
monetary union published at the end of May by the European Commission.
The majority of European insurers favours a big bang solution, viewing
the three-year preparation period envisaged in the Green Paper as too
long.  During the transitional period (phase B) a large critical mass
of business must be undertaken in the single currency.  Undertakings
should not have to use double accounting during phase B even if they
underwrite single currency contracts from the start of 1999, the CEA
stressed.  Only national currencies will still be legal tender during
phase B, but as they will become real substitutes for the single
currency, conversion rates into the single currency, fixed irrevocably,
must make it possible for an automatic and cost-free move from any one
national currency to the single currency and back.  A European
directive was also required to stipulate that the move to the single
currency may not in itself be used unilaterally to cancel current
contracts.

SWISS RE ON SOLVENCY

Financial security of insurers is increasingly important in the
industry, but higher security has its price because it must be
ultimately paid for by policyholders and cedants or shareholders,
Schweizerische Ruckversicherungs-Ges (Swiss Re) concludes in its latest
Sigma study*.  "Just as investors are prepared to accept a lower return
on a bond issue with a high rating, so policyholders and cedants must
be prepared to pay higher premiums to a company with high security,"
the study said.

Since 1978, 648 non-life insurers worldwide have become insolvent.  At
the end of the 1970s, the number of insolvencies annually averaged
about 10, but by the 1990s had increased to about 80.  Although in 1994
there was a decline to just above 40, it was too early to speak of a
reversal of the trend, Swiss Re considered.  Two-thirds (66%) of the
insolvencies between 1978 and 1994 involved US companies, while in
Europe, UK insurers were most bankruptcy-prone, with 7% of the world
total.  Europe excluding the UK accounted for 4% (and at the same time
for 26% of global premium income).  Elsewhere, Bermuda represented 8%
of bankruptcies.

According to Swiss Re, the causes of insurance insolvencies are
complex.  In general, bankruptcy is greater in deregulated markets, as
these are exposed to greater fluctuations in premium rates, and the
profitability of the market as a whole tends to be both lower and more
volatile.  The US and UK markets were also adversely affected by high
burdens of loss from liability claims and natural disasters.  Prolonged
periods of falling interest rates also probably favour insolvencies, it
said.  Swiss Re expects that, especially in Europe, deregulation of
insurance markets and the replacement of material control by financial
supervision will increase competition and insurance market volatility,
exacerbating the risk of insolvency.

The study also analysed various methods for assessing solvency.  "Taken
in isolation, the solvency ratio means little.  The reserves ratio at
least must also be taken into account," Swiss Re said, adding that
generally, the use of premium volumes as a measure of exposure to risks
was "problematic".  There were distortions as a result of fluctuating
premium rates and different portfolio composition, and investment risks
were ignored.  In deregulated markets, insurance supervision
essentially consists of financial supervision, based in the EU on
relatively simple solvency ratios.  In the US, new risk-based capital
approaches were already being used, under which both underwriting and
investment risks assumed are quantified and used to determine the
necessary capital.  The study discusses several alternatives, including
simulation models and Swiss Re's own method of measuring its necessary
risk-adjusted capital.

This it describes as follows.  "The capital requirement is calculated
in accordance with the business risk, that is to say on the basis of
the probability distribution of the annual operating results.  This
distribution is made up of the results distributions of the various
lines of business and of investments.  The individual distributions are
determined in two stages: firstly, from empirical data from the past, a
probability function of the results is formed which is adjusted by
disregarding exceptional major events.  Secondly, using so-called
`threat scenarios' (for the various lines of business and investments),
exceptional loss events of the kind which, on the basis of Swiss Re's
portfolio, are to be expected statistically every 10, 20, 50 and 100
years are simulated.  The adjusted distributions and the distributions
of the exceptional events are combined to form the results
distributions.  From these, the probability distribution of the
operating result is derived, taking account of the most important
correlations.  This means that the diversification effects of Swiss
Re's portfolio are included.  It is most unlikely that extremely
unfavourable events will occur in all regions and lines of business at
the same time, which means that an unfavourable result in one area can
be cushioned by a favourable result in another.

The capital required is thus determined by the extent to which the
Executive Board is prepared to take risks.  The Executive Board
stipulates the probability with which, and the period over which, the
company's financial strength is not to be adversely affected.

The risk-adjusted capital determined in this way is then allocated to
the individual lines of business and profit centres on the basis of the
volatility of the results.  This allocation enables the results of the
lines of business and profit centres to be measured adequately."

Insurers' claims-paying ability is assessed not only by regulators but
also by private rating agencies, of which the best-known are Standard &
Poor's, Moody's and AM Best.  Comparing individual agencies' ratings
was not without its problems either, Swiss Re said.  Definitions of
rating categories differed, as did rating procedures, but there was a
clearly identifiable tendency for an ever smaller proportion of
insurers to receive a top rating.  "Best's clearly rates more companies
as `excellent' than do Moody's and Standard & Poor's," Swiss Re said.
"Moody's is the most cautious in assigning the highest rating," it
added, but of the companies examined, only Standard & Poor's rated some
as `vulnerable'.

The accuracy of ratings was analysed with AM Best's data, looking at
the rating three years prior to a company's collapse.  Corresponding
data from the other rating agencies were not available.  For most of
the companies becoming insolvent, the rating had been withdrawn or none
had been assigned.  Three years before bankruptcy, 45 out of 247
insurers had an A rating, and one year before only six.

ROI IMPROVED

Although the US property/casualty insurance industry will show a rate
of return on capital for 1995 of 9.2%, more than 60% higher than the
5.6% achieved in 1994, the industry's profit rate remains below that of
most other sectors according to a report published jointly by the
Insurance Information Institute (I.I.I.) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).
The Fortune 500 is expected to show a 13% rate of return for the year.
Nevertheless, the rate of return for insurance in 1995 is slightly
above its long-term rate of 9%.

The increase was attributed to lower than expected catastrophe losses,
and higher investment income and interest rates.  Catastrophes for 1995
are expected to cost about US$8bn, down from $17bn in 1994, although
Hurricane Opal and some lesser storms made 1995 the third worst year on
record for catastrophe losses, after 1994 and the record $23bn of 1992.
 Investment income increased by 10.4% in 1995 over 1994.  In 1994, the
increase was an "anaemic" 3.4%, after declines of 1.5% and 3.2% in 1992
and 1993.  Interest rates rose in 1994 and remained relatively high in
early 1995, so insurers could invest new funds in higher-yielding
assets.  Record stockmarket highs also generated  increases in capital
gains, while the fall in interest rates in Q3-Q4 1995 added to the
realised gains of insurers which sold bonds.  Realised capital gains
increased to $5bn last year, from $1.7bn in 1994.

Overall profitability for 1996 is expected to show further significant
growth, mainly due to investment income as premium growth is slowed by
severe price competition.  Alan Levin of S&P predicted a combined ratio
of 107.9% for 1996, and a continued fall in the quality of earnings as
underwriting losses increase through 1997.  "As a result, we expect to
see even more action in controlling expenses, possibly through more
mergers as insurers attack their cost base in order to preserve profit
margins.  With underwriting expenses accounting for approximately 26%
of net premium volume, internal expense control becomes the only
alternative open to insurers as a means for maintaining adequate
profitability," Mr Levin said.

A similar conclusion was reached by a study* by the Insurance Services
Office Inc (ISO), which measured risk as the variability in return on
year-end net worth for the 20 largest insurers and the 20 largest
companies in 30 non-property/casualty insurance industry groups,
including life/health insurers.  It found that from 1979 to 1993 the
median rate of return for the 20 largest p/c insurers was 9.6%, 1.6
points below the average of the corresponding medians for the 20
largest companies in each of the non-insurance groups.  It also found
that insurance was riskier than most non-insurance industries on each
of three measures of variability used to assess risk, total variability
in rate of return, a variability adjusted for industry cycles and an
ISO composite index averaging the first two.

The number of industry groups more profitable and less risky than
insurance was about three times the number which were the reverse.
Similar results were found when ISO examined all companies in industry
groups, not just the 20 largest.  However, about a quarter of
individual insurers analysed were superior to the typical company in
the non-insurance industry groups.  The property/casualty industry's
10.1% average rate of return during the two insurance cycles for 1978
to 1994 also was lower than the corresponding rates of return for five
out of six key composite indices, including the Standard & Poor's 500
and the Standard & Poor's Financials.

The study found that stockholder-owned insurers earned higher returns,
but faced greater risk than policyholder-owned mutuals.  Commercial-
lines insurers have also been more profitable, but faced more risk than
personal-lines insurers, and agency companies have been more profitable
but also more risky than direct writers.  The major short-tail property
lines have been more profitable, but also more risky than the major
long-tail lines, catastrophes increasing the volatility in property and
year-to-year changes in reserve adequacy smoothing results for
liability.

STATE REINSURER, NEW COMPANIES

Yang Wenyou, director of the Administration Department for Foreign Fund
Financial Organs of the People's Bank of China, said on 30 December
that a State Reinsurance Company would be established to break the
monopoly of the People's Insurance Co of China (PICC), Beijing, which
he said created unfair competition between the PICC and its potential
competitors which was unfavourable for the healthy development of the
insurance market (WIR527/7).  Implementation decrees on the provisional
regulations for the operation of the Insurance Administration and the
administration of agents to supplement the new Insurance Law were
expected to be issued shortly, he added.

On 13 December, approval was announced for a joint venture life insurer
to be set up in Shanghai by Manufacturer's Life Insurance Co of Canada
(Manulife), Toronto.  Manulife has been present in China for 15 years,
and has representative offices in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu
and Guangzhou, and has demonstrated its goodwill by funding insurance
and actuarial training schemes as well as contributing to a "Help the
Poor" programme in Sichuan.

However, in an interview with China Information last month, Vice-
Premier Zhu Rongji said that although China was committed to opening
its financial and insurance markets to foreign capital and its social
insurance system was in its infancy, hurried approval of a large number
of licences for foreign insurers would not necessarily benefit the
development of China's insurance industry.  "Haste makes waste," he
remarked, and therefore "we have to be cautious and open the market
gradually."

NEW LIFE INSURER FOR THOSE RESETTLED BY DAM PROJECT

A new life insurer is to be set up to provide pension, health and
accident insurance for those resettled as a result of the Three Gorges
Dam project, an official of the China Three Gorges Economic Development
Corp (CTGEDC) said last month.  The dam will flood 19 counties and
cities in Sichuan and Hubei and displace about one million people.
Sanxia Life Insurance Co is expected to have initial capital of
Yuan500m (US$60m), with shareholders including Hua'neng Electric Group,
Shenzhen Dapeng Securities Co, Wuhan Iron & Steel Co, Taishan Group,
China Petrochemical Corp and Houwang Group.  It will operate throughout
the country, investing a proportion of the premiums received in the
Three Gorges Project itself, the official said, adding that "five or
six insurance companies from the US, Japan, Canada and other countries
have expressed an intention to be its partners."

NINE FOREIGN APPLICANTS

The Taiwanese Finance Ministry accepted nine applications from foreign
insurers to establish branches in the 1995 applications round.  Four
were from non-life companies (Asia Insurance Co Ltd, Hong Kong, Royal
Insurance plc, London, CIGNA Insurance Asia Pacific Ltd, Sydney and AXA
Assurances IARD, Paris) and five life and health insurers (National
Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, Melbourne, CUNA Mutual
Insurance Soc, Madison WI, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Delaware Inc,
Chubb Life Insurance Co of America, Warren NJ, and Aegon
Levensverzekering NV, The Hague).  Last year's was the first round in
which non-US insurers were permitted to make applications.  Nine US non-
life insurers and 14 life have been licensed since the market was
opened to them in 1986.  The government plans to reduce its 45% stake
in Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance Co and Taiwan Life Insurance Co, both

CCI ON MARKET REFORM

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry New Delhi has recommended to
the government that it create a strong, independent regulatory body
with the power to finalise regulations and prudential norms for the
insurance sector as it is opened to the private sector (WIR522/8).  It
also recommended that the government should divest its own holdings in
the industry before allowing new entrants, regarding it as essential
that the state-owned companies operate in a commercial framework
governed by the operation of the market, as only then would they assume
a customer-oriented focus and be prompted to improve operations and
quality of service, the Chamber said.  It favours the opening of the
market to foreign investors, but only through a locally-incorporated
subsidiary, and preferably in a joint venture with Indian partners.
The Malhotra Commission recommendation to restrict the maximum
shareholding of the promoter of a new insurance company to 40% may not
be sufficiently attractive to attract investment, the Chamber
considered, and suggested a higher limit of 75%.  Capital criteria also
needed review, it considered, recommending minimum capital of Rs1bn
(US$28m) be brought in stages.

Privatization of pension funds, with a strong regulatory body, was also
recommended.  In order to popularise individual pension plans,
contributions to prescribed limit should be fully exempted from tax,
the Chamber proposed.  For rural business, clear guidelines were
required given the high acquisition cost, and cross-subsidization was
necessary, the Chamber said.  Rural covers also needed to be
imaginatively designed.

MINIMUM CAPITAL INCREASED

The Ministry of Economy & Commerce believes that most local insurers
currently have less than minimum Dh50m (US$13.6m) paid up capital
eventually required under the recent Federal Law No13 which amended the
1984 Federal Law No9 on insurance companies and agents, but believes
that the new minimum will easily be met within the next six years
(WIR525/5).  Most foreign insurers in the UAE should have no difficulty
in meeting the requirement, it added.  According to the Emirates
Insurance Association, 27 of the 46 insurers operating in the
Federation are foreign.

Under the new legislation, insurers are required to increase their
minimum paid-up capital to Dh25m immediately, and Dh50m by the end of
the sixth year.  Those unable to do so have the option of merger or
closure.  Some insurers consider that of the 46 currently operating,
only about 30 can easily manage the latest increase.  Minimum capital
requirements have already increased  from Dh7.5m in 1993 to Dh10m in
1994.

MOTOR POOL PROPOSED

- High premium motor insurance has prompted the UAE Ministry of Economy
to ask insurers to form a pool for high-risk motor.  A spokesman said
the proposal was in response to a spate of complaints that some
insurers were demanding premiums of up to 25% of the value of the
vehicle.  The Ministry approached the Emirates Insurance Association to
study the idea in consultation with its members.  "We think this could
be a reasonable alternative to tackle the problem," the spokesman said.

Pool members would provide loss, damage, TPL and passenger liability
cover for hire cars, the vehicle renter, publicly-operated buses and
trucks of all types - all known high risk category vehicles - and any
other vehicle the pool decided to include.  The spokesman said the pool
would be able to draw on the collective experience of member insurers
to fix fair rates meeting the needs of both insurer and insured, as
well as saving legal expenses by pooling costs.  The pool would also be
able to arrange excess of loss treaty protection, he added.

MOTOR THEFT ESCALATING

Faced with mounting theft losses, Israeli insurers said in November
that motor premiums would have to increase by 7% unless the police took
measures to reverse the trend.  One third of total premium volume is
consumed by the costs of large scale organised theft of cars by Israeli
gangs for resale or cannibalisation in Palestinian autonomous areas.
In October, 3,000 cars were stolen according to police figures, the
highest monthly total ever.  The conclusion of the Oslo agreements on
Palestinian autonomy resulted in a 44% increase in vehicle thefts in
the first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period in 1994,
according to Israel Insurance Companies Association data.  Chairman
Rimon Ben-Shaul, in a letter to Premier Shimon Peres, claimed that if
nothing is done, insurers may stop providing cover for theft.

Once vehicles disappear into Gaza and other autonomous towns, little is
done to recover them.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian patrols instituted in
December have reportedly reduced the incidence of thefts of Israeli
cars destined for resale whole, but theft of vehicles to be broken down
and sold as parts has increased.  Palestinian sources suggest that a
frequently-practised form of insurance fraud is for Israeli citizens to
sell their vehicles to a Palestinian and then report it stolen to the
police and insurers.

EARTHQUAKE LIMIT RAISED

Since 1 January, Israelis have been able to buy earthquake insurance
for 100% of the value of their property rather than the former 75%.
Awareness of earthquake risk, which has been steadily increasing, was
highlighted by the Gulf of Aqaba event in late November (WIR526/13),
after which the Knesset Finance Committee sub-committee for insurance
held a special session to try to formulate new measures.  Premium for
earthquake cover has been raised since 1985 from 0.2% to 1.5%, with a
deductible of 10%.  A proposal is also under consideration by the sub-
committee for establishment of a fund into which all earthquake
premiums would be paid, partly with the intention of saving the cost of
reinsurance abroad, since earthquakes are rare.

Meanwhile, following a report that over 60% of Israel's 1.3m households
carry no home insurance, Isracard, one of Israel's two credit card
companies, has decided to offer contents cover to people travelling
abroad.  Policies will cover 30 days, the average length of holiday by
Israelis, extendable to two months.

GLASS-STEAGALL AMENDMENTS CLOSE TO VOTE

In a letter to Thomas Lebreque, president of The Bankers Roundtable, on
28 December, US House Banking Committee chairman James Leach said that
after resolution of the current budget dispute between Congress and the
Clinton administration, he will recommend that the House of
Representatives bill to reform the Glass-Steagall Act be brought to the
floor of the House for a vote.  The proposals would permit banks to
affiliate with firms involved in securities operations, and become more
involved in insurance activities.  Disputes between representatives of
insurers and banks have bedevilled the bill, the American Council of
Life Insurance (ACLI) accusing the banks of deliberately preventing a
compromise settlement.  At issue are state regulation of bancassurance
activity and proposed powers for the Comptroller of the Currency to
impose a five-year moratorium on banks' entry into insurance.  The
Roundtable is particularly concerned that state regulation of
bancassurance should not be more onerous than that of insurance
companies.  Mr Leach said that there was "massive agreement" on 98% of
the bill, and a vote should not be delayed by the other 2%, on which
agreement was perhaps impossible.

PEOPLE'S BANKCORP GRANTED INSURANCE LICENCE

People's Bankcorp Inc of Marietta OH has been granted a licence by the
Ohio insurance department to distribute life, motor and property
insurance through a wholly-owned insurance agency, provided that
insurance activity is physically separated from banking activity in its
branches, the majority of policies are sold to non-customers of the
bank, and customers are not required to buy insurance from the bank for
any reason.  The licence is opposed by the Independent Insurance Agents
of  Ohio, which will challenge its validity in court.

AMENDED LAW IN FORCE

The Insurance Amendment Act came into effect on 31 December.  As well
as increased minimum capital requirements, and more stringent licensing
requirements, the amendments increase the freedom of insurers to invest
in reserves.  Compulsory reinsurance cessions to Kenya Reinsurance
Corp, Nairobi, are to be phased out between this year and 1999.
Speaking at a reception last month, deputy insurance commissioner Sammy
Makove said that in future, the commission would publish annual lists
of insurance industry participants with valid licences, East Africa
Standard reported.  The publication of such a list in September
appeared to de-register hundreds of insurers, brokers, assessors and
surveyors (WIR523/7).  Some brokers and assessors de-registered at that
time continued to operate with some insurers, Mr Makove said, adding
that the Insurance Commission would continue to enforce licence
requirements.  Insurers should refuse business from unlicensed agents,
he added.

Of the two insurers "de-listed" in September, Mr Makove said that Co-
operative Insurance Service Ltd (CIS), Nairobi, had now met all
necessary requirements.  An auditor's report on state-owned Kenya
National Assurance Co, Nairobi (WICR181/20), was expected to be
completed by mid-December.

Meanwhile, insurers and brokers are in conflict over payment of the
compulsory 0.35% levy on gross direct premiums introduced by the
government in 1994 to fund the College of Insurance.  Attempts by
insurers to pass the costs on to policyholders are being resisted by
brokers, who allege such a step is illegal and are threatening court
action.  Cynical insurers suggest the complaining brokers merely wish
to be paid for collecting the tax.

NEW SUPERVISION COMMISSION

In December the Ugandan parliament passed legislation to establish an
independent Uganda Insurance Commission to oversee the industry,
responsible to the Finance Ministry.  Insurance was formerly supervised
by the Central Bank along with all other financial institutions.  The
Commission will issue regulations on the conduct of insurance and
reinsurance and intermediary activity, licence individuals involved in
insurance, and deal with complaints by policyholders.

Minister of State for Finance Matthew Rukikaire told parliament that
existing insurance legislation was "grossly inadequate".  Minimum
capital for a locally-owned insurer will increase to USh200m
(US$198,400), an increase which it is hoped will be sufficient to
remove from the market so-called "briefcase" companies (also known
locally as "quark insurers", presumably because they vanish with the
speed of light).  Sebaana Kizito MP, head of Statewide Insurance Co
Ltd, Kampala, argued for an increase to USh500m, a measure he said was
supported by the Uganda Insurance Association and the Uganda Insurance
Institute.  Foreign-owned insurers will be required to have minimum
capital of USh1bn for life or non-life, USh2bn for composite companies
and USh2.5bn for reinsurance activity.

MORE CATS, LOSSES LOWER

While indications have become stronger during 1995 that the gradually
changing world climate is having an effect on the occurrence of natural
catastrophes, especially floods and windstorms, insurers suffered fewer
losses from such events last year, Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG,
Munich, said in its annual report on catastrophes.  The year 1995 had
provided a "breathing space for the insurance industry, which has been
having to cope with particularly heavy claims burdens from natural
catastrophes for nearly ten years," it added.

The company also drew attention to an important and mainly positive,
factor: the long-lasting El Niuo effect, a natural cyclical warming of
the tropical Pacific, came to an end in 1995.  El Niuo had resulted in
extreme drought in Australia and heavy rainfall on the US Pacific
coast, but had also contributed to a reduction of hurricane activity in
the Caribbean.

According to Munich Re, the number of events it categorises as natural
catastrophes rose from 580 in 1994 to about 600 in 1995 which claimed a
total of 18,000 lives, up from 10,150.  In terms of economic losses,
1995 was a record year, the total of US$180bn dwarfing the $65bn of
1994, the previous worst year.  In 1995, however, insured losses
reached only $14bn, compared to $28bn in 1992 and $17bn in 1994.  This
resulted from the fact that insurance density in the regions most badly
affected in 1995 was comparatively low.

This applied in particular to what was, in economic terms, the most
expensive natural catastrophe to date, the Great Hanshin Earthquake
which struck Kobe on 17 January and caused overall losses of about
$100bn.  Although of only medium intensity, it reduced parts of the
industrial and port city to rubble and ashes.  More than 6,000 people
were killed and 300,000 left homeless.  Other notable events during
1995 were the January floodings of the rivers Rhine, Moselle and Maas,
only 13 months after similar occurrences, and tropical windstorms in
the Caribbean, the US and East Asia.

DISASTERS BILL UNDER FIRE

At hearings before the US House Transportation & Infrastructure
Committee's Water Resources & Environment subcommittee at the beginning
of December, the proposed Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Act
came under severe criticism by Rep Mike Parker (R-MS) as "a public-
sector solution to a private-sector problem".

The legislation proposes the establishment of a private sector insurer
to provide homeowners' cover and reinsurance in areas at high risk from
natural disasters.  Mr Parker said that a clause which would permit the
entity to borrow from federal government should its reserves be
depleted by a major catastrophe would make the government liable for
the insurance industry's risks.

In his testimony to the Committee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Mozelle Thompson recommended an approach combining state-
regulated mandatory disaster insurance with a federal reinsurance
programme rather than the federal corporation proposed in the Act.  Mr
Thompson feared that the proposed National Disaster Insurance Corp
could develop into a monopoly, placing policyholders at a disadvantage.
 He said the Clinton administration feared that the Act could expose
the government to unlimited liabilities, and had reservations about the
financial viability of the scheme.

He proposed instead development of "a required phased-in policy" for
dwellings for up to four families mortgaged with federally-related
lenders or secondary issuers, administered by states, together with a
federal excess of loss programme through the mechanism of an annual
auction of contracts covering a proportion of the loss from a single
natural disaster, triggered by industry-wide insured losses and with a
base price set in line with risk plus a cost of capital adjustment.
The programme would be designed to phase itself out between years 15
and 20 of operation.

WINDSTORM MARKET ASSISTANCE PROPOSAL

intended to create a windstorm market assistance programme to improve
the availability of insurance for homeowners on the NJ coast, she told
the New Jersey Senate judiciary committee.  "If a co-operative,
voluntary effort by the industry fails to achieve the desired result, I
am prepared to consider moving forward with a regulatory approach on
behalf of our citizens," she said.  Her proposal would involve insurers
assuming liability in rotation for underwriting cover for homeowners
unable to obtain it.

STORM INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO RISE

In mid-November, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association filed a
request to the Insurance Department for an average rate increase of
67%, the first since 1981.  The annual premium for a house in Miami
Beach valued at US$113,000 and insured by the Association would rise
from $185 to $461, and in St. Petersburg Beach from $222 to $407, but
in St. Augustine Beach, the premium would fall from $222 to $205.  The
Association said that an independent actuarial assessment had
recommended an average increase of 124%, and that it had incurred a
loss in excess of $192m for claims in 1995.  Its rates are currently
significantly below those for other residual markets for homeowners in
Florida and in other states, as well as some rates in the private
sector, it said.  The Association insures 223,000 policyholders and has
total exposure of $35bn.

TAX BREAK "CRITICAL" FOR EQ PLAN

A proposed new earthquake insurance programme in California, given
preliminary approval by the state legislature on the last day of its
session in October, will require confirmation of tax-exempt status from
the Internal Revenue Service to be viable, deputy insurance
commissioner Richard Wiebe said.  This would force the state to
consider other alternatives, such as an involuntary insurance pool, he
added.

The proposed California Earthquake Authority will have access to funds
of up to US$10.5bn.  The California Insurance Department proposes a
premium rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of insured house value.  An initial
$1bn in funding for the Authority would be provided by insurers,
together with a guarantee of $3bn in the event of claims.  $2bn in
reinsurance would be bought in excess of this figure.  Last month
Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush toured Bermuda, London, New
York and Zurich in search of potential capacity, where reaction was
favourable, Mr Wiebe said.  Brokers for the reinsurance element will be
EW Blanch Holdings Inc.  Losses above $6bn will be covered by an issue
of state bonds for $1bn, and a further $1.5bn in bonds placed on the
New York stock market by Morgan Stanley as lead manager, co-managed by
Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.  A further $2bn would be paid by the
insurance industry on a contingency basis, bringing the Authority's
total capital to $10.5bn.

The Insurance Department hopes to deliver an interim report on progress
of the plan in the near future, and secure final approval by the end of
March.

"FAIR TORRENT" OF SNOW CLAIMS

While blizzard conditions brought a white Christmas to Scotland,
Northern Ireland, Wales and northern parts of England, the subsequent
New Year thaw has caused estimated damage of #350m (US$545m) according
to loss adjusters, The Balcome Group, London.  The group's initial
estimate of #500m in insured damage was refuted last week by the
Association of British Insurers (ABI), London.  Share analysts
variously predict the likely eventual cost to UK insurers at about
#400m, or #20m to #30m off the net profit of each of the UK composites.

UK insurers are receiving a "fair torrent" of claims after this "major
incident", an ABI spokesman told WIR, but insured damage was more
likely to total #100m to #200m rather than #300m to #500m.  It will be
several weeks before the official ABI estimate is known.  The majority
of claims are expected in Scotland, Northern Ireland and north east
England, primarily for household damage following burst pipes,
commercial water damage and business interruption.

Significant claims are also expected to arise from commercial users of
water following the failure of water supplies, he added, although some
businesses would be self-insured or lack appropriate cover and there
would be significant uninsured damage for householders in Scotland.

Increased weather damage claims recorded over the past week are still
within normal expectations and unlikely to lead to higher premiums,
according to UK insurers.  A spokesman for Royal Insurance plc, London,
told WIR that an increased number of claims were coming in, but it was
too early to estimate the total number.  Claims would be concentrated
in Scotland and north east of England, unlike in 1991 and the 1980s
when cold weather affected the whole country, he added.  Royal expects
the greatest number of claims from household damage, but commercial
claims to cost more.  Commercial Union plc, London, said it was too
early for definite numbers, but claims were likely to be "more than
usual".  As of 3 January, the company had received 1,500 claims.  Sun
Alliance Group plc, London, said the number of claims would be
significantly "up, not under".

BUILDING CODE PROPOSED

Insurers in the Caribbean region have been reminded by the Council of
Caribbean Engineering Organisations (CCEO) of the need to improve risk
management methods if they wish to achieve better rates from
international reinsurers.  One way, it suggested, is for insurers to
throw their weight behind the introduction of mandatory building codes
as a means of minimising damage from natural hazards.  Only three
Caribbean countries, two of them British colonies (the Bahamas,
Anguilla and Monserrat) have such codes.

The Barbados-based CCEO is in the final phase of drawing up a
comprehensive Caribbean Uniform Building Code (CUBIC), which it would
like adopted by all the other 12 members of CARICOM, the Caribbean free
trade area.  The code will outline the design and construction
parameters for all new buildings.  The organisation would like the
insurance industry to be more active in pressing governments to enforce
the Code, a spokesman said, and with the Caribbean just having
experienced its worst hurricane season for 62 years and insurers still
counting the costs, it feels the industry, with the prodding of
reinsurers, may now be ready to take notice.

Tony Gibbs, a senior Caribbean engineer who has been one of the most
active in promoting CUBIC, said Caribbean insurers would be doing
themselves a favour by supporting mandatory building standards, if only
because "it will remove an easy excuse for the high catastrophe
insurance premiums the region must bear at the present time".

One reason why most Caribbean governments have not moved to enforce the
Code is a desire to avoid raising building costs.  Mr Gibbs said that a
recent study showed that were CUBIC adopted, only between 0.24% and
2.2% would be added to total costs.

IN THE COURTS

On 21 December, Mr Justice Gatehouse found "with considerable
hesitation" that no competent members' agent could have placed names on
Feltrim syndicate 540/2 in 1990 (although some categories of names
failed to demonstrate their case), and "with more confidence" that the
names case failed with regard to syndicate 847.

On the same day, the Court of Appeal upheld the "pay now, sue later"
ruling by Mr Justice Rix in Marchant & Eliot Ltd v Higgins (WIR524/9).
Lloyd's served approximately 300 writs on recalcitrant names the same
day.

On 6 December, Lloyd's was also successful in a High Court action, also
heard by Mr Justice Gatehouse, in which Diana Aldrich sought to prevent
drawdown on her Lloyd's deposit because she claimed to have been
fundamentally mistaken about the nature of Lloyd's when she became a
name.  The case was summarily dismissed.

On 3 January, the Colorado Court of Appeal partially reversed a Denver
District Court preventing drawdown on Colorado names' deposits in an
action initiated by the state securities commissioner.  Meanwhile, an
outline settlement with the 700-odd members of the American Names
Association has been agreed in principle by Lloyd's.

As a result of the decision of Mr Justice Cresswell in Henderson et al
v Merrett Syndicates Ltd et al (WIR524/1), E&O insurers served the
victorious Pulbrook 334 (1985) names with a notice of intention to
avoid payment (WIR506/1).  The names have begun liquidation proceedings
against Pulbrook U/W management Ltd, London.

The appeal by the Gooda Walker Action Group on the issue of the
taxation of awards will be heard by the House of Lords on 16 January.

VETO TO BE OVERTURNED?

President Bill Clinton decided in December to veto congressional
proposals to limit court awards for liability damages (WIR525/11).  The
House of Representatives voted to override the veto on its bill, which
as part of the so-called Contract with America would limit damages in
all cases, including medical malpractice.  The Senate appeared likely
to try to take similar action, a two-thirds majority being required to
overturn the veto.  The bill would be the first to be enacted after a
Clinton presidential veto.

A joint congressional committee had met briefly on 15 December to try
to reconcile the differences between the House bill and that in the
Senate, which is restricted to product liability.  No date was set for
a further meeting, the staff of committee members being requested to
reach agreement on as many issues as possible beforehand.

CALIFORNIA PROPOSES NO-FAULT

Three initiatives to be put before the California electorate in March
could have important implications for insurers.  Propositions 200 to
202, which are being presented as a package by proponents, would
introduce no fault motor insurance in the state (200), require in most
cases that the losing party in class and shareholder actions alleging
breach of securities legislation to pay the costs of the victor (201),
and limit contingency fees to 15% if defendants in tort cases offer
early settlement in response to a mandatory demand letter (202).

Meanwhile, California motor insurers are lobbying against new anti-
redlining measures announced by Insurance Commissioner Charles
Quackenbush, which will force insurers to apply greater weight to
driving records and less to where the vehicle is garaged.  Insurers
suggest that the cost of reconfiguring databases will be huge and
passed on to policyholders, and that premium increases of up to 175%
may result.

NEW WORKERS' COMP SCHEME

A new Workers' Compensation Act was passed by the Argentine Congress on
3 October, and will come into effect in early April.  While previous
legislation referred only to injuries at work and employer's liability,
the new law also covers loss prevention.  The main features of the new
legislation are

- insurance is made compulsory, but employers may also choose to self-
insure if they can demonstrate sufficient financial strength to pay
monetary benefits and the ability to deliver required medical and other
services (medical care and medication; prostheses and orthopaedics;
rehabilitation; occupational retraining and funeral services).  The
ability of employers to provide benefits in kind if uninsured is
currently unsupervised

- employers are relieved of civil liability unless there is proof of a
wrongful, intentional act.  Under existing legislation, workers can
choose between accepting the scheduled compensation or going to court,
leading over the years to tens of thousands of cases with enormous
losses for insurers and reinsurers

- a new type of specialised workers' compensation insurer, known as
ARTs, is to be created.  These must have a minimum paid-in capital of
Pesos3m.  General insurers who write workers' comp may continue doing
so if they provide the new services provided by the act.  ARTs and
insurers will choose which industrial sectors they will cover, but
cannot turn down any request for cover from employers in those sectors

LANDMARK MEDMAL RULING

The Supreme Court of India has held that patients who receive
incompetent service either from doctors or hospitals can claim damages
under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 (CPA), leading doctors to seek
cover against potential liabilities.  The National Consumer Commission
(NCC), constituted under the CPA, ruled in April 1992 that the
provision of paid medical assistance by hospitals and medical
professionals fell within the scope of the term "service" as defined in
section 2(1)(0) of the CPA.  In the event of any deficiency in the
performance of such services, the aggrieved party may file a complaint
to the Consumer Forum under the CPA.  The NCC decision was challenged
by the Medical Council of India.

The Supreme Court (Justices Kuldip Singh, SC Agarwal and BL Hansaria)
upheld the NCC ruling, excepting only services rendered by a doctor
practising free of charge to every patient under a contract of personal
service, by way of consultation, diagnosis or treatment.

The judges commented that a contract of personal service must be
distinguished from a contract of professional service.  They also
observed that they were unable to support the view that merely because
medical practitioners belong to the medical profession, they are
outside the purview of the provisions of the Act and the services
rendered by them are not covered by it.  The normal tests of negligence
should apply.  The court further observed that while immunity from
damages could be granted on grounds of public interest, the trend was
for restricting of such immunity.

The verdict brings to an end years of controversy generated by
differing decisions by various High Courts.  Among the possible reliefs
which could be granted plaintiffs are return of charges paid,
compensation for loss or injury suffered due to negligence and
remedying of the defective or deficient service.  The Supreme Court
decision evoked a mixed reaction.  The Honorary General Secretary of
the India Medical Association, Dr JC Sobti, pointed out that henceforth
private doctors would increasingly seek insurance cover on the lines of
the US system.

A random survey of private nursing homes in Delhi revealed that the
majority of doctors had already bought a professional indemnity policy
or planned to do so, and many of those already covered planned to
increase the sum insured.  At one home, all 35 medical consultants had
been instructed by the hospital director to take out cover for Rs1m
(US$28,230) each, while the director had already sought cover for
himself and paramedical staff at a cost of about Rs40,000 in annual
premium.

Liberia 
[DOCUMENT] Harassment of Journalists Intensifies 

Africa News Service 
January 15, 1996 (19960115)
 
   New York - Text of several recent news alerts by the New York-based 
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). 
   On 12 January 1996, Stanton Peabody, acting managing director of the 
"Daily Observer", was released after Press Union of Liberia attorneys, 
through the Justice & Peace Commission, filed a bill of habeus corpus on 
his behalf. Peabody was released on bail of $20,000 Liberian (US$ 400). 
   Peabody will return to court on 16 January, as will editor-in- chief 
of the "Daily Observer" James Seitua. However, the two journalists will 
be tried separately on charges of "criminal malevolence." 
   Immediately after the court ordered Peabody's release, Director of 
National Police Joseph Tate ordered seven police officers to re-arrest 
him in the courthouse. However, the presiding judge announced that any 
re-arrest would place Tate in contempt of court. Peabody plans to remain 
at home until the upcoming court date.
   On 11 January 1996, representatives of the Press Union of Liberia and 
the management of the "Daily Observer" obtained a bill of release for 
James Seitua, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Observer". Bail in the 
amount of $25,000 Liberian dollars ($350 US) was paid. Under the 
conditions of his release, Seitua cannot travel outside of Monrovia, and 
must report daily to the police until the matter is resolved.
   The charge against Seitua, as stated in his bill of release, is 
"criminal malevolence." No charges have been filed against him in a 
court of law. On 29 December 1995, the "Daily Observer" published an 
article that disputed the claim made by United Revolutionary Front of 
Sierra Leone spokesperson Eddie Hebron that he was interviewed in the 
Ivory Coast by the British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of 
America. The article claimed that Hebron was in Monrovia, the Liberian 
capital, during the interviews. James Seitua was subsequently arrested 
on 9 January and detained; he has since been released on bail. Stanton 
Peabody, in an attempt to intervene on Seitua's behalf, was also 
arrested on 10 January. He remains in detention.
   On 8 January 1996, D. Sompon Weah II, reporter for "The News", and 
"The News" photographer Pewee S. Flomoku were attacked in Po River 
(northwestern Liberia), where they were covering skirmishes between West 
Africa peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) and warring factions of the United 
Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J).
   The attack occurred shortly after their arrival, as they were 
recording the state of security in the region. At the directive of the 
executive director of the Liberia Refugees Repatriation & Resettlement 
Commission, Mrs. Weade Kobbah Wreh, they were beaten by her personal 
bodyguards and some ECOMOG soldiers. Flomoku's camera was destroyed.

Nigeria
[DOCUMENT] Press Group Condemns Attacks on Press 

Africa News Service
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   New York - Statement by the New York-based Committee to Protect 
Journalists.
  The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan advocate of 
press freedom, condemns the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor 
in chief of best-selling Lagos-based "Tell" magazine, and the recent 
escalation of attacks against Nigeria's independent press. 
   Igiebor, the recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 
1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at 
his home in Lagos. SSS agents also confiscated 20,000 copies of "Tell" 
magazine's Christmas Day edition with the cover story "Abacha is 
Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition." On December 27, SSS agents made a 
failed attempt to search his office for the company's tax records and 
staff pay records.
   Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without 
charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for articles 
published in Tell criticizing the military government. During 
interrogations at Lagos State Command of the SSS facility in Shangisha, 
Igiebor repeatedly stated that he receives financial support from 
neither outsiders nor Nigerian citizens, and that any information he 
receives arrives by mail. 
   CPJ also denounces the following attacks against the independent 
press during the last two weeks of 1995:
   * On December 31, the office of the magazine division of the 
Independent Communications Network Limited, publishers of "The News," 
"Tempo," and "Tempofootball," was torched by arsonists using a petrol 
bomb. According to Dapo Olorunyomi, editor -in-chief of "The News," the 
fire destroyed property (including a new line of Gateway 2000 Pentium 
computers) worth millions of naira. The arsonists managed to escape.
   The office, located on the first floor of Tejumola House in Ikeja, 
Lagos, houses the newsroom and production center of the three magazines. 
It was the only floor of the four-story building that was torched. 
Management expects publication of The News and Tempo to be suspended for 
approximately two weeks.
    On December 19, photojournalists Peter Obe, Bayo Ewuoso, Abiodun 
Ajala and Segun Olakitan were assaulted and detained by police during 
the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) rally in Lagos. Their offense 
was photographing the confrontation between NADECO supporters and the 
over five hundred policemen who shot tear gas into the crowd to disperse 
the protesters. 
   Ewuoso, a senior photojournalist with "AM News" was severely beaten 
by over ten policemen who later transported him to the Surulere Police 
Station for interrogation. Ajala of "This Day" newspaper, Olakitan of 
"Tell" magazine, and veteran photojournalist Obe were also beaten and 
seriously injured by police. Ajala and Olakitan were rushed to a nearby 
hospital for treatment.
   On December 16, ten security operatives lay siege to the "AM News" 
office, demanding to know the whereabouts of editor-in-chief Bayo 
Onanuga. They were seeking Onanuga to place him under arrest. Onanuga 
remains in hiding. The security operatives reportedly did the same at 
the offices of "Tell" magazine. 
   On December 16, all 55,000 copies of "Tell" were seized at the 
printing house. The seizure followed the magazine's publication of an 
article titled "The Release of [Chief Moshood] Abiola: The World Waits 
On [General Sani] Abacha." 
   On December 15, arsonists torched the circulation department of "The 
Guardian" newspaper. Damage was minimal because the fire was quickly 
brought under control.
   On December 15, Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi 
Isaac, reporters and contributors to the paper, were held for 
questioning by Lagos police.
   Finally, CPJ intensified its call for the release of the four 
journalists (Christine Anyanwu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle 
Ajibade) who were convicted to fifteen years in jail for their alleged 
participation in an alleged coup plot against the military regime.

Uganda
UK Report Predicts Museveni Win In '96 Polls

The Monitor (Kampala)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Gerald Owachi

   Kampala - A report issued by the authoritative London-based Economist 
Intelligence Unit (EIU) has predicted a Museveni victory in the forthcoming 
presidential elections.
   "It will be very surprising if President Yoweri Museveni, is not returned 
to office next April as the elected president,: the just released 1995 4th 
quarter country report, says.
   The report, however, doubts whether all sections of society will accept the 
legitimacy of his election.
   At the same time it casts a shadow over the loyalty of the army towards any 
other person other than Museveni. "The army remains Mr. Museveni's trump 
card," it states, therefore disqualifying the possibilities of the army 
supporting any other democratically elected government.
   It also suggests that the legislative elections in May 1996 will produce a 
better political balance in parliament, and thereby defuse some political 
tension.
   According to the report, NRM is already confident of victories in Karamoja 
-- because NRM has allowed the K'jongs to keep their guns. Busoga--VP 
Kazibwe's home area, Bugisu, Kapchorwa and his traditional base the South-
west.
   The report further states that, "Mr Museveni is even trying to tempt former 
president, Idi Amin, back to Uganda in order to capitalise on his support in 
the North West.
   The EIU report which briefly portrays the current political and economic 
state of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, cites the new constitution and the 
escalating military expenditure of the Uganda government as a possible source 
of disagreement between the donor community and the Government.
   According to the report, "the USA clearly believes that a five-year wait 
before the issue of multi-partyism can again be tested is too long. It adds 
that European countries previously reluctant to show their resentment on the 
matter, have now formally joined the US in pressing for an early 
constitutional amendment.
   "The government reduced the defence share of budget expenditure from 36% in 
1990/91 to 13% in 1991/92, but then raised it again during the following two 
years and brought it up to 30% this year [1995}," the reports notes. The donor 
community is not at all happy with this trend regardless of the insecurity in 
the north and along the Sudan border.
   The report says that the rift between president Moi of Kenya and Museveni 
which used to be portrayed as a largely personal matter, has developed into "a 
more substantial rift based on the different approaches to systems of 
government." It blames the failure to achieve regional cooperation on this cat 
and mouse relationship between these two leaders.
   The strike by medical workers last September is cited in the report as a 
possible beginning of demands to be floated by the public sector workers. 
This, the report goes on, would result into an inflationary wage spiral that 
would threaten the climate of economic stability which has been achieved in 
recent years.
   It is expected to be compounded by unfavourable economic prospects 
especially following the recent decline in coffee prices. The end of this 
coffee boom was marked by the October fall in the value of the shilling, after 
a two year spell of stability, the EIU report notes.

South Africa
Foreign Trip Could Clear Constitutional Logjam 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Marion Edmunds

   Johannesburg - Over drinks in hotel bars in Germany last week, new 
friendships were formed that bode well for the writing of the final 
constitution.
   During a week-long, fact-finding tour to Germany, Inkatha Freedom 
Party (IFP), African National Congress (ANC) and National Party (NP) 
politicians were able, for the first time since the IFP walked out of 
the Constitutional Assembly last year, to talk to each other -- 
sometimes late into the night -- about South Africa's constitutional 
future.
   Back home this week, the delegates were cautiously optimistic about 
the effect the mission would have on the constitution-writing process 
and, in particular, on the stand-off between the IFP and the ANC over 
international mediation.
   At this stage -- and it is early days yet -- the signs of a new 
interparty rapport are good, with even the IFP delegates taking a more 
amiable line than usual.
   IFP negotiator, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela, said 
this week he had already briefed party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi about 
the trip and Buthelezi had been "positively surprised" at what he had to 
say.
   Mzimela said of the trip: "I think we got the chance to interact 
across party lines ... if the group had had the power to make decisions, 
certainly there would have been movement on issues because we were able 
to understand a lot of things collectively."
   Mzimela believed there would be follow-up talks between parties on 
what had been learnt, but would not commit himself on whether the IFP 
would return to the Constitutional Assembly to participate fully in the 
final, and most important, phases of the constitutional negotiations.
   He said international mediation had not been mentioned during the 
visit, and in any case "the media have overplayed the whole issue".
   "If we in South Africa could solve our problems, we would not need 
international mediation ... what we did realise abroad was that the 
international mediation was not just an IFP and ANC problem, it was a 
problem to be resolved by all the parties," he said.
   A source in the German delegation said that a particularly good 
relationship had been established between the three M's -- Mzimela, 
National Party Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer, and his ANC 
deputy Valli Moosa -- the same trio who met to resolve the international 
mediation crisis last year, and abandoned the attempt in bad humour.
   Democratic Party constitutional expert Colin Eglin said this week the 
trip could be intepreted as a "diluted form of international mediation", 
as it was away from home and because they learnt from the Germans.
   A report on the tour is being drawn up by the three technical 
advisers who accompanied the team. It is possible that this report will 
form the basis of further discussions with the IFP and parties within 
the Constitutional Assembly.

South Africa
Moseneke To Lead PAC?  

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Vuyo Mvoko

   Johannesburg - Former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) deputy president 
and now chairman of Telkom, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, has been 
approached to lead the party.
    This was confirmed by PAC MP Patricia de Lille late this week. De 
Lille, however, said she did not yet know what his response has been.
   This follows the resignation of general secretary Maxwell 
Nemadzivhanani early this week, which renewed attention to the troubled 
party.
   Nemadzivhanani said he had received a lot of criticism from party 
members, and so felt he should hand over to other "capable" people. He 
told the Mail & Guardian he planned to look for work in the government, 
but he was keeping his options open.
   Since its disastrous results in both the 1994 national elections and 
last year's local government elections, the PAC has been plagued by 
allegations of leadership ineptitude which were particularly directed at 
its dour president Clarence Makwetu.
   Makwetu held on to the party's senior position by eight votes in 
1994, against a last-minute challenge from Motsoko Pheko, who had 
arrived from overseas on the penultimate day of the party's four-day 
congress in Mmabatho. Pheko is now deputy president and most likely to 
be elected president.
   Last month the PAC's student wing the Pan Africanist Students 
Organisation (Paso), declared the party was in an "anarchical state of 
affairs" and was experiencing a "leadership crisis".
   Paso called for the ousting of Makwetu, Maxwell Nemadzivhanani (whom 
they described as "arrogant and devisive"), MP Gora Ibrahim, and former 
deputy president Johnson Mlambo.
   Following Paso's call the PAC National Executive Committee decided to 
change the status of the party's annual general conference, scheduled 
for Easter weekend, to a congress where a new leadership can be elected.
   De Lille confirmed there was a lot of agitation within the party, but 
denied it was crumbling to the ground.
   Moseneke told the M&G: "No. I decline. It's great to know I'm still 
loved out there, but I have no interest in a political career."

South Africa
Report takes WWF To 'Tusk' 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch and Rehana Rossouw

   Johannesburg - The Department of Military Intelligence was heavily 
involved in the illegal sale of elephant tusks from Angola between 1978 
and 1986 -- and a commission of inquiry, established by the South 
African Defence Force in 1988 to probe these deals, was a white-wash.
   This is the main finding of the Kumbleben Commission which this week 
released a 200-page report about its inquiry into the smuggling of rhino 
horn and elephant tusks in South Africa. The commission was appointed by 
President Nelson Mandela in October 1994.
   Justice ME Kumbleben also criticises Operation Lock, the 
controversial covert operation by former British special forces officers 
to combat poaching in Southern Africa in the late 1980s, and says the 
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the head of its South African branch must 
take some responsibility for the behaviour of this unit.
   The Kumbleben report finds there was large-scale destruction of 
wildlife, including elephants and rhinos, in north-eastern Namibia and 
Angola as a result of the 1980s wars in those countries. Most of the 
ivory and rhino horn obtained by poachers during this period was 
illegally exported through South Africa by SADF military intelligence.
   The Roos Commission, set up by the defence force in 1988 to probe 
press reports of military involvement in the illicit trade, claimed that 
only about 500 tusks captured by Unita from poachers were handled by the 
military from 1978 onwards.
   Kumbleben describes this commission as a "charade" designed to 
exonerate the SADF.
   The report lambasts a scheme hatched by conservationists in the late 
1980s to use former British special forces officers to combat poaching 
in Southern Africa. It describes Operation Lock -- financed by Prince 
Bernhard of the Netherlands and set up by John Hanks (then the WWF's 
project manager at its headquarters in Geneva) -- as being "accountable 
to no one".
   Kumbleben also suggests that more than 100 rhino horns provided to 
these officers by the Natal Parks Board and conservation authorities in 
Namibia for supposed sting operations were later misappropriated by 
members of Operation Lock.
   Sections of the report contain extracts from a secret document 
(called Q in the report) which shows that the anti-poaching operation 
was infiltrated by members of South African military intelligence after 
it set up headquarters in South Africa. This was apparently designed to 
ensure Operation Lock could be "put to good use by the necessary South 
African information collecting departments".
   The document claims that Colonel Ian Crooke, the commander of 
Operation Lock, had offered to help in "the monitoring of anti-South 
African bodies which are situated overseas".
   Evidence presented to the commission suggests that document Q -- 
which appears to be an internal Operation Lock memo -- was drawn up by a 
South African military intelligence officer called Mike Richards, who 
had managed to infiltrate the operation.
   Kumbleben questions claims by Hanks that the WWF, the world's biggest 
conservation NGO, was not aware of Operation Lock's activities.
    It goes on to stress, however, that "those responsible for putting 
Lock in place did not have the ulterior motive of Lock functioning as 
some sort of espionage or intelligence collecting agency for the RSA. It 
was intended by them to be an anti-poaching or anti-smuggling operation 
and nothing more. It may have later been contaminated by other 
objectives and considerations referred to in document Q."
   Hanks said his involvement in purchasing rhino horn to entrap 
smugglers was a sincere attempt to save Africa's dwindling black rhino 
stocks.
   "It was nothing to do with Operation Lock, it was a totally different 
project. The WWF had done nothing wrong in this regard."
   With the assistance of Prince Bernhard, Hanks raised R250 000 to 
purchase rhino horn to trap smugglers. Although the horn was never again 
accounted for, Hanks believes it was money well spent. "There was a 
group of people tested to do the undercover work. They never reported to 
the WWF."
   Hanks said he could not comment further until he had read the 
Kumbleben report.

De Kock Trial To Focus On Mlangeni Assassination 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Mail & Guardian reporter

   Johannesburg - The Eugene de Kock trial reopens on Monday with a 
cross-examination of former Vlakplaas policeman Joe Mamasela who is 
expected to provide the court with details about police involvement in a 
number of political murders in the 1980s.
   The trial will then focus on the assassination of human rights lawyer 
Bheki Mlangeni whose head was blown apart by a bomb planted in a 
cassette recorder.
   A number of witnesses -- including the man who manufactured the 
Mlangeni bomb -- are likely to tell the court that De Kock, former 
commander of the notorious Vlakplaas unit, arranged for the deadly 
parcel to be sent to his old enemy, renegade policeman Dirk Coetzee, in 
London.
   Coetzee was unable to pay demurrage costs in Lusaka and it was then 
sent back to lawyer Bheki Mlangeni who had been listed as the sender. 
When Mlangeni received the package, he placed a cassette in the 
recorder, put on the headphones and detonated the device.
   The Transvaal Attorney General's office may interrupt the trial after 
it resumes in order to charge De Kock in connection with the smuggling 
of weapons to Inkatha Freedom Party paramilitary camps during the early 
1990s.
   Senior IFP officials -- including Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu -- 
will be implicated in the gun-running operations while the name of 
Inkatha senator Phillip Powell is expected to feature prominently in the 
case.
   The Mail & Guardian is aware that the AG's office is also working on 
prosecutions against three police generals mentioned by Judge Richard 
Goldstone as having been involved in dirty tricks operations. These are 
Krappies Engelbrecht, Basie Smit and Johan le Roux.
   Officials in the AG's office declined to comment on the matter.
   These cases are due to be finalised this year.

Is TV Relaunching ... Or Re-sinking? 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy and Justin Pearce 

   Johannesburg - The grand plan for a spectacular relaunch of the SABC 
to shake off the last vestiges of its heritage as a bastion of Afrikaner 
nationalism, has been dampened by a last-ditch bid by the language 
lobby.
   When the Rapportryers and other bodies dedicated to the protection of 
the Afrikaans language signalled that they would fight -- through the 
courts, if necessary -- any downgrading of their language on the 
national broadcaster, the Independent Broadcasting Authority had to sit 
up and take note. In the interim Constitution, the Afrikaans language 
lobby has a powerful weapon, and the Independent Broadcasting Authority 
(IBA), which had been relaxed about the formalities of SABC's planned 
changes, would be vulnerable to legal attack if it did not follow the 
letter of the law and hold public hearings, which would allow the 
language lobby to pursue its objections.
   That sparked off this week's power struggle between the two premier 
bodies of South African broadcasting, both of which are determined to 
show that they are in charge of reshaping the public broadcaster.
   The SABC for the moment lacks IBA approval to amend its television 
broadcast licences in such a way as to allow the corporation to spread 
South African languages equitably across all three new channels as it 
had planned to do next month. The IBA is refusing to give this approval 
until public hearings have been held in terms of the Broadcasting Act.
   The SABC is to press on with its plans to relaunch its TV services on 
February 4, but the still-unchanged broadcast licences mean the 
corporation now has two weeks to revise schedules which took months to 
compile.
   The IBA and SABC accuse each other of provoking this crisis. The SABC 
said it had held discussions with the IBA as early as September and that 
the regulatory body was "well aware" of what was coming.
   IBA sources in turn said the authority had repeatedly informed SABC 
top management of the need to make a formal application to amend its 
broadcast licence.
   The SABC further alleges that, based on discussions held between the 
parties, there "did not seem to be a problem" until earlier this week 
when press reports alerted the SABC to the IBA's decision against 
granting an immediate amendment. The possibility of legal irregularities 
in the SABC's plans was first made public when Afrikaner organisations 
threatened the SABC with court action.
   The Rapportryersbeweging said programme restructuring and language 
changes by the SABC were being done single-handedly by the corporation. 
The Rapportryers threatened to take the SABC to court and to make 
submissions to the IBA regarding the planned relaunch.
   The IBA was alerted and the SABC was informed that it would have to 
comply by amending its licence and allowing for public scrutiny.
   SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu said the launch on February 4 
was not challenged by the IBA at the parties' last meeting in mid-
December, adding that the corporation was "made to understand that the 
amendment would be a minor technicality". The IBA denied this.
   Some sources see the IBA-SABC wrangle as a misunderstanding due to 
bad communication; others believe it is a power struggle over who has 
the greater authority, while others insinuate that were it not for the 
stir caused by the Afrikaner men-only movement, the stand-off between 
the parties would have been averted.
   The question that remains is whether the two had agreed in principle 
on the amendment being granted as a mere formality and whether plans 
were upset by a small Afrikaans fringe group insisting on its democratic 
right to scrutinise the new SABC changes.
   SABC communications head Ken Modise insisted that no individual was 
responsible for the misunderstanding, since each meeting between the 
parties was attended by at least three representatives from each 
organisation.
   IBA spokesman Amos Vilakazi denied that there was a power struggle 
between them, adding that the IBA was merely doing its regulatory duty.
   The SABC is adamant that it was complying with the Broadcasting Act 
by handing in its application for an amendment when it did. According to 
one SABC official, the IBA had dragged its heels in getting the 
application gazetted and this contributed to the delay in notifying the 
public of imminent changes within the SABC.
   There is a feeling within the SABC that the IBA was whipping up a 
logistical storm in a teacup, and that it did not have the right to 
dictate the language preference used on the SABC.
   The IBA, however, felt that the handing in of the application two 
months ago -- in early October rather than in mid-December -- would have 
been more acceptable and would have allowed for public scrutiny.
   "The effect of the application is that it transforms public 
broadcasting in this country and, while we are not opposed to the SABC, 
we are opposed to the procedurally incorrect manner in which it has gone 
about doing it," an IBA source said. He stressed the IBA was merely 
doing its job as a media regulator.
   In the wake of this week's fiasco, SABC management has asserted its 
commitment to public consultation, and has argued that going ahead with 
its revised plan was the best way to give the public an idea of what the 
changes involved.
   "We believe the public will be better informed once they have seen 
what is offered," Modise said.
   Modise confirmed that the corporation is to go ahead with its 
February 4 relaunch while still abiding by the terms of its existing 
licences. This will, however, involve a rearrangement of the schedules 
in order to keep the dominant languages on each channel the same as at 
present.
   SABC sources suggest the corporation paid little attention to the 
need to seek a formal licence amendment, lulled into false security by 
the fact that the IBA had raised no objections when African languages 
were introduced into TV1's Good Morning South Africa.
   However, licences stipulate the dominant languages for each channel. 
While the GMSA changes did not change the status of English and 
Afrikaans as the dominant languages on TV1, the changes that were 
planned for February 4 would have reached much further.
   Briefing TV staff on Wednesday, Jill Chisholm, head of Television 
News Production and acting head of television, pointed out there was no 
precedent for a South African broadcaster applying for a licence 
amendment as opposed to a fresh licence, hence the lack of clarity over 
correct procedure.
   Chisholm also expressed disappointment that changes which "are part 
of a root and branch transformation" of the SABC had been stymied by the 
problems raised by the IBA, when in fact the IBA and SABC were in 
agreement on the kind of transformation which the corporation needed to 
undergo.
   Stressing the need for discretion, Chisholm expressed concern about 
"running into IBA sensitivities about power and authority".
   Wednesday's briefing was the first time that staff who will be 
implementing the new programme format had been officially informed of 
the plans. Chisholm apologised to staff for the fact that they had heard 
about the changes in line-up in the press before being briefed by the 
SABC. The briefing was intended to take place earlier but had been 
delayed.
   Staffers have in the meantime voiced frustration at what they see as 
the superficial nature of the changes planned at the SABC, at the 
confusion over the lines of managerial command, and at the corporation's 
tardiness in informing them about the changes.

News Viewers Vote With Their Remotes 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The SABC's news and actuality coverage -- the mainstay 
of the broadcaster's operation -- has lost more than a quarter of a 
million viewers over the past year.
   The corporation's eight o'clock English news slot has suffered a drop 
of a minimum of 100 000 viewers, while the equivalent 30-minute 
Afrikaans bulletin lost 200 000 viewers.
   The new, "improved" Agenda Newsline also suffered a decline of about 
100 000 viewers, but it is not clear from market research where the 
audience has moved to.
   There has been a "steady decrease" in the number of people who watch 
news and actuality, said SABC news and actuality research manager, Dr. 
Stoffel Blaauw, adding that people either watch only half the news, 
change channels, or just switch off their television sets for the night.
   Blaauw said the decline began when the SABC shifted from being a 
commercial broadcaster to becoming a public broadcaster, adding that the 
drop of 300 000 viewers was a "minimum average" of the total number of 
people lost to news and actuality.
   "The drop began as early as September 1993, when the political agenda 
of the SABC changed and it had to adapt to a changing South Africa by 
ridding itself of the stereotyped black television channels -- the 
former TV2 and TV3 -- and market a television service that was more 
representative of the broader spectrum of South Africans," Blaauw said.
   He said the SABC's top brass was trying its best to broadcast to all 
language groups but, because it was a mammoth task and one could not be 
all things to all people, certain local English and Afrikaans groups 
were becoming "increasingly annoyed" with the drop in standards of 
television, especially news and actuality.
   With about 10,5-million households connected to television, a steady 
decline of this nature could see a drop of close to a million viewers by 
the time the next elections are due.
   Blaauw predicted that people would be increasingly incensed to find 
that, with the relaunching of channels, the corporation was using 
material which was "currently on the shelf" because of time and 
budgetary constraints.
   He said top management was, despite having its own agenda, open to 
suggestions gathered from research conducted and keen to improve the 
image of the SABC, but added that the "new look" SABC would be a case of 
"let's wait and see what happens".

Rugby: Luyt Dynasty Expands Its Turf 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Nicole Fritz and Vuyo Mvoko

    Johannesburg - Rian Oberholzer, Louis Luyt's son-in-law, has left 
his job as South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) tournament 
director to take up a permanent appointment in Australia as chief 
executive of Sanza -- the company which will control rugby broadcasts in 
the southern hemisphere.
   Sanza came into being after a R2-billion deal Luyt, together with 
Australia's Leo Williams and New Zealand's Richie Guy, signed with media 
mogul Rupert Murdoch.
   Effectively, this contract gives Murdoch exclusive television rights 
to all southern hemisphere provincial and international rugby for the 
next 10 years.
   Oberholzer's appointment as head of Sanza is being seen in some 
circles as a transcontinental expansion of the Luyt dynasty -- which 
includes Luyt's son, Louis Luyt junior, who is general manager of Ellis 
Park and Luyt senior's personal assistant.
   Oberholzer is also a trustee of the Transvaal Rugby Sports Trust. The 
trustees control voting rights and rights to dividends and interest in 
respect of the Transvaal Rugby Football Union's investment in Ellis 
Park.
   Oberholzer's move and reports of Luyt's property sales have fuelled 
speculation that Luyt intends to leave the country. Two weeks ago the 
Mail & Guardian reported Luyt's house in the plush Johannesburg suburb 
of Saxonwold had been placed on the market, apparently for a staggering 
R7-million.
   It has also been reported that Luyt's luxurious Ballito holiday-home 
was up for sale over the festive season, but was inexplicably withdrawn 
after a short period.

Education In Crisis: Teachers Face Cut-backs 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Philippa Garson and Vusi Mona

   Johannesburg - TENS of thousands of teachers around the country will 
soon have to pack up their bags and move to under-resourced schools or 
be retrenched.
   The government's commitment to equity in schools and the severe 
constraints on the education budget mean many schools will have to cut-
back on the number of teachers they employ.
   The squeeze on the education budget, and the fact that many provinces 
have already overspent on last year's budget, is forcing schools to cut 
back on the number of teachers they employ by increasing teacher/pupil 
ratios to 1:40 in primary schools and 1:35 in high schools over a period 
of five years and cutting back on subject choices.
   Ironically, the subjects the country needs the most in terms of human 
resource development, like science, will be the first to go, because 
these are the smaller, and more expensive classes to run. So too will 
the better, more experienced teachers bear the brunt of the cut-backs, 
as they are the more expensive to employ.
   But the only way that provinces can balance their books is by 
slashing back on teachers salaries -- which swallow 85% of the education 
budget. According to some, the number of teachers currently in 
employment is roughly adequate for the country as a whole. For others, 
no amount of redeployment will absorb the excess number of teachers 
generated by the new teacher/pupil ratios. The 1994 national 
teacher/pupil ratio was 1:34 in primary schools and 1:27 in high 
schools, implying that enforced new ratios will generate a surplus of 
teachers. There are already as many as 15 000 unemployed teachers.
   Glaring inequities exist in terms of teacher distribution, with an 
abundance of teachers and small classes in most formerly white schools. 
It is in the many township schools, in peri-urban informal settlements 
and in rural areas, where teacher shortages exist.
   Teachers wanting to keep their jobs will have no option but to 
relocate to the areas where they are needed. But moving teachers to 
poorer areas brings with it a host of legal, financial and social 
obstacles, said Peter Buckland of the National Business Initiative. In 
terms of the Educators' Employment Act, affecting state-aided or model C 
schools, schools have the right to choose which teachers to employ. To 
redeploy teachers would mean amending this legislation.
   Moving teachers to other schools also implies the need for travel 
costs, relocation costs and in some cases, accommodation costs -- money 
which the government doesn't seem to have.
   Then there is teachers' resistance to moving on the one hand, and 
communities' antagonism towards "outside" teachers coming to take up 
jobs when their own teachers are unemployed. Many white teachers would 
balk at moving to volatile informal settlements where they may not be 
welcome.
   The South African Teachers Union has agreed in principle to 
redeployment, if it means that jobs can be saved. "We are backing 
redeployment in that we are backing teachers' jobs. But we need a 
strategy to attract teachers to impoverished areas," said general 
secretary Thulas Nxesi.
   Issues such as housing arrangements and travel allowances would have 
to be negotiated, Nxesi added, warning that last-resort retrenchments 
would meet with resistance. "We don't believe there's an oversupply of 
teachers. If they talk retrenchments we will do whatever we can to 
protect our members' jobs."
    Gauteng MEC Mary Metcalfe said travelling expenses could not be paid 
however. She said redeployment had already been negotiated with the 
teachers' unions for the moving of teachers "from the better-off to the 
more under-resourced schools to be phased in over the next two years. 
People will be offered redeployment to areas within reasonable distances 
from where they live.
   "Educationally we'd agree that smaller class sizes are better but we 
are going through a period of massive reconstruction and we simply 
cannot afford smaller classroom sizes."
   Metcalfe added however that even if the new ratios were complied 
with, the province could still not meet its budget. This would point 
towards inevitable retrenchments. Metcalfe refused to confirm this in 
the absence of a finalised budget or negotiations.
   According to Jane Hofmeyr, also of the NBI, "teachers will have to be 
retrenched unless we relook at the teacher/pupil ratios and the 
education budget". In her view, it is time to consider loans from the 
World Bank. "We don't want a debt trap forever but there are few 
countries that don't use loans at some time or another. It is a critical 
time for us in terms of human resource development."

Rector Urges Universities To Share Apartheid's Backlogs

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Philippa Garson

   Johannesburg - The call by the University of the Western Cape's new 
rector, Cecil Abrahams, for the province's three universities to take 
joint responsibility for its disadvantaged students has prompted mildly 
defensive attitudes from two wealthier sisters, the University of Cape 
Town and the University of Stellenbosch.
   Abrahams has called for the three universities in the Western Cape to 
share the burden of disadvantaged students and take some of the load off 
his own university with a streamlined, common admissions centre.
   Abrahams outlined his proposal in a graduation speech at UCT last 
month, calling for "universities as a collective (to) establish a common 
applications centre where we agree to divide among ourselves a pre-
determined percentage of applicants who have been historically 
oppressed.
   "I propose as well that we address together the difficult financial 
situation facing students. It is vitally important that the university 
sector in this region develop in an orderly and financially viable 
manner. This is not a time for any one of our universities to gloat at 
the struggles and misfortunes of a particular university," he said.
   Abrahams told the Mail & Guardian the educational and financial 
poverty of disadvantaged students should be the responsibility of all 
three institutions. "This would reduce the responsibility of one 
university to deal with all the backlogs apartheid created."
   He said he feared a repeat of last year's admissions saga at UWC 
which resulted in scores of students being turned away for non-payment 
of fees.
   Abrahams said that UCT's response had been "polite", and Stellenbosch 
had not yet responded. He hoped however to schedule a meeting on the 
issue next month.
   UCT acting Vice-Chancellor Wieland Gewers said he was "very 
interested" in the line taken by Abrahams, but suggested that many co-
operative developments had taken place of which Abrahams had perhaps not 
been aware.
   "We've been very active in inter-technikon and university co-
operation in the Western Cape." A group of five institutions, namely the 
three Western Cape universities, Peninsula Technikon and Cape Technikon, 
has established a vice-rectors' group that meets frequently to promote 
co-operation on issues of common concern like staff development and 
sharing of libraries, said Gewers.
   The Western Cape Tertiary Institutions Trust had already raised funds 
for all the institutions and a single mechanism for all five libraries 
was being implimented. Gewers hinted that Abrahams was "not fully 
conversant with the number of students we do have that are black (51%). 
"
   He said that his university was flooded with 17 000 applications this 
year and had only 3 000 places.
   The University of Stellenbosch was also keen to remind Abrahams of 
existing regional co-operation structures and of its own numbers of 
disadvantaged students, which the university was already battling to 
fund.
   Stellensbosch Vice-Chancellor A Van Wyk said the university had been 
increasing its admission of disadvantaged students at an "exponential 
rate and 17% of 1995's intake of first year students were from that 
group." Van Wyk said Abrahams suggestions, which he noted with 
"interest", should be taken to the National Commission on Higher 
Education.
    Abrahams said he was aware of the Committee of Five Tertiary 
Institutions but believed the issue was "urgent enough" to be dealt with 
by top leadership as soon as possible.

Intelligence To Investigate Police Spy Scandal 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg - Intelligence officials hope to have their own 
investigation into the police bugging scandal wrapped up as early as 
next week and will be forwarding a report to both President Nelson 
Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
   "We will get to the bottom of this -- the who, the how and the why," 
deputy co-ordinator of intelligence Moe Shaik said this week of the 
spying row which saw police and intelligence chiefs all but accuse each 
other of lying.
   The investigation by the National Intelligence Co-ordinating 
Committee (NICOC) centres on allegations that former security policeman 
Dirk Coetzee, now an National Intelligence Agency operative, told SAPS 
member Inspector H Moodley he had been assigned to spy on top-ranking 
policemen -- a charge Coetzee denies.
   The probe also focuses on whether or not listening devices or 
equipment were found connected to top-ranking policemen's telephones.
   Shaik refused to comment this week when asked whether an 
investigation by Telkom had thrown doubt on whether bugs were in fact 
found.
   He did however concede a failure to properly assess the impact the 
allegations could have if made public. Shaik said he discussed "rumours 
circulating" with SAPS commissioner George Fivaz as soon as he heard of 
them. Fivaz "was aware of them and could put them in context". In what 
proved a serious miscalculation, they agreed to let the matter rest 
there.
   Shaik said this week: "Our collective response was sluggish. A story 
we dismissed as media hype, that we thought was essentially a non-issue, 
threatened to become a national crisis.
   "The lesson to be learned is that we need mechanisms to deal with any 
issue that -- whether deliberately or unintentionally -- could threaten 
the fragility of the transition."
   The investigation, by the NICOC, is one of three launched in the wake 
of newspaper reports that the National Intelligence Agency was bugging 
top-ranking policemen. Coetzee, Moodley and his commander, the head of 
the National Priority Crimes Unit, Major-General Suiker Brits had all 
been interviewed, Shaik said.
   A judge to head an independent inquiry announced by Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki last week has yet to be appointed, although Minister of 
Justice Dullah Omar told the M&G he expected an announcement would be 
made during the course of next week.
   Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence will be meeting 
on February 7 to consider reports it has called for from both the SAPS 
and NIA and to decide whether to call individuals to testify before it. 
Its inquiry begins officially on February 12.
   Shaik said NICOC's report would first be discussed within the 
committee, which brings together the National Crime Intelligence Service 
of the SAPS, the NIA and the South African Secret Service, before being 
forwarded to President Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki for a decision 
on how to proceed.

De Klerk Aims for Nat Party Revival 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg - National Party leader F. W. de Klerk has yet again had 
to insist that rumours of his party's imminent demise were exaggerated.
   De Klerk's irritation was not so much with the "disgruntled 
individuals" who, by leaking a strategy document to the Afrikaans Sunday 
newspaper Rapport had set themselves "on a course of sabotage", but with 
the fact that the document had been interpreted as saying the NP was 
preparing to dissolve.
   De Klerk faced having to correct this misinterpretation by saying 
what was really intended -- that far from dissolving, the NP meant to 
act like an alka-seltzer on the political digestive tract, saving it 
from the indigestibility of a one-party state threatened by the ANC's 
dominance.
   But his ire was compounded at having to show more of his hand than he 
would have liked. The plan was for him to unveil the vision of a new, 
right-of-centre political movement, aimed at injecting fluidity into 
South Africa's democracy, on February 2.
   Seeing De Klerk, flanked by NP executive director Fanus Schoeman, 
media head Marthinus Van Schalkwyk and Cape leader Dawie de Villiers, a 
question arose. How could they expect the public to have confidence in 
their ability to transform the political landscape when rearranging the 
furniture within their own party was proving so problematic?
   In fact, De Klerk does not see the NP  as necessarily leading the 
movement it is proposing, which will need substantial black support to 
survive.
   He has been engaged in intensive talks with business, religious and 
community leaders he wants to support the formation of a movement, 
founded on Christian values, that could draw support on issues like 
bringing back capital punishment, retaining anti-abortion laws, lowering 
taxes and limiting state power.
   He wants to establish common ground with the other minority parties 
through "regular discussions", but an alliance is not necessarily going 
to emerge. Essentially, NP strategists are looking for growth to 
congregants in the ANC's church who might be encouraged, ahead of 1999 
and a new general election, to cross the floor.
   These are non-racial issues, around which De Klerk hopes to rally 
people on the basis of shared values as a way of shattering what NP 
strategists see as racially-based voting patterns.
   A clause in the interim constitution demands that MPs crossing the 
floor resign their seats. It is not repeated in the draft new 
constitution, but may yet appear: the ANC would not want members elected 
by voters who backed the party, rather than voting for an individual, 
free to do political waltzes.
   But members -- and supporters -- might just be tempted, if there was 
a viable opposition amounting to more than tiny parties relegated to 
being permanent opponents of the majority party without any hope of ever 
coming into power. To be viable, it would have to be non-racial and 
forward-looking, with no hint of being concerned with furthering narrow 
ethnic interests.

Soccer: This Fish Is Poetry In Motion 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Mark Gevisser

   Johannesburg - Monday afternoon at the Old Eds Health & Racquet Club 
in Houghton. It's only 48 hours after they were crowned national heroes, 
and the Bafana Bafana seem bemused, rather than irritated, by the fact 
that only a few autograph-hunting children recognise them. "Excuse me!" 
calls a fluorescent kugel, "what team are you?"
   Doctor and Shoes have led an invasion of the aerobics class, pealing 
with laughter as they throw their gold around. Zane, meanwhile, is 
throwing indignant teenage girls off exercycles. Augie is primping his 
pecs down in freeweights. Coach Clive is gamely puffing his way through 
a circuit. The Feesh, it goes without saying, is in the water, doing 
laps.
   Later, signature bird's-nest hair tamed by a back-to-front baseball 
cap, the youngest member of the South African squad  -- and the one most 
likely to hit the international big time -- lopes across the floor to 
laugh at his buddies in the aerobics class.
   There's something mesmerising about Mark Fish. The gangly white boy's 
jerky, too-long limbs sometimes seem to be caught in adolescence (he is 
21), beyond his control, until they snap, in a moment, into the machine-
like precision which earned him the "Man of the Match" vote last 
Saturday when South Africa trounced Cameroon.
   There's no white player black South Africans love more; there's no 
South African defender who gets as much attention from the crowd. 
"Feeeesh!" the supporters cried every time his boot tapped the ball on 
Saturday. "Feeeesh" they cry every time he plays for Orlando Pirates.
   And it's not just because his name, like "Shhhhoooeees", rolls easily 
off the collective tongue of a stadium-full of people. It's not just 
because he is a defender who never loses a tackle, no matter how 
aggressive the striker, who is given to blazing lone storms across the 
length of the field into the other team's goal-box and who reads a game 
like no one else on the field. No, it's because he is raw, a rebel, easy 
to find (that hair!), easy to read.
   There's something intimidating about the artistry of a Khumalo or a 
Mosheou, something inaccessible about the lofty Masinga; through Feesh, 
though, you can live the match, following the fortunes of your team as 
they ripple through his posture and register on his features.
   Coach Clive Barker puts it best: "What impresses most people about 
Mark Fish is his body language. He's unpredictable, a character. A Jonty 
Rhodes, a James Small. He betrays to the crowds what we're trying to get 
across."
   Barker clearly adores his youngest ward: "He's not my first choice 
for the national team! He's my first, second and third choice!" The 
bluff, no-nonsense coach plays his part so perfectly you wonder if he 
hasn't stepped off the pages of Whizzer & Chips. But Fish stirs even the 
coach to poesy: "If I were in the trenches of World War I and I had Mark 
Fish next to me, even if there were 1 000 soldiers storming us, I'd be 
convinced we'd still win. He's a fighter."
   It's no secret there are talent scouts from the European clubs here 
for the African Cup of Nations, and they've got their eyes on Fish. 
There have been rumours about Manchester United, and it's believed the 
Italians are also showing interest. Soccer writers caution, though, that 
a star in malnourished South Africa might not even register a blip on 
the Italian or British landscape.
   Barker believes that Fish "may have the potential to hit the jackpot, 
to make the big league if he manages things right. But he may yet go 
into the category of the George Bests." Fish, you see, is Party Animal 
Number One in the South African squad. He loves to drink and he can get 
unruly. The squad still chuckle at how he told Mike Atherton he was 
"ugly".
   "He loves a good party," says Barker, "and his parties go on longer 
than anyone else's." As does his hair, even though Barker's caught wind 
of a rumour that, if the Bafana Bafana get to the finals, a certain 
Feesh might be sporting an "exotic, punk, short, blue do".
   There's none of that Mark Fish sitting opposite me at the bar of the 
Sunnyside Hotel. He is the consummate Pretoria Boys High alumnus: well-
spoken, very polite. He talks, for example, of "Mr Barker" and "Mr 
Mandela".
   It's clear he doesn't really like the limelight, but he plays ball 
anyway, attempting to answer questions and admitting, sheepishly, that 
his mind is elsewhere. Despite his youth, he is one of the most popular 
members of the squad: it's hard not to like him.
   He is not self-conscious about being a white boy in a black sport. 
His best buddy -- and room mate at the Sunnyside -- is Pirates captain 
and fellow Pretoria homeboy (and rabble-rouser) Edward Motale. "Fish," 
says Motale, "is not like other whites. I take him to Mamelodi, to 
Tembisa, and he'll get up and dance even though he's the only white. He 
won't give a damn, he'll just boogie and then others will join him. With 
other whites it's different. They need special attention one cannot 
afford."
   After Saturday's victory, Fish chose to go with his mates to a bar, 
"Tings and Times" in Pretoria, rather than joining the team at the 
Randburg Waterfront. Johannesburg, he says, is "flashy and phoney and 
false, all these guys who dress to impress". Motale often accompanies 
him on his Pretoria sorties -- a place not known for its mixed venues -- 
where the pair has become known as "New South Africa".
    Fish lives in one of our land's strange interstices, unrecognised by 
his home culture, but a folk hero to millions. "I'll go to a restaurant 
with a girlfriend and the only one who'll recognise me is the waiter, 
and he'll insist I go into the back and meet all the kitchen staff."
   Perhaps his ease with this is a function of his youth: he was in 
nappies during the Soweto uprising. He is, truly, a post-apartheid babe. 
Although he is "not rushing to join the ANC", he acknowledges that, 
because soccer has taken him across the railway line, he does have an 
insight into the ravages of apartheid his white peers may not have. But 
there is something a little too defensive -- or perhaps just young -- in 
his comment: "I know about apartheid years, but I wasn't there. It's got 
nothing to do with me. I never hated blacks."
    Fish, like Eddie Motale, spent most of his childhood playing soccer 
at Pretoria club, Arcadia Shepherds. But, while Fish remembers Arcadia 
with unqualified warmth, Motale's stories are full of the slights of 
petty apartheid. He was left behind in the showers when the white boys 
went to the pub, he was dropped from the Colts team even though he was 
clearly the best player and at rival Berea Park he was not allowed to 
use the facilities.
   Fish -- like most white South Africans -- wants to erase race; Motale 
-- like most black South Africans -- can't. Motale lives with his 
parents in Mamelodi; Fish lives with his grandparents in Arcadia. 
Motale's mother is a cleaner at Pretoria University; Fish's mother is a 
sales manageress at Edgars. Motale had a hard time finishing school and, 
aged 29, lives for and through soccer. Fish is in the middle of a Unisa 
marketing degree and thinks he may want to move into sports psychology.
   There are intimations that Fish had a difficult childhood -- his 
parents are divorced, and those who know him well say, elliptically, 
that his drive on the football field is related to his "background" -- 
but he does not talk about this. The greatest conflict of his youth 
seems to have been that timeworn one of white South African schools: 
soccer versus rugby.
   Pretoria Boys High is a great rugby-playing school. They wanted him 
to play rugby, he wanted to play soccer. At primary school, he was head 
boy. But in white South African high schools, soccer -- the terrain of 
dagga-smoking rebels -- is positively unpatriotic, so at "Boys High" 
Fish assumed a more marginal existence. He speaks, now, with 
indignation, about how the school "did nothing for me, and now has the 
cheek to ask me to donate money to a new library. When Robbie Brink made 
the national rugby team, they said he was Boys High's first Springbok. 
Well what about me? I was already playing for the national soccer 
squad!"
   He clearly doesn't like authority. Soccer administration in this 
country is "corrupt ... the administrators get all the money and the 
players don't get the respect they earn. I tell you, if I get picked for 
a European club, if it's Clive Barker as coach I might consider coming 
back to this country. Otherwise, forget it."
   Right now he's listening to the group LIVE on his walkman, 
particularly "this one song, Lightning Crashes, about the world and how 
fucked up it is". It figures that his favourite movie is What's eating 
Gilbert Grape? Even though he is as gregarious as Johnny Depp is dark, 
there's something unmistakably teen-rebel about him. It's not 
nihilistic, wear-black, fuck-you or gangsta-rap rebellion; it's rather 
the indie-rock rebellion of vague social conscience, long sideburns and 
mellow attitude -- REM and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are two of his 
favourite bands.
   And yes, he is a poet. A promising one at that. Changes (see above) 
is filled with the nostalgic romanticism of an alienated Generation-X 
yearning for more essential times, when there was nothing to mediate our 
experience and we were mad bodies "dancing on the hillsides" rather than 
"pair[s] of eyes" staring, through the dark, at TV sets.
   He wrote the poem for Clive Barker's wife, a ballet dancer, but it is 
clearly a meditation on his own career. We are no longer all "dancers", 
but now "cleaved" into "actor and spectators", soccer-stars and fans. 
"We are obsessed with heroes who live for us/ and whom we punish."
   Mark Fish must know that he has now become one of those heroes.
   CHANGES, by Mark Fish 
   Dancer 
   entertain with your 
   sweet dangerous flow.
   I watched your body

   Now your mind 
   must excite these waiting bodies.
   New Woman, timeless dancer 
   Pick your time narrowly though those 
   crowded minds, 
   give your warmth and obedience  
   to these schools of learning.

   There are no longer "dancers" the possessed 
   The cleavage of men into actor and spectators 
   is the central feel of our time.
   We are obsessed with heroes who live for us  
   and whom we punish.

   If all the radios and the televisions were deprived 
   of their sources of power, all books and paintings 
   burned tomorrow, 
   all shows and cinemas closed,  
   all the arts of vicarious existence 
   We are content with the "given" in sensations quest

Mozambique 
Row over IMF Plans

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch and Carlos Cardoso

   Johannesburg - A row has broken out over International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) plans to impose tight curbs on wage hikes and the few social 
security benefits that still exist in Mozambique.
   The country has one of the poorest economies in the world and one of 
the lowest annual incomes per head for its 15-million people: $90 to 
$100 (about R315 to R360).
   The row began when the IMF started negotiating a new agreement with 
the Mozambican government in September last year. The Mozambican 
government had just agreed to increase the minimum wage of $14 (about 
R50) a month by 37,5%.
   The IMF responded by pointing out the post-election government had 
not met all its budget-cutting targets and issued a hard-line statement 
about the need to tighten up the fund's basic controls for Third World 
economies. These include cutbacks in state expenses, curbs on inflation 
and monetary circulation, financial reform and further privatisation.
   Officials from the IMF have since softened their stance after a 
number of Mozambique's donor countries -- which usually back the 
organisation's medicine for ailing economies -- wrote a letter saying 
the Frelimo-led government, which won the election last year, was 
actually doing well in terms of economic reform and that the fund should 
relax its hard line.
   However, IMF officials have indicated they will not relax monetary 
constraints and availability of investment capital until the government 
slashes the country's inflation levels, currently running at around 40%, 
down to 15%.
   The fund has also been criticised for ignoring the informal sector in 
Mozambique. It says this accounts for 30% of the country's GDP, while 
senior government sources insist that it is as high as 60% -- and 
operates as the most important cushion against starvation, rampant crime 
and redistribution of resources.
   Yet average wages for children on the dumbanengues (black markets) 
range from 30 000 to 75 000 meticais (R10 to R25) a month, plus one meal 
-- much less than the already abysmal R50 minimum in the formal sector.
   The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), which held a 
workshop in Maputo in November last year, urged the IMF to realise that 
the country's informal sector had mushroomed as a byproduct of the tough 
austerity programme.
   "The government must begin to accord proper attention to the needs of 
workers in this sector, with a view to integrating them into the formal 
economy," says the ICFTU report.
   The ICFTU also urges the fund to negotiate its new package of 
financial constraints for the next three years -- which is expected to 
be finalised in Maputo next month -- with organised labour and emerging 
civic organisations. The international union organisation also wants 
measures designed to ensure food security and social spending for 
vulnerable groups such as women, youth and the aged.

Mozambique
US Millionaire Plans Indian Ocean Dreampark 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch

   Johannesburg - "Yo! You and you! Yo!" The big Texan is standing 
beneath the thudding turbine of a chopper in the middle of the 
Mozambican bush. He is whooping and yelling and pointing at a group of 
bewildered peasants who huddle behind a tree to protect themselves from 
a sandstorm whipped up by the helicopter as it swooped into their 
settlement.
   Gradually, above the cacophony, the villagers realise the American is 
telling some of them to "stop fiddle fucking" (a phrase repeated so 
often it could be called his company's motto), get into the air and take 
a look at the natural beauty that surrounds them. This is John Perrott, 
general manager for flamboyant millionaire James Ulysses Blanchard III, 
and he is bringing his employer's version of rural development to one of 
the poorest countries in the world.
   The vision of Blanchard Mozambique Enterprises is to create a massive 
wildlife and tourism mecca stretching from Inhaca Island off Maputo 
through the staggeringly beautiful Machangulo Peninsula, across the 
Maputo Elephant Park, where one of Africa's last free-ranging elephant 
herds lives, and then down to the South African border in the south.
   The Machangulo Peninsula has the world's highest forested dunes which 
jut, south of the island, into a subtropical sea abounding with coral 
reefs, dolphins, rays, sharks, marine turtles and endangered dugongs 
(strange sea mammal which gave rise to the mermaid legend because it has 
breasts to suckle its young).
   The $800-million masterplan, outlined in a book called the Black 
Bible by Blanchard's men, includes hovercrafts to ferry jetsetting 
tourists from Maputo to Inhaca; a Mississippi Steamer which will become 
a floating hotel and casino off the island; a chain of upmarket lodges 
on the beaches and inland lakes that dot the pensinsula; a national park 
that will be supplied with the big five and other animals in the biggest 
game restocking exercise ever undertaken in human history; scuba diving 
schools; game fishing expeditions; an aquarium; and a steam train to 
ferry tourists through this wonderland of wild game and marine life.
   South African consultants have advised Perrott that his dream to 
import a group of Bushmen from the Kalahari into the Mozambican theme 
park is likely to discredit the project. So has he given up the idea? 
"Hell no! If I get my way, I'll bring some of them little guys out here. 
Can you imagine tourists on the steam train looking out of one window 
and seeing elephants and rhino? Then they'll look out of the other and 
see the little bastards running around with their loin clothes and 
poison-tipped arrows ... The way I see it we'll bring them rhino here 
and save them from going extinct so why not bring the little guys who 
are also going extinct?"
   It is unlikely that either the Botswana or Mozambique governments 
will grant permission for Bushmen to be part of the scheme. But the 
masterplan is being taken seriously by the government in Maputo.
   The biggest obstacle in Perrott's way is that in 1987, at the height 
of Renamo's civil war, the Frelimo-led government granted South African 
timber giant Sappi a concession to plant more than 30 000 hectares of 
land with a plantation of bluegum trees -- in partnership with two 
Mozambican firms.
   The Maputo government's aim was to bring a big South African business 
into the area as a bulwark against bands of Renamo rebels, who waged a 
destructive civil war in the area, with clandestine support from 
elements in the South African military.
   Little thought was given, at that stage, to the fact that the 
concession zone is part of an incredibly rich area of plant diversity, 
known as the Maputaland Centre of Endemism, and that the commercial 
plantation will destroy botanical species which occur no where else on 
Earth and also one of the last tropical grasslands left in southern 
Africa.
   An environmental impact study commissioned by Sappi has recognised 
that the plantation could have serious negative impacts on the 
biodiversity and water resources of southern Maputo province and has 
recommended the planted area be reduced from 32 000 to 21 000 hectares 
so the bluegums can be kept away from rivers and inland lakes in the 
area. The study points out that the plantation, which could earn 
Mozambique some R80-million (about $23-million) a year and create 12 000 
new jobs (not all of them full-time), does not prevent other companies 
from implementing ecotourism programmes in the Elephant Park and on the 
Machangulo Peninsula.
   But Perrott will have none of this. The Blanchard proposal, he 
explains, could bring in an investment of $800-million and will create 
20 000 jobs in the long run. However, it depends on "critical mass", a 
realisation of the grand plan, and it cannot have a patch of bluegums in 
the middle of it.
   So James Ulysses Blanchard III has presented an ultimatum to the 
Mozambicans. He will not go ahead unless Sappi is out.
   Perrott's job is to persuade the local population and the media that 
his boss is right, which is why he is now in the middle of the bush with 
a chopper and a convoy of four-by-fours conducting an exercise in what 
the newspaper contingent on the trip dubbed the Texas School of 
Community Communication.
    While the local chief, his wife and two other volunteers from the 
village are taking a flip in the helicopter, the Texan begins dishing 
out colourful
   T-shirts with a huge map of southern Mozambique on the front 
proclaiming that the area is now a national park. The logo on the back 
says -- in English even though the villagers speak only Shangaan or 
Portuguese -- "Nix to water guzzling bluegums".
   Women, men and children scramble for the T-shirts while a group of 
men gather around Perrott and his Mozambican translator. "Tell them they 
gonna have shares in this project," says Perrott. "The elephants we 
bring here are gonna belong to them too. Now you tell them that in your 
best Shingaan (sic)."
   Perrott insists that a democratic approach is vital for conservation 
to work and that his company will treat the local communities as equal 
partners. "We're gonna put a fence up and make this place a national 
park and they will be able to choose. We gonna come here and say: 'Okay, 
now you're in a national park. Your village can either get fenced in or 
you can have them wild animals walking right through your main street'."
   Early in February the Cabinet will meet in Maputo to decide on the 
bluegum-plantation-versus-ecotheme-park row. The debate has become 
Mozambique's equivalent of the St Lucia controversy in South Africa and 
is likely to be the biggest and most complex economic decision the 
Mozambican government has ever had to make.
   Cabinet members appear divided on the issue. The agriculture ministry 
favours the plantation because it is ready to proceed and will bring 
immediate jobs to the depressed area. The environment ministry wants the 
ecotourism plan because the plantation will cause irreversible damage to 
Mozambican wildlife while it provides raw materials for the South 
African paper industry.
    Another source of concern in the Cabinet is that Blanchard -- a 
cold-war warrior from the 1980s with close links to far-right groups in 
the US --  has good friends in Renamo and also the Inkatha Freedom Party 
in KwaZulu-Natal.
   For the time being though, it appears that opinion in Maputo's 
government and intellectual circles is swinging Blanchard's way. The 
government will insist on a proper land-use plan and assurances that the 
ecotourism project will not be used to benefit Renamo during the next 
elections, or link up with seccessionist movements in KwaZulu-Natal. It 
also plans to set up a group of monitors to ensure that the rhetorical 
commitment to a partnership with the local landowners is put into 
practise.
   But it now seems that the man who once bankrolled a rebel army to 
wage a war of incredible destruction and brutality (the US State 
Department once described Renamo atrocities as worse than those of the 
Pol Pot regime in Cambodia) is likely to be rewarded with control over a 
huge chunk of Mozambique's richest province.
   It is just one of the many paradoxes that pervade this poor country. 
"To understand it," says one of the officials who works with Perrott on 
the project, "you must realise that Mozambique in the past hasn't had 
bulldozers that work. Now we have one that does."

Madonna Of The Margins

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Ricardo Dunn

   Johannesburg -  Mexican artist Frida Kahlo appears on T- shirts, 
calendars and in stage plays. Why are we so fascinated by her?
   Little Frida, a cafe catering to the lesbian and gay community in 
West Hollywood, is a shrine to the memory of Mexican cult-painter Frida 
Kahlo. Surrounded by neo-Mexican decor, inspired by Kahlo's house in 
Mexico City, you can even order a "Frida salad". Little Frida is but one 
outpost in a merchandising empire that churns out T-shirts, earrings, 
aprons, clocks, pins, calenders and posters bearing Kahlo's now world-
famous images. You might even come upon such fetishistic objects as 
Frida Kahlo masks.
   Kahlo's life has been documented in Spanish, English, German, French 
and Japanese. A number of serious biographies can be found on the 
shelves of bookshops and museums; one has even been written for 
children. She has been the subject of documentaries, feature films, 
stage plays -- a character becomes obsessed with her in Harry Kalmer's 
Frida Kahlo's Eyes, now running at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre -- 
numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing. In May 
1989 Elle magazine ran a 16-page feature on Kahlo as embodying the 
"spirit of Mexico", while in Vogue of February 1990 there was a 10-page 
interpretation of the "romance of Frida Kahlo". It comes as no surprise 
that Madonna has invested a sizeable sum in the hopes of bringing the 
Kahlo myth to the silver screen.
   So, who was Frida Kahlo? And what is it about this strikingly 
beautiful but tragically handicapped artist, who painted her life story 
on tin and masonite, that has inspired a huge cult following?
   Kahlo began painting as a teenager in Mexico City in the 1920s, while 
recovering from a near-fatal bus accident in which she was impaled on a 
metal pole. At 21 she married renowned muralist Diego Rivera. Although 
she lived in a conservative, patriarchal culture, and in the heyday of 
murals, when a woman making small, highly personal paintings could not 
win much respect, she valued her idiosyncratic talent. Kahlo challenged 
and refashioned social codes, sometimes by cross- dressing -- appearing 
in photographs or paintings in men's clothing -- or by montaging her 
head on to the bodies of male patriarchs.
   Her self-portraits express the burdens that weighed on her: 
unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera's affairs prompted, her 
homesickness when living abroad and her sorrow at not being able to bear 
a child.
   It is tempting to draw parallels between the tragic life of Van Gogh, 
an artist recently made "sexy" by the media, and that of Kahlo. But Van 
Gogh is known primarily for his work. In the case of Kahlo, the popular 
image is of the artist herself: the characteristic eyebrows which she 
connected to create the illusion of masculinity, the elaborate hair, the 
light moustache which she darkened, and, of course, the dressy Mexican 
traditional costumes which she adopted to affirm her identity and to 
hide her broken body. It is her appearance, not her art, that has graced 
the pages of Elle and Vogue.
   Despite Kahlo's larger-than-life standing, she painted less than 150 
pictures in her brief career, with barely half of them considered top-
notch. Admired by Picasso and adored by the Surrealists, she held only 
two shows during her lifetime. Today, prices for her works have 
skyrocketed to more than $3-million a piece.
   The current fascination with Kahlo began in the 1970s, when her work 
generated excitement in the women's liberation movement. But it was 
Hayden Harera's 1983 biography of Kahlo, simply titled Frida, which 
elevated the painter to the level of superstar. 
   Looking at Kahlo's contemporary appeal, Harera writes that '"as a 
Hispanic woman, a bisexual, an invalid and an artist, Kahlo had all the 
qualifications for a cult figure; she embodied everything not straight, 
male and Anglo ... For a people preoccupied with psychological health, 
fearful of Aids and appalled by drug abuse, the gritty strength with 
which she endured her illness is salutory. Although her painting records 
specific moments in her life, all who look at them feel that Frida is 
speaking directly to them."
   This, many say, has led to the representation of Kahlo as a kind of 
mascot of marginalisation. It is the portrayal of Kahlo as a victim that 
has encouraged the many myths that have been formulated around her. 
Stories of her childhood accident and her obsessive relationship with 
Rivera become more brutal and bizarre as they are retold. One story 
maintains that Kahlo's clothes were ripped from her body during the bus 
accident. As she lay naked, a bag of gold-dust that a fellow traveller 
was carrying split open and covered the artist's body. But it is not 
only devotees who have enjoyed fabricating fantastic twists to Kahlo's 
already unconventional life. The artist herself, although born in 1907, 
insisted she was born in 1910 -- the start of the Mexican Revolution. 
   So Kahlo herself contributed to her status as a symbol of cultural 
diversity -- a status some critics say has diluted the significance of 
her work. Yet by demystifying the work of Kahlo and other artists the 
privileged doors of the art world are opened to consumers of popular 
culture. In a 1992 travelling exhibition organised by the Studio Museum 
of Diego Rivera in Mexico City, a number of "Fridita" artists 
participated, while cross- dressing performance artists paid campy 
homage to Kahlo. Many gay artists find Kahlo, who paraded her liaisons 
with other women, a source of strength because of her unconventional 
approach to gender.
   Parodoxically, although Kahlo is considered a populist, she was 
intensely annoyed when she noticed that some of her admirers were 
attempting to adopt her meticulously constructed image. As early as 1933 
she was mocking: "... some of the gringa women are imitating me and 
trying to dress _ la Mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages 
and to tell the truth they look absolutely impossible".
   Frida Kahlo's Eyes is at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre until 
February 24

The Soprano Who Stole The Show

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Coenraad Visser

   Johannesburg - After Luciano Pavarotti's concert in early January, 
many were heard to wonder about Kathleen Cassello, the stunning young 
soprano who so completely stole the limelight at this event. Few were 
aware that it is almost exactly 10 years ago that she was a prizewinner 
in the Unisa International Singing Competition in Pretoria.
   Cassello took third place in what was arguably the best field ever 
assembled for this competition. Her fellow victors are also household 
names today: Sumi Jo is the queen of twittering coloratura sopranos, 
while Marilyn Mims is a regular at New York's Metropolitan Opera.
   Cassello, an American whose family hails from Naples, won a string of 
vocal competitions during the 1980s. As the 1985 winner of the Pavarotti 
Competition in Modena, she sang Musetta in Puccini's La Boheme with 
Pavarotti as Rudolfo. After her European debut the same year, she 
travelled the globe, giving more than 200 performances as the Queen of 
the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberflste. 
   Today she sings a wide repertoire, including all the major Mozart 
roles and Verdi heroines such as Leonora in Il Trovatore, Gilda in 
Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata. Her Gilda has already proved to 
be rather special: she made her La Scala debut in this role under the 
baton of Riccardo Muti, and was acclaimed last year when she sang as 
Gilda opposite the current tenor heartthrob, Roberto Alagna.
   On the evidence of her Pavarotti concert, Cassello (who, admirers 
will be sad to hear, has not yet made any recordings) is one of the most 
versatile sopranos around. In one evening she was a moving Mimi in 
Puccini's La Boheme, an agonising Violetta, and a powerful Lucia in 
Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.
   One can only hope someone from Pact Opera was there. A house that has 
been so unlucky in the repertoire in which Cassello excels will never be 
forgiven if it fails to secure the services of this exciting singer, in 
the early stages of what promises to be an astounding career.

Pavarotti Against All Odds

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   Johannesburg - They trampled through the dust in their droves to hear 
the rotund tenor from Modena: elderly matrons in bridesmaids' dresses, 
beautiful youngsters in cocktail minis and clumpy designer shoes, and 
sensible folk in gear more befitting the rugby stadium in which the 
concert was held. Inside, vendors of snacks and cold-drinks cried out 
their wares, seemingly oblivious to the occasion.
   Not even a brief downpour could dampen the determination of the 
assembled throng to hear their idol. A pity, then, that the 
circumstances should have been so unfavourable. Over a woefully 
inadequate sound system Pavarotti sounded like he was singing on a 
scratchy 78 recording; bad acoustic planning had the singers' voices 
echoing around the stadium, and the odd sound balance had the orchestra 
playing far away. And the giant television screens which were supposed 
to allow one a close-up view of the singers mostly flickered and went 
blank.
   How does one judge the quality of any performance under these 
circumstances? With great difficulty. What was clear was that, at 60, 
Pavarotti's voice is still in excellent condition when amplified and not 
subject to the strain of projecting without help in a big auditorium. 
One was struck by the ease of his delivery, by those hallmark top notes, 
and by his unique ability to sculpt the Italian texts exquisitely.
   On the other hand, there was frustration at the sameness of his 
characterisations and at his predictable recipe for pleasing the masses: 
his matter-of-fact vocal delivery, slightly rushed, with top notes being 
belted out for all their worth and sustained far longer than required by 
the composers. And then there was the surprising memory lapse in the 
middle of Che gelida manina, an aria he must have sung literally 
hundreds of times around the world.
   It was only in the closing Neapolitan songs and E lucevan le stelle 
from Puccini's Tosca that one heard a true artist at work.
   Rightly, the greatest applause was reserved for soprano Kathleen 
Cassello, who outsang and outacted her mentor in their duets and her 
solo excerpts. Her heartfelt E strano from La Traviata and closely 
characterised Si, mi chiamano Mimi from La Boheme brought the house 
down.
   Conductor Marco Armiliato impressed with his understanding of the 
various operatic styles on the programme. Unfortunately the same cannot 
be said for the ragged National Symphony Orchestra and the surprisingly 
hopeless SABC Choir and the Bonisudumo Choristers. Why bother with this 
odd collection, so clearly unfamiliar with operatic style, when there 
was a superb opera chorus and orchestra just down the road? It was, 
perhaps, simply another instance of bad -- should that be arrogant? ---
artistic judgment.

South Africa Reconsiders Exchange Controls

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Simon Segal 

   Johannesburg - Perhaps the most tricky decision facing South Africa's 
monetary authorities is when to lift exchange controls.
   It might be too slow for some, but South Africa has adopted a phased 
approach. The abolition of the financial rand system in March last year, 
the granting of limited permission for financial institutions to swap 
assets with foreign investors, and the Reserve Bank's (RB) phased 
withdrawal from the forward cover market all reconfirm the authorities' 
determination to liberalise South Africa's foreign exchange market and 
to create an investor-friendly environment for foreigners.
   Some see the smooth transition from the dual to a single currency 
system as an argument for the quick abolition of all exchange controls.
   But RB governor Chris Stals' firm conviction is that South Africa 
must first prepare the way and lead the country into a situation where 
the lifting of exchange controls is a non-event.
   The million-dollar question is when does South Africa reach this 
situation. Some feel that reserves have improved sufficiently and the 
exchange rate stabilised satisfactorily that the time is now right to 
lift exchange controls.
   Stals has said it will take to 1997 or 1998. He notes that backlogs 
have built-up for international diversification in the asset structure 
of South African investors and is concerned about the huge pent-up 
demand with institutional investors and managers of portfolio funds for 
some diversification into foreign assets. 
   As a start, since July last year, the RB is allowing insurance 
companies, pension funds, and unit trusts to invest abroad if the 
investment is swapped by a foreign investment in South Africa, thus 
leaving no net loss of foreign exchange reserves. By mid-November, the 
RB had approved asset swaps worth R5,6- billion.
   The RB is also reducing its role in the forward foreign exchange 
market where it allows banks a greater role. The RB's share of forward 
transactions fell from 18,5% in July to 14,2% in September and its 
short-term forward book dropped by $5,7-billion from the end of March to 
the end of November.
   Stals' cautious approach is based on the presumption that South 
Africa must first ensure greater stability in the underlying market 
forces before entrusting the determination of important prices to market 
forces.
   The RB's exchange rate policy is still one of a floating exchange 
rate system operating within the constraints of certain foreign exchange 
controls. In this situation, it is extremely difficult to assess the 
rand's level.
   Stals notes that in a new global environment, where exchange rates 
are determined by volatile capital movements, the conventional concepts 
of over/under-valued currencies, based on the principle of purchasing 
power parity, have little meaning. In today's world the rand can easily 
appreciate as a result of capital inflows despite a growing deficit on 
the current account.
   Ultimately, net capital inflows and a stable exchange rate cannot be 
achieved or maintained through superficial intervention or controls. 
There is no alternative for sound monetary, fiscal and other macro-
economic policies. International capital markets will be the 
adjudicators of these policies.
   In this regard, South Africa has virtually fully normalised its 
international financial relations and cannot ignore the norms and 
standards for financial discipline.
   Over the past year, South Africa has re- established normal relations 
with multi- national bodies such as the United Nations and the World 
Bank, and joined various international regional bodies such as the 
Organisation of African Unity and the African Development Bank. The 
country obtained various international credit ratings which enabled it 
to raise new funds on the international capital markets.

South African Currency on the Rise

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   Johannesburg - The rand has stabilised remarkably compared to those 
heady days over 1985 to 1993 when it was in a free-fall against all the 
world's major currencies.
   There are numerous ways of looking at a currency's value.
   The best measure is to consider its nominal effective value. This is 
an index comprising a basket of currencies weighted according to the 
value of transactions South Africa does in that currency.
   The Reserve Bank's index, with a base of 100 in 1990, averaged 81,25 
in 1993, 73,71 in 1994 and 69,52 in 1995, a depreciation of six percent 
which is not that different from the gap in the inflation rate between 
South Africa and its major trading partners. The index is currently at 
70.
   The real effective exchange rate of the rand, which is the nominal 
value adjusted for producer price differentials between South Africa and 
its trading partners, has barely changed from 98,66 in January 1995 to 
98,57 in September (the last available figure). In 1994, it averaged 
97,18.
   Over 1995, the rand depreciated by only two percent against the US 
dollar (nine percent in 1994), five percent against the British pound 
(10%), 11% against the Japanese yen (18%) and 16% against the German 
mark (11%).
   Compared to May when the rand was at its year's low, the currency has 
actually appreciated against the dollar (from 3,7 to 3,64 this week), 
the pound (5,9 to 5,62) and the mark (2,66 to 2,51).
   The average daily turnover rose from $4- billion in the last quarter 
of 1994 to $4,9- billion in the second quarter of 1995 and $5,2-billion 
in the third quarter.

South Africa Faces Public Sector Strikes in 1996

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Rowan Callaghan

   Johannesburg - A report on strike action in 1995 has shown that, 
despite disastrous predictions, there were less strikes last year than 
in previous years.
   Compiled by Andrew Levy and Associates, the report said that the 1995 
level was the lowest since 1988. But the industrial relations 
consultancy does not expect the same to happen this year.
   "With the new Labour Relations Act there will be a tendency to test 
its boundaries and this will cause an increase in strike action. It will 
become easier to go on strike," says Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy & 
Associates. 
   According to the report an estimated 1,6- million mandays -- the 
number of workers multiplied by the number of days on strike -- - were 
lost to strikes in 1995. In 1994 the amount of mandays was 3,9-million 
while in 1993 it was 3,6-million mandays. 
   The main trigger causing strike action was found to be disputes over 
wages, "indicating the wide gap between expectations and delivery".
   "I think the reason there have been fewer days lost is because it 
seems as if there is an increased maturity between both parties, 
management and unions," comments Sparks.
   This maturity is not yet evident in the public sector and among state 
parastatals where the majority of strike action took place. 
   Sparks attributes this in part to the fact that strikes in these 
sectors were only allowed recently and "both management and workers are 
therefore relatively new to the negotiating process". 
   He is confident, however, that the maturity in the private sector 
would eventually spread to the public sector.
   However, he predicts that most of the strike action this year will 
still take place in the public sector for some time to come.

Satellite Group Plans Pan-African Links

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Leon Perlman

   Johannesburg - South Africa recently hosted a special meeting for 
Rascom, a pan-African satellite organisation dedicated to providing 
Africa with its own satellite for relaying telephone, data and 
television signals.
   African countries are paying up to R1,5- billion a year through 
obligatory routing of intra-African telephony traffic through Europe. 
   The 120-delegate meeting in Cape Town provided the first detailed 
implementation plan for pooling African satellite requirements, 
currently spread over some 11 Intelsat satellites.
   With the substantial loss of first-world country business to high-
capacity fibre optic cabling, Africa is seen by satellite companies as 
the next revenue growth point. 
   The first Afrocentric Rascom satellite, the R750-million Intelsat 
804, is under construction by Lockheed and is scheduled to be launched 
in the first quarter of 1997. 
   This should be followed by the launch of the Intelsat 805. Both 
satellites are expected to be launched into orbit by Chinese Long March 
rockets. 
   The 804 will provide high-power coverage of the entire African 
continent, South America, parts of Europe and the Middle East, and even 
the east coast of the United States. 
   "We aim to pool African resources to create a network for 17 African 
countries for their domestic television, data and telephony needs. We 
believe that the best way for Africa to be developed is via a regional 
approach to be able to show a market big enough to attract regional as 
well as international players," Intelsat group director Hamadoun Toure 
told the delegates.
   But while the 804 would pool the capacity needs of African nations 
currently served by some nine Intelsat spacecraft, Toure says that some 
services will not be moved -- primarily because of the need for costly 
upgrades to earth station equipment. 
   The capacity on the 804 -- which is still under construction -- is 
already swamped and another satellite will be ordered. The 805 will be 
the first dedicated land-mass African satellite, orbiting in geo-
stationary orbit above Zaire. 
   Many of the Rascom delegates expressed concern about funding for the 
project. Intelsat requires a prepayment of more than US$200- million. 
   Telkom's presence at the meeting surprised many observers considering 
it is not an official Rascom signatory. 
   However, the three Telkom representatives all played an active part 
in the deliberations. Most of the capacity on the proposed 805 satellite 
has already been requested by Telkom. 
   This appears to dovetail with Telkom's plans to integrate its planned 
South Africa to Far East (SAFE) fibre cable with the intra-African 
Rascom 805 satellite network. 
   Telkom is likely to contribute handsomely in proportion to its usage 
of the 804 and 805 satellites. It is the largest Intelsat user in Africa 
by far. 
   Sources in Rascom say that South Africa's official entry into the 
organisation will occur within months, if not weeks. They say that these 
assurances have been already been given by Telkom chairman Dikgang 
Moseneke.

Benin
Voodoo Receives Official Nod

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   BENIN - Africa's traditional ancestor worship and appeasement of the 
spirits is now officially fashionable in the small West African nation 
of Benin.
   The government of President Nicephore Soglo declared January 11 a 
national holiday to mark the recognition of voodoo as a religion. Voodoo 
is a religion based on belief in witchcraft and magical rites.
   Westerners still refer to voodoo variously as a "cult", "culture", 
"animistic" or "paganism".
   The curtain-raiser to the installation of voodoo as an officially 
recognised religion was the "Ouidah 92", the first festival of voodoo 
culture and arts which took place from February 8 to 18, 1993 in Ouidah 
some 45 kilometers west of Benin's capital, Cotonou.
   At the time, the organisers of the international event which was 
opened by President Soglo, took care to suppress the religious basis of 
voodoo.
   He was accompanied by two high priests of voodoo - Sossa Guedehongue 
and Dagbo Hounon.  It was a carnival affair.
   At the inauguration of the festival, President Soglo emphasised that 
voodoo was the common link between Benin -- indeed the whole of the west 
coast of Africa that had provided the slaves during the era of slave 
trade -- and the black diaspora of the Americas and the Caribbean.  Many 
of the guests came from Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and West Africa.
   The President pointed out that at least 4 million out of Benin's 7.5 
million people worship ancestors or spirits at one time or another. 
Those are clearly staggering figures for a country that is regarded 
mainly Catholic, with Islam considered the second mainstream religion.
   Benin is a poor country whose economy was ruined by the misguided 
marxist military dictatorship of former ruler Matthew Kerokou.
   By 1990, 40,000 civil servants had not been paid their salaries for 
at least six months.  Yet by 1992/1993 so highly regarded was the voodoo 
festival that the government undertook to pay CFA francs 400 million (US 
dollars 800,000) of the CFA francs 800 million (US dollars 1.6 million) 
budget for the whole extravaganza.  France offered about CFA francs 100 
million.  The rest of the money came from the diaspora.
   Soglo claims 3 million Beninois or descendants of Beninois, migrated 
abroad either by the effects of slavery in the 18th Century or in later 
years.
   Voodoo preceded slavery on the west coast of Africa by three 
centuries.  The practice thrived in West Africa by the 15th century.
   Alan Anderson of the Centre for the Study of New religions in 
Birmingham, United Kingdom says Beninois are not alone in the practice 
of voodoo.
   "Voodoo is the traditional religion of West Africa," he emphasised. 
It was suppressed in the colonial period when it was equated with 
witchcraft and it continued to be sensationalised by magazines and 
Western writers in modern times.
   One of the prominent aspects of voodoo is appeasement of spirits 
through sacrificial offerings of children and domestic animals. 
Traditional liquor is offered as "libation" for the purpose.
   It is not yet clear how the Catholic Church in Benin views the latest 
developments.  Officially it has the largest number of followers of any 
one religion in the country.
   However it is interesting to note that the head of the Roman Catholic 
Church, Pope John Paul II, during his most recent visit to Africa last 
September, remarked about the similarity between the Communion with 
Saints in Catholicism and ancestor worship in African religions.
   Indeed, at the Resurrection Gardens in Nairobi, the Pope received an 
African traditional priest who officially blessed him.
   Dr. Anderson points out that African traditional religions are being 
revived in many places in Africa.  Very often, traditional religions and 
Christianity exist side by side in Africa.

Kenya
Milk Cooperative In Dire Straits

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI - The giant Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC), is broke and 
cannot pay farmers over Kshs.1.5 billion (US$.27 million) owed them for 
deliveries made since August 1994, the Minister for Agriculture, 
Livestock Development and Marketing Mr. Simeon Nyachae admitted in a 
press statement on January 16.
   Minister Nyachae noted that a total restructuring was necessary if 
KCC was to be rescued.  "There is need to re-formulate the future role 
of KCC in the short and long-term," Nyachae said in the press statement.  
"KCC continues to pay over Kshs.30 million (US$ 54,000) interest per 
month for its overdraft and farmers are not being paid," said the 
Minister.
   The Agriculture Minister added; "In the short-term , this would mean 
immediate selling of stocks to pay farmers and clear the overdraft, 
overhaul the management, and introduce a new pricing system to take care 
of both domestic and external markets."
   About the medium and long-term plans for saving KCC from imminent 
collapse Nyachae said that there was need to legally establish the 
status of KCC and "hand over the responsibility (of running it) to the 
original owners (farmers) who can decide to run it either as a co-
operative or a company."
   The giant dairy farmers' organisation is said to be holding rotting 
products worth Kshs.2.4 billion (US$50 million) in its store.  The items 
cannot be sold either locally or abroad due to "poor management and poor 
marketing strategies."
   A section of the local press reported that the "cash strapped Kenya 
Co-operative Creameries has in the past sabotaged private individuals 
out to market the company's products out."  It further said that the 
organisation was receiving 800,000 litres of milk daily but was able to 
sell only 500,000 litres, with the rest going to waste.
   Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) Chairman, Mr Mark Too also called for 
the immediate decentralization of the KCC.  He said that farmers and the 
public have been kept in the dark about the operations of KCC. "Previous 
directors used their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of 
farmers," he added.
   Since its inception in 1925, the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has 
grown to become a monopoly in dairy processing and distribution in 
Kenya.  Today, KCC is the oldest and largest co-operative society with 
more than 40,000 members in the country.  It operates 11 collecting 
centres, 11 processing factories and has workforce of well over 4,000 
employees.
   In 1968 the Kenya government rationalised milk distribution by 
withdrawing operating licenses from KCC's main competitors thus giving 
it monopoly.
   For the next decade KCC was rapidly expanded through provision of 
government loans and government guaranteed external loans.  In 1980, the 
company surplus reportedly started declining and in 1987 KCC started 
experiencing loses altogether.
   Between May 25, 1989 and August 9, 1991 KCC was managed by a 
government appointed management commission, following an outcry from 
dairy farmers about mismanagement of their organisation and an appeal 
from them to save it from imminent collapse.  The commission was also 
enjoined to write a prescriptive report which is yet to be made public.
   In the second half of 1994, KCC started experiencing serious 
financial and management problems and the government appointed a task 
force in May 1995 which has run the dairy firm to date under the parent 
Ministry of Co-operative Development.
   Meanwhile dairy farmers across the country have added their voices to 
the nationwide condemnation of KCC's management.  Dairy farmers from the 
North Rift region, one of the leading milk producing parts of the 
country, are reported to have "called for the total overhaul of KCC 
management and disbanding of the appointed Task Force."
   "The government should restructure KCC with the aim to streamline its 
operations to reduce overhead costs and have the current Task Force 
disbanded," Richard Barkoyet, one of the farmers' representatives said.
   Commenting on the cash strapped KCC, the Chairman of the Kenya 
Farmers' Association Mr. Mark Too said; "I can only compare KCC to a 
vehicle which veers off into a ravine.  You need a broader perspective 
to rescue what remained of it than the usual cranes."

Uganda
Cardinal Attacks Tax System

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   KAMPALA - The head of the Uganda Catholic Church Cardinal Emmanuel 
Wamala has attacked the country's tax authority saying it is "anti-
people".
   Speaking during the launching of the Catholic Church-owned Nsambya 
Hospital Development Fund in the Ugandan capital on January 15, Cardinal 
Wamala decried the "brutal high taxation of medicines and other 
essential Ugandan imports".
   Cardinal Wamala told Christians at the function presided over by 
President Yoweri Museveni; "Taxation should be aimed at improving the 
well being of common people --- but to tax medicines meant to save their 
lives is not only making their lives difficult but condemning them to 
death."
   Cardinal Wamala's remarks come at a time when the Ugandan business 
community is complaining about high tax rates in the basically import 
oriented economy of this East African country.
   The Chairman of Uganda Importers, Exporters and Traders Association 
Captain Mike Mukula, told President Museveni during a meeting he held 
with the association on January 16 that the Anti-Smuggling Unit of 
Uganda's tax body is so high-handed that it confiscates a loaf of bread 
from a poor Ugandan simply because he has bought it from neighbouring 
Kenya, where 90 per cent of Uganda's manufactured goods are imported 
from.
   But President Museveni defended his government's tax policy saying it 
is meant to protect up-coming Ugandan industries from foreign products.

Ghana
Religious Leaders Intervene in Presidential Row

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   ACCRA - Religious leaders in Ghana announced on January 16 they had 
met Vice-President Kow Arkaah in a move to heal the deepening rift 
between him and President Jerry Rawlings.
   The row between the two men, rooted in a split between the formerly 
allied political parties they respectively lead, came to a head when 
Arkaah accused Rawlings of punching him during a December 28 cabinet 
meeting.
   Rawlings has since repeatedly and publicly suggested that Ghana's 
parliament should find a way to get rid of Arkaah, but Arkaah has said 
he would not bow out voluntarily under any circumstances since the 
president has no power to sack him.
   But two dozen leaders from six religious bodies, including Ghana's 
Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Independent Churches and 
the Federation  of Muslim Councils, met Arkaah on January 15 to work 
towards resolving the dispute.
   The delegation's spokesman and general secretary of the Christian 
Council of Ghana, David Asante Dartey, said the six bodies were very 
concerned about the rift and wanted to ensure the prevailing peace in 
the country is not threatened.
   Dartey commended Arkaah's prompt response to the delegation's request 
for an audience and said a similar request had been made to the 
president.
   "It is because of my love for peace and conviction in finding a 
lasting solution to the country's problems that I consented to meet the 
religious bodies," Arkaah said of the meeting.
   Before the alleged attack, Arkaah had claimed cabinet meetings were a 
focus for high-level corruption in Ghana.
   According to the official version of events, Rawlings did not assault 
the Vice-President, but simply pushed him to encourage his departure 
from the meeting on account of the insults he had allegedly made.
   The intervention by the religious leaders came shortly after Arkaah, 
who had accused Rawlings of punching him during the cabinet meeting, 
boycotted the opening of Parliament on January 12.
   "It would appear as if I offer myself as a punching bag to offer 
someone political enhancement," Arkaah said, referring to "insults" from 
Rawlings and his supporters which followed Arkaah's allegation that the 
President had punched him in full view of ministers during the December 
28 cabinet meeting.
   "Today's occasion was one only for the president to make a statement, 
just like last January 8 parade. I attended the parade and was subjected 
to a tirade of insults without the opportunity to exercise the right of 
reply, so I wanted to avoid a repetition," Arkaah said.
   During anniversary celebrations on January 8, Rawlings said of 
Arkaah:  "He tends to subvert the government from within."
   During his 90-minute address on January 12, Rawlings repeated a 
suggestion made on January 8 that Parliament should find a way to sack 
the vice president.

Burundi
Tutsi Extremists Bring Capital To A Standstill

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   BURUNDI - Extremists from Burundi's Tutsi minority brought business 
in the capital Bujumbura to a standstill on January 16, the second day 
of a strike launched to force President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya to 
resign.
   Despite a major deployment by crack army troops, residents of the 
troubled city appeared unwilling to go to work for fear of ethnic 
clashes, and banks, many offices and public services did not open their 
doors.
   The standstill was brought about without violence by a Tutsi 
movement, Youth Solidarity for the Defence of Minorities (SOJEDEM), led 
by Deo Niyonzima and Tutsi extremist organisations, which accuse 
Ntibantunganya, a Hutu in charge of a shaky coalition, of conniving with 
Hutu extremist gangs fighting a guerrilla war against the Tutsi- 
dominated army.
   With its turnout early last week the army clearly distanced itself 
from the extremists, but it is frequently accused of collaborating with 
them in the small central African highland nation, where relief workers 
estimate that ethnic killings claim about 30 lives every day.
   Hardliners in the main Tutsi opposition party, the Union for National 
Progress (UPRONA), had also planned to hold a demonstration in front of 
the party's headquarters, which were under tight military security.
   UPRONA radicals want their party to withdraw confidence in 
Ntibantunganya and pull out of the coalition and the national assembly, 
formed in September 1994 in a bid to stave off mass bloodletting between 
Tutsis and Hutus.
   Burundi, like neighbouring Rwanda, is a powderkeg where 50,000 people 
were massacred after the first elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, 
was killed in a foiled military coup in October 1993, which the then 
government survived.
   On January 15, diplomats said the authorities had put up a remarkably 
united front against the Tutsis, but the extremists gained ground the 
next day despite an overnight warning from Defence Minister, Lieutenant-
Colonel Firmin Sinzoyiheba, who said he put the Tutsi extremists in the 
same basket as "those who wreck bridges, sabotage power lines and water 
supplies -- all those whom we are fighting."
   For three months, Bujumbura has been without electricity and has also 
seen water stoppages caused by sabotage.  The Defence Minister called on 
the security forces, which have taken a battering from Hutu extremists 
in attacks to "act with firmness, lucidity and serenity".

Uganda
Commission To Probe Church Diocese

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   UGANDA - The Church of Uganda has set up a commission to probe the 
alleged mismanagement of funds in the south western Anglican Diocese of 
Mityana.
   The Bishop of the diocese, the Right Rev. Wilson Mutebi on January 16 
announced that the commission will investigate failure by the diocese to 
meet its financial obligations during the past seven years.
   "It will assist the church to find out whether the problem is with 
priests, Christians or the administration at the diocese" the Bishop 
said.
   He also announced the suspension of his diocesan secretary Rev. Canon 
Samuel Kamya who allegedly failed to account for US dollars 7,000.
   The bishop's revelations follow a recent declaration by Church of 
Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo to the effect that the church 
would take action against "corrupt and inefficient bishops".
   Church of Uganda officials say this announcement by the Anglican 
Archbishop was facilitated by the amendment of the church's constitution 
"empowering" the Anglican prelate to discipline bishops in the wrong and 
take overall charge of the Church affairs.
   Anglican Christians here see the move as a result of widespread 
dissent in the church over alleged corruption and abuse of power by 
church officials.
   Although Archbishop Nkoyoyo did not cite any concrete examples, it is 
generally believed that he was targeting the Church of Uganda eastern 
diocese of Busoga where some Christians have accused their Bishop 
Cyprian Bamwoze of mismanagement of funds and church affairs.

Ethiopia
Rebels Broadcast From Former Soviet Union

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI -  A rebel Ethiopian group is using a radio transmitter in 
the former Soviet Union to broadcast propaganda against the Addis Ababa 
regime of Meles Zenawi.
   The transmissions are on shortwave frequencies and appear to have 
started in early January. According to a spokesman for the British 
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) East African radio monitoring facility in 
Nairobi, Kenya, the Oromo Liberation Front started the evening 
transmission early this year after the apparent discontinuation of their 
broadcasts from transmitters in the United States where they were first 
monitored last year.  Such broadcasts are illegal in the US.
   The BBC monitoring facility believes the radio station is based in 
the Ukraine "where there is a lot of spare transmission capacity at the 
moment."  The contact address for the station is given as Berlin, 
Germany.
   The shortwave signal is described as "good though somewhat noisy."
   The rebel station does not put out news broadcasts, though it carries 
strongly worded commentaries, critical of the government in Addis Ababa.  
Despite the mid-1995 devolution of power to the provinces that allowed 
the various regions in Ethiopia to enjoy autonomy, the radio accuses the 
Tigrean people - the tribe of the executive Prime Minister, Meles 
Zenawi, of taking the rest of the country for a ride.
   Some correspondence is also read on the radio.  One letter asked why 
there are no battle reports on the broadcasts giving information about 
the war waged in Oromia by the Oromo Liberation Front.  The presenter 
promised that battle reports should be expected in the near future.
   The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (indeed in 
Africa) with a population of 30 million of Ethiopia's 55 million strong 
population.
   The geographical location of Oromia, (homeland of the Oromo) is 
southern Ethiopia.  It covers more than 500,000 square kilometres of the 
territory - double the size of the United Kingdom.
   Many Oromos say successive Ethiopian regimes dating back to 
Abyssinian King Menelik II, in the 1880s, looked down on or segregated 
Oromo people.

Zimbabwe
Catholic Church Refuses To Register Its Own 

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   HARARE - The Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe has refused to 
register its relief agency, the Catholic Development Commission (CADEC), 
under a controversial new law, the Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) reported 
here on January 16.
   Church spokesman Oskar Wermter told ZIANA that Catholic bishops were 
unhappy that the new act, which sailed through parliament last year gave 
a cabinet minister absolute powers over non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) without providing any legal recourse.
   "The bishops are unhappy with the act, which gives the minister 
enormous powers and there is no legal redress," Wermter said.
   "Voluntary organisations cannot defend themselves even if the 
minister receives false information.  Natural justice demands that there 
is recourse to law," he added.
   The church warned that if it is pressurised to register, it will 
challenge the matter in court to determine the constitutionality of the 
Private Voluntary Organisations Act, an amendment of the 1974 Welfare 
Act designed to monitor NGOs.
   When the bill was  enacted, many NGOs were concerned but reacted 
cautiously, though of late some have openly criticised the act, which 
puts them under the direct scrutiny of the government.
   The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) last month said 
that the act went far beyond legitimate oversight of NGOs by the 
government, threatening their independence and opening the way to 
governmental abuse and corruption.
   ZIMRIGHTS said the new law allowed the Public Service, Labour and 
Social Welfare Minister to take over the running of NGOs on a number of 
"vague and ill-defined" grounds.
   The human rights organisation said that members of NGOs could now 
easily be "suppressed" for criticising actions taken by the government 
and the new law "is intended to serve as a club against outspoken NGOs 
in the future."
   A number of international NGOs operate in Zimbabwe, providing relief 
and development programmes.
   Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's former Prime Minister Bishop Abel Muzorewa 
launched his campaign for the March presidential elections on January 17 
with a vitriolic attack on President Robert Mugabe, likening him to "a 
cruel, drunken father."
   Muzorewa, 71, who was prime minister briefly before independence in 
1980, said he had returned to active politics because he was "shocked 
and heartbroken by the abortion of our independent nationhood at the 
hands of Mugabe and his associates."
   He accused Mugabe and his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union- 
Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of "instilling fear among people of all 
races in Zimbabwe, so that they now live and behave like rats that have 
been chased by cats all day."
   Muzorewa is one of only two challengers who have announced their 
intention to run against Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 16 
years.  The other is the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, who faces trial in 
February on charges of plotting to kill Mugabe and overthrow the 
government.
   All three men, in their 70s, are veterans of the nationalist struggle 
that ousted the white-minority government of Ian Smith in the 1970s.
   Sithole's ZANU-Ndonga party currently holds two seats in the 150-seat 
parliament, while Muzorewa will be standing as a candidate for the 
United Parties (UP), a coalition of opposition groups which has no MPs.
   Muzorewa, a Methodist bishop and conservative politician, served in 
parliament for four years after independence but was arrested in 1984 on 
security charges.
   He was released before elections in 1985, but after his party failed 
to secure a single seat he quit politics. Speaking on January 17 at a 
news conference here which was packed with his supporters but with 
government-controlled television noticeably absent, Muzorewa said 
corruption and mismanagement since independence had plunged Zimbabwe 
into the "worst poverty and worst unemployment ever experienced."
   Muzorewa pointed to Mugabe's recent salary increase of 100 per cent 
at a time of economic hardships and steep rises in the cost of staple 
foodstuffs as a sign of the government's arrogance and insensitivity.

Kenya
Methodist Church Consecrates First Woman Bishop

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI - The Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones made history on January 14 
by becoming the first woman bishop in the African continent.
   She was consecrated Bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya at St. 
Peter's Methodist Church, Langata, in the outskirts of Kenya's capital, 
Nairobi.  The ceremony was conducted by Presiding Bishop of the 
Methodist Church in Kenya, Bishop Zablon Nthamburi.
   Bishop Jones, who was born in the small town of Stamford, 
Lincolnshire, England on May 24, 1939, arrived in Kenya in January 1969 
as a lay woman worker.  She was initially based in the Tana River and 
Lamu Districts in the Coastal Province.
   Rev. Jones recalls that she worked with women and children in that 
region "in the field of development, both physical and spiritual."
   After five years of service she proceeded to St. Paul's United 
Theological College, Limuru, to help in the training of pastors' wives.  
In 1976 she went for theological training "and preparation for the 
ordained ministry" at Bristol College in the United Kingdom.
   Rev. Jones returned to Kenya at the invitation of the Methodist 
Church of Kenya in July 1979, served as a minister on probation for one 
year and was ordained in the "ministry of Word and Sacrament" in June 
1980.
   She served as a minister at the Kariokor Methodist Church up to 1985. 
In 1986 she was transferred to Kariji Circuit in Pwani (Coast) Synod 
where she worked for the next seven years.  In 1993 she was transferred 
to the Langata Circuit.
   Asked what she felt after beating three other male contestants, Rev. 
Jones told APS; "To be honest, I did not expect it....I am very moved 
and very honoured."
   A congregant pointed out that Rev. Jones garnered the 83 votes, half 
of all the votes cast because "she is very dedicated to her work and 
very sensitive to the needs of her congregation."
   Rev. Jones said that working as a bishop, and particularly as a white 
female bishop among blacks does not make her feel discriminated against.  
"I have lived with these people for many years and I have never felt 
discriminated against," she added.
   The history of the Methodist Church in Kenya goes back 133 years when 
three missionaries of the United Methodist Free Churches arrived in the 
country.  Thomas Wakefield, James Woolner and Dr. Ludwig Krapf planted 
the first Methodist Church at Rabai, on Kenya's coast in July 1882.
   Later, the church moved to the interior of Kenya arriving in Meru, 
Eastern province in 1910.  In 1967 the Methodist Church of Kenya became 
autonomous.  Soon after, it opened missions in Northern Kenya (1967), 
Western Kenya (1973) and Kwale-Coast- (1977).
   In 1994 the church launched an insurance brokerage firm and is 
currently in the process of establishing a full fledged university. The 
Methodist Church in Kenya has a following of some 650,000 faithful.
   Before coming to Kenya, Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones trained and 
worked as a social worker in the United Kingdom.  She says that she 
worked "with deprived and disabled children" for 11 years. "I have a 
great love for young people and this has very much influenced the shape 
of my ministry here in Kenya," she told APS.

Chad
Peace Talks Collapse

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   FRANCEVILLE, GABON - Round-table talks on the political future of 
Chad ended in failure here on January 9 after most of the armed rebel 
groups present refused to sign a framework document to end civil strife 
and install a democratic system in Chad.
   Gabonese President Omar Bongo was forced to put an end to the meeting 
late on January 9 after the document failed to win enough backing.
   "Since you say 'No' then I want the discussions to stop there," Bongo 
told participants at the meeting, which finally started on January 6, 
six hours late, with the aim of ending 30 years of civil war in Chad and 
bringing the Chadian rebels into the democratisation and election 
process now underway.
   The meeting grouped representatives of the Chadian government, legal 
political parties, trade unions, various associations and armed 
opposition groups, plus mediators and international observers.
   The final document was read out to the participants by Gabonese 
Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba, then signed by Bongo, Chadian 
President Idriss Deby and President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central 
African Republic and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger.
   Most of the 12 representatives of legalised parties signed the text, 
but some abstained along with several representatives of associations 
and trade unions.
   But out of the 15 armed opposition groups present, 13 refused to 
sign, while the two groups which signed were a faction of the Movement 
for Democracy and Development represented by Moussa Medella and a 
recently-created group called AFUD, about which no information was 
available.
   Most of the opposing groups wanted detailed discussions between them 
before a text could be agreed on and signed, contrary to signing a 
document followed by discussions.
   But when some of the rebel participants called for the resignation of 
Chadian President Deby, Bongo accused them of coming to Franceville "to 
sabotage the round-table talks."
   Bongo's text had called on all signatories to renounce use of force 
to conquer and keep power and appealed to them to uphold democratic 
processes as the only path to a lasting political settlement in Chad.
   It also called for immediate ceasefire and amnesty, for armed groups 
to be transformed into political parties and for defence and security 
forces to be reorganised "along republican lines."
   The meeting was originally scheduled for last December but had to be 
postponed amid disagreements over the participants from the Chadian 
side.  All 58 legal political parties in the country wanted to be 
represented as did the guerrilla groups, which total 15 according to 
Chadian Prime Minister Djimasta Koibla.  Chad has a population of some 
5.5 million people.
   Finally it was agreed that the political parties would be grouped, 
sharing a total of 10 representatives.  Some protested, demanding a 
greater role, but none refused to take part.
   The Gabonese government sent envoys to Chad itself, to Benin, Libya 
and Algeria to involve the armed groups, while Djimasta Koibla visited 
Chad's neighbours, including the Central African Republic, Cameroon and 
Nigeria.
   The Chadian Premier said the government's aim was to get the external 
opposition leaders to return to the country and take part in the normal 
political process.

Sierra Leone
Ousted Leader Flown To Guinea

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   FREETOWN - Military head of State Captain Valentine Strasser of 
Sierra Leone was ousted in a palace coup on January 16 and replaced by 
his deputy and armed forces chief.
   Reports say the 29-year-old Strasser was immediately flown by 
helicopter to neighbouring Guinea (in handcuffs), together with his wife 
and children.  Captain Strasser now joins the man he overthrew at the 
end of April 1992, former President Joseph Momoh, who also lives in 
exile in Guinea.
   Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean government has asked Ghana to grant 
Captain Strasser political asylum and Ghanaian authorities say the 
request is under consideration.  Sierra Leone state radio announced that 
the new leader Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, has imposed a dusk to dawn 
curfew.
   Another report says the new leader of the National Provisional Ruling 
Council (NPRC) has sacked all government officials seen to be actively 
involved in party politics.
   Director of Defence Information, Lieutenant Colonel Karifa Kargbo, 
who made the radio announcement, accused Strasser of wanting to cling to 
power.  "Captain Strasser has been removed from office and has safely 
left these shores due to his blatant attempts to implement legislation 
intended to be harmful to the democratic process," Kargbo was quoted 
saying.
   Although diplomats remain sceptical of Brigadier Bio's motive, the 
new NPRC leader has announced in his first national radio broadcast that 
elections scheduled for February 26 will go ahead as planned to return 
the country to democratic civilian rule.
   He also called on the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Foday 
Sankoh, which has been fighting the government since 1991, to come to 
the negotiating table without pre-conditions.  Brigadier Bio promised 
the rebels a general amnesty and urged them to participate in the 
forthcoming elections.

Zambia
Society Campaigns For Widow's Rights

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by APS Correspondent

   Nairobi - Most human beings are somehow familiar with the feeling of 
utter loss when a family loses a beloved member.  But not every bereaved 
family experiences the combined anguish of the absence of a breadwinner 
and disappearance of family property, thanks to practices that demand 
that relatives also "inherit" movable belongings left behind by the dead 
person.  Widows in Zambia, under the umbrella of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church have formed a society that is fighting for the rights of widows, 
widowers and their children.
   For Charity Changwe, there was nothing wrong with the decision made 
by her in-laws to shift the funeral gathering of her late husband from 
her flatlet in Kamenza township to the residence of the deceased's elder 
brother in the mine township, about two kilometres away in the same 
Zambian town of Chililabombwe.
   After  all, like other countries in Africa, it is a common tradition 
among Zambian communities to hold lugubrious meetings at the house of 
the eldest member of the surviving family in a given locality.  In 
addition, the company flatlet Changwe shared with her late husband, 
Chris, a surveyor with the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) 
at the time of his death in hospital on June 26, 1993, was unsuitable 
for the funeral gathering which demands a log-fire in the yard.
   But little did Changwe know she had been tricked.  For, on return to 
her flatlet a week after interring Chris at Kakoso Cemetery, she found 
all the goods missing from the house.  She could not believe the sight 
of her house which now resembled a playground.
   Sofasets, dinning table and chairs, a fridge, two beds and 
mattresses, and other household goods were no longer there.  She was 
heart broken for the second time in a week.
   "I learnt later that on June 29 while we were burying Chris,some men 
went to the house with a lorry and took all the goods.  My neighbours 
thought I was shifting from the flat since my husband had passed away," 
Changwe told a stunned seminar on the plight of widows and their 
children, held recently in Chililabombwe about 400 kilometres north of 
the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
   To date, she has never seen the goods and efforts to recover anything 
including the fridge bought from her earnings as a ZCCM mine police 
constable, failed.
   But this young widow is not alone in her predicament.  Many in this 
Southern African country continue to endure untold suffering at the 
hands of in-laws, despite the enactment by Parliament of the Laws of 
Intestate Succession Act and the Wills and Administration of Testate 
Estates Act, aimed at protecting widows, widowers and their surviving 
children after the death of their bread winner.
   According to the Intestate Succession Act which deals with the 
distribution of property in a situation where the deceased left no will, 
the widow or widower is entitled to 20 per cent of the property, 50 per 
cent goes to the children, the other 20 per cent to the deceased's 
parents while the remaining ten per cent is given to the dependants, who 
in this case is the person or persons who are/were maintained by the 
deceased immediately before death.
   The Wills and Administration of Testate simplifies the making of a 
will and provides for adequate financial and other provisions to be made 
in a will.
   However, the continued suffering of widows and their children is the 
concern of many sympathisers in Zambia and more so fellow women who 
congregate under the Women Missionary Society of the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Chililabombwe.
   With funds from America's Southern University Democratic Governance 
Project, the women have launched a public awareness campaign "aimed at 
conscietising the general public and challenging every wing of society 
through seminars to join in the campaign to fight against wide-spread 
property grabbing and ill-treatment of widows and orphans," says 
campaign co-ordinator, Rev. Paul Bupe.
   Rev. Bupe says no matter how some people might try to justify this 
scourge of ill-treatment of widows, the practice remains evil in the 
eyes of God.
   "This cruel act is condemned from the religious point of view.  What 
the Bible has established let no culture or tradition change, says Bupe 
who supports his statement by quoting from Exodus 22:22:24 in which God 
disapproves the act:  "Do not ill-treat any widow or orphan, if you do, 
I, the Lord will answer them when they cry out to me for help and I will 
be angry and kill you.  Your wives will become widows and your children 
will be fatherless."
   Ironically, according to Rev. Bupe's observations, Christians are in 
the forefront in disobeying God's ruling, in most cases on a woman- 
against-woman basis.
   It is the women who make widows crawl on their knees on hard ground 
for a long distance and smear them with mud and mealie meal (paste from 
maize meal) on the eve of the burial of their late spouses. Helpless 
widows are abused in the name of cleansing, God forbid with HIV lurking.
   Opening the seminar, Deputy - Mayor of Chililabombwe, Mr. Curp Mwaba 
said lack of public information on the law of succession is responsible 
for the suffering of widows.
   "Property grabbing and other forms of ill-treatment of widows is as 
cancerous as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and must also 
equally receive corresponding attention," Mr. Mwaba said.
   Seminar participants had different views when they cited poverty as 
one of the causes of property grabbing.  "Many people have turned the 
death of a relative to be a means of gain.  Like vultures, relatives 
wait patiently for the demise of a wealthy kin in order to share all his 
property at the expense of the widow and orphans," a participant said.
   Some said jealous sisters of the deceased often exhibit the most 
hostile attitude towards the widow because they think they are closer to 
their brother and regard the widow as a stranger.  Such sisters seize 
the opportunity at funerals to vent out their revenge on the hapless 
widow especially when she did not receive them well and cared for them 
when their brother was alive.
   Another argued that the situation can be unpleasant in cases where 
marriages of the sisters were not stable whereas that of the deceased 
brother was smooth.  It is worse in strained marital relations whereby 
the widow ends up being blamed for the death of her husband. This is 
worsened by the belief that "culture demands" that the widow be 
mistreated.
   However, the participants were unanimous that there is no specific 
yardstick for mistreating widows.  They singled out ignorance about the 
law of succession among the victims, perpetrators and the law 
enforcement officers as being major contributing factors to the problem.
   As Changwe admits; "I had no idea at the time of my husband's death 
that laws exist in Zambia to protect widows.  Otherwise, I should have 
taken the matter to the magistrates court for redress after the police 
turned me away saying the issue was civil and that it should be dealt 
with domestically between my family and in-laws."
   And, considering that she was five-months pregnant with her first 
born child, Changwe also feared she would prematurely lose this valuable 
gift from God in questionable circumstances.  She felt unsafe to 
antagonise her in-laws over her goods.
   "Although I was neither physically harassed nor sexually abused, fear 
of witch-craft grew in intensity when my pregnancy went beyond nine 
months.  I gave birth to a baby girl in the eleventh month," she 
revealed.
   In his contribution to the debate, Chililabombwe Magistrate, Mr. 
Kaengele Mulenga criticised the conduct of the law enforcement officers 
for displaying ignorance about the law of succession when they are 
supposed to be knowledgeable.
   "In many cases, the police turn away victims reporting the loss of 
their property believing the matter is of civil nature.  This is not the 
case as this is a criminal offence which carries custodial sentences for 
the guilty," he said.
   According to Mr. Mulenga, a person found guilty under the law of 
succession can either be fined a maximum of Kwacha 500,000 (about US 
dollars 590) or get a jail sentence of three years with hard labour or 
both fine and imprisonment as the court might determine.
   He suggested that police officers under-go orientation courses on 
succession statutes in order for them to deal with widows' complaints 
fairly.
   Seminar participants who included civil servants, mine and Zambia 
police officers, the clergy and widows also blamed weak and biased 
administrators in the distribution of property and corrupt local court 
justices for the disparities in the dispensation of cases of this 
nature.
   "When a family has a principled and well respected person, very often 
the administration of property is done according to the law and the 
widow is protected and cared for," they observed.
   Unlike other widows, Changwe's employment as a mine police constable, 
helped her recover from the shock of losing her property. She is now 
happily settled in a two-bedroomed ZCCM house in the mine township 
raising her daughter now aged over two years.
   Her advice to potential widows is: "Be brave and have no fear of 
witch-craft.  Take property-grabbing in-laws to court if need be." Some 
timely advice indeed.

Angola
Combatants Agree On Troop Encampment

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by APS Correspondent

   Luanda - After two-months break in the Angolan peace process, coupled 
with several incidents of ceasefire violations, the Angolan government 
and UNITA rebels have taken a major step forward with an agreement on 
the new composition of the army and the encampment of their excess 
guerrilla forces.
   More than 26,000 soldiers of the former rebel Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement will be integrated into a new 
Angolan defence force of some 90,000 men.  Of the 63,000 ex- guerrillas 
in Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, 26,000 will join the new army, 200 the air 
force and 100 the navy.
   The figure, announced in the Angolan capital, Luanda on January 15, 
was decided on at meetings in the past week between members of the 
general staff of UNITA and the regular armed forces of President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos' ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola (MPLA) government.
   Both UNITA and MPLA, protagonists in Angola's civil war for almost 
two decades since independence from Portugal in 1975, agreed that other 
soldiers in their ranks -- some 180,000 men -- will not be demobilised 
immediately but assigned to a new force responsible for rebuilding 
civilian and military infrastructure destroyed during the bitter 
conflict.
   The UNITA fighters named to the new defence force in line with a 
peace pact signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, will be selected 
once all the former rebels have been disarmed and encamped in 15 sites 
prepared for them under the United Nations' supervision.
   Negotiations on the structure of the future army and the distribution 
of posts will continue.  The Luanda government has offered UNITA six 
places on the general staff of the defence force, including that of 
deputy chief-of-staff, a government source said.
   The UNITA representative on the joint peace commission established 
with the government, Isaias Samakuva, on January 15 went to Bailundo, 
the movement's headquarters town in central Angola, to consult with 
Savimbi on Luanda's proposals.
   The resumption of military talks is expected to lead to progress in 
the encampment operation, although no timetable has been fixed.  "We are 
not yet in a position to confirm the beginning of this operation," a 
UNITA delegation member said.
   On January 12, UNITA declared that it will free all prisoners of war 
(POWs) it is still holding, a joint commission for verifying peace in 
the southern African state said.
   The release of the POWs -- both military and civilian -- was due to 
be supervised from this week by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, (ICRC) sources said, but did not give the exact number involved.  
The government has so far released 341 prisoners, while UNITA has freed 
20.
   A timetable aimed at putting the Angola peace effort back on a firm 
track was reached "formally" at a meeting on January 12 between 
representatives of the rebel group and the joint commission.  It 
requires
   UNITA to bring back to their bases its combatants in three locations 
-- Negage and Quibaze, both in the north, and Londiibali, in the centre 
of the country -- by January 20.
   The government, meanwhile, is to remove its troops to barracks in 
Uije and Bengo provinces, both in the north, according to the timetable 
which was proposed by the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).
   The talks had gone on hold after clashes between fighters from both 
sides in the north, threatening the success of a peace plan signed in 
November 1994.  UN sources in Luanda said a list of UNITA officials who 
would be part of a new Angolan government of national unity would be 
discussed at the next meeting between President dos Santos and the UNITA  
leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The United Nations did not say when the meeting would take place, but 
Angolan radio said it could be held before January 20.  Since the Lusaka 
peace accord was signed in 1994, UNITA and MPLA have met three times in 
Zambia, Gabon and Belgium.
   Under the Lusaka peace accord, which ended 20 years of civil war in 
the sprawling former Portuguese colony, the Ministers of Geology and 
Mines, Trade, Health and Tourism are to be UNITA officials.
   Also reserved for the rebel group are seven vice-ministerial 
positions, including Defence, Interior, Finance and Agriculture, plus 
three provincial governorships and six ambassadorial posts.
   The former rivals are also due to discuss the repatriation of 
mercenaries they employed during the war.  Last week, the government 
sent home 460 South Africans who had been fighting on its side, but 
UNITA claims that Luanda had employed a total of 5,000.
   The move forward in the peace process comes as the head of the UN 
Security Council sought to boost the peace process in Angola by urging 
President dos Santos and the UNITA opposition leader to meet soon 
without conditions.
   "I appeal strongly to you to build upon progress made in negotiations 
in the past few days and to do everything necessary to resolve the 
outstanding issues which are blocking the peace process in Angola," 
Britain's Sir John Weston wrote on behalf of the 15-member council.
   The council expressed "serious concern about reports of continued 
violations of the ceasefire" as well as slow progress on practical 
implementation of obligations of peace agreements.
   The council said it was expecting a response from the two men via 
United States ambassador to the Untied Nations Madeleine Albright who 
was about to set out on a visit to Africa.  That response as well as 
concrete actions will be "critical factors" as the council considers the 
possible renewal of the 6,400-man UN mission next month.
   On January 4, 50 people were killed in southern Angola during a dawn 
attack by rebels from the UNITA movement, the governor of the province 
of Huila Kundi Payama announced in a statement carried by the official 
Angolan News Agency (ANGOP) monitored in Lisbon the same day.
   In the statement, Kundi said that an unknown number of rebels from 
UNITA took part in the attack on the town of Chivulo, located in Huila 
province, where the military situation had escalated in recent weeks 
following the return to the area of a UNITA leader.
   The incident came just as the Angolan government and former rebel 
leaders from the UNITA movement resumed negotiations a day earlier on 
setting up a national army in line with the November 1994 Lusaka peace 
accord.
   The talks resumed following an emergency meeting in Luanda on January 
2 between UN special envoy to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye and 
representatives from the government and UNITA.
   UN officials said that during the meeting, the UN also denounced the 
Angolan government for allowing one of the army units to capture the 
town of Kitoke in Uije province during the Christmas holidays.
   The incident neither claimed any victims nor sparked any clashes with 
UNITA soldiers, the officials added.
   Clashes between the two sides in recent months had raised fears about 
the country's commitment to the Lusaka Peace Accord, under which rebels 
were to disarm and both sides were to quarter soldiers before merging 
into a new national army.
   On December 8, US President Bill Clinton also warned President dos 
Santos, during a visit to Washington that ceasefire violations in the 
battle-scarred African nation could jeopardise its improving ties with 
the United States.

Uganda
NGOs Call For Donor Pressure

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Crespo Sebunya

   Kampala - Much has been said about Uganda rising from ruins to become 
a showcase of a positive economic recovery programme.  But non- 
governmental organisations here say the same donors who are praising 
this East African country for its overall statistical progress, should 
now pressurize the government to address itself to the plight of 
millions of ordinary Ugandans who are wallowing in poverty.
   Residents of Kyotera town some 160 km south of Uganda's capital, 
Kampala held their breath as tens of military tanks rumbled through 
their dusty town, wrecking the just tarmacked section of a highway that 
leads into neighbouring Tanzania.
   Military authorities say that some 84 tanks were imported through 
Tanzania last November, a sign of increasing scale of Ugandan armament 
programme which is worrying donors who now say the programme accounts 
for more than 30 per cent of the country's budget.
   The collision course between Ugandan government and the donors over 
defence is not very difficult to discern.  The government explains that 
security needs are back on the high table because the country feels 
besieged by hostile neighbours.
   President Yoweri Museveni recently said that there are only two 
countries in the region he is on talking terms with -- Rwanda and 
Tanzania.  He suspects that other countries harbour rebel groups bent on 
destabilising Uganda.  "These countries fear a repeat of the type of 
revolution that happened in Uganda in their countries," Museveni has 
been quoted saying.
   He also believes that beefed up security also guarantees the welfare 
of investors.  To date, Uganda's Investment Authority has recorded 
nearly US dollars 2.5 billion but only 10 per cent of the amount has 
been actually invested in the country.  Among the reasons given for 
holding back is the uncertainty of this East African country's political 
situation.
   Uganda has however assured "doubting Thomases" that her 
demobilisation programme would result in a decline in defence spending.  
When the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took power in 1986, it built 
up a force of nearly 130,000 soldiers.  Then, the government reasoned 
that it had many enemies to fight. At one time 14 rebel groups were 
operating in the country.  Thus the high defence spending was tolerated.  
And as the number of rebel groups was scaled down and the government 
started demobilising its troops, there was a sigh of relief.
   The troops were reduced down to 50,000 and correspondingly defence 
spending went down.  According to the latest parliamentary report 
covering the 94/95 financial year, defence spending had dropped to 8 per 
cent of the national budget.  But then it is picking up again and 
according to latest figures from the United Nations Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), spending on defence has gone back to 30 per cent.
   But the government says there is need to modernise the army.  Mr. 
Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Defence Minister is of the opinion that the army 
is now faced with well armed rebels and therefore needs to improve its 
efficiency.
   He notes that the country has to be guarded against external threat, 
especially from Sudan where both former President Idi Amin's soldiers 
under the West Nile Bank Front and Joseph Kony's rebel Lord Resistance 
Army (LRA) are based.
   But many concerned Ugandans believe defence is eating up resources 
which would otherwise have gone to the improvement of the people's 
welfare.  Both donors and non-governmental organisation are also worried 
about the trend in a country whose population is increasingly wallowing 
in poverty and disease, and want donors to do something about it.
   At a poverty alleviation conference held last November in Uganda, the 
NGOs said that some form of pressure ought to be put on the government 
so that it responds to the needs of the people.
   "The Ugandan government should be made to accept highest social 
conditionalities in form of higher budget allocation in health and 
education," Gary Bercker, one of the resource persons at the meeting 
said.
   He said that out of the country's 18 million people, 13 million live 
below the poverty line.  About 76 per cent of the 2.2 million pupils who 
enter primary schools do not complete seven years of education and only 
three per cent make it to university.
   Mr. Bercker said donors can prevail upon the government to address 
the increasing levels of poverty in the country.  "Poverty reduction is 
still an after-thought and not an integral part of the government policy 
formulation," he said.
   Bercker's concern is shared by the 1400 NGOs operating in Uganda. 
They say there are many intangible causes of insecurity in the country, 
especially when the population is dissatisfied with what they get from 
the government.
   NGOs, most of whom interact with one another and with the people, 
have proved to be spokespersons for the population.  They have served as 
an alternative to the government in availing the much needed services, a 
quality that puts them in a better position to understand what are 
likely to be causes of social conflicts.
   Social disruptions and discontent have increasingly been demonstrated 
through industrial strikes, especially by government workers.  Most 
dramatic was the strike by doctors who felt that their demand for better 
pay among other conditions has not been met.  Railway workers and 
teachers too have expressed their grievances through similar 
demonstrations.
   "The government should look into the issue of equity which requires 
that the distribution of benefits from growth must be addressed, if the 
poor are not to be further marginalised," Dr. Fred Opio, the Makerere 
University Executive Director for Economic Policy Research said.  His 
concern was that the government is yet to show commitment to the plight 
of the poor at a time when there are increasingly huge sums of money 
saved from the ongoing economic reform programmes.
   A statistical bulletin released by the Ministry of Finance in June 
1995 says Uganda saved up to US dollars 100 million in programmes such 
as the retrenchment of 148,000 civil servants.  The publication also 
notes that the privatisation programme allowed the country to collect 
nearly US dollars 90 million through privatisation receipts.
   It was hoped that this money would be utilised in the improvement of 
much needed services.  For instance, the World Bank says that the Uganda 
Electricity Board (UEB) is in great financial distress.  The board needs 
US dollars 100 million annually to be able to extend its services to the 
different areas of the country.
   But then, this should have been possible if the monies saved from the 
privatisation were applied to improve these services.  But when the 
report on privatisation was read, it was discovered that some of the 
money has been lent to private investors who have bought some of the 
companies, much to the annoyance of the parliamentarians.
   Nevertheless the government says that it has embarked on four 
measures to improve public resource expenditure.  The Minister for 
Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Joash Mayanja Nkangi says 
the government has already established a medium term expenditure 
framework where all sectors are involved in preparation of the budget.
   He says the application of these measures will see the budget share 
of the health sector rise from the current 12.1 to 15.4 per cent in the 
next financial year (96/97) while that of education will move from 17.9 
to 22.6 per cent in the same period.
   He also points out that the government has redesigned its priority 
programmes to serve as many people as possible.  "Before 1991, health 
expenditure skewed towards high cost hospital services that tended to 
benefit the few, while education was skewed towards secondary and 
tertiary institutions," he explained.  Now special attention will be 
paid to primary health care, rural water supply and primary education.
   Although these measures have taken hold, it would be long before 
tangible improvements are seen.  For instance, the per capita 
expenditure on health has risen to only US dollars 8 while the accepted 
standard is US dollars 12.  So far NGOs feel that pressure has to be put 
on the government so that it does not backslide.
   And their prayers were partly answered when donors asked the 
government to use money saved from relief programmes in the social 
sector.
   A debt management programme drawn by experts from the Bank of Uganda 
and an international team of experts from the newly created Eastern and 
Southern African Initiative in Debt and Reserves Management (ESAIDARM), 
World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) introduced two new components in the debt management programme.  
Through the programme, up to US dollars 20 million of the debt will be 
converted into local currency and be invested in social and 
environmental sectors.
   At the same time, donors have agreed to establish a multi-lateral 
debt fund where donors will avail unspecified balance of payment support 
to the government to offset amounts owed to multilateral institutions 
like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and African 
Development Bank (ADB).  The fund which is being supported by Denmark, 
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland among others, will release more 
funds to the social sector instead of having the same directed to 
servicing the external debt.
   According to government estimates, multilateral debt servicing 
accounts for up to 30 per cent of the national budget.  But it is 
expected that the new measures will reduce this by half to between 11 
and 12 per cent annually.  To ensure that the Ugandan government follows 
the plan, donors are expected to review the debt programme on a 
quarterly basis.
   But then, this is only part of the answer.  There are strong feelings 
especially in Uganda, among government opponents that the authorities in 
Kampala need to be more reconciliatory to neighbours.
   "It was wrong to sever diplomatic relationship with Sudan for this 
closed all avenues towards peaceful resolution of the conflict," said 
Mr. Paul Kawanga Semogerere, an aspiring presidential candidate.
   This subject also elicits some form of sympathy among senior 
government officials.  Mrs Betty  Bigombe, the Minister in charge of 
Pacification of the north said that when all is said and done, 
negotiations are still part of the answer.
   "It is very difficult to police our long stretch of the border we 
share with Sudan, thus it may be through negotiations that peace can be 
achieved," she emphasised.

Zambia
Africa Cup Games Drug Free

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - Games being played at the Africa Cup of Nations in 
South Africa have been declared as drug free, ten days before the close 
of the competition. Organising committee  chairman Dr Peter Matsheke 
said on Friday in a press statement: "So far all players have been 
clean." He explained that each of the four venues has a centre where the 
tests are being carried.
   "At half time, the match commissioners and team officials of the two 
competing teams randomly select two players from each team by drawing 
two numbers per team out of a bag," Dr Matsheke said, adding: "The 
players are identified 15 minutes from the centre by their team 
officials and doctors where the taking of samples is administered by a 
CAF appointed doctor." According to Dr. Matsheke, the players are 
allowed to choose the containers for their samples.
   "These containers are coded and only the secretary general of CAF, 
Mustapha Fahmy, knows the identities of the players when he receives the 
results between 36 and 48 hours after the tests are carried out," 
explained Dr. Matsheke.
   The samples are being tested at the University of Bloemfontein which 
according to Dr. Matsheke "is the only international Olympics committee 
(IOC) accredited laboratory in Africa."
   During Zambia's game against Algeria, Zeddy Saileti and Harrison 
Chongo were picked for testing and have since been cleared.
   Meanwhile, Zambia could still get in the quarter-finals with one 
point from the tie against Sierra Leone on Wednesday night in the Group 
B Africa Cup of Naions finals here.
   But no such thought is being entertained by coach Roald Poulsen or 
his 22- man squad who says no chances were going to be taken and his 
players were going to go for the kill to top the group.
   "Our aim is to win and end at the top of the group,"declared Poulsen. 
"We will put all our energies into the game." He added: "The boys know 
what is at stake. They will go out for an outright win."
   Combative winger, Jonson Bwalya agreed.  " Our aim is to beat Sierra 
Leone convincingly so that we top the table in group B and stay in 
Bloemfontein," he said. "Sierra Leone is a good team. we have to respect 
them," warned Jonson. But team captain Kalusha Bwalya is confident his 
boys will pull off a win . "The boys are keyed up after the Burkina Faso 
match and are more determined than ever to make sure of a place in the 
last eight," Great Kalu said
   Zambia's breath taking 5-1 win over Burkina Faso on Saturday night 
meant that they are now heading group B on goal difference.
   The scoreline was too much for the Burkinabe that  coach, Idrissa 
Traore refused to attend the mandatory mixed post match press 
conference. But nearly everyone here in Bloemfontein is full of praise 
for the Zambian  team.
   Former Aston Villa and Wimbledon stirker John Fashanu had this to 
say:  " This is the best team performance so far. Kulusha led by 
example, it makes me feel at 33 I am not too old to play soccer."

Zambia
President's Actions Sow Seeds of Anarchy

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Fred M'membe (Column)

   Lusaka - President Chiluba's position on the method of  adopting the 
constitution has nothing to do with respect for the sovereignty of 
Parliament but much with fear of losing power if clauses that level the 
play field and broaden political competition are put in the 
constitution.
   The President's fear of losing the benefits of power, and not of  the 
opportunity to help create a better  Zambia for all, was made very clear 
at last month's MMD's extraordinary convention.
   The President reminded his government officials of the deprivations 
they will have to endure if he and the MMD were voted out. He reminded 
them of the houses, the cars and offices they will lose. But he failed 
to acknow-ladge that he will be the greatest loser as he is the highest 
beneficiary.
   This is what worries President Chiluba. This is what seems to propel 
him in all that he does. But the disastrous endings of people who pursue 
the goals of vanity in the world are many. And President Chiluba is 
pushing this country on that path. I beg all men and women of goodwill 
to go down on their knees to beg President Chiluba not to drag our 
country into chaos. A constitution that is not accepted and respected by 
a large section of society is a recipe for bloodshed. The President and 
his people, as defence minister Ben Mwila once remarked, have 
accumulated enough money to go and live abroad comfortably.
   The government seems to be running out of arguments to justify its 
refusal to adopt the Constitution through a constituent assembly.
   Opening the fifth session of the seventh National Assembly, President 
Frederick Chiluba warned that the government will not bow to pressure 
from some elements with axes to grind to adopt the constitution through 
a constituent assembly.
   The President also cautioned that any other procedures dictated to by 
disgruntled elements would only entail the law of the jungle. This type 
of language is very familiar to most Zambians. It is not different to 
former president Kenneth Kaunda's language during the Second Republic.
   But I fail to appreciate the link between one being disgruntled with 
President Chiluba and the method of adopting the constitution. What is 
personal about the Constitution? Can any reasonable person really 
personalise a Constitution? Is the Constitution of the Republic of 
Zambia a personal property of the President and his friends in the MMD 
club, which they can resolve to disband tomorrow?
   Can a citizen's rights be measured on the basis of his or her 
disposition towards those in power? The plural society Zambians ushered 
in 1991 had at its core, the empowerment of those with axes to grind 
them and the disgruntled to be disgruntled. Dissent is a constitutional 
right that must be scrupulously respected. President Chiluba was at one 
time a 'disgruntled' person with 'an axe to grind' with former president 
Kaunda. 
   Our Constitution will, and should, not be an exclusive product of the 
friends and supporters of a president. It should be a product of all 
Zambians - whether friends and foes of President Chiluba. This is the 
depth to which the President has sunk the constitutional debate! And 
this being the case it is understandable why the 'disgruntled' and the 
'axe grinders' are not comfortable with President Chiluba's method of 
adopting the Constitution.
   The more President Chiluba opens his mouth over the Constitution the 
more I am convinced he is not being honest and forthright with the 
Zambian people. The President's argument that a constituent assembly 
takes away the powers of Parliament is not very convincing when the 
Constitution of the Republic of Zambia provides for a referendum 
whenever there are any amendments to the Bill of Rights.
   The Constitutional Review Commission had proposed an extension of the 
Bill of Rights, in line with the MMD manifesto of 1991, which would have 
required subjecting the Constitution to a referendum. But President 
Chiluba, it appears, is not prepared to have anyone outside his control 
have any significant influence on the constitution, and he consequently 
got rid of all the proposed amendments to the Bill of Rights, in order 
to stay clear of a referendum, even if this meant breaking a written 
election promise.
   The 1991 MMD manifesto, on which President Chiluba claims he was 
elected, on page 3 promised: "The MMD is committed to extending the Bill 
of Rights to embrace categories such as the rights of the press and 
children and rights against all forms of discriminations against women.  
The MMD will uphold the Bill of Right with all its power."
   But this is not the only promise that has been expediently abandoned. 
The MMD promised not to subordinate the rights of the minority to that 
of the majority. But today, over the constitution, the MMD wants to use 
its parliamentary majority to subject all Zambians, even those who are 
not members of the MMD, to a party constitution.  
   The MMD manifesto on page 11 promised:  "The MMD upholds the 
democratic principles such as ... non-subordinations of the minority to 
the majority and the right of the minority to defend its interests 
publicly if their interests are threatened." The Munyama Human Rights 
Commission, in its report, politely noted the party's departure from 
this position. But what is much more worrying with the commission's 
observations is that the MMD has negated on the extension of the Bill of 
Rights when there are concerns that the courts are not doing much to 
advance liberties.
   "The judiciary was accused of being too timid and passing judgments 
that favoured the government, and were against the civil liberties of 
individuals," reads the Munyama Human Rights Commission report, adding: 
"It was then argued that fighting human rights  cases in court was an 
exercise in futility."
   And even Nelson Mandela, a law-abiding attorney whose desire for the 
freedom of his people to live in dignity drove him to become a criminal, 
turned this family-loving husband into a man without a home, forced this 
life-loving man  to live like a monk for more than a quarter of a 
century in jail, when his 'hour' won, he did not want to single-handedly 
write a constitution of South Africa.
   In his book, "Long Walk to Freedom", on page 743 Mandela writes: "We 
polled 62.6 per cent of national vote, slightly short of the two-thirds 
needed had we wished to push through a final constitution without 
support from other parties. Some in the ANC were disappointed that we 
did not cross the two-thirds threshold, but I was not one of them. In 
fact I was relieved; had we won two-thirds of the vote and been able to 
write a constitution unfettered by input from others, people would argue 
that we had created an ANC constitution, not a South African 
constitution. I wanted a true government of national unity."

YWCA Funds Small Scale Entrepreneurs

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Masauso Lungu

   Lusaka - About 400 small scale entrepreneurs would benefit from the 
US$240,000 budget for training set aside by the  Small Scale Business 
Development Centre at the Young Womens' Christian Association (YWCA) in 
Lusaka. Project Chief technical Advisor, Wendy Fitzgerald, said in an 
interview yesterday the programme will start on February 5, and run for 
a year.
   "We have budgeted $240, 000 for 1996 programmes and we hope to run 
about 8 short courses in various areas in small scale businesses," said 
Fiztgerald. Last year the centre trained about 300 small scale 
entrepreneurs, and some of the participants who attended the courses say 
it was beneficial to train at the centre.
   "I attended a three week course in small business development and I 
have improved very much in my operations and I think I am doing fine. I 
learnt a lot," said Evelyn Mwale of Lusaka's Longacres in an interview 
on Thursday.  The centre was established in 1993  by YWCA with Irish 
Aid.

'Apathy' Worries SA Soccer Boss

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - South Africa's soccer boss, Solomon "Stix" Morewa has 
expressed worry at the poor crowds attending the on-going Africa Cup of 
Nations games.
   Briefing pressmen and women on Tuesday, Morewa said the situation was
getting out of hand and would meet Confederation of Africa Football 
(CAF) officials this week with the aim of reviewing gate charges.
   Unreserved seats have been priced at R25 while reserved seats are 
going for R30.
   Poor crowds were seen during the Zambia versus Algeria and Sierra 
Leone versus Burkina Faso matches here in Bloemfontein and also during a 
night game on Monday at the giant FNB stadium where fewer than 2,000 
people watched the match.
   "The poor attendence is worrying us. We are to hold meetings with CAF 
to review the situation," said Morewa.
   Meanwhile, chairman of the organising committee here in Bloemfontein, 
Veli Mahlangu, has appealed to influntial local leaders to draw the 
attention of the community to the Africa Cup of Nations games being 
played at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.+++His appeal comes in 
the wake of the poor crowds that attended the two matches so far played 
in Bloemfontein.
   "This is very sad," said Mahlangu during a cocktail party hosted by 
Bloemfontein mayor, Jani Mohapi, in honour of the four competing teams 
and CAF officials.
   "We accept that African teams are mainly a foreign entity to our 
fans," Mahlangu said. "But we had hoped local fans would appreciate the 
chance if seeing the teams in action and therefore support their games."
   But some Bloemfontein residents interviewed say they are boycotting 
the games because of the exclusion of Bloemfontein-born local starand 
1995 national soccer league Player of the Year, David "Lesilo" Modise to 
the South African national team.

Soccer: Now Team Gets Serious

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)

by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - A serious mood engulfed the Zambian squad as they 
prepared for tomorrow's clash against Burkina Faso.
   The situation was further compounded after Algeria took over the 
leadership of Group B when they beat Sierra Leone 2-0 last night.
   Coach Roald Poulsen last night drilled his army in a gruelling two 
hours training session under floodlights.
   Poulsen's emphasis was to make sure his players got used to playing 
under the floodlights. Zambia's two remaining preliminaries have been 
slated at 20.00 hours.
   But Poulsen said he was not worried about Zambia playing their two 
remaining preliminary matches under flood lights.
   "There is definitely no problem," Poulsen on Wednesday night adding 
"There is no difference playing under flood lights or during the day."
   According to Poulsen, playing at night was a blessing in disguise 
because the temperatures here were stifling.
   "You cannot expect the players to play soccer in temperatures in the 
region of 32 degrees centigrade. Naturally the heat will inhibit and 
stifle their type of play," Poulsen said.
   But he admitted that it would have been better had the games been 
played during the day.
   "In Zambia, we play soccer during the day. But the boys are adapting 
well and looking forward to the games," Poulsen said.
   Camp manager Solly Pandor agreed. "I wouldn't say playing under flood 
lights is an advantage or disadvantage. But the morale in the camp is 
very high. There are no injuries and the boys are raring to go," Pandor 
said.
   So determined and sharp were the players in their workout that one 
Burkinabe journalist remarked; "Our boys are in trouble."
   Today is a rest day for the team. "We are taking them on a sight-
seeing tour of Bloemfontein but training will continue tomorrow, with 
two sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening," Pandor said.
   And Algeria yesterday beat a determined Sierra Leone side and 
immediately took over the leadership of Group B with four points from 
two games.
   A goal in each half were enough to push Sierra Leone into second 
position ahead of Zambia and Burkina Faso.
   Zambia plays Burkina Faso on Saturday while Algeria will have to wait 
for their last game against Burkina Faso.

Zambia
Three Quarters of Budget Donor Funded

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 18, 1996 (19960118)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - Seventy five per cent of Zambia's annual budget and 
development projects was donor funded in 1995, Finance Minister Ronald 
Penza disclosed in an interview yesterday in Chisamba.
   Penza said only 25 per cent was contributed to the overall budget by 
the taxpayer.
   "It's my intention to run Zambia at a profit but we have 70 per cent 
of theinvestment being foreign while 75 per cent of the so called budget 
is provided for by the donors, " Penza said. "It will take another 15 
years to get out of the current debts."
   And debt repayment obligations have also compounded Penza's 
headaches.
   "It's unfortunate that the $1.3 billion we got from the donors will 
only be used to repay debts," Penza carped. "We will have to repay at 0. 
05 per cent interest over a period of five and half years since now our 
credit worthiness is more enhanced."
   And this week opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) challenged 
in an open letter to the President for the government to explain where 
it was taking the money from tax collections since almost everything in 
the country is donor funded.
   But Penza dismissed LPF's charges saying understanding of economics 
seemed to be a problem in the party.
   "Twenty five per cent of Zambia's money went to the budget and 
Chongwe (LPFpresident) does not understand economics," Penza said. " He 
is just politicking."

Zambia
Only 80,000 Register As Voters In Lusaka

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 18, 1996 (19960118)
by Reuben Phiri

   Lusaka - Less than 80,000, of a targeted 480,000 eligible citizens, 
have registered as voters in Lusaka so far, disclosed Lusaka Province 
registration officer, John Mulenga, in an interview yesterday.
   Mulenga, said the exercise which had picked up towards the close of 
the initial deadline is now slowing down again.
   He called on employers, NGO's, churches and other interested groups 
not to
 relax because of the extension but continue with publicity.
   "We need a lot of publicity if we have to meet our target of 483,496 
of eligible voters in Lusaka alone," Mulenga said. "We have only 
registered 79,965 as at January 10."
   But public liaison officer at Elections Office, Joel Sikazwe, said in 
an interview yesterday that the statistics reported in the press and 
attributed to his office were incorrect.
   "I am still compiling the data," Sikazwe said. "It will be 
communicated to the press when we are ready."
   And Elections Office will pay the field polling officers their 
allowances for the initial part of the exercise tomorrow.
   "Money has been released to pay the field officers for the first 
phase and we hope to pay the officers in Lusaka by Friday," Mulenga 
said.

Zambia
Where Is Tax Money Going? Opposition Party Asks

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 17, 1996 (19960117)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - Opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) on Tuesday 
challenged President Frederick Chiluba in an open letter to explain 
where the taxpayer's money was going as most services government claimed 
to be providing were donor funded.
   The LPF letter claimed money from taxes was not being spent on things 
the majority of the people were crying for.
   "Government is not feeding the vulnerable groups," LPF claimed in its 
open letter to the President of Monday. "Donors are."
   LPF further charged that government was not supplying medicines in 
hospitals as the drug kits too came from donors.
   But neither State House nor the finance ministry or Ministry of 
Health wasprepared to respond to LPF's charges.
   "I think the issue is really a ministry of finance one so you should 
try MrPenza," said President Chiluba's public relations and press aide, 
Richard Sakala, in an interview yesterday. " I don't want to answer it 
in general terms."
   And health minister Michael Sata was also not in a position to defend 
hisministry, or the President, over the supply of medicines to 
hospitals.
   "If the letter was addressed to me I would have commented but since 
it wasaddressed to the President I cant comment," Sata said in an 
interview yesterday.
   And finance minister Ronald Penza and deputies could not be reached 
for comment as they were locked in a budget meeting.
   LPF accused government of not providing services that matched up to 
the value of taxes collected.
   "Government has not released money promised for maintenance from the 
Road Fund, despite fuel levies being increased in 1995," LPF's open 
letter to the President read, adding: "Government supplies of books and 
desks to schools have tickled to a halt. Government has not invested in 
water supply since the donors finished their drought relief programs."
   LPF advised President Chiluba to take advantage of his address at the 
opening of Parliament on Friday to restore hope to the people of Zambia.
   "We urge you to address how your government will reduce and re-target 
publicexpenditure in order to deliver the goods and services and what 
measures thegovernment will put in place to revive the economy and 
achieve growth in 1996," LPF urged.
   LPF claimed there was ample evidence of "flagrant extravagance in 
higher levels of government".
   "New cars, new offices, new furniture, and trips overseas," the 
letter stated. "Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has confirmed that there 
is no shortage of money. In fact ZRA collected more money than budgeted 
for in 1995."

United States and Africa
[DOCUMENT] Southern Africa Media Group Criticizes U.S. Embassy

Africa News Service
January 15, 1996 (19960115)

   Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA), December 
15, 1995.
   United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a 
U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any 
of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on 
December 15 saying: "Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose 
reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time 
talking to him."
   Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also 
edited the "Peace Process Bulletin", put out by AWEPA (Association of 
European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon 
covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the 
government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique 
Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best 
informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.
   AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done 
many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press 
attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to 
him. "I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the 
past 15 years", Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon 
spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: "I have talked to people here in 
the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the 
US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you". AIM reported that 
when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as 
saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted 
as having added: "There is a history to this."
   AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US 
officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what 
he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon 
said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude. 
"Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy 
would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under 
threat," Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: "For a country that 
supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is 
grotesque," and added, "it will be interesting to see whether the 
embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the 
next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique."
   However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned 
Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. "The government 
will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the 
government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is 
my choice to take up questions," Ambassador Jett said. He further said 
that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds "his 
information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased."

United States and Africa
[DOCUMENT] U.S. Ambassador Defends Refusal of Interviews to American 
Reporter

Africa News Service
January 15, 1996 (19960115)

   Maputo - Letter from the American Ambassador to Mozambique, Dennis 
Jett
to the publication MediaFax.
   Dear Editor of Mediafax:
   Permit me to respond to your editorial of December 19. In that 
editorial you called the American Embassy's refusal to give Joe Hanlon 
interviews with Embassy and USAID personnel a "flagrant violation of 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right of person to 
be informed." Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar 
accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban 
any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.
   Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are 
so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different 
definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution 
and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The 
American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of 
expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging 
the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to 
anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the 
American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular 
country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability 
to express or publish his opinions.
   The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom 
of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this. 
Article 74 of the constitution states:
   "1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression 
and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.
   2. Freedom of expression, which includes the right to disseminate 
one's opinion by all legal means, and the right to information, shall 
not be limited by censorship. 
   3. Freedom of press shall include in particular the freedom of 
journalistic expression and creativity, access to sources of 
information, protection of professional independence and 
confidentiality, and the right to publish newspapers and other 
publications." 
   Since the Embassy has done nothing to prevent Mr. Hanlon from 
expressing his thoughts or publishing them, clearly the only question 
that arises is whether the embassy has violated Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information or his right to access to sources of information.
   Mozambique's press law, law number 18/91, contains article 29 
entitled "Access to sources of information." It states "Access to 
OFFICIAL (emphasis added) sources of information shall be granted to 
journalists in the course of their work." Would the distinguished editor 
of MediaFax have his readers believe that Article 29, which only 
mentions "official" sources of information, is referring to the 
information of all governments in the world and not just that of the 
Mozambican government? 
   In any case, I and other members of this Embassy have frequently made 
ourselves available to the press in those cases where we believed it was 
productive to do so. At the same time, Mr.Hanlon's request for 
interviews was not the first we have declined because we thought it 
would not be useful.
   Since access to official sources of information obviously does not 
apply, that only leaves the question whether Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information could have been violated. Article 3 of law 18/91 entitled 
"right to information" states: "In the field of the press, the right to 
information means the ability of every citizen to inform himself and to 
be informed of facts and opinions of national and international 
consequence, as well as the right to release information, opinions and 
ideas through the press." The citizens of Mozambique therefore have the 
right to inform themselves and be infomed by journalists. Would the 
distinguished editor of Mediafax have his readers believe that this 
should be interpreted that any time anyone refuses to answer any 
question of any journalist, that the rights of all 16 million 
Mozambicans have just been violated?
   Has the distinguished editor of MediaFax never heard in his 
professional career the response "no comment"? Has he never had a phone 
call that was not returned or never had a question he posed that was not 
fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not 
informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which 
their rights have been violated? 
   I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the 
assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people 
to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I 
did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a 
journalist.
   When it comes to expressing official government opinions during 
official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not 
only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official 
positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the 
obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money 
is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr. 
Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his 
reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of 
Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of 
objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.
   Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe 
that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of 
any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority, 
be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine 
whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case, 
Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to 
include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution 
is such a right described.
   I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the 
letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the 
spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one 
occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November 
regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity 
of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the 
press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who 
had worked at AIM and you pointed out "AIM journalists had to continue 
to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without 
success."
   While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed. 
When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but 
was always referred to as the "armed bandits." Today AIM only describes 
Renamo as "the former rebel movement." It never calls Renamo "the 
largest opposition political party" or even "an opposition party." 
Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the "ruling party" 
or the "governing party" which is an accurate description of the present 
without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded 
every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's 
intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for 
liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a 
"former rebel movement?"
   This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias, 
but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following 
quote regarding AIM may interest you: "the service, however, causes some 
controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a 
service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information 
service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law." The quote 
is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of "Savana," 
an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.
   Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about 
freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore 
the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an 
editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last 
word.
   While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an 
important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now 
enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently 
concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had 
been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them 
war broke out again.
   Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating 
the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether 
democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the 
institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a 
strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of 
those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by 
the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the 
oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this 
regard should be taken seriously.
   When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to 
negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent. 
The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other 
repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and 
unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The 
role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war 
and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.
   Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time 
complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time 
worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some 
of those who practice your profession.
   Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust 
you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its 
entirety.
   Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of 
and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, 
please accept assurances of my highest consideration.

fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not 
informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which 
their rights have been violated? 
   I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the 
assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people 
to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I 
did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a 
journalist.
   When it comes to expressing official government opinions during 
official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not 
only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official 
positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the 
obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money 
is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr. 
Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his 
reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of 
Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of 
objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.
   Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe 
that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of 
any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority, 
be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine 
whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case, 
Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to 
include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution 
is such a right described.
   I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the 
letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the 
spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one 
occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November 
regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity 
of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the 
press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who 
had worked at AIM and you pointed out "AIM journalists had to continue 
to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without 
success."
   While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed. 
When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but 
was always referred to as the "armed bandits." Today AIM only describes 
Renamo as "the former rebel movement." It never calls Renamo "the 
largest opposition political party" or even "an opposition party." 
Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the "ruling party" 
or the "governing party" which is an accurate description of the present 
without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded 
every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's 
intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for 
liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a 
"former rebel movement?"
   This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias, 
but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following 
quote regarding AIM may interest you: "the service, however, causes some 
controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a 
service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information 
service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law." The quote 
is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of "Savana," 
an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.
   Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about 
freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore 
the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an 
editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last 
word.
   While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an 
important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now 
enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently 
concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had 
been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them 
war broke out again.
   Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating 
the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether 
democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the 
institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a 
strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of 
those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by 
the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the 
oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this 
regard should be taken seriously.
   When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to 
negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent. 
The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other 
repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and 
unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The 
role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war 
and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.
   Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time 
complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time 
worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some 
of those who practice your profession.
   Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust 
you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its 
entirety.
   Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of 
and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, 
please accept assurances of my highest consideration.

United States and Africa
Congressional Resolution on Kenya

Washington Office on Africa
January 13, 1996 (19960113)

   Washington, D.C. - Rep. John Porter is submitting the following 
concurrent resolution this week; which will be referred to the House of 
Representatives Committee on International Relations, Africa 
Subcommittee.
   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION: Expressing the sense of the House of 
Representatives concerning the political and human rights situation in 
the Republic of Kenya.
   Whereas the Governments of the United States and the Republic of 
Kenya have enjoyed friendly relations as the Republic of Kenya has been 
an important and politically stable ally to the United States in Africa;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is a major tourist destination in East 
Africa enhancing its economic and political importance to the United 
States;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is one of the largest recipients of 
United States foreign assistance in sub-Saharan Africa;
   Whereas such foreign assistance had been offered to encourage 
democratic freedoms, human rights, and political stability in the 
Republic of Kenya;
   Whereas after nine years as a single-party state led by the Kenya 
Africa National Union, a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multi-
party democracy;
   Whereas the Kenyan Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly, 
association, conscience, and expression;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya, as a signatory to the United Nations 
Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
the African Charter, is obliged to adhere to its international legal 
obligations and to protect the fundamental human rights of all its 
citizens;
   Whereas despite the 1991 Constitutional amendment restoring multi-
party democracy, the Government of Kenya continues to wage a campaign of 
repression designed to eliminate criticism and dissent;
   Whereas Government of Kenya security forces have harassed and 
detained government critics, including former cabinet members and other 
advocating multi-party democracy;
   Whereas former member of Parliament from Nakuru, Koigi wa Wamwere, 
who has been recognized as a determined opponent to ethnic cleansing, 
brutality, and corruption in the Republic of Kenya, has been targeted by 
the Government of Kenya for his political beliefs and has spent the 
batter part of the last nine years in police detention;
   Whereas numerous international human rights groups and independent 
international observers have concluded that the trial and sentencing of 
Mr. Wamwere and his two co-defendants, Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. 
Njuguna Ngengi, to four years in prison and six "strokes" (lashes with a 
cane), was conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with 
international legal standards, that the charges against the defendants 
were unsubstantiated by the evidence, that much of the evidence was 
fabricated, and that the trial was not conducted by an independent and 
impartial tribunal;
   Whereas the Government of Kenya continues to intimidate and harass 
human rights attorneys, peaceful demonstrators, and human rights 
activists by regularly interfering with many civil liberties, including 
freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya, especially political 
prisoners, are detained in prison for indefinite periods of time without 
being charged with a crime;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya charged with crimes remain 
in prison for excessively lengthy periods of time without being brought 
to trial;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya are often subjected to 
various kinds of torture, including beating with sticks, fists, handles 
of hoes, and gun butts, often resulting in permanent disability;
   Whereas life threatening prison conditions in the Republic of Kenya, 
including sexual abuse, severe over crowding, poor diet, inadequate 
health care, substandard bedding materials, and flooded or unheated 
cells led to several hundred deaths in prison in 1994;
   Whereas despite constitutional provisions to the contrary and the 
Kenya Police Commissioner's June 1993 announcement that torture was 
prohibited and would not be tolerated, there continue to be credible 
reports that police and security forces resort to torture and brutality 
to break up licensed public assemblies;
   Whereas the President of Kenya exerts overwhelming influence over the 
country's judiciary, including through the President's refusal to renew 
contracts of the three High Court Judges who have issued rulings adverse 
to the government; and
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya's political stability is threatened by 
the Government of Kenya's repression of individual rights and democratic 
freedoms and its intolerance toward political dissent:
   Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring),
   SECTION 1: STATEMENT OF POLICY:
   It is the sense of the Congress that the Government of Kenya should:
   1. Uphold the rights of assembly, association, conscience, and 
expression, which are guaranteed in the Kenyan Constitution;
   2. Adhere to its international legal obligations under the United 
Nations Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, and the African Charter;
   3. End all intimidation and harassment of those who are critical of 
government policies and those working for democracy in Kenya, 
particularly individuals within the church, the press, and the legal and 
academic communities;
   4. Either charge and try or release all prisoners, including persons 
detained for political reasons;
   5. Cease all physical abuse or mistreatment of prisoners;
   6. Release Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere and permit him to exercise his rights 
of free expression, association, and political participation in a multi-
party democracy; and
   7. Restore the independence of the judiciary.
   SECTION 2. ASSISTANCE TO REPUBLIC OF KENYA: It is the sense of the 
Congress that the United States should consider reducing, and possibly 
suspending, military and economic assistance to the Republic of Kenya 
unless the Government of Kenya makes substantial progress in addressing 
the concerns set forth in Section 1.

Africa-at-Large
World Football Stars on South African Stage

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lungile Madywabe 
   Johannesburg - Some of the world's greatest players will from this 
weekend grace South African soccer pitches. This is despite the debacle 
surrounding the withdrawal of champions Nigeria.
   Nigeria have the largest contingent of players plying their trade in 
Europe, but the 15 nations taking part in the tournament are packed with 
players who are playing for top overseas clubs. 
   As the world's leading clubs broaden their search for talent, Africa 
has become a good hunting ground for them, and stars from many poor 
African countries are now earning fortunes with the rich European clubs. 
   The most well known of these is George Weah, who is having a great 
season with Italy's AC Milan. Since re-admission, South Africa has also 
exported many local stars with John "Shoes" Moshoeu, playing in Turkey, 
being the most expensive player.
   GEORGE WEAH (Liberia)
   GEORGE APPONG WEAH is simply the best player on earth at the moment. 
World soccer's governing body, Fifa, confirmed that on Monday when Weah 
was voted World Player of the Year.
   He has played much of his football outside his war-torn country, 
starring for a French club before moving to the Italian Serie A giants 
AC Milan. But Weah's love for Liberia has led him to contribute some of 
his earning towards the national team and he has inspired them to their 
first appearance in the African nations Cup.
   National coach Wilfred Lardner knows that in Weah he has someone 
around whom he can build a strong team capable of upsetting the 
tournament's favourites. Liberian minister of sport Francois Massaquoi 
said: "He has shown the world that Liberians are not just killers, but 
also decent people with talent and mastery of certain crafts." 
   With Nigeria out of the finals and Weah leading their attack, Liberia 
have a good chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament.
   ANTHONY YEBOAH (Ghana)
   ANTHONY YEBOAH has not lost the goal touch that prompted England's 
Leeds United to pay $3,4-million to Eintracht Frankfurt for his 
services. He was a prolific goalscorer in the German Bundesliga and 
Yeboah's continued appetite for what he is paid to do earned him the 
goal of the month award in September and October last year. 
   Asked about his much-publicised squabble with team captain Abedi 
"Pele" Ayew, he said: "Blown out of proportion". However, Ghana 's 
failure in Tunisia 94 was attributed to internal quarrels. Having failed 
in two previous tournaments, Yeboah knows that this may be his last 
chance. The 30-year-old striker has a lethal shot with both feet and if 
his 25-yard scorchers do not elude him, he may be the top goal scorer of 
the tournament.
   DOCTOR KHUMALO (South Africa)
   WAY back in 1992 in Zimbabwe, when South Africa were beaten 4-1 in a 
African Nations Cup qualifier, the most talked about player then was 
Doctor Khumalo (right), with the Zimbabweans dubbing him a "nurse". He 
has come a long way since then, and has put in some assured and skillful 
performances for the national team. 
   The Kaizer Chiefs idol always plays in patches but with a strong 
contingent around him he can rise to the occasion.
   He spent the latter part of last year rueing a botched deal with a 
club in Argentina but  next season he is likely to play in the revamped 
American league. Khumalo will be looking to make a big impression at 
this tournament so that he can clinch himself a better deal in a more 
competitive league than the United States. 
   KALUSHA BWALYA (Zambia)
   TEAM captain Kalusha Bwalya will best be remembered for leading 
Zambia to the finals of the 1994 tournament in Tunisia against Nigeria 
after he was one of the survivors of the 1993 plane crash in Gabon which 
killed all but three members of the national squad. "Great Lusha" is 
still with us today because he simply missed the flight.
   Those who saw the 1994 finals will remember how close Bwalya came to 
equalising in the final against Nigeria, hitting the crossbar with a 40m 
drive.
   The 33-year-old Bwaly is currently playing for Club America in Mexico 
and with Johnson Bwalya and Kenneth Malitoli alongside him, this left- 
footed midfielder could give goalkeepers a hard time. Having come that 
close in Tunisia with a makeshift squad, this time around they may hit 
the jackpot.

South Africa
Task Force Looks at Government Info and Media Ownership

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The task team appointed by Deputy President Thabo 
Mbeki to look at the media will be reviewing the South African 
Communications Services (SACS) -- government's current communications 
model -- in a bid to find new and more effective means of disseminating 
government information to the public.
   A brief for Friday's meeting sent by Mbeki's office to all ten 
members of the task team urges participants to concentrate on 
investigating, among others issues, the relationship between SACS and 
those print and electronic media structures not linked to government.
   Freedom of Expression Institute chairman Raymond Louw, who is a task 
team member, said the team would also be reviewing the government's 
existing policy on communication and placing "special emphasis" on re-
assessing affirmative action policies.
   "Ownership and control of the media, and how it affects government 
communications is also one of the key issues for the task team," Louw 
said.
   Another member of the task team, the Sowetan's political editor, 
Mathatha Tsedu, said foreign control of the media by large conglomerates 
and monopolies should be a priority for the task team because foreign 
ownership impeded the process of ensuring a "diversity of voices" among 
the press.
   "I believe that the large groups controlling the media should 
unbundle and relinquish shares. Sowetan staffers have appealed to the 
Independent Group to sell its stake in the Sowetan and allow them to buy 
shares. This displays the urgency with which our team has to discuss 
foreign control of the media," Tsedu said.
   More than 80 percent of South African print media is controlled by 
four major players: namely, Times Media Limited, Independent Newspapers 
Holdings, Perskor and the Nasionale Pers.
   Although members agreed on the issue of spurring affirmative action, 
some feared that government may resort to "undesirable means" of 
implementation such as using government advertising money to implement 
the policy.

Parliament Prepares Intelligence Probe

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg -   Parliament's watchdog over the intelligence 
community faces its most crucial test as it prepares to uncover the 
truth behind the police spying scandal.
   The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence thrashed out its terms 
of reference for its investigation into police claims that top members 
were being spied on by agents of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), 
which has denied the allegations, during a five-hour meeting behind 
closed doors this week.
   "We have already had our battles with the intelligence services. How 
we deal with this case is a test for us as far as the public is 
concerned," committee chair, African National Congress MP Lindiwe 
Sisulu-Guma, told the Mail & Guardian.
   The committee is responsible for monitoring the two national 
intelligence services -- the NIA, which deals with domestic threats, and 
the South African Secret Service, which deals with external threats -- 
as well as the intelligence arms of the police and defence force. Its 
power lies in its legislated right to approve or veto budgets: "We hold 
the purse-strings," said Sisulu-Guma.
   Public interviews of seven nominees shortlisted for the post of 
Inspector General of Intelligence -- a civilian who will deal with 
complaints of abuses from the public and within the services themselves 
-- start on February 20.
   The candidates have been drawn from a list of nominees submitted by 
all seven political parties and three nominated by members of the 
public.
   The final choice must be approved by a 75 percent majority in 
Parliament -- more than the two-thirds required to amend the 
constitution, because of the nature of the job.
   Since it started work four months ago, the committee has had to 
scrutinise intelligence budgets, learn about the services it is supposed 
to monitor, and find a balance between transparency and secrecy. 
   "It's the most difficult balancing act imaginable. We must do it 
properly or the concept of transparency will be destroyed." It will 
report to Parliament on its work during February. "Nothing will be 
excluded without our first consulting all the political parties and 
nothing will be included that jeopardises the national interest."
   The committee meets on February 7 to consider reports on the spying 
scandal it has called for from the police and the NIA, and to decide 
whom to subpoena to give evidence. It will investigate the truth of 
allegations of the use of bugs and other surveillance of senior police 
officers and prepare a report, with recommendations, for parliament and 
the executive.

South Africa
Man Who Exposed Police Misdeeds Regrets Six-Year-Old Confession

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Peta Thornycroft
   Johannesburg - It's been a long time coming, but Dirk Coetzee has had 
enough. He now regrets having spoken out in 1989 about killer squads in 
the South African Police.
   His confession six years ago about his own role in sanctioned murders 
and his breathtaking exposure of the rot deep in the South African 
security police has brought him little but grief. When he first told 
Vrye Weekblad reporter Jacques Pauw his story, both he and his claims 
were ridiculed in much of the then mainstream media. He had to spend 
four years in uncomfortable exile, in constant fear of being 
assassinated.
   And the propaganda machine within the South African Police, and the 
remnants of that machine which is still functioning, has pursued him 
relentlessly. This week was the final straw.
   His old colleague, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz (who 
probably owes Coetzee at least a good lunch for alerting the African 
National Congress that he was "untainted" and therefore probably the 
best compromise to be the future National Commissioner), chose to ignore 
him and go public with another man's accusations against him
   Fivaz decided to endorse a version of events given to him by another 
former security policeman Inspector HT Moodley: Moodley claims Dirk 
Coetzee told him he was under orders to bug senior policemen at a 
meeting at National Intelligence Agency headquarters six weeks ago.
   Coetzee scoffs at this. His version is that Moodley, "a pleasant 
fellow," visited him at NIA HQ and asked him to make a statement about 
the assassination of ANC lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1981. 
Mxenge's brother had decided to ask the police to charge Coetzee after 
participating in a Yorkshire Television documentary in which Coetzee 
once again repeated his confession, that under orders from his superiors 
in the security police, he sent his men to kill Mxenge.
   Coetzee says he told Moodley at the "relaxed" meeting he would not 
make a statement to the police, but he would be telling the Mxenge 
story, for the last time, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
   Coetzee, uncomfortable in his NIA job as a "spook", says he has 
neither access to "bugging" devices, nor has he ever been involved in 
bugging operations in his life, and that he is in the wrong department 
at the NIA to do any bugging, even if he knew how. He also claims that 
nobody in the NIA asked him to do any bugging, ever.
   According to Coetzee neither Fivaz nor anyone else, including his 
bosses at NIA, asked him his version of the bugging allegations 
contained in a report by Independent Newspapers' investigative unit, 
Spectrum.
   Coetzee learned of Fivaz's statement early last Thursday morning when 
a friend phoned him to tell him the newspaper reports were being aired 
on radio news bulletins.
   Coetzee is bewildered about why he was the last to find out, and 
said: "Let me and Moodley have a lie detector test." Moodley refused to 
talk to the M&G, and referred us to Fivaz.
   Coetzee is not supposed to talk to the press. He would far prefer to 
be back in the police, which he left on "medical grounds" after a 
disciplinary hearing in 1986.
   He's an unconventional, outspoken wild card for the new government. 
In an interview with Tribute magazine before the elections he accused 
the ANC intelligence community of incompetence, and that didn't do his 
career much good. And he's not sure, after this week and his outrage in 
the press, what his job prospects are like with the NIA.
   And he's deeply hurt that some men who covered up and lied about the 
hit squads are generals in the police, while he is ill-placed in the 
state spy shop. Coetzee is not an angel, but so far he has never been 
caught in a lie.
   Fivaz told the M&G late on Thursday he had at no stage commented on 
the veracity of the allegations against Coetzee. He said he had 
discussed the bugging with intelligence boss Mo Shaik, who had decided 
to let the matter rest.

Police Accused Over Christmas Day Massacre

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Eddie Koch and Mehlo Mvelase

   Johannesburg - Police either colluded in the Christmas Day massacre 
at Shobashobane or are guilty of negligence in the run-up to the attack 
that left 19 people dead in the KwaZulu-Natal village, according to a 
television documentary to be broadcast by SABC's Agenda programme on 
Sunday night.
   The documentary includes strong criticisms from Captain Shaun 
Vollenhoven, former commander of the police station near Shobashobane, 
of the co-ordination of the security operation in the area before the 
attack.
   Vollenhoven, who has been transferred from the police station at his 
own request, feels that his efforts to introduce new and more community-
friendly policing methods in the area had been consistently undermined.
   "The old police structure which we are trying to change now is still 
not ready for change," says Vollenoven in response to queries from the 
film crew about lack of co-ordination in the way police behaved before 
and during the massacre.
   The documentary, made by Mail & Guardian Television with the SABC, 
includes an in-depth examination of how the massacre took place and 
explores the possibilities for restoring order to the region.
   One of Vollenhoven's key criticisms relates to the lack of 
communication between the police station and various other security 
operatives in the area. He was, he said, unable to provide an 
explanation for the fact that an Internal Stability Unit patrol, which 
was supposed to have been on duty in the area, was not present at the 
time of the attack in Shobashobane. He was also not informed about 
houses being searched and weapons allegedly being confiscated in 
Shobashobane on the day before the attack.
   "I was not aware of the search by outside units," says Vollenhoven. 
"This creates a perception that police are siding with one party."
   The documentary points out that these anomalies occurred even though 
African National Congress leaders and independent monitors had informed 
senior police officers that an attack on Shobashobane could be expected 
in the Christmas period.
   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has asked Neville Melville, police 
reporting officer for KwaZulu-Natal and former advocate, to head up a 
special task force that will probe allegations of police complicity or 
negligence regarding the massacre. Members of the Investigative Task 
Unit, a crack team of detectives that reports directly to Mufamadi, will 
help with this probe.
   Police Commissioner George Fivaz has also sent a top team of 34 
detectives to Port Shepstone to investigate the massacre, headed by 
Pretoria detective Bushie Engelbrecht. Fivaz announced in a press 
statement that extra informers would be sent into the area and that the 
use of extra powers, granted to the provincial commissioner under the 
Police Act, was also possible.
   Engelbrecht's men began interviewing eyewitnesses and survivors of 
the massacre on Tuesday this week. The team has issued warrants of 
arrest for four suspects believed to have been involved in the attack. 
   In addition, a National Public Order Policing (Pop) Unit will be set 
up in Natal under command of former ISU commander Vernon Hunter. The Pop 
teams will set up temporary bases in various hotspots of the province 
and will concentrate on the South Coast.
   These moves represent an effort by the national police commissioner 
-- along with Mufamadi's office -- to stamp their authority on the 
province. The Inkatha Freedom Party has insisted policing is primarily a 
provincial matter and has already signaled its intention to oppose 
"unilateral" intervention by national authorities. 
   "We are worried by Fivaz's comment that more spies will be sent into 
the province as we have been victims of unlawful espionage on our 
officials by members of the intelligence agencies," said IFP secretary 
general Ziba Jiyane.
   The Inkatha leader says the new measures on the South Coast could 
amount to anti-Inkatha intervention by central government in the 
province. "We are not saying the central government should not be 
involved in security matters in KwaZulu-Natal. But Schedule Six of the 
Constitution says policing is also a provincial issue and as long at it 
[national intervention] is done in a unilateral way this is invariably a 
partisan approach."
   The action by the national police authorities and Jiyane's response 
indicates that the Shobashabane killings may have initiated a major 
conflict between the central and provincial governments over who will

South Africa
Mandela's Children Fund Corners Donations

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Marion Edmunds

   Johannesburg -  President Nelson Mandela's high-profile Children's 
Fund has netted more than R12- million since its inception last year, 
with a further R24-million pledged to it. while humbler non-government 
organisations (NGOs) are battling for money.  
   As a result, NGOs are frightened that Mandela's Midas touch is 
proving so successful that it is threatening their own ability to raise 
funds to care for South Africa's poor and homeless children. 
   These NGOs, many of which have lost foreign funders in post-apartheid 
South Africa, are desperate for larger donations from big business to 
help disadvantaged children, and are eyeing the millions in Mandela's 
fund with envy and reservations. 
   Mandela's Children's Fund has received R12- million, with a further 
R24-million pledged to it over the next five years. There are now 28 
members in the President's Club --individuals, businesses and foreign 
governments that have matched Mandela's donation to the fund and whose 
members are giving R150 000 or more over five years. The club includes 
US actor Denzil Washington, the Norwegian government, Barlows, Coca-
Cola, Pierre Cardin and M-Net.
   The marketing director of the South African National Council for 
Child and Family Welfare, Hennie Oosthuizen, said this week: "I believe 
that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund has the potential to take donors 
away from child welfare organisations because it can offer exposure to 
donors, and all we can offer is accountability. We need some of that 
money in our organisation and we could use it successfully."
   The chief executive trustee of the Fund, Jeremy Ractliffe, responded 
by saying, "I do not know of any of our donors who have given to the 
Mandela's Children Fund through not funding some other NGO in the field 
we concentrate on ... I would welcome discussions with NGOs who feel 
that they have lost out to the Fund."
   It cannot be disputed that Mandela's name sanctifies his Children's 
Fund, giving it a political and emotional appeal of international 
standing. (Those who become part of the President's Club receive a 
certificate signed by Mandela, as well as a photograph of the donor with 
Mandela.)
   Smaller, humbler NGOs -- which have worked for decades in South 
Africa's forgotten communities -- are throwing up their hands in 
despair, saying that they just cannot compete with the Mandela name. 
This is ironic, given the fact that these NGOs were the unofficial 
conduit for foreign funds during apartheid years, funds which, in many 
instances, helped prepare South Africa and the African National Congress 
for the transition to democracy.
   Chairperson of the Save the Children Fund, Mary Hanna, said this week 
that it was becoming increasingly difficult to raise money and that 
high-profile funds were attracting donations which had previously gone 
to Save the Children. 
   "The demands are increasing and the funds are not ... we have had to 
severely curtail our nutrition programmes in places like the Northern 
Province, for example, and as far as we know there is no other 
organisation working there to take our place." 
   Johannesburg Child Welfare has retrenched 22 social workers this year 
to cope with the drop in funding, according to Anne Bown, manager of 
funding and public relations. 
   Bown said people were much less generous than they used to be and 
that they were struggling to find donors, especially needed as the state 
had cut its subsidy by R1-million, and foreign governments were giving 
to the Reconstruction and Development Programme. 
   The funding and development manager of the Child Welfare Society in 
Cape Town, Jetty Botes, said that the society's 1996 to 1997 budget was 
short by more than a million rand and that it would have to cut projects 
unless saved by a windfall.
   "Corporations provide 15 to 20 percent of our funding currently -- 
this is less than it used to be," she said.
   Ractliffe said this week that information and application forms were 
freely available and that he had distributed R3 500 brochures about the 
Fund.
   He said the Fund focused on organisations that were on the coal-face 
of development work and working directly with communities. The fund's 
brochure states that it assists organisations working with disadvantaged 
children, with a particular emphasis on children in detention, children 
who have had no formal education, who are handicapped, and homeless 
children. 
   Ractliffe said 92 grants had already been made, many to projects 
involving street children. Altogether R1,5-million had been disbursed 
and more than R5-million would be paid out in 1996, he said. The Fund 
intended to allocate not less than 75 percent of the interest from its 
capital base and 25 percent of its annual opening capital to projects 
every year, he said.
   The Mandela Children's Fund has, in conjunction with other NGOs, 
helped to fund a Youth Development Centre at Leeuwkop Prison in Gauteng, 
a similar centre at Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, and has donated R38 000 
to the NGO Streetwise. The decisions about which NGOs and organisations 
to fund would be made at quarterly meetings by a committee of 14 
managing trustees.
   While the NGOs' official line is one of regret and restraint, their 
off-the-record comments tend to be resentful and, at time, vicious. 
"Nobody wants to say anything because it is politically incorrect to 
criticise the Mandela fund," said the source. 
   But Ractliffe is not exempt from criticism. He has been accused of 
trying to turn the Mandela fund into a personal empire, and of eluding 
telephone calls by NGOs attempting to establish information about the 
fund. 
   "Ractliffe is the fund," said a source. "You can't get past him."
   Ractliffe said, "I have no desire to create a personal empire. All 
the information about the Fund is freely available. People who want to 
talk to me should keep trying, because I am always here."

South African Mineworkers May Not Support Trade Union Strike

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The Congress of South African Trade Unions cannot 
count on the support of its main affiliate, the 300 000-strong National 
Union of Mineworkers (NUM), in its planned anti- privatisation strike on 
Tuesday.
   Although, as a Cosatu affiliate, the NUM is bound to some degree by 
the federation's decision to strike, ambivalence is being displayed 
among some key NUM members.
   The strike, aimed at what Cosatu terms the "unilateral restructuring 
of state assets", could fail, with one senior unionist, who wished to 
remain anonymous, describing Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa's 
militant stance as "mere posturing".
   NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe was tight-lipped about the 
strike, saying it was "inappropriate to comment", since talks between 
Cosatu and various other parties could "succeed in reconciling 
differences" and possibly reach agreement on the objectives of 
restructuring within the public and other sectors."
   "All federation decisions are binding on affiliates,'' Motlanthe 
said.
   However, should the NUM, as a backbone union of the federation, fail 
to render its support, Cosatu's "show of strength" will not make an 
impact.
   Cosatu spokesperson Nowetu Mpati said she did not doubt the NUM would 
support the strike, especially as it participated in the decision- 
making process. "The strike will continue as planned, and we have 
distributed pamphlets in all the regions," Mpati said, adding Cosatu's 
affiliates had pledged "strong support" for the strike.
   The strike is, however, ill-timed, with factory workers returning a 
day before Cosatu plans to show its "force of strength". The Federation 
of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) also indicated last week that it 
had no intention of participating in the strike.

Taxpayers to Pay Ex-Generals' Legal Costs

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Vuyo Mvoko

   Johannesburg - The taxpayer is going to pay legal costs for former 
defence minister Magnus Malan and 10 senior officers in their murder 
trial which begins in early March in Durban.
   General Malan and his co-accused, including former SADF chief General 
"Kat" Liebenberg, are accused of complicity in the massacre of 13 
civilians at KwaMakhuta in KwaZulu-Natal in 1987.
   The indictment against Malan and the others includes allegations 
about a secret sub- committee of the State Security Council which 
approved millions of rands for training Inkatha hit squads in the 
Caprivi from 1986.
   Malan and others were arrested after the Durban-based Investigation 
Task Unit found secret documents linking them to the training of the 
hit-squads and the execution of the massacre.
   Responding to a Mail & Guardian inquiry this week, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Damien de Lange, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, said defence 
costs of former SADF as well those of South African National Defence 
Force (SANDF) members involved in trials are and will be borne by the 
ministry. He would not explain how this decision had been reached beyond 
saying it was "at the instruction of the Treasury for Finance". He said 
he presumed the decision had been taken by the Cabinet.
   De Lange said there was no provision to recover the money if the 
accused were found guilty. He said some would probably not be able to 
pay back the huge sums involved in their defence. 
   Office of the President spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the payment 
of the defence costs of the Malan 20 was never discussed in Cabinet.
   The South African taxpayer has already paid out more than R3-million 
in legal costs for the defence of former policeman, Vlakplaas commander 
Eugene de Kock, in a trial which will probably end in March.
   African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus said the 
organisation was "extremely uncomfortable" with the situation, but 
understood the dilemma facing the ministry, and that as long as there 
was a legal provision it was difficult for the ministry not to abide by 
it.
   However M&G has learned there is some unhappiness about the 
government paying for the defence of Malan and his co-accused in the 
recently formed Secretariat for Defence. The Secretariat was established 
to ensure civilian accountability in the military.

BP Chooses First Black Exec to Lead Africa Division

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lynda Loxton

   .TEXT  Johannesburg - Frederick Phaswana, the new chairman and chief 
executive of British Petroleum Southern Africa (BPSA) and head of BP's 
13-country Africa Division, is no cosmetic, affirmative action 
appointee, but a BP man through and through.
   This was borne out by the roar of approval that met the news of his 
appointment at the group's Cape Town offices from people he had worked 
with for more than 30 years.
   Not only is he the first South African to run the Southern African 
operation, but he is the first black man appointed to head one of BP's 
five regional divisions.
   The son of a tailor and a domestic worker, he was born in the 
Northern Transvaal town of Louis Trichardt in the heart of conservative 
white Afrikaners.
   A bright pupil, Phaswana was sent to a Calvinist training college for 
primary school teachers at Bethesda near Pietersberg at the age of 13.
   On completing Form Two, he went on to another church-run school, 
Emmarentia High School to complete his school leaving certificate.
   But his stay at the school was prematurely halted when, three months 
before he was due to write his finals, he was expelled. The pupils had 
been protesting against the creation of the Republic of South Africa and 
some were woken up at two in the morning. Torches were shone in their 
faces and rifles poked in their ribs.
   "They were only doing their job," Phaswana said without any 
bitterness.
   "I wasn't hurt or anything like that. I was just rounded up with 10 
others in my class, told to dress and put on a train back to Louis 
Trichardt.
   "They told me that I would not be able to write my finals, even to 
finish school at all, unless I joined the police or the civil service, 
of course."
   But Phaswana had registered to write his finals and had an 
examination number, which was all the examiners needed. So he was sent 
to a school in a rural area where he wrote his matric, obtaining a 
university exemption.
   Because he was good at languages, Phaswana set his heart on a degree 
leading to a career in court interpreting. His brother agreed to help 
him finance his studies, but either forgot his promise or found it too 
difficult.
   Anxious not to lose a good student, the university of the North 
contacted the then joint service company run by BP and Shell and 
arranged a bursary. The two companies set up in their own right in 1974.
   He went on to study part-time for an Honours degree in energy 
economics through Unisa and for a Masters degree in Dutch literature 
through Rand Afrikaans University. 
   In the meantime, he needed a job and went to the oil company saying: 
"Listen here, you gave me a bursary, now give me a job." The company was 
somewhat taken aback, but agreed to take him on in its personnel 
department.
   "I hadn't a clue about BP, personnel or anything else, so I asked 
what it was they did. When I gathered that they sat in an office and 
made plans for the chaps working at the bottom of the organisation, I 
said; 'Well, if that is what I am going to be doing, I think I had 
better go out there and work with the people on the ground. Then maybe I 
would become a better personnel officer.'"
   Phaswana rolled drums in depots and filled rail tank cars for some 
years but by 1973 he was a personnel officer and identified as a fast 
tracker. By 1988, he was appointed a general manager responsible for 
various portfolios.
   Phaswana was appointed to the board of BPSA in 1989, and in 1992 he 
became president of BP Nederland and BP Belgium, based in Amsterdam and 
Brussels.
   On the question of black advancement, Phaswana said that whites had 
little to fear from their black colleagues. Rather than complain about 
the lack of black skills, they should acknowledge that they themselves 
had been living in a restricted business environment.
   "In developing black staff, we have perhaps not applied ourselves as 
hard as we should," Phaswana said.
   "It is a difficult problem, but we could have moved faster, more 
fundamentally. There is headroom for everyone to grow now and that is 
perhaps different from the past."
   Phaswana takes over at a time when the South African oil industry is 
undergoing fundamental restructuring and he is under no illusions about 
the size of the task that faces him.
   After years of tight secrecy and government regulations covering 
virtually every aspect of the business, deregulation and a greater 
openness have become the order of the day.
   One of the most contentious issues in the industry is continued 
government subsidies to oil-from-coal producer Sasol. Even though these 
are being gradually scaled down, the fact that they continue to exist at 
all has been a bone of contention.
   "We in BP do not have a problem in investing in the new refining 
capacity the market will soon demand," Phaswana said. "The caveat is how 
you do this when the playing field, set by government essentially, is 
uneven."

South Africa
Rain Water Economic Growth

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Simon Segal
  
   Johannesburg - The South African Agricultural Union (SAAU) estimates 
that the good rains, should they continue into March could add 1,5 
percentage points to South Africa's economic growth rate in 1996 (and 25 
percent to South Africa's gross agricultural income of R30-billion in 
1995).
   This will account for around one-quarter of total economic growth in 
1996. It will also raise agriculture's contribution to gross domestic 
product (GDP) from 4,6 percent in 1995 to more than six percent.
   The only region in South Africa not to benefit from the rains are 
parts of the Northern Transvaal.
   The main beneficiary of the rain is the maize industry which is now 
looking forward to a crop of seven to 10-million tons. Last year's crop 
was 4,4-million tons. Local consumption is around seven million tons, so 
South Africa should be able to export maize this year and restore its 
stockpile.
   The wheat crop is estimated at 2,3-million tons (1,8-million last 
year) which should cover domestic consumption. Horticultural output is 
expected to grow 10 to 12 percent, while animal production should remain 
constant as herds are rebuilt.
   Despite the rains, the SAAU does not expect food prices to drop over 
the year as demand picks up when world food stocks are at their lowest 
levels in 30 years.
   Those foods that South Africa exports - mainly fruit and wine - could 
see price rises of over 10 percent. Other price rises should average 
around 10 percent.
   The rains will also not reverse the narrowing trade gap between 
agricultural imports and exports. In 1994, when South Africa enjoyed a 
bumper agricultural season, agricultural exports totaled R8,3-billion 
and imports R4,9-billion. The Agricultural department reckons in 1995 
exports were up 15 percent (to R9,5-billion) and imports 20 percent (to 
R6- billion). The rise in imports was largely due to loopholes in meat 
importation which has subsequently been tightened.
   For 1996 the "guesstimate" is for exports to rise 10 percent (to 
R10,5-billion) and imports to increase by 15 percent (to R6,8-billion). 
The trend is clear - in a deregulating agricultural industry, imports 
are increasing at a more rapid rate than exports.
   So the rains will bring more food, although not cheaper, and 
contribute favourably on a net basis to South Africa's balance of 
payments.

South Africa
Expensive Oil-from-Gas Plant Presents Conundrum

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Aspasia Karras 
  
   Johannesburg - Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, the old 
stalwart of the South African political theatre, Pik Botha openly 
concedes that Mossgas was a purely strategic investment that made 
absolutely no economic sense. 
   In fact, so categorical is he that he wryly points out, "If this had 
happened in a private company, the board of directors would have been 
fired." 
   Barring the irony, the statement about one more apartheid white 
elephant, is illustrative of the current privatisation debate. 
   The gas into oil conversion plant doubled its projected costs, so 
even though the plant is now producing a cash profit, it will never 
manage to put a dent in the R11-billion that it eventually cost the 
state. This, however, is history. 
   Botha concedes that he would never have taken that cabinet decision 
again; the question that now prevails is, what to do with it, and who 
should do it?
   A brief summary of the "conundrum", as cabinet has characterised the 
issue, is difficult. 
   Mossgas and the Central Energy Fund (CEF) are pushing for an 
investment of R840-million in the Mossgas plant, in order to develop 
satellite fields and to introduce compression, from which they expect to 
yield a net income of about R2,5-billion in 26 months. 
   These figures have been challenged on the basis that the projected 
income was taking into account artificial elements, like tariff 
protection, and synfuel levy, which in light of the deregulation and 
rationalisation of government involvement in liquid fuels, is falsely 
premised. 
   The monitoring committee has opposed this, although it is prepared to 
contemplate limited compression, and has demanded that a survey of the 
marketability of Mossgas be undertaken. 
   The prospective buyer, or "invisible man", is being negotiated with 
the appointed consultants Rand Merchant Bank and international 
consultants Arthur D Little.
   Some of the prospective buyers include: a troika composed of Sasol, 
Sentrachem and AECI, who plan to convert Mossgas into methanol 
production; an elusive Taiwanese option that brings into focus South 
Africa's continued flirtation with the wrong part of China; Sasol; 
Gencor; and even a recent suggestion from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki 
that Malaysia is willing to bid. 
   The deadline for the consultants to make a judgment call is the end 
of February, and while Botha is reluctant to estimate a price tag, what 
he does say is that a decision needs to be taken urgently on whether to 
invest, as the oil well is about to run dry. 
   The projected 25-year supply has dwindled to a mere five which means 
that the elephant will lose even more investment appeal, if production 
stops altogether in 1997 and Mossgas loses its cash-positive position. A 
decision on whether to invest the R840-million is of dire necessity
   The question needs to be asked: why should the government privatise 
if there is an option of relative profitability? Neil Morrison of Rand 
Merchant Bank states that "To proceed with privatisation or changing the 
role of the state, it must demonstrably lead to tangible benefits for 
the various stakeholders, in particular labour and the historically 
disadvantaged."
   Wielding his double-edged sword, Botha is the first to concede that 
oil is one of those strategic trump cards for any country, and yet 
questions the rationale of state involvement in industries in which it 
has very little expertise, resources and skill. 
   The much-slammed Moseneke report, as well as the upcoming Cosatu 
strike, bring the question into bold relief. 
   In determining the country's long-term interests, the urgency of 
certain decisions takes on tragic proportions. Botha attempts to resolve 
the conundrum with a typical rough and ready, diplomatic answer, "Prize 
number one, for me is to sell it but also to negotiate that the new 
owner produces a new product, so as to continue to generate economic 
stability and development in that part of the country."
   He is full of those grand Rhodes-like visions, for development, 
eloquently conjuring up images of the Southern African Power Pool 
agreement to develop the Zaire rapids, solar power projects to be 
facilitated by the CEF, and tourist attractions in the Soutpan. 
   But most evidently the question of what is really in the country's 
good still troubles him. "Do you save on foreign exchange and earn 
income on fuel, or go for the jobsaving option that a conversion to 
methanol would provide? Perhaps a combination is more viable by 
retaining the state interest in part.
   "The argument could also follow a different route, create long-term 
viability, but lose foreign exchange and suffer temporary job losses."
   He is clear about electricity, though, "It is not in our interest to 
privatise, there needs to be centralisation, our status quo is a result 
of the fragmentation, there exist over 300 suppliers, and 2 000 tariffs, 
there is no clarity or security for potential investors. I have great 
faith in Dr Ian McRae (head of the National Electricity Forum) - he is a 
man of vision and imagination."
   It is probably imagination that is needed in the question of 
privatisation. Morrison argues, "Government has to make the choice 
whether to squander the future as a competitive economy or to make hard 
adjustments right now. Policy matters, the decisions government makes, 
affects directly which shareholders benefit and which don't."
   As to Mossgas, Rand Merchant Bank is still mum, arguing that it is 
premature to comment. 
   Botha, in a pithy allegory, sums it up by quoting a phrase that ex-
cabinet minister Piet du Plessis has on his prison wall, "In die konsert 
van die lewe is daar geen program nie" which Botha then slyly adapts to 
"In die konsert van Mossgas is daar geen program nie."

Soccer: Cameroon Lion Meet Home Team in Cup Openers

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lungile Madywabe
  
   Johannesburg - South Africa opens the 20th African Nations Cup finals 
on Saturday with a tough clash against Cameroon at the FNB Stadium in 
Johannesburg, and in the Group of Death - the other teams are Egypt and 
Angola -- every point will be vital.
   Because of the recent problems the Federation of Cameroon Football 
(Fecafoot) has had with Fifa over the government's interference with the 
election of Fecafoot members - coupled with the bad result on the field 
-- Cameroon come here as underdogs. 
   But it must not be forgotten that six years ago Cameroon stunned the 
world when they beat two-time world champions Argentina in the opening 
match of the World Cup in Italy. Cameroon sank Argentina with a first-
half goal, and doggedly -- with nine men -- they defended until the 
final whistle to record a historic victory. 
   Rated as the "no hopers" in Italy, the west African country got the 
result that was to give African teams the respect they deserve on the 
international stage. 
   African champions in 1984 and 1988, and quarter-finalists in 1990 in 
Italy, the players of the Indomitable Lions will more than likely be 
able to withstand the pressure of the occasion on Saturday afternoon. 
   To use the words of one soccer official, 10 seconds before the game 
the South African players would have sweated three times more than their 
opponents. The simple reason is that Bafana Bafana have never played 
such an important match since their arrival back in the international 
arena. 
   But much has also changed since South Africa first took those first 
tentative steps back onto the international stage. South Africa can 
boast a run of seven unbeaten games this year and include in their line-
up of seasoned strikers the likes of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Mark 
Williams and Philemon "Chippa" Masinga of Leeds United. 
   However both remain doubtful starters. Masinga will only arrive on 
Friday as Leeds played a cup game on Wednesday and Williams sustained an 
ankle injury doing duty for his team last weekend. 
   National coach Clive Barker seemed undisturbed, saying: "I am sure 
everyone will be fit for Saturday." Williams may be fit but Masinga 
playing after 10 hours on the plane would be asking too much. 
   Previously players and officials have used jet-lag as an excuse for 
bad performances, but with so much to play for one hopes that there will 
be no silly excuses. 
   Neil Tovey, the South African captain affectionately known as 
"mkhukhu", will have to marshal his defence against the likes of 
Francois Omam Biyick, Augustine Simo, Alphonse Tchami who now wears the 
famous number nine Roger Milla jersey. 
   Cameroon coach Jules Nyongha will pin his hopes on the dazzling 
midfielder Roger Feutumba to exploit any South African weaknesses. 
Feutumba played for Mamelodi Sundowns for most of this year so he has 
experience of local conditions and players. 
   With injury doubts about their forwards South Africa go into this 
game without too many attacking options and Daniel Mudau, who came in as 
a late replacement for Sean Dundee, is also suffering from an ankle 
injury.
   Shaun Bartlett, who made his debut for South Africa in the recent 
Simba Four Nations Cup, will have to test his abilities against the big, 
strong Cameroon defence. 
   One thing that still baffles me is why the enterprising Umtata Bucks 
striker Brendon Augustine was left out. He last wore South African 
colours when he scored an equaliser against Mozambique in a friendly.
   Comforting news is that Barker said he would call on him should the 
worst come to the worst. The winger Helman Mkhelele should be a constant 
menace down the line if he is played.  
   Their financial problems aside, Cameroon are sure to give South 
Africa and their supporters a run for their money. The two teams have 
met four times, sharing the spoils twice, with South Africa winning one 
and Cameroon taking the other. 
   The tournament is played in a round robin system, with three points 
for a win. The top two teams in each group will go through to the 
quarter-finals. 
   At this knockout stage, in the event of a draw after full time, 30 
minutes extra time will be played followed by a penalty shootout if the 
two teams are still even.

Sailing: Yacht Rises To The Occasion

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jonathan Spencer Jones

   Cape Town - CAPE TOWN put on her finest with an almost windless 
morning giving way to a fresh 20-knot south-easterly for the start of 
the Rothmans Cape to Rio on Saturday, and hundreds of well-wishers 
lining the seashore and on craft from jet skis to ocean-going tugs 
turned out to cheer the fleet on its way.
   For the 46 entrants -- eight of the smaller yachts having taken the 
early start on January 2 -- the weeks and months, and in some cases 
years, of preparation came to fruition with the firing of the start gun 
by Deputy Minister of Defence Ronnie Kasrils at 3pm, and they were led 
off by the Whitbread 60 Corum Meteorite skippered by Frenchman Pierre 
Mas and German Hasso Plattner's hi-tech ILC 70 Fancourt's Morning Glory 
down to the first mark off Granger Bay.
   Rounding just astern of Corum Meteorite, Fancourt's Morning Glory's 
spinnaker was the first to fly, however, and she surged ahead to lead 
round the second mark off Mouille Point -- and take the newly instituted 
Telkom Trophy as the first yacht to do so -- before setting a westerly 
course to clear Robben Island to seaward.
   First of the South African entries round the second mark was the new 
Simonis 60 Warrior skippered by Rick Nankin, but opting instead to take 
full advantage of the south-easter, led the majority of the remainder of 
the fleet out of Table Bay on the "traditional" spinnaker run inshore of 
Robben Island.
   The fleet soon started to spread, however, and by the end of the 
first day at sea, during which Fancourt's Morning Glory covered a 24- 
hour race record of 330 miles, some 150 miles separated the maxis from 
the smallest yachts at the rear, with Warrior marginally in the lead on 
handicap.
   But day two belonged to the Lavranos-designed 77-foot maxi Daly's 
International Insurances skippered by Mike Daly sailing a more westerly 
course than the leaders and notching up 296 miles to put her into the 
lead on handicap, before reverting to the more north-westerly routing as 
her wind ran out.
   By the end of the third day, Fancourt's Morning Glory had 
consolidated her lead to almost 40 miles ahead of a neck-and-neck 
Nicorette skippered by Swede Ludde Ingvall and Corum Meteorite following 
a slightly more southerly route, as well as moving into first place on 
handicap, four minutes ahead of Nicorette, while Warrior had slipped to 
fourth, behind third-placed Wizard with Jan Reuvers at the helm showing 
her form after a slow start.
   In the cruiser monohull class, Durban yacht Dream Reach skippered by 
Colin Bryson held a marginal lead over Richard Holloway's Aquacoco, 
while in the multihull class, Colin Kenny's catamaran Manx -- sporting a 
revolutionary unstayed carbon fibre rig -- had moved into first place 
ahead of early leader Basic Instinct skippered by Kieran Draper.

Africa-at-Large
Cricket: Winning Team Has Some Problems to Solve

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jon Swift
   Johannesburg - There is a time for reappraisal and reassessment in 
every sphere of diverse activity the universe has thankfully thrown our 
way. Such must surely be the case in the light of the truly heroic klap 
Hansie Cronje and his side gave the Poms over three glorious days of 
Cape sunshine.
   And equally gratifying to finally break this country's one-day duck 
after four abortive attempts against England in a stirring victory at 
the same venue just five days later.
   Right now, despite concerns about the brittle quality of the top 
order, there is the no doubt sage advice to the effect of the "if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it" variety being applied. This unquestioning 
philosophy has some merit, but there are some areas which can be 
addressed immediately before it all gets broke faster than anyone can 
fix it.
   The first is surely the question of a back-up wicketkeeper at 
national level. This is a priority both for the incumbent, Dave 
Richardson, and the future of the national team. Richardson has played 
every test since this country's readmission from the years of self-
imposed darkness and, it must be added, played every one with 
distinction. He has borne an unenviable task with equanimity and taken 
the pressures which have so often been thrust unwillingly on him low 
down the order with dignity and calm.
   But it also cannot be denied that at 36 he is getting very close to 
his sell-by date. It is time, perhaps, to use the lateral thinking that 
has so often been lacking in all this country's sporting endeavours to 
this particular problem which is fast closing in on the selectors.
   We have had any number of pretenders to Richardson's crown. Erroll 
Stewart has come and gone. Steve Palframan has come and gone and then 
come again. Gerhardus Liebenberg was offered a brief flirtation, and 
youngsters like Nick Pothas and Paul Kirsten are waiting in the 
provincial wings.
   Palframan is the heir apparent as the incumbent South Africa "A" - 
such an exercise in alphabetic semantics this name for a team - and 
among the 20 named for the initial World Cup squad. One must question 
his ability close to the stumps against a spinner like Paul Adams 
though. Adams is going to be around for a while. The man behind the 
stumps will have to grow with him.
   And why, too, did Palframan not do exactly what Richardson did when 
Adams had him floundering and ask the teenage wrist spin wonder to 
explain what he was doing?
   Richardson's perception of the Adams wiles improved dramatically 
after an on-pitch conflab at Newlands. For the reserve side against 
England at Kimberley, Palframan never quite seemed to get the hang of 
it.
   Liebenberg, one feels, will never wear the wicketkeeping gloves with 
any real panache, although there can be little doubt that he has a fine 
future as a batsman.
   Pothas is rapidly improving behind the stumps under the tutelage of 
Ray Jennings at Transvaal and has a maiden ton against the English to 
show that his batting is coming on in leaps and bounds.
   Kirsten has all the pedigree and the competitive nature of his 
pedigree and one feels that he will one day take the step that the 
Kirsten family seem to regard as a natural progression.
   But none of them look really ready to step in if Richardson decides 
to call it a day ... and yet there is an answer if the selectors look 
past the obvious.
   Rudi Steyn has all the credentials even if it is a while since he has 
stood behind the stumps. He kept wicket with some distinction for South 
African Universities and has also been considered good enough to open 
the batting for this country. He also has the advantage of nine years on 
Richardson.
   Steyn is, in perhaps a different light, the type of multi-discipline 
player coach Bob Woolmer is on record as saying he is looking for.
   The multi-discipline approach has already thrown up Shaun Pollock, 
Jacques Kallis and - if you include his batting heroics with Dave 
Richardson in the 73-run last wicket stand which ultimately was a major 
factor in winning the test and series at Newlands - Paul Adams.
   On Adams, several volumes have already been written about a man who 
has yet to reach his 19th birthday and play a hat-trick of test matches. 
   There are still some patently raw patches about him which a career 
slated to be a long one will surely iron out. 
   The unique strangulated action and a control far beyond his years are 
always going to give opposition batters problems.
   But Adams, who has already learnt to disguise his grip, needs to 
concentrate on the speed of his run-up for the arm ball he bowls so 
well. His pace quickens perceptibly up to the wicket and makes it easy 
to pick.
   The youngster also needs to learn that the simplest way to get the 
ball to loop up to the bat is to deliver from half a yard (it is after 
all an imperial game) short of the crease. 
   These fairly simplistic things he will learn. He is too good a player 
to ignore them.
   Pollock, too, has been a revelation. He has a superb action and the 
fire to take the batsman on physically which makes a great fast bowler. 
Surely, this cannot be argued after his five- wicket haul at Newlands. 
Or his four for 34 in the opening one-day encounter against England at 
the same venue.
   Grafted onto this is a growing confidence in his undoubted ability 
with the bat shown in the stand at Kingsmead with Allan Donald and the 
sparkling 66 off a like number of balls in the 50-overs match at 
Newlands.
   Kallis, while he does not have the pace of a Pollock or a Donald or 
indeed the frustrating guile of Adams, is a more than useful medium 
pacer and will only grow in this department as his test experience is 
rounded out.
   But there remains one point to consider. The pressure on Kallis with 
the bat is far more intense than the pressure on the Cape 20-year- old 
with the ball. 
   And one senses that while Pollock and Adams have been allowed to play 
their natural games, Kallis has operated under the severe restrictions 
of a preconceived game plan and his place in the batting line-up.
   It returns us to the use of lateral thinking. Kallis is naturally 
aggressive with the bat and equally at home in the troublesome No 3 
spot. Against England in the decider in Cape Town he was neither. And 
this with Hansie Cronje battling to find anything approaching the form 
he is capable of.
   Talent, it is true, will come through eventually, but placing 
shackles on it either slows the growth or stunts it altogether. Giving 
Kallis a freer rein while impressing him with his responsibilities at 
the crease could have been one solution. 
   Moving him up an order which has stuttered and started at the top end 
is another.

South Africa
Cape Town Presses Olympic Bid

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Julian Drew 

   Johannesburg - Eleven cities will go to the starting blocks in the 
race to host the 2004 Olympic Games, it was revealed in Lausanne on 
Wednesday. That was the deadline set by the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) for the filing of candidatures at its headquarters in 
Switzerland.
   Until Wednesday it was like trying to predict the outcome of a race 
without knowing who the runners would be but the contestants are now 
clear-cut in the bid to secure the IOC's nomination in September 1997. 
Besides Cape Town the other cities are: Athens, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, 
Lille, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Seville, St 
Petersburg and Stockholm. 
   Although there had been much speculation about a Chinese bid, either 
from Beijing, who lost out narrowly to Sydney in the bid for the 2000 
Olympics, or Shanghai, they declined to file, much to the relief of 
South Africa. 
   Whether the mandarins in the politburo were too disheartened with the 
unfathomable workings of the IOC after losing with what they had 
incorrectly considered a winning ticket, or they were simply making way 
for their "comrades" in Africa, remains to be seen. But with China out 
of the way South Africa should have sole sway over the emotional and 
political votes. And, provided this country can deliver a competent 
technical bid, those votes should be enough to see the Games come to 
Africa for the first time. 
   Chris Ball, chief executive officer of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic 
Bid, was upbeat about Cape Town's chances, but he warned against 
complacency. "I believe every single candidate must be taken seriously. 
There are still 21 months of this process to go and a lot can still 
happen. There have been surprises in the past.
   "For example, in the contest for the Winter Olympics when Lillehammer 
won it was not the favourite. Therefore one should never discount one's 
competitors, " said Ball. 
   Obviously it is prudent to avoid counting your chickens before 
they've hatched for past experience has shown that the only certainty is 
that there are no sure-fire favourites where the members of the world's 
most exclusive club are concerned. 
   For historical reasons Athens was considered to be a foregone 
conclusion to host the Centennial Olympic Games this year but lost out 
to Atlanta through what many believe was the Coca-Cola factor. Also, 
1988 hosts Seoul were considered no match for Nagoya and Mexico City was 
thought to be the least likely of the four candidates for the 1968 
Olympics because of its altitude. 
   South Africa has much going for it in terms of "the missing ring" 
factor which refers to Africa (represented by the black ring among the 
five Olympic rings) never having hosted the Games, together with the 
enormous amount of goodwill that exists towards this country at the 
moment. 
   But there are also issues which will favour some of the other cities. 
South America has never hosted the Games, which could favour Buenos 
Aires or Rio. 
   South Africa should be able to count on Africa's 19 members among the 
IOC's full complement of 106 but with Istanbul bidding for the second 
time, six of Africa's 19 votes could join an Islamic block if talk of 
block voting is to be believed. 
   Rome can be expected to mount a strong challenge with the powerful, 
although not necessarily popular, athletics supremo, Primo Nebiolo, 
leading the hunt for votes - something he has proved rather adept at 
when ensuring his own position. 
   But Rome has hosted the Games before, as has Stockholm. The Swedish 
capital will pose a threat with its superb array of infrastructure 
already in place together with a proven record of efficiency and a 
national environmental policy without equal. But providing South Africa 
does its homework properly it is difficult to see it losing. 
   "Our responsibility is to make sure that we submit a very 
professional technical plan. We must not rely on emotion. We must 
compete and be professional and that's what we intend to do," said Ball.
   "We want our technical bid to be as competent as anybody's and I hope 
that we will then be able to persuade people not only that Cape Town is 
the best place to have the Olympic Games in 2004, but also that there is 
validity in the concept that an Olympics in Southern Africa can make a 
major impact on the socio- economic and socio-political future of this 
part of the world."
   Socio-economic impact is perhaps the greatest worry for most South 
Africans, particularly the residents of the Western Cape. Many people 
believe that the Games will prove to be an economic extravaganza the 
country can ill afford and that the taxpayer and ratepayers will end up 
footing any deficit.
   Ball and his committee are well aware of such perceptions. "We are 
starting a proactive approach in Cape Town which will be extended 
nationally to give more details of the real facts, our capability and 
the excitement of the bid. Until now we've tended to keep our heads down 
and deal with the preparation of the physical product. That was a policy 
decision. We felt that we couldn't go ahead and make a noise until we 
were satisfied we were on absolutely firm ground. We are now quite sure 
that we are on firm ground," said Ball. 
   What the South African public is going to want reassurance about is 
the cost of the bid, but if the preliminary operating budget is accurate 
there is no need for alarm. It is predicted that the total revenue for 
the Games from television rights, sponsorships and ticket sales will be 
R4,21-billion which will produce a net surplus of R94 million after the 
Games are over.
   These revenues have made allowance for R504- million to go towards 
the provision of facilities in a total capital expenditure budget of 
R1,761-billion of which only R978- million will come from central 
government. 
   These funds from government are required to upgrade the road and rail 
system in Cape Town and would have to be spent at some time in the 
future anyway. The government is therefore only being asked to bring its 
funding forward to assist with the staging of the Games. 
   This means a shifting in the priorities of some of the government's 
transport budget but in terms of the benefits of staging the Games it 
will be more than worthwhile. The bottom line for the ratepayers of Cape 
Town is that the Games will not cost them anything and they will be left 
with an excellent set of sporting facilities and a much improved 
transport infrastructure. 
   Of course this scenario relies on the assumption that Ball and his 
team have got their sums right. But with R2,5-billion in television 
rights already guaranteed (more than was budgeted for) from NBC's 
television deal with the IOC late last year and a well tested IOC 
marketing programme, much of the revenue is assured irrespective of 
where the Games are held. 
   The trick is going to be in keeping the cost of sports facilities to 
a minimum while still meeting the requirements of the International 
Sports Federations. Cape Town's operating budget is lower than Atlanta's 
(R5,69-billion) but higher than Sydney's (R3,46-billion at the time of 
bidding). Such figures can be misleading though because they do not 
always include the same things and the viability of Cape Town's figures 
will only really be put to the test when they are reviewed by the IOC's 
Evaluation Commission. 
   On January 23 the bidding cities will be briefed by the IOC in 
Lausanne on the electoral procedure. They will then have to finalise 
their bid books containing the technical details covering 19 different 
themes relating to the staging of the Games. 
   These must be submitted to the IOC by August 15 and then towards the 
end of September the Evaluation Commission will begin its inspection 
visits to the candidate cities. The commission will present a report to 
the IOC next February and four of the 11 cities will be nominated as 
finalists for the bid. 
   These four cities will then be allowed to canvass the members of the 
IOC and the host city will be selected in a secret ballot at the IOC 
session in Lausanne on September 5 1997. 
   Ball and many others believe the Games are an economic opportunity 
South Africa simply cannot afford to miss. Certainly the staging of the 
Games provided a major boost to the economies of Japan and Korea which 
went on to become major world players. But by the same token Mexico also 
held the Games and has remained very much a Third-World economy. Only 
time will tell which route South Africa will take?

U.S. Lawyers Advise on Constitution.TEXT 

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 9, 1996 (19960109) 
by Masautso Phiri 

   Lusaka - Two American public lawyers have praised the preamble and 
provisions of the 1991 Zambian constitution on press freedom and freedom 
of speech which they say echoes similar sentiments in the American 
constitution.   But they have advised Zambians to debate openly if such 
provisions are to become a reality.   "I am speaking as an outsider but 
I see natural rights of the individual in the words in the preamble like 
inherent, inviolable," said US lawyer David Putter.   Speaking at the 
United States Information Service (USIS) centre yesterday  in a 
discussion organised jointly by the centre and the Law Association of 
Zambia, Paul Berch and Putter pointed to some 1991 provisions which they 
said were similar to those in the American constitution.   "It is the 
principles and analyses of the American constitution which we can apply 
to the Zambian constitution. There may be parallels," Berch advised. 
"The preamble to the 1991 constitution recognised the relationship 
between the people and the government."   Putter added: "The language of 
the 1991 constitution recognises the individual person as the source of 
power." According to Putter the 1991 Zambian constitution "makes a 
strong statement which you will find in the American constitution" on 
press freedom and speech.   "Where government is based on the individual 
the scale of justice is tilted in favour of the individual and 
government has to justify its actions,"  Putter said.

Pro-Democracy Group Calls for Independent Electoral Commission 

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
by Reuben Phiri

   Lusaka - The Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) yesterday 
called on the government to seriously consider de-linking the Electoral 
Commission from government to enhance democracy.   FODEP's call comes 
barely a week after opposition parties called for the resignation of 
chairman of the Electoral Commission Justice Weston Muzyamba for 
abdicating his constitutional and legal responsibilities to the 
government. 
   FODEP alluded to this view saying even matters of extension of the 
registration exercise are being referred to cabinet by the commission.  
"Only cabinet can decide making the commission totally toothless," 
carped FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo.   Mambo accused members of the 
ruling MMD of having a "short memory" because they had agreed during the 
Cathedral meeting in 1991 that the Elections Office would be autonomous.   
"We agreed that whoever comes into power and forms government, the first 
step was to de-link the Elections Office from government," Mambo said. 
"But it seems people have short memories."   FODEP said that the 
commission has to be seen to be independent and this is paramount as 
people are identifying it with the ruling party. 
   Meanwhile, Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred 
Zulu said extension of the voters registration will not make any 
difference to the apathy that has rocked the month long exercise. He 
instead suggested the issue should be first taken to parliament to amend 
the act which he described as outdated.   "The government should amend 
all acts, rules and regulations that impede initiative in the 
registration of voters," Zulu said in an interview yesterday.

Lusaka Stock Exchange Readies ZCCM Shares

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
by Sipo Kapumba

   Lusaka - Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is finalising details which 
would lead to the listing of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) 
"B" shares.   LuSE general manager Charles Mate said in an interview on 
Monday that a lot  of work had been done so far towards achieving that 
goal and what remained was "tidying up the loose ends which are too 
numerous to mention".   ZCCM released a prospectus in February last year 
in which it stated that it would like to float 35,470,620 of its "B" 
shares on the exchange but to date they have not. And these account for 
39.7 per cent of ZCCM's total shares.   Anglo American Corporation, 
through its subsidiary company Zambia Copper Industries (ZCI) Holdings 
Limited, owns 27.3 per cent of these "B" shares while the rest are held 
by various sections of the public.    The government owns the remainder 
of the 60.3 per cent of ZCCM shares, classified as "A" shares.    Stock 
exchange analysts say the delay in listing the "B" shares was due to 
disagreements between ZCCM and LuSE about how the floatation should be 
done.   Last month discussions between the LuSE and ZCCM intensified and 
now there is speculation that the two have agreed on a date for the 
listing, but Mate  denies this. "We are working on it, but we have not 
finalised it. I can't give a date because I have not got one," Mate said 
on Monday.   He added that he was reluctant to give further details 
because any "careless and uncalculated statements could have global 
repercussions on stock markets".   But ZCCM insists all has been done on 
its part, and what remains is for LuSE to sort out."We applied for the 
listing so it is up to them to comment on the matter," public relations 
manager Francis Musonda said in an interview on Monday.
   But some analysts have questioned the wisdom of listing the ZCCM "B" 
shares on the exchange given that the company is experiencing declining 
production  and if the government sticks to its plans, it will not be 
until next year before the mines are privatised.   Theo Bull, a member 
of the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industries (ZACCI) 
said in an interview on Saturday that it would be unwise to invest in 
the shares before fundamental issues like privatisation were addressed.   
In addition he said floating the "B" shares would not have much impact 
on ZCCM because the more important "A" shares would still be in 
government control.   Stock brokers, like Finance Securities' Nduba 
Namoonde, say the listing of ZCCM shares was welcome and it would make 
the LuSE the second largest  capitalised exchange in the region after 
the Johannesburg exchange and would lead to increased business on the 
exchange. 
   Namoonde said the prospects for the company were getting better 
especially that the government has indicated that it would like to 
recapitalise the mines with the involvement of Anglo American 
Corporation. He added that investing in ZCCM when the company is not 
doing very well at the moment means that people will buy the shares 
cheaply but would be able to sell them at a profit when the company's 
fortunes change.-0-

Government Extends Voter Registration

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 11, 1996 (19960111)
by Staff Reporter

   Lusaka - THE government finally succumbed to opposition pressure 
yesterday and extended the voters registration exercise by another month 
effective today. But MMD national secretary, health minister Michael 
Sata, has advised that extensions will not be upheld forever.
   "We can not keep on extending deadlines. What happens if again people 
don't register?" Sata asked in an interview yesterday. "Such extensions 
could derail our democracy because whatever register will be in place at 
the time of the deadline must be used." 
   And announcing the extension in Lusaka yesterday Electoral Commission 
chairman Justice Weston Muzyamba said the Elections Office needed K2 
billion to pay the officers running the exercise.    "I have been 
informed by the Director of Elections that K1billion is needed for the 
work done so far and another K1billion for the period that has been 
extended, " Muzyamba said. "We have to raise this money as soon as 
possible because without it, this extension will be meaningless, the 
registration officers need to be paid."   The exercise will run until 
February 9.    Muzyamba, however, warned that the public should make 
good use of the  extension because there might "not be another after 
this one". And Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) has hailed the 
government's decision to extend the registration exercise saying it was 
a "healthy sign" 
   "It's very important to note that the government can at least adhere 
to people's demands because it would not have really augured well had 
they  ignored people's calls," FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo said in 
an  interview yesterday.   Last week opposition parties piled pressure 
on the government urging it to extend the registration period. Mambo has 
also said "in the future, the commission must be made totally, 
independent so that decisions like those of extending should not await 
the  government approval."
   He said the commission should be independent enough to look at all 
disputes arising from the elections in order to make the whole 
democratising process more meaningful.   President Frederick Chiluba 
almost missed the deadline for the exercise in Ndola yesterday when he 
was among the last people registering on the  scheduled final day of the 
exercise.

KLM Launches Direct Flights to Zambia

by Masauso Lungu

   Lusaka - KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' first flight to Zambia will touch 
down at Lusaka  International Airport at 14:20 hours today.The airline 
will fly twice-weekly, on Mondays and Wednesdays, into Lusaka using an 
MD 11 aircraft. And the northbound, or return, flights will be the same 
day.   Aero Zambia managing director Mengistu Yewon-dwossen has welcomed 
the KLM flights to Lusaka as a boost to the country's tourism 
industry."The flights will bring in a lot of tourists in the country 
from Europe and that will be beneficial to the country," Yewo-ndwossen 
said in an interview.   But Yewondwossen had some 'personal' worries 
about KLM's entry into the Zambian market. " At the moment we will not 
be affected but as soon as we fly to London I think we shall be very 
much affected as it will increase competion with us, and British 
Airways," Yew-ondwossen said. "But it will give customers a lot of 
choice."   Today's KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight is expected to be met 
by communications and transport minister Dawson Lupunga, the Netherlands 
ambassador to Zambia Jan Peter Dykstra and members of the travel 
industry.   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' MD 11 is configured to carry 37 
business class passengers and 260 in the economy section

Government Forecasts Six Percent Growth

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - A finance ministry financial expert yesterday said  Zambia's 
per capita income will grow by 6 per cent per year starting this year, 
following its move from the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) to 
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. 
   The expert, Hendrick Van der Heijden, disclosed this during a State 
House-organised press briefing. 
   Heijden, however,  said the growth heavily depended on how swift the 
government moves in privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM). 
   "The current price of copper at the world market is $1.10 per pound 
and if Zambia increases to export well, the economy should be expected 
to be on track with our forecast," Heijden said. 
   He said with the availability of other exports at the export board of 
Zambia, no problem should be perceived in maintaining the growth rate. 
   "You will be surprised to find how much there is to export at the 
export board, flowers and other products, while if you visit the tobacco 
farmers, you will find them smiling because they are doing good business 
abroad," Heijden  said. 
   Zambia's graduation from SAP to ESAF is according to Heijden the 
largest contributor to the expected economic boom as it allows Zambia to 
borrow at  concessional rates. 
   But a press release by the World Bank shortly after Consultative 
Group meeting last December in Bournemouth said Zambia's external aid 
partners emphasised the vital link between good governance, economic 
growth, and improving the welfare of the Zambian people. The donors also 
registered concern on governance issues. In response, the Zambian 
government delegation reaffirmed its determination to continue on the 
path towards irreversible democratic change, including constitutional 
changes based on consensus. It also reiterated its strong commitment to 
free and fair elections. 
   But the government has continued to oppose and resist proposals by 
the opposition and civic organisations to adopt the constitution through 
a constituent assembly, insisting the parliament they dominate is the 
only legally empowered institution to do so.  
   "Everybody in Zambia is represented in parliament, and besides, only 
parliament can enact a Constitution while a constituent assembly can 
only vet some clauses," President Chiluba's public relations and press 
aide Richard Sakala reiterated the government's position at a press 
briefing at State House yesterday.

Arts and Culture
Zambians Urged to Take An Interest in Art

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Joe Kaunda

      Lusaka - A 50-year-old traditional potter has called on Zambians 
to develop an interest in art if they are expected to help preserve 
culture in the country. 
   Malita Chanda, who has more than 40 years experience in traditional 
clay pot making, said this in an interview on Wednesday at a Visual Arts 
Council (VAC) women's art workshop. 
   She said there was a need to learn simple traditional works such as  
clay pot making to help preserve our ailing cultural background. 
   "Tufwile ukusambilila ukub-umba ifya pala inongo ne fingi ifyaibela 
nga tu li no kusunga intambi shesu (We must try to learn activities like 
the moulding of clay pots and many other traditional works if we are to 
help  preserve our culture)," Chanda said in a local lunguage, Bemba. 
   Chanda, who is also a leading marriage counsellor in Lusaka, had been 
invited to teach women artists participating in the VAC women's art 
workshop skills in traditional pottery which she learnt while in her 
village in Kasama. 
   The workshop, which ends today, was organised to facilitate the 
exchange of ideas of women in the field of arts and attracted 22 women 
participants drawn from all provinces in the country. 
   At the same function veteran woman artist and VAC national treasurer, 
Agness Yombwe, on Wednesday revealed that the workshop concentrated on 
the exploitation of found materials (scrap material) which were 
inexpensive and readily available for use by the artist. It was  funded 
by the European Union/CICIBA at a cost of K3.1 million. 
   The workshop will be closed tomorrow by community development 
permanent secretary, Hellen Matanda with an exhibition of the artworks 
prepared during the 10-day duration of the workshop.

[Column] Market Economy Has Made Zambians More Productive

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Mwanachonga H Chipewo (Column)

   Lusaka - Scientists have dug up theories about human behaviour and 
have rightly postulated about what can make persons become ingenious to 
achieve a predetermined goal. The democratic governance  and the market 
economic system are the panacea which unshackles man from the bondage of 
dependance and indolence to the freedoms of choice, creativity, 
resourcefulness and ingenuity. 
   The last four years of practicing democratic governance and market 
economic system have vindicated this postulate. The moment the economy 
was deregulated and all impediments to trade both local and foreign 
removed, the once seemingly unwitting populace and docile citizenry 
simply jettisoned and reverberated into the commercial activity totally 
unprecedented in the history of the nation. Under the stimuli of hunger 
and poverty, the most aggressive among the citizenry sauntered into the 
world and brought into this country anything conceivable from the 
mundane to the most sophisticated to the benefit of all. In the 
euphoria, however, confusion has reigned. 
   The elements that have been caught on the left and napping in all of 
this ecstasy are the authorities. From empirical evidence and so far as 
things are happening, it is evident that the governmental regulatory 
bodies were and are still not prepared and have lamentably failed to 
cope with the dictates of the performance of the market economic system. 
The market economic system, while priding itself on the ability to 
provide goods and services in abundance and efficiently, more often than 
not  is wrought with vices and unbecoming trade practices which can 
wreak havoc in the economy. Fair competition is healthy but unfair 
competition is not. Unfair competition utilises resources inefficiently 
and erodes profit margins which are essential to the growth of any 
business enterprise. 
   Players in the market are not capable of regulating themselves for 
optimum operations. This is where different governmental bodies dealing 
with commerce and trade come in to establish rules and regulations to 
ensure that unfair practices are eliminated.  
   What should be borne in mind is the fact that the market economy 
calls for greater responsibility on the part of both government and the 
players in the market. 
   The government acts as the referee and for as long as the referee 
plays  the part efficiently and effectively, the players in the market 
will respond accordingly. 
   As of now, these regulatory bodies in government are dormant and 
starting soon, this article will begin analysing them one by one to show 
what they should do in order to help build a vibrant commercial practice 
in the country.

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Reuben Tonga
   Lusaka - Zambia lost her first game but won the second in the on-
going International Tennis Championship, the Davis Cup, in the Kenyan 
capital of Nairobi. Zambia lost to Cyprus in all the three sets but 
managed to pull off a victory over Djibouti. 
   In the first matches against the much experienced Cyprus side, 
Zambia's Kachinga  
   Sinkala lost to Alkis Papamichael of Cyprus (6, 3) (6, 0), while 
another Zambian Sydeny Bwalya was beaten by Dembertos Lenodis (7, 5 ),  
(6, 3).  
   Lighton Ndefwayi of Zambia was further crushed (7, 6), (6, 4) by 
Dembertos  Lenodis. 
   In the matches against Djibouti, Zambia's Kachinga Sinkala beat Aden 
Ali (6, 0), (6, 0). Sydeny Bwalya defeated Nasr Changwau (6,1), (6, 0)

beat Botswana, Estonia who beat Moldova and Greece who trounced Togo. 
   Ireland won over Djibouti and Monaco lost to Bulgaria. 
   Zambia Tennis Association general secretary Austin Fuliwa has however 
hailed the performance of the Zambian team in the Davis Cup. 
   "This is the equivalent of the soccer world cup and beating some 
teams for our players  is a very great effort, considering also that 
none of these players play professional tennis," Fuliwa said in an 
interview yesterday 
   Zambia plays her next game against Ireland tomorrow.

Sao Tome and Principe
President Selects Unity Cabinet

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Sao Tome - A national government of unity has taken over in Sao Tome 
and Principe after being appointed by President Miguel Trovoada to 
tackle the economic and social ills facing this former Portuguese 
territory off the coast of West Africa.
   The 12-member team headed by Prime Minister Vaz d'Almeida took over 
on January 5 but was not expected to endure much beyond presidential 
elections scheduled for March 3, only a month before Trovoada's mandate 
expires in April.
   The new government includes six members of the former Movement for 
the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP/PSD), which holds the 
majority in parliament and four ministers from the Independent 
Democratic Alliance (ADI) which backs Trovoada. One other minister is 
from the Democratic Opposition Coalition (CODO), which is not 
represented in parliament.
   The main opposition Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) which came to 
power in the years after the country abandoned single-party rule in 
1990, refused to join the national unity administration.
   D'Almeida on January 6 asked for a "grace period of 45 days to carry 
through some urgent measures".
   He said he would seek to "bring a new momentum to the administration 
to help the state restore its credibility" after the military coup which 
briefly unseated Trovoada last August.
   He vowed to be "rigorous and firm and to tackle the indiscipline and 
breakdown in law and order affecting the country".
   During his New Year message to the nation, Trovoada set March 3 as 
the date for presidential elections in the small Atlantic archipelago.
   Trovoada also expressed satisfaction at the outcome of inter-party 
discussions aimed at forming a government of national unity and 
thereafter named Vaz d'Almeida prime minister in place of Carlos da 
Graca.
   Vaz d'Almeida was deputy prime minister in Da Graca's outgoing 
government and is also deputy secretary general of the MLSTP/PSD 
liberation movement.
   Sao Tome and Principe, situated off the West African coast, gained 
independence from Portugal in 1975.

Ghana
Opposition Says President Must Resign 

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Accra - Two major opposition parties in Ghana have called on 
President Jerry Rawlings to resign following accusations by Vice-
President Kow Arkaah that Rawlings assaulted him during a cabinet 
meeting last month.
   Peter Ala Adjetey and Alhaji Asuma Banda, respectively leaders of the 
New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the Peoples Convention Party (PCP) told a 
press conference on January 4 that the behaviour of the president, in 
full view of the December 28 cabinet meeting, was unprecedented in the 
history of Ghana.
   Arkaah alleged that Rawlings kicked him in the groin, injured his 
left eye and tore his jacket in reaction to allegations of corruption.
   Arkaah, 68, said the violence had broken out after the president, 48, 
had walked into the meeting and accused his Vice-President of stating 
that corrupt practices went on during the regular cabinet sessions. 
"Before one could say anything, he gave me a terrible blow on the 
shoulder which sent me falling," the police document said, quoting the 
vice president.
   "I fell on my back. He began to pull me up but I would not allow him, 
so he tore up the shoulders of my jacket in the process. He then gave me 
a series of kicks in the groin," Arkaah said, adding that he never 
attempted to hit back "due to my respect for (Rawlings) as the President 
of the Republic of Ghana."
   But reading from a prepared statement, Adjetey said "the gravity of 
the act required that the president, in the interest of the dignity and 
honour of the Republic, resign his high office now."
   The incident was "not only unacceptable, but unpardonable in our 
social and cultural code of behaviour," he said.
   Rawlings' resignation is "the only way by which the dispute into 
which the presidency has fallen can be repaired," he said, urging 
Ghana's parliament to initiate impeachment proceedings against Rawlings 
should he fail to heed the resignation call.
   "The issue calls for a national, not partisan response as the matter 
goes to the very survival of the institutions of the Fourth Republic," 
it said.
   "Members of Parliament should not forget that this is an election 
year and (if they do not act) they would be left with the task of 
explaining to their constituencies why they could not take this action 
to restore the dignity of the nation," said Adjetey.
   Rawlings' National Democratic Conference currently holds 188 of the 
200 seats in parliament.
   On December 29, the cabinet confirmed that Rawlings confronted Arkaah 
on December 28 in reaction to allegations made by the vice-president 
that corrupt practices took place during ministers' meetings.
   The cabinet statement also suggested that unless Arkaah could 
substantiate his allegations, his presence on the cabinet would be 
problematic, but Arkaah has since said he would not resign over the 
issue, because Rawlings has no power under the constitution to sack his 
vice-president.
   But in his first reaction on January 8, Rawlings launched a scathing 
attack on Arkaah and asked: "How can a man who has formed an alliance 
with our opposition parties continue to be the vice-president of this 
government? He insists he can still sit in at cabinet meetings because 
the constitution says so, unless he tends to subvert the government from 
within."
   In his address during the third anniversary celebrations, Rawlings 
said the allegations of assault had soured the atmosphere for the 
Ghanaian government, its friends and potential investors.
   During the parade, watched by more than 15,000 people including 
diplomats, Arkaah sat passively beside his wife, Marian, and Rawlings 
and his wife, Nana Konadu, during the three-hour ceremony, during which 
the president took a military salute from 120 officers and 3,100 
soldiers.
   Arkaah, who had not been expected to attend, was greeted with cheers 
when his arrival was announced. Tension between the two men, who won 
elections on a joint ticket in 1992, has been common knowledge since 
early this year.
   In May, Arkaah called on Rawlings to rescind a controversial value- 
added tax, which sparked a wave of social discontent.
   A spokesman for the opposition Alliance For Change (AFC) said that 
Rawlings' behaviour was sufficient to merit his impeachment.
   "Rawlings is a disgrace to Ghana. How can a president behave this 
way?" he said. Rawlings has ruled this West African state since coming 
to power in a coup in June 1979.

Kenya
Government Agrees to Register Muslim College

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nairobi - A directive by Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi that a 
Muslim teachers' training college be registered has brought to an 
amicable end a wrangle between the country's Muslims and the Ministry of 
Education.
   The presidential order on January 9 came following a meeting between 
the Head of State and a delegation comprising prominent scholars of 
Islam, Imams and Members of Parliament at Moi's Harambee House office 
here.
   The country's Muslim community, at loggerheads with Education 
Minister Mr. Joseph Kamotho over the registration of the shs. 20 million 
(US dollars 400,000) Mombasa (coast region)-based Islamic Teachers 
College in Mikindani area, had been warned by the ministry against 
establishing any academic programme. The Muslim community had earlier on 
expressed intentions to train 104 Islamic teachers annually.
   Consequently, the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) had 
threatened to sue the government alleging religious discrimination while 
some zealots of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) had 
declared a fatwa (death sentence) on Education Minister Joseph Kamotho.
   SUPKEM's argument was based on the fact that of the six private 
teacher training colleges in the country, five are run by Christian 
churches. They insisted that Muslims should also have their own colleges 
and charged that there is a serious shortage of trained muslims to teach 
Islamic Religious Education (RE) in schools. Most students are thus 
forced to opt for Christian Religious Education (CRE) which is more 
developed.
   Education Director Mr. Ezra Njoka had dismissed the problem as 
statistical. "We have enough teachers and we do not have the capacity to 
absorb them all. We are just not registering any more colleges," he had 
said before Moi's intervention.
   The delegation to the President's office last week was led by SUPKEM 
chairman, Prof. Al-Busaidy, who thanked the President on behalf of 
Kenya's Muslims and said there was no pre-condition for the Ministry of 
Education to employ graduates from the new college.
   The Ministry of Education plans to convert some of the 20 teachers 
training colleges it runs into secondary schools and polytechnics.
   Teachers remain some of the least paid Kenyan workers and often have 
their salaries delayed. Many Muslims however believe the government had 
blocked registration of the colleges - one at Mikindani, Coast Province, 
the other in Murang'a in Central Province - because it fears a 
connection with the IPK.
   Since its founding in 1991, the IPK has campaigned against what it 
claims to be official neglect and marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims who 
comprise about 10 per cent of the national population of 25 million 
people. Muslims, although spread out all over the country are mainly 
concentrated in the coastal region and northern parts of the country.
   On the whole, Christian-Muslim relations in Kenya have been peaceful 
but increasing suspicion seems to be rising between the two religious 
groups with the latter feeling the former are favoured by the State. 
President Moi is a Christian.
   Muslims have consequently cultivated a high media profile by 
sponsoring several programmes a week especially on the national radio.
   Although Christians have steered clear of the present controversy, 
there is no telling where the suspicion may end.
   However, by the time of going to press various reactions had been 
registered regarding President Moi's directive on the Muslim college.
   Opposition leaders and the unregistered IPK were of the opinion that 
Moi's move was merely a political ploy.
   Mombasa Mayor Ahmed Mwidani, in whose region the teacher's training 
institution is situated, supported the registration of the college 
saying the Head of State was concerned about the welfare of Muslims in 
the country.
   By January 10, students were reported arriving for enrolment for the 
1996 academic year.

Uganda
Anglican Head Reshuffles Leadership

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)


    Kampala - The head of the Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone 
Nkoyoyo has announced sweeping changes in the church in a move to curb 
what he called "corruption and inefficiency in the church top circles."
   The changes range from forced retirement of some of the Bishops whose 
terms have expired to forced transfer of some members of the laity.
   "Those bishops who have refused transfer should either quit or accept 
transfer," Archbishop Nkoyoyo said on January 8 in his first major 
statement published in Kampala since he came to office last year.
   In a pastoral letter entitled The Anglican Church of Uganda policy of 
work and guidelines, Nkoyoyo says the changes are meant to address 
"factors that have caused conflicts in the church leading to some 
followers quitting for emerging sects."
   The Archbishop said; "Some church leaders aim at only amassing wealth 
I will have no mercy on them." Although the Archbishop neither said when 
he would effect the changes nor named the leaders in question his 
remarks were generally understood to be reaction to the ongoing row in 
the eastern church of Uganda Busoga diocese, the biggest controversy in 
the church so far.
   Some Busoga Christians are locked up in a wrangle with their Bishop 
Cyprian Bamwoze whom they accuse of misuse of church funds.
   Bishop Bamwoze has recently rejected an appeal by Archbishop Nkoyoyo 
to consider retiring or transfer as a means to solve the crisis.
   Archbishop Nkoyoyo also said in his pastoral letter that the church 
of Uganda will soon issue its comprehensive position on general 
elections in the country scheduled for March this year.

agency "works closely with poor communities in their endeavour to 
respond to people's spiritual and physical needs."

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Conviction of Ivorian Journalists

Africa News Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  to President Konan 
Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn the 
sentence imposed yesterday, 11 January, on Freedom Neruda, deputy editor 
of the daily La Voie.
   Neruda was sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined CFA6 million 
US$12,000) for "offenses against the head of state." 
   Before his arrest on 2 January, Neruda's colleagues, Abou Drahamane 
Sangare, director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns 
La Voie, and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were also each sentenced 
on 28 December to two years in prison for "offending the chief of 
state," and fined three million CFA (US$6,000).  La Voie was also banned 
for three months.
   Their charges stem from the 18 December La Voie article which 
suggested that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer 
team ASEC by attending the 16 December African Champions Cup final, 
which the favored ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates.
   CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against Neruda, Sangare 
and Emmanuel are excessive and unjustified.  Having previously written 
to Your Excellency on 4 January regarding this matter, we strengthen our 
call for the nullification of their convictions, and their immediate and 
unconditional release.
   We welcome your comments.

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Arrest of Ivorian Journalist

Africa News Service
January 4, 1996 (19960104)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  to President Konan 
Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire
    The Committee to Protect Journalists writes to strongly protest the 
arrest of Freedom Neruda, deputy editor of the independent opposition 
daily, La Voie, and to condemn the sentencing of his two colleagues.
   Neruda was arrested on January 2, 1996 and held for questioning. The 
next day, he was taken to an Abidjan correctional institution and 
charged with insulting the head of state. 
   Neruda was out of town when his colleagues, Abou Drahamane Sangare, 
director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns La Voie, 
and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were summoned by police on 
December 21. Upon his return on January 2, Neruda presented himself to 
authorities.
   His charge stems from the December 18 La Voie article which suggested 
that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer team ASEC by 
attending the December 16 African Champions Cup final, which the favored 
ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates. On December 28, publisher 
Sangare and reporter Emmanuel were each sentenced to two years in prison 
for "offending the chief of state," and fined three million CFA 
(US$6,000). La Voie was also banned for three months. 
   As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of our 
colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ believes Freedom Neruda and his 
colleagues have been unjustifiably imprisoned, due solely to exercising 
their right to free expression. This right is guaranteed by Article 19 
of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 
9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which, we 
respectfully remind Your Excellency, Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory. 
   CPJ strongly urges Your Excellency to immediately and unconditionally 
release Neruda. Moreover, we call for the reversal of the convictions of 
Sangare and Emmanuel, and their immediate release from prison. In light 
of Your Excellency's recent reelection to the Presidency, CPJ trusts 
that you will do your utmost to cease harassment of the independent

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Arrest of Nigerian Journalist

Africa News Service
January 4, 1996 (19960104)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, to Nigerian Head-of-
State General Sani Abacha.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest 
the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-
based Tell magazine, and to condemn the recent series of attacks on the 
independent weekly magazine.
   Igiebor, recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 
1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at 
his home in Lagos. He was then transported to SSS Headquarters in 
Shangisha. Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement 
without charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for 
articles criticizing the military government. During interrogations, 
Igiebor has repeatedly stated that he receives no financial support 
outsiders or Nigerian citizens, and that any information he receives 
arrives by mail.
   On the same date of Igiebor's arrest, SSS agents confiscated 20,000 
copies of Tell magazine's Christmas Day edition. The week before, on 
December 16, 1995, 55,000 copies of Tell were seized from Academy Press, 
the magazine's printing house. Earlier this week, on January 1, Nigerian 
security agents unsuccessfully attempted to seize this week's issue of 
Tell, and subsequently resorted to seizing the publication from Lagos 
vendors.
   Igiebor's arrest followed the December 23 raid of the home of Tell's 
managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, and the December 15 detention by 
Lagos police of Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi 
Isaac, also reporters of Tell.
   CPJ has also documented the December 15 arson of The Guardian; the 
December 16 siege of AM News; the December 19 police assault and 
detention of four photojournalists, Peter Obe, Segun Olakitan of Tell, 
Abiodun Ajala of This Day, and Bayo Ewuoso of AM News; and the December 
20 arrest of Lagos vendor Olabisi Akintoye for possession of 
"unpatriotic magazines."
   In addition, we note with alarm the New Year's eve bombing of the 
office of the Independent Communications Network-publishers of the The 
News, Tempo, and Tempofootball-which destroyed millions of naira worth 
of property, but thankfully caused no fatalities.
   CPJ welcomes news of the release of Fred Eno, senior aide to Chief 
Moshood Abiola; Wariebe Agamene, president of the Nigerian Oil and Gas 
Senior Workers Union; Amos Idalemo, also a union official; and Sylvester 
Odion Akhaine of the Campaign for Democracy.
   However, CPJ strongly urges you to immediately and unconditionally 
release Nosa Igiebor and to launch an independent investigation of the 
aforementioned attacks on the independent press.
   We welcome your comments.

United States and Africa 
Outlook for U.S. Policy 1996 

Africa Policy Information Center 
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
 
   Washington, D.C. - The political climate in Washington will likely 
remain extremely difficult for Africa advocacy this year. Funding for 
aid, peacekeeping and other U.S. international obligations is sure to 
come under renewed attack in the second year of the 104th Congress. Many 
congressional advocates for African issues, Republican and Democratic, 
are scheduled to retire at the end of the 1996 session, notably Senators 
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.). And it is very 
unlikely that international issues, much less Africa, will figure 
prominently in the 1996 election campaigns.
   In general, therefore--short of a catastrophe on the scale of the 
Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Somalia's disintegration in 1992-1993--it 
will not be easy to attract high-level attention to African issues, even 
when they do not involve significant funding commitments. The one 
African issue that seems likely to stay in the spotlight is the campaign 
for sanctions to promote democracy in Nigeria--if, that is, the late-
1995 momentum of grassroots involvement and media coverage is 
maintained.
   Nevertheless, the prospects are good for maintaining some level of 
constructive U.S. involvement in strengthening ongoing ties with South 
Africa. Washington will also likely play a role in selected peacekeeping 
operations such as Angola and Liberia, in promoting debt relief for 
African countries, and in a number of aid initiatives. The extent of 
active U.S. support for pro-democracy and human rights efforts in 
Nigeria and other countries, going beyond business-as-usual diplomacy, 
will depend above all on the level of public pressure and press 
attention.
   
   Economies Grow, But So Does Debt Burden
   
   Economic growth rates for Africa in 1995 and 1996 were projected to 
be in the 3% range, considerably higher than the 1.5% average of the 
early 1990s. But this still falls short of the rate necessary to keep 
pace with population growth, much less provide a basis for sustainable 
growth. Reductions in flows of external assistance, together with a 
still-mounting debt burden, pose additional obstacles. However, rising 
capital flows into South Africa and expectations of increased growth 
there and in several other countries somewhat offset these general 
trends.
   A late 1995 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development highlighted prospects for foreign investment in Africa, 
which it termed potentially the most profitable world region. But long-
term economic difficulties and new burdens imposed by economic austerity 
programs mean most of the continent's people face a grim year of renewed 
hardships.
   Proposals for further action on debt reduction, including the more 
than $35 billion Africa owes to international financial institutions, 
will be under consideration in 1996. Congress may also try to shape an 
agenda for improving Africa's trade prospects. But both initiatives will 
have to overcome apathy as well as substantive opposition to new 
proposals.
   The prospects for economic advance also depend fundamentally on 
resolving and averting violent conflicts and on building and 
strengthening democratic institutions. In terms of security, the most 
intractable and devastating conflict in 1996, as in 1995, is likely to 
be the war in southern Sudan. But implementation of peace settlements in 
Angola and Liberia was still problematic as the year began, and 
escalation of mass violence in Rwanda, Burundi or both was an ever-
present danger. The struggle for democracy against the military regime 
in Nigeria is likely to be the most prominent African issue in 1996. 
Meanwhile, human rights activists and pro-democracy groups also face 
serious repression in a number of other countries.
   
   Countries and Issues
   
   Following are brief highlights of specific areas and issues on which 
U.S. involvement may make a difference this year.
   
   Conflict (Sudan and other countries): War continues in southern 
Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are caught in conflict 
between the brutally repressive Sudanese government and the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army, which has gained military ground in recent 
months. The international community is engaged in relief efforts, but 
efforts at mediation have stalled. Regime opponents in the north as well 
as the south have called for increased international pressure against 
the Khartoum regime.
   While on a smaller scale than in Sudan, ongoing or sporadic violent 
conflict or insecurity characterizes a number of other countries, 
including Algeria, Sierra Leone, Zaire, Somalia, the Tuareg area in 
northern Niger, and KwaZulu/Natal province in South Africa.
   
   Peace agreements (Angola and Liberia): Observers are hopeful that 
implementation of the peace agreements in these two countries will move 
ahead in 1996, but further delays are almost certain and renewed 
conflict a constant threat. In Angola, the demobilization of Unita 
troops called for under the November 1994 accords has barely begun, and 
government forces are highly suspicious that the delay will be used to 
rebuild Unita military capacity. And in Liberia it is still doubtful 
whether the resources and political will are sufficient for the agreed 
disarmament of combatants.
   
   Prevention of wider conflict (Rwanda and Burundi): The situation in 
these two countries continues tense and potentially explosive. Some 1.8 
million Rwandan refugees remain outside Rwanda, mainly in Zaire, where 
officials of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994 
genocide still hold sway over their army and most civilians. Delays in 
prosecutions for the genocide, and threats that the refugees might 
return or be returned home forcibly, are among factors making a new 
escalation of violence possible. In Burundi, ethnic violence will likely 
continue--and possibly escalate-- despite international mediators' 
efforts to maintain a delicate coalition between the predominantly Tutsi 
military and an elected multiethnic government.
   
   Democratization (Nigeria and other countries): The campaign for 
democracy in Nigeria gained new international prominence in late 1995 
after the Nigerian military regime executed enviromental activist Ken 
Saro-Wiwa and eight of his colleagues. Nigeria was suspended from the 
Commonwealth, and support for oil and other sanctions came from a wide 
range of groups around the world. Bills were introduced in the U.S. 
Congress which fell short of oil sanctions, but did include bans on new 
investment and a freeze on personal assets of top Nigerian officials. 
Governments were slow to move on more substantive measures, which were 
vigorously opposed by oil companies. The sanctions campaign will likely 
continue to grow in 1996, but it remains to be seen whether it can 
overcome excuses for inaction by governments.
   Meanwhile, in many other countries, notably Zaire and Kenya, the pro-
democracy momentum of the early 1990s has been difficult to maintain in 
the face of both repression and other ploys by incumbent regimes. In 
some countries that have recently held elections (for example, Ethiopia, 
Cote d'Ivoire), serious questions have been raised about the fairness of 
those polls. International donors, including the United States, have 
shown far more consistency in pressing for free-market economic policies 
than they have in demanding respect for human rights and political 
participation by diverse social groups.
   
   South Africa and the continent: In 1996 South Africa is likely to 
confront increasing disagreements among labor, business and different 
political forces over how to craft social and economic policies that 
address the legacy of apartheid inequality. The Truth Commission, headed 
by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, will begin its controversial work of 
investigating human rights abuses in the apartheid era. Conflict between 
the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party may escalate 
in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly around the local government elections now 
scheduled for May.
   Meanwhile, South Africa will be forced to deal with the challenge of 
identifying appropriate roles for itself on wider African issues, such 
as Nigeria. In doing so it must avoid the twin dangers of narrow 
isolationism and condescending paternalism toward other African states. 
Like the U.S. outside the continent, South Africa neither can nor should 
attempt to resolve every crisis. Its stance on key issues, regardless, 
will be closely watched by African countries and outside powers alike.

Burundi
[DOCUMENT] Security Council Condemns Killings 

United Nations Press Release
January 5, 1996 (19960105)

 ...United Nations -  The Security Council today condemned in the 
strongest terms those responsible for the daily killings, massacres, 
torture and arbitrary detention in Burundi and said they must cease 
immediately. In a statement read by its President, Sir John Weston 
(United Kingdom), the Council encouraged all States to take measures 
necessary to prevent such persons from travelling abroad and receiving 
any kind of support. It shared the deep concern of Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the situation in the country and called on all 
concerned in Burundi to exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from 
all acts of violence.
   The Council reiterated that all those who committed or authorized the 
commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law were 
individually responsible and should be held accountable. It stressed the 
importance of the International Commission of Inquiry. The Council also 
reiterated its profound concern about radio stations which incited 
hatred and acts of genocide and encouraged Member States and others to 
cooperate in their identification and dismantling.
   Expressing grave concern at recent attacks on international 
humanitarian personnel, the Council said such actions had led to the 
suspension of essential assistance to refugees and displaced persons and 
the temporary withdrawal of personnel. It underlined that the Government 
of Burundi was responsible for the security of international personnel, 
refugees and displaced persons there and called on it to provide 
security for food convoys and the humanitarian workers.
   The Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to ask the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata to 
discuss with Burundi officials, steps which might be taken to defuse the 
situation and said it would consider his proposal for a deployment of 
guards in light of Mrs. Ogata's mission and reports reaching him from 
the field. It asked him to consider what role UN personnel in the region 
and other support personnel might play in Burundi.
   Stressing the importance of continued attention by the international 
community as a whole to the situation, the Council encouraged Member 
States to intensify contacts and visits. It reaffirmed its support for 
the Convention of Government of 10 September 1994 -- the institutional 
framework for national reconciliation -- and again called on all 
parties, military forces and elements of civil society to fully respect 
and implement it.

Uganda
Church Leaders Issue Warnings On General Elections

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Kampala - Leaders of Uganda's Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches 
have warned against intrigue, bribery and violence during this East 
African country's first election in over a decade early this year.
   "If any evil people come to you with evil money, dismiss them like 
how Jesus did with Satan," the Archbishop of the Anglican Church of 
Uganda Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo said in a stern warning against 
bribery.
   The concern by the church leaders comes as both opposition candidates 
and those royal to the ruling Uganda National Resistance Movement liven 
up to Presidential and parliamentary elections expected to begin in 
March.
   In his New Year address the Head of Uganda's Catholics, Cardinal 
Emmanuel Wamala noted with concern "the serious disagreement" on 
Uganda's new constitution which he says may lead some people to go to 
"the bush."
   "Even (President) Museveni does not agree with some parts of the 
constitution like myself ... we should bury our differences and build a 
united Uganda," Cardinal Wamala said.
   The Ugandan Constitution which was promulgated last November 
entrenches and extends Museveni's nine-year old no-party system for 
another five years.
   Ousted Ugandan President Dr. Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress 
(UPC) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) which have formed an 
Alliance under DP. leader Paul Semogerere say a constitution which 
imposes severe restrictions on political parties virtually banning them 
during the elections is "mockery of democracy".
   "It is like two men competing in a 100-metre race. One of them starts 
50 metres away a head of the other," Paul Semogerere told APS in a 
recent interview.
   President Museveni however dismissed the Opposition which have 
received sympathy from Western donors particularly the United States as 
"Foreign Parrots".
   "Although the basic underlined principles of democracy are Universal, 
the forms which democracies take must vary from one country to the other 
 ... parroting forms from elsewhere is a disservice to the development of 
democracy in our society," Museveni said in his New Year address to 
Ugandans.
   Meanwhile President Yoweri Museveni has commended the people of 
Nyabubushozi county, Mbarara district, 270 kilometers south west of 
Kampala for embracing the "gospel of development". He was speaking at 
the area church where he attended the New Year's thanksgiving service.
   He urged the church to get actively involved in programmes geared to 
motivate the people to work and improve household incomes in the social, 
political and economic sectors in the country.
   The service was delivered by George Birungi who also reported on 
steps being taken by the church to encourage income generating 
activities.

Egypt
Muslim Militants Kill Christians

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Cairo - Armed Muslim militants killed two Coptic Christian 
agricultural workers and dumped their bodies on a nearby railway track 
where they were crushed by a train in southern Egypt, police said here 
on January 4.
   Fundamentalists from the same group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, killed a 
third person and wounded five in an attack the same day in the same 
region of southern Egypt, a hotbed of extremists battling to overthrow 
the government of President Hosni Mubarak.
   The attacks took place in Minya province near the town of Mallawi, 
300 kilometres south of the capital, Cairo.
   In the first attack at the village of Al-Idara, militants shot dead 
Jamil Saad Said and Issa Yussef Georgi, whose crushed bodies were found 
on railway tracks by villagers.
   Police said the militants had killed the two farm workers because 
they suspected them of passing information to the security services 
about extremists hiding in nearby sugar cane fields
   In the second attack, a municipal guard was killed and three of his 
colleagues as well as two civilians were injured when Jamaa Islamiyya 
activists opened fire on them in the village of Gelba near Mallawi.
   On December 29, Islamic militants shot and critically wounded a 
doctor for raping a Muslim girl in a revenge attack on his clinic which 
left a Christian male nurse dead, police said.
   A group of gunmen broke into Dr. Boutros Maxwell Boutros's clinic in 
Fikriya village, Minya province, and sprayed the clinic with bullets, 
critically injuring Boutros and killing Christian nurse Makram Subhi 
Said, 45, before escaping, police said.
   Police said Boutros had previously received threats from armed 
extremists after he raped a 17-year-old Muslim girl from nearby 
Gemaliyya village, the hometown of a local militant leader, Farid Salim 
Kerdani.
   The girl's family had agreed not to seek revenge against Boutros in 
exchange for a monetary sum, a common practice in southern Egypt, where 
violent clan feuds are frequent and "crimes of honour" are often solved 
far from the courts. But armed Muslim fundamentalists from the town had 
vowed to avenge the girl's rape, police said.
   A day earlier, Muslim militants had also killed a tractor driver as 
he cleared sugar cane from a field in southern Egypt for police hunting 
fugitive extremists, police said.
   Police had ordered a group of tractor drivers on January 4 to clear 
away parts of the cane field near Mahras village outside Mallawi town, 
after receiving reports that militants were hiding there.
   Two extremists opened fire on the tractor drivers as they worked, 
killing Shahata Abdel Aziz Mohammed, 30. Police said officers returned 
fire but the two gunmen escaped.
   Militants frequently use the high-growing sugar cane fields in 
southern Egypt as cover for ambushes and hideouts.
   The latest deaths bring to 938 the number of people who have been 
killed since March 1992, when Muslim militants began a violent campaign 
to bring down Mubarak's government.

Mauritania
New Government Installed After Premier's Sacking

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nouakchott - Mauritanian President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya 
dismissed Prime Minister Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubakar on January 2 and 
immediately named Shaikh Alavia Oulod Mohamed Khouna to replace him, 
officials announced in the capital Nouakchott.
   The new premier has been Minister for Fishing and Economy since 
February last year.
   A former Finance Minister, Boubacar had headed the government for 
four years and no reason was given for his sacking, although an informed 
source said his departure would pave way for "a more politically solid 
team" to prepare for elections.
   Mauritania's opposition has been calling for the dissolution of 
parliament since the first multiparty elections in 1992, which it 
boycotted.
   Among other demands, they want a new electoral code, an independent 
judiciary and an impartial administration.
   And on January 3, Kouna announced his new government line-up, 
drafting in four new ministers and dismissing three others, a move 
political observers said suggested a continuation of Boubakar's liberal 
economic policies, which began four years ago.
   With the exception of the Rural Development and Environment 
portfolio, given to Sow Demba, all of the key ministries -- Interior, 
Defence and Foreign Affairs -- did not change.
   The new premier was replaced in his previous post as Minister for 
Fisheries and Maritime Economy by Baba Ould Sidi.
   Entering the government for the first time were Kamara Ali Gueladio 
(Public Health and Social Affairs), Boidiel Ould Houmeid (Commerce, 
Handicrafts and Tourism) and Seniya mint Sidi Haiba (Secretary of State 
for Women's Affairs).
   The three sacked ministers were Sgnoire Ould M'Barack (Public Health 
and Social Affairs Minister), Timera Boubou (Rural Development and 
Environment) and Mariem mint Ahmed Aiche (Women's Affairs).
   The shakeup comes just two days before a national convention of the 
ruling Democratic and Socialist Republican Party (PRDS), which will be 
centred on key decisions related to upcoming legislative and 
presidential elections.
   Reliable sources here said late December that general elections 
planned for February and March 1997 could be brought forward to the 
fourth quarter of 1996, but there was no official confirmation of the 
report.
   Local newspapers said parliamentarians of the governing party had 
been told of the possibility by Boubakar at a meeting.

Burundi
Despair Growing As Country Slides Into Anarchy

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Bujumbura - Fear has gripped Burundi as the country continues to 
slide into anarchy that threatens to lead to the eruption of the endemic 
ethnic bloodbath that has continued unabated in the two former Belgian 
colonies of Rwanda and Burundi.
   Burundian politicians have expressed despair as they see their small 
central African nation sliding into anarchy, while gunmen call the shots 
at the risk of sparking ethnic bloodletting as savage as Rwanda's 1994 
genocidal war.
   "If we are not vigilant enough, our country runs the risk of total 
collapse," warned President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in his 1996 New 
Year message.
   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are swept 
away and defeated.
   The institutions, the numerous state services and organisations have 
the capacity to agree to work together to overcome these phenomena of 
fear, violence and uncertainty which threaten our people's future."
   He added: "I personally promise to do everything to root out of the 
state apparatus all those who are obstructing the state from operating 
normally and those who may try to sabotage it from within. The security 
forces and the administration must understand that they have no other 
raison d'etre than the protection of the interests of our people, whose 
primary interest is the right to life. In this struggle, the people must 
not be regarded as an object which can be manipulated to achieve 
whatever goals you want to attain, but as a partner, indeed the cardinal 
one," said the Burundian Head of State.
   The government radio echoed that warning on January 4 with the report 
of yet another massacre, which left seven people dead and 20 wounded in 
an attack in a southwestern town by men, some in uniform --wielding 
assault rifles and machetes.
   "The ideology of exclusion and genocide" is gaining ground and the 
economy is being destroyed, warned Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo in his 
own New Year message.
   In New York, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
resuscitated a proposal he made in 1994 for a UN standby force to be 
deployed in neighbouring Zaire, and for guards to protect relief agency 
workers in Burundi.
   He warned of "a real danger of the situation in Burundi degenerating 
to the point where it might explode into ethnic violence on a massive 
scale.
   But analysts say members of the UN Security Council are unlikely to 
heed his call, made public on January 2 and the idea of UN troops here 
is fiercely opposed by the commanders of Burundi's own armed forces.
   That raises the prospect of an unhindered civil war on the scale of 
that in neighbouring Rwanda, where Hutu extremists killed more than half 
a million men, women and children in 1994 before being defeated by an 
army of rebel Tutsi. UN troops there failed to halt the genocide.
   Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, UN special rapporteur for human rights in 
Burundi lashed out last December at the international community, saying 
the passivity of the rest of the world was largely responsible for the 
fostering civil war.
   Most of the clashes here between Hutus, who make up 85 per cent of 
the population of 5.5 million, and Tutsis, who comprise 14 per cent but 
dominate the armed forces, go unreported. Diplomats and relief workers 
put the death toll at around 30 a day -- 10,000 to 15,000 last year, 
according to the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors 
without Borders.)
   Thousands of Hutus have fled to Zaire, and even Rwandan Tutsis who 
had lived in Bujumbura since they were children have fled the capital.
   Eleven relief workers have been killed since August 1994, and a 
number of agencies, including the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC), the French-based International Action Against Famine, have 
recently suspended their operations or pulled out most of their 
expatriate staff.
   The Organisation of African Unity has discussed the probability of a 
UN-backed African force to keep the peace in Burundi, but the idea has 
been opposed by a number of influential countries in the region, such as 
Kenya, and appears to have made little progress.
   The government is a fragile coalition under Ntibantunganya, a 39-
year- old Hutu, and Nduwayo, a Tutsi. But the armed forces answer to no 
one but their commanders, and politics are increasingly dominated by 
extremists on both sides, observers say.

Malawi
State Appeals Former President's Acquittal

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
 
   Blantyre - The Malawian government has filed an appeal in the Supreme 
Court against the acquittal of former president Hastings Kamuzu Banda 
and five others on murder charges, a verdict that was seen here as the 
most controversial since the country attained independence from British 
colonial rule more than 30 years ago.
   Prosecutions Director Kamudoni Nyasulu, who led the prosecution 
against Banda over the deaths of four politicians, said January 4 he was 
appealing on points of law, pointing out that the High Court judge's 
summing up in the trial exceeded the proper bounds of judicial comment 
and made it difficult for the jury to convict the accused.
   "The judge misdirected the jury. All he was doing is to present my 
case and find faults in it," Nyasulu said of the acquittal on December 
23.
   The judge had told the seven-member jury that much of the 
prosecution's case during the five-month trial was speculative and 
circumstantial.
   Banda -- who ruled Malawi for 30 years before being ousted in 
elections in 1994 -- had been charged with conspiracy to murder along 
with his close aide John Tembo, constant companion Cecilia Kadzamira and 
three former police officers -- MacDonald Kalomba, Leston Kikaomba and 
MacWilliam Lunguzi.
   But in his ruling, Judge Mackson Mkandawire found Banda, Tembo, 
Kadzamira, Kalomba and Leston not guilty of murder and also ruled that 
Kadzamira and Lunguzi were not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct the 
course of justice.
   The jury's decision, which took just two hours to reach despite five 
months of trial, and the final verdict split the country along political 
lines, with supporters of Banda's opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) 
celebrating while many Malawians who have long been convinced of Banda's 
guilt were wondering how the jury arrived at its verdict.
   Justice Minister Collins Chizumila said after the verdict: "I haven't 
changed my mind that they are guilty. I don't know what went wrong. It's 
either incompetence or bribery. I've also heard the judge misdirected 
the jury."
   The judge had told the jury that most of the prosecution evidence was 
circumstantial and speculative. But the courtroom, packed with 
supporters of Banda's MCP, erupted with scenes of joy when the jury 
announced its verdicts and Tembo and the other accused leapt to their 
feet and gave the thumbs up sign, carrying shoulder high the senior 
British defence lawyer Clive Stanbrook.
   Banda, who once threatened to feed his opponents to the crocodiles 
during 30 years of untrammelled power in the tiny southern African 
nation, was tried in absentia because of ill-health and senility, and 
was at his house in Blantyre under Kadzamira's care.
   Tembo, believed to have been the power behind Banda as the former 
dictator became increasingly frail in recent years, told the crowd 
outside the courtroom that the verdict was "a reflection of the 
independence of the judiciary."
   The charges stemmed from the deaths in 1983 of cabinet ministers Dick 
Matenje, Aaron Gadama, John Sangala and parliamentarian David Chiwanga.
   It was officially announced at the time that they had died in a car 
accident, but an inquiry after Banda's ouster found that they had been 
battered to death, placed in a car and pushed over a cliff.
   The prosecution said the men had been murdered because they had 
become outspoken in their opposition to the misuse of government funds 
and were suspected of harbouring ambitions for power.
   A commission of inquiry after Banda's ouster had, however also 
established that they had in fact been murdered.
   The families of the four murdered Malawian politicians have also 
vowed that they would continue pressing for justice despite the 
acquittal of Banda.
   "We will continue to seek damages and find out who ordered the 
killings even if it means dying myself to find the truth," said a 
spokeswoman for the families, Mary Gadama, daughter of Aaron Gadama, one 
of the four politicians murdered in 1983. Mary leads a group of 
relatives fighting for compensation and for the murderers to be brought 
to justice.
   "How do you free murderers like that? It means in Malawi anyone can 
kill a person and get away with it. Somebody must be guilty of ordering 
the murders," she asked after the verdict was announced.
   Banda took power in impoverished Malawi after independence from 
Britain in 1964 and soon established a vice-like grip on the country, 
introducing a one-party state and ruling the country as a personal 
kingdom.
   He was accused of widespread human rights abuses while remaining an 
ally of Western nations for his staunch anti-communist stance during the 
Cold War, receiving visiting British royalty in a red Rolls Royce 
convertible and entertaining them to lavish banquets in his Sanjika 
Palace outside Blantyre.

Gambia
Junta Leader Announces Elections For June

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Banjul - Gambian junta leader Captain Yahya Jameh has announced that 
presidential and general elections will be held next June to restore 
normal constitutional democracy in this West African country.
   In his New Year's message broadcast on the night of December 31, 
Jameh said that the voting will be preceded by local council polls in 
May and that the Commonwealth would back Gambia in the electoral 
process.
   The three elections will be supervised by an independent commission 
recently set up by the military regime, which plans to return to 
barracks after 23 months in power, Jameh said.
   The military ousted civilian president Sr. Dawda Jawara in a coup in 
July 1994, prompting international donors, led by former colonial power 
Britain, to condemn the coup and suspend financial assistance.
   Jameh presented an optimistic account of the achievements of his 
regime, speaking of progress in education, transport, energy production 
and television.
   He said that tourists were flocking back after the "disaster of 
1994". This year, Gambia expects to host some 70,000 tourists, as in 
1992 and 1993.
   The Head of State also declared that Nigerian and Cuban doctors would 
take over from Chinese medical workers, who withdrew their cooperation 
after Gambia recognised Taiwan in July last year. Beijing considers 
Taiwan to be part of China.
   The presidential announcement came only three days after Captain Sana 
Babally, former vice-president of the tiny West African state of Gambia 
was jailed for nine years by a court martial here, after being accused 
of having plotted against President Jameh.
   Sabally was said to have headed two attempted coups -- the first in 
November 1994 and the second in January 1995.
   Jameh, who is chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling 
Council, seized power in a bloodless coup on July 22, 1994 after 
toppling Dawda Jawara, who is in exile in Britain.
   Sabally, the vice-chairman of the Council, was accused of having 
participated in the January 1995 plot involving a Captain Sadibu Hydara, 
former Interior Minister who has since died in prison.
   Meanwhile, the military government is claiming more than US dollars 
11 million from Jawara for alleged fraud in an oil deal.
   In a statement published here on January 3, Jameh's government said 
it accepted the findings of a commission of inquiry into the deal set up 
in October 1994 under a Nigerian judge.
   The inquiry dealt with financial transactions linked to the supply of 
17.3 million barrels of oil supplied by Nigeria as aid to Gambia between 
1984 and 1988.
   Jawara, former Planning Minister Momodou Manneh, and a businessman of 
Lebanese origin, Jamil Said Mohamed, are accused of conspiring to resell 
the oil and pocket the proceeds.
   The oil should have brought in US dollars 42 million to Gambia's 
treasury, but only 2.6 million was actually paid in, a reliable source 
said.
   The statement said the government was demanding that Saidi Mohamed, a 
Sierra Leonean national, pay more than US dollars48 million to Nigerian 
national oil company.
   Former Sierra Leonean vice-president Abdulai Conteh, who was said to 
have facilitated the deal, was arrested last October and expelled from 
Gambia, where he had lived for several years.

Kenya
President Bans Scout Family Life Manual

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nairobi - President Daniel arap Moi has banned a family life 
education manual compiled by the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in Africa.
   Announcing the ban on "Scouting Manual on Family Life Education in 
Africa", President Moi said on New Year's eve that the book contained 
foreign ideas and emphasised that not all things that have come to 
Africa are necessarily good for the continent.
   Moi directed that the sales of the manual compiled as a collaborative 
effort with the Margaret Sanger Centre of Planned Parenthood in New 
York, USA, be stopped immediately.
   The move is seen as placatory to the the Catholic Church in Kenya 
which particularly over the last two years, has campaigned consistently 
against the intended introduction in schools of secular sex/family 
education lessons which the Church claims would disrupt the moral fabric 
of the nation.
   The Scouting Manual on "Family Life Education for Africa" has been 
available in Kenya over the last eight years, but it came into 
prominence last August when the head of the Catholic Church in Kenya, 
Maurice Cardinal Otunga, who is also the Archbishop of Nairobi, and the 
Imam of Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, Sheikh Ali Shee, jointly set alight a 
pile of sex education books, condoms and other birth control- related 
items in a public ceremony in the city's Uhuru Park.
   But the African regional director of the Scouts movement Mr. 
Kieraithe Nyagah told APS he was apprehensive the negative publicity 
associated with the manual would cast the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in 
bad light.
   Mr. Nyagah underscored that the manual had been produced "with all 
the best intention in the world."
   "As scouts we have a duty to ensure that young people have a chance 
and access to materials that enable them to develop into wholesome 
citizens," he said.
   Some critics have charged that some of the illustrations in the 
manual were too explicit and indecent. Nyagah says these were intended 
to show the changes in a young person's body.
   While conceding that input came from all over the world, he 
emphasised that the bulk of the manual had been produced with local 
African expertise.
   Nyagah observed that no other country in Africa including the 
regional ocean nations, had banned the book.
   He observed, however, that like any other textbook that had been in 
use for sometime the manual was subject to review from time to time. 
"Where it has hurt the sensitivities of any community or religious 
affiliations, we are prepared to modify it accordingly," emphasised the 
Africa regional boss of the Scout's movement.
   Meanwhile, the presidential directive to ban the manual has received 
widespread support among Catholic clergy and bishops. Praising President 
Moi for his decision, Cardinal Otunga promised that the Catholic Church 
in Kenya would re-dedicate itself to strengthening the family fabric.

Finances Threaten Africa's Environmental Programmes

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Kafui Ameh

   Nairobi - African countries have been urged to intensify efforts 
aimed at achieving sustainable development through adoption and 
implementation of sound environmental policies. But as it came out 
clearly at the Sixth Session of the African Ministerial Conference on 
the Environment (AMCEN) in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, last December, 
financial constraints are the root cause of the continent's 
environmental dilemma. 
   Although the programme of action on the environment which gave birth 
to the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) was 
launched in Cairo, Egypt in December 1985, no deliberate programme was 
set up to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the continental 
organisation in 1995.
   At the Sixth Session of AMCEN held in the Kenyan capital from 
December 11 to 15, 1995, proceedings were dominated by discussions about 
the survival of the organisation and the source of resources to run it 
rather than achievements made in the last one decade.
   The tone was set at the opening of the Expert Group Meeting which 
preceded the ministerial meeting when the representative and Director of 
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa Regional Office 
Mrs. Maria da Graca de Amorim called on African countries to focus 
properly on the situation confronting the continent.
   Mrs Amorim conceded that the African Ministerial Conference on the 
Environment had scored a number of inspiring successes such as the 
development and adoption of the African Common Perspectives on 
Biological Diversity and the significant inputs made by AMCEN to the 
process leading to the Regional Annex and resolution on urgent action 
for Africa with respect to desertification control.
   She however pointed out that the successful implementation of AMCEN 
programmes was being stifled by lack of financial resources and called 
for a discussion of modalities for fund mobilisation from member 
countries, bilateral and multilateral agencies.
   "There is an urgent need for AMCEN to streamline its programmes to be 
focussed more on sensitising African governments on sustainable 
development issues especially with regard to ratification and 
implementation of international conventions, and to back up these 
programmes with financial support," de Amorim said.
   She also called on the meeting to address the issue of formalising 
AMCEN by statutes as an intergovernmental body whose decision can be 
tabled at summit meetings of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and 
the establishment of appropriate institutional arrangements and linkages 
to make the conference secretariat more effective. Currently there is an 
amorphous secretariat comprising the UNEP, OAU and Economic Commission 
for Africa (ECA) personnel.
   "Do we want AMCEN to function independently or to remain an 
organisation that is permanently asking for charity?" That question 
posed later by the Senegalese Minister for Environment and Conservation 
of Natural Resources, Prof. Abdoulaye Battily reflected the mood of the 
ministerial meeting as participants considered the report of the group 
experts.
   Delegates expressed great concern about the unsatisfactory response 
by member countries to financial contributions towards trust fund agreed 
upon at the Fourth Session of AMCEN in 1991. Only Egypt and Seychelles 
had contributed US dollars 679,700 and 500 respectively towards the 
fund.
   The initial idea of the trust fund was that contributions would 
accrue over a five-year period (1992-96) after which interest yield 
would be used for the operational activities of AMCEN.
   After lengthy debate on whether to make contributions to the Trust 
Fund mandatory or voluntary, the African ministers decided that an 
urgent appeal be sent to member states to contribute to the fund while 
examining the possibility of adopting new measures of raising additional 
resources in order to facilitate the implementation of AMCEN programmes.
   The meeting also noted with concern the declining funding to the UNEP 
Environment Fund and urged all member states to honour their pledges to 
the fund.
   Perhaps the most significant decision was one to formalise the 
institutionalization of AMCEN as an intergovernmental organisation, 
providing the legislative framework including a constitution and related 
rules and regulations which will certainly cover financial 
contributions.
   The meeting also decided to continue with the 1994-95 programme of 
work into the biennium 1996-97 with some additional priorities. These 
would include sustainable industrial production, consumption and 
industrial development including aspects relating to the framework 
convention on change, environmentally sound management of all types of 
wastes including hazardous and potentially hazardous and toxic 
chemicals; as well as strengthening the African common perspective and 
position on the Convention of Biological Diversity through sensitization 
and awareness creation.
   Other priority areas identified included the rational management of 
African forests through the establishment of mechanisms for sub- 
regional cooperation and support to the implementation of the Convention 
to Combat Desertification and Drought.
   On the implications of major international events, the meeting agreed 
that AMCEN should fully participate in activities relating to 
environmental impacts within the framework of the UN agenda for peace 
and development and related programmes of action.
   The major international events highlighted by the Group of Experts 
meeting included the World UN Summit for Social Development held in 
Copenhagen last year, the 1995 World Summit for Women held in Beijing, 
China and the World Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) 
scheduled for Istanbul, Turkey in June 1996.
   The AMCEN meeting also agreed that full support should be given to 
the assessment of environmental impacts of conflict and the resultant 
suffering by refugees and displaced persons as well as host nations.
   The session outlined five main areas of orientation that would form 
the focus of activities in the next two years. These comprise the 
sensitization and organisation of workshops, seminars and conventions 
within the available financial resources; support for the drawing up of 
national environmental plans of action and national Agenda 21 plans; the 
integration of the environmental impact assessment in development 
projects; capacity building, environmental education and public 
awareness; and the strengthening of sub-regional cooperation in 
environmental management.
   As the UN Under-Secretary General and Executive Director of UNEP, 
Miss Elizabeth Dowdeswell said during the opening of the ministerial 
meeting, AMCEN has a major role to play in reversing the continent's 
decline by judiciously using its vast resources, traditional solidarity 
and cooperation and international support.
   "The time has come for African countries to take their future into 
their own hands and not to allow their economies to be micro-managed by 
the international donor community. It is also incumbent on the donor 
community to listen more to Africa and seek partnerships as between 
equals, she said.
   While commending AMCEN for its contribution towards Africa's gradual 
transition to sustainable development in collaboration with the OAU and 
the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and other relevant regional 
and sub-regional institutions, Dowdeswell urged the Environment 
Ministers to press their governments to fulfil their financial 
obligations to the AMCEN Trust Fund to enable the organisation implement 
its laudable programmes.
   In his intervention, Prof. Battily had decried the presentation of 
lengthy speeches and rhetoric which did not address the real issues. 
"Where do African countries expect to get Samaritans to cover the 
financial aspect of the fight against environmental degradation?" he 
asked.
   Among the speakers who came up with some novel ideas was Samuel 
Nyambi, the Director of the New York-based UN office to combat 
desertification. Nyambi, a Cameroonian, suggested that AMCEN be renamed 
the African Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development 
(AMCED) to catch up with the spirit of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de 
Janeiro.
   Others also proposed that the conference be named the African 
Ministerial Conference on Sustainable Development (AMCOSD). Still, 
Nyambi argued that whatever name is finally retained, there was need for 
greater participation in the 1997 evaluation of the implementation of 
the Rio Conference Agenda 21 on sustainable development. "We need to 
prepare adequately for that session as we did before the 1992 Earth 
Summit because the issues are so crucial to Africa," he noted.
   In spite of the last minute shift of venue from Harare, Zimbabwe, to 
the Kenyan capital, the 20-plus Environment Ministers, more than 100 
government representatives and experts from 45 African countries, as 
well as about 25 international organisations who attended the Sixth 
Session of AMCEN, had enough food for thought.
   "We believe there should be greater inter-African consultation to 
ensure that we in Africa understand ourselves better and speak with a 
common voice at global fora on the environment," noted Dr. Farouk 
Brimah, Ghana's Deputy Minister for Environment, Science and Technology.
   Organisations represented included among others, the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), International Labour Organisation (ILO) the World 
Bank, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern 
African Development Corporation (SADC), and the UN Food and Agricultural 
Organisation (FAO).
   The Seventh Session of AMCEN will take place in Senegal in January 
1997.

Black And Beautiful But Skin Bleaching Persists

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Sam Gonza

   Nairobi - From time immemorial the enhancement of beauty has been a 
major preoccupation of the womenfolk. Not surprisingly, the beauty 
industry is among the ten largest industries in the world today. 
Unfortunately many products used in the pursuit of mostly "better" 
physical appearance have serious medical repercussions. This is true of 
skin bleaching creams, lotions, and soaps. In the Gambia, military ruler 
Captain Yahya Jameh has clamped down on skin lightening preparations, 
citing the medical dangers posed to the women in this West African 
country.
   On New Year's Eve, Gambian military ruler Captain Yahya Jameh decreed 
a complete ban on skin bleaching creams, lotions and soaps used as 
cosmetics by women in the Gambia. Captain Jameh said he had instituted 
the measure "for the good of the Gambian woman".
   But observers say the practice of bleaching the skin to obtain a 
lighter complexion is so widespread in Africa, banned items will simply 
be smuggled into the country. This is what has been happening in Nigeria 
for over 10 years now since skin bleaching products were officially 
banned in the mid-eighties.
   In spite of the documentation of the dangers over the last 20 years, 
millions of women continue to bleach their skins to obtain a lighter 
skin. The best approach to the problem would thus include education, an 
option already adopted by the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria 
(Lagos Zone).
   Among the main reasons cited by African women for lightening the 
skin, thus bleaching out the natural dark pigmentation that provides 
protection against the harsh rays of the sun - range from "men like fair 
complexioned women", "it is fashionable" to "purify the skin".
   Over the last ten years, the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria 
has intensified its campaign efforts to make Nigerian women understand 
that the process of lightening the skin is very hazardous indeed. The 
association has produced a pamphlet, Bleaching the Skin - What Every 
Woman Should Know, in which Dr. Osinuppebi-Cole observes that 
paradoxically while black people were bleaching their skin to look more 
beautiful, whites were seeking to acquire a turn by exposing themselves 
foolishly to the sun. "So while the blacks are seeking to become white, 
the whites are seeking to become dark, both exchanging good skin for 
cancerous skins", she says.
   In the 70s, skin bleaching creams containing as much as 7 per cent 
hydroquinone level - one of the main bleaching agents, were freely 
available in Africa. At the same time in America and Europe, creams 
containing one to two per cent level of hydroquinone were banned.
   Dr. Osinupebi-Cole laments that there was keen competition among 
manufacturers of skin bleaching agents and women demanded ever stronger 
chemicals. "The most serious damage to our women was done during this 
period," she argues.
   Today these soaps, creams and lotions originate in Asia, Europe, 
America and within Africa itself. One Irish woman Member of Parliament 
describes the trade in skin bleaching chemicals as "a scandal".
   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the habit of bleaching the skin "started in 
racially morbid countries like the United States and apartheid era South 
Africa.
   Hydroquinone and mercury in soaps are the main bleaching agents. 
Because mercury is absorbed through the skin it eventually leads to the 
development of various complications, notably kidney related.
   Officially, mercury products were banned in Nigeria in the mid- 
eighties but the same continue to flow into the country under such names 
as "Drula bleaching wax", "Skinguard", "Tura", "Concorde", "Roberts", 
"Neko", "Sukkisa", "Bango", "Jeribu" and many more.
   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the hydroquinone compound not only causes 
damage to the superficial skin cells, but has serious effects on the 
underlying connective tissues beneath.
   "Hydroquinone causes an acid called "homogentisic" acid to be 
deposited in skin tissue, eventually damaging the elastic properties of 
the skin as well as the ability of the skin to recover from injuries 
like cuts or surgery.
   Accordingly, long-term bleachers have serious complications when they 
go for surgery or even when they have minor cuts. "Wounds from even 
minor cuts become very difficult to heal. For the surgeon, it is a 
nightmare trying to stitch back the skin of chronic bleachers", says 
Olumide.
   Moreover, by removing the natural pigmentation of the skin through 
bleaching, the African woman is also exposed more intensively to 
dangerous rays of the sun. She becomes more prone to cancer of the skin.
   Dr. Olumide says at present there is no known cure for damage 
inflicted by skin bleaching. Having damaged their skin, some desperate 
women ask for a skin graft and feel terribly dejected when told that 
grafted skin cannot "take" because the entire associated structure had 
been damaged irretrievably.

Clergy Offers Solace To Pregnant Teenagers

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Dingaan Mpondah

   Nairobi - Shunned and blamed by their families for being persons of 
loose morals, pregnant unmarried women in Zimbabwe can now find solace 
in a church-based local centre that nurtures both mother and child and 
offers a stepping stone for a future with a purpose.
   Mwana Anokosha (local Shona language for "precious child") Home is 
the only centre of its kind in Zimbabwe and possibly Southern Africa. It 
offers temporary sanctuary to unmarried women, mostly teenagers with 
unwanted pregnancies who have been rejected by their boyfriends and 
families.
   Situated in Westwood, on the outskirts of the capital, Harare, "Mwana 
Anokosha" was set up in 1988 by the Shelter Trust, which is made up of a 
group of clergymen. It now has a full-time social worker who counsels 
and "rehabilitates" the destitute young women.
   When the women first come to the home, the social worker explained, 
most of them are so lonely, desperate and down-hearted that some have 
suicidal tendencies. A lot of time and effort is put into helping them 
overcome these feelings.
   In response to public criticism, many of the women wrote a joint 
letter to Harare's Herald newspaper last year and spoke frankly about 
their experiences. "We have been kept in an atmosphere of trust and 
confidence where we may await the birth of our children in peaceful 
surroundings. After the delivery of our babies, when we have grown to 
love them, we are able to be reunited with our families.
   "We are very upset to discover that some people feel we are young 
people of loose morals. This is not true, and can be confirmed by the 
people who know us. Most of us really believed in the proposals of love; 
we did not even think of using contraceptives ...," they wrote.
   The number of illegitimate or one-parent children in Zimbabwe is 
high. Despite the difficulty in obtaining official statistics on this 
sensitive issue, it is believed that roughly one in every four teenage 
pregnancies is illegitimate. Several young women have been convicted and 
imprisoned for baby dumping over the years.
   More than 1000 women have been offered temporary shelter at the Mwana 
Anokosha Home until such time that they were reunited with their 
families. However, besides offering refuge to these rejected pregnant 
women, Shelter Trust has now opened up a skills training centre called 
Mufandichimuka Training Centre in Harare, designed to offer a new lease 
of life to these women, most of whom could not support themselves and 
their babies when they left home.
   The co-ordinator of Shelter Trust, Sister Theresa Mangieri, said the 
centre has been named "Mufandichimuka" meaning the home of the 
resurrected.
   "When the girls come to us, they are always so desperate and without 
hope. But the moment they get skills they will then be able to live a 
new life. They are being resurrected hence the name Mufandichimuka," she 
said.
   The majority of the women who end up at Mwana Anokosha Home are those 
who dropped out of school before sitting for a public examination, 
either Grade Seven, Form One or 'O' Level and have no formal skills at 
all.
   Out of the more than 280 who visited Shelter Trust offices in 1995, 
56 per cent dropped out of school before sitting for a public exam while 
eight per cent were illiterate. Those who had work experience had either 
worked as domestics or vendors. Only seven per cent had either done 
dressmaking, knitting, till operating or First Aid. There was one 
university graduate.
   Sister Theresa told APS the number of under-age girls (13 to 17 
years) becoming pregnant was also on the increase. The majority of the 
abandoned women came from intact families, only 4 per cent came from 
single-parent families.
   "In practice, Shelter Trust has been approached by women, some of 
whom might have tried backstreet abortions and failed. With support and 
counsel, these women have developed a strong bonding with their children 
after delivery. Unjust social conditions and priorities of the parents 
and boyfriends encourage them to choose an option they are not 
comfortable with. The psychological damage of abortion for a woman 
cannot be measured. Women who have contemplated abortion, but have not 
acted, have a sense of well-being and joy after delivery," she said.
   The majority of the men inolved with these women were single did not 
want any responsibilities. Casual sex was reported to be on the increase 
as the use of contraceptives, according to the women, was almost non-
existent, despite concerted campaigns by the Zimbabwe National Family 
Planning Council.
   "In line with the needs of the marginalised single mothers we are 
going to start a day skills training. The centre is expected to be 
officially opened in January 1996 but a pilot project involving 100 
former clients was carried out from September 1995. We have sent out 500 
newsletters to former clients telling them about the centre and whether 
they will be interested and the response has been overwhelming. So far 
100 clients have said they would want to enrol.
   "Firstly we are going to offer a course in home economics, 
housekeeping, knitting, sewing and cooking - and later we will introduce 
practical courses. We are starting off with the areas that are necessary 
to them now. We will later introduce such courses as hair braiding so 
that they can earn some income," she explained.
   Apart from offering courses, the centre would, from time to time, 
invite public speakers on various topics including the Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and maintenance to educate the mothers.
   "In general, the women in our residential outreach programmes are in 
need of means of a livelihood after they give birth and are discharged. 
Their common cry is for employment. Our hope is that when the skills are 
acquired, the women will be able to earn a living either on their own or 
through employment," noted Sr. Theresa.
   Researchers indicate that male reluctance to accept responsibility 
for pregnancy, coupled with limited psychological and financial support 
from the family are all seen as the crucial determinants in baby- 
dumping, infanticide and child abandonment. And, according to the World 
Bank, the chances of women dying from pregnancy-related causes are 
highest in Africa among all developing regions of the world.
   This is largely due to the high population growth rate - now the 
world's highest at around 3.2 per cent a year - which is taking a severe 
toll on the health of the mothers.
   As a result, some 150,000 maternal deaths are recorded each year in 
Africa as a whole, a figure representing 30 per cent of all maternal 
deaths world-wide.

Arts and Culture 
Mother Of All Jazz Festivals 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Itumeleng oa Mahabane 
 
   Johanneburg - Not quite Montreux in July or April in Paris, Cape Town 
in February nonetheless promises a feast for lovers of jazz. Next month, 
Cape Town will play host to the largest jazz festival ever held in South 
Africa. 
   The line-up includes some impressive artists: trumpeter Maynard 
Ferguson, Brazilian-born vocalist Tania Maria, guitarist Earl Klugh, and 
Don Grusin. The festival also brings back to South Africa singer Randy 
Crawford, while lovers of the big-band sound will be given the 
opportunity to hear the most famous of the biggies -- the Count Basie 
Orchestra. 
   After last year's debacle, when two Americans promoting a jazz 
festival in the mother city did a duck shortly before it was due to 
open, South Africans might well feel cynical. The prevailing air of 
scepticism has also meant that little has been written about the 
upcoming festival. But organisers Esther Miller and Gerry Spencer (who, 
it should be pointed out, had nothing to do with the earlier ill-fated 
event) have been working towards this for three years and insist that no 
one will be taken for a ride. 
   The two, both local jazz musicians, say intensive planning has gone 
into the festival, and that their approach differs significantly from 
that of last year's organisers. Firstly, Miller and Spencer say, no 
names were announced until artists' attendance had been confirmed. 
Secondly, sponsors were secured well in advance. The financial and 
logistical support of a major airline and financial institution has been 
secured, with American Express in charge of bookings and accommodation, 
and KLM acting as official carrier for the festival. 
   Spencer and Miller hope the festival will bring in hard foreign 
currency in the form of tourism. The sponsors are putting together 
special tour packages, while Captour has promoted the event in overseas 
exhibitions. Apart from a lot of inquiries, there are no firm bookings 
by foreign tourists as yet. 
   Certainly, the festival will give Cape jazz a much-needed shot in the 
arm (a dose is also needed by Johannesburg) The festival will make use 
of a range of large venues, including the Good Hope Centre, the Nico 
complex, and the Waterfront Amphitheatre and Theatre; throughout the 
week, smaller gigs will also take place at various jazz clubs. 
   Jazz students will benefit from workshops and clinics -- two a day, 
throughout the week - -- some of which will be conducted by Klugh, who 
is a musical educator. The creation of a scholarship for young South 
African musicians to study overseas is also in the offing. There will be 
collaborations between local artists and visitors, and Miller herself 
will perform with the Jack Van Poll Trio. 
   Miller and Spencer say they tried to cater for classical as well as 
mainstream jazz-lovers by inviting Wynton Marsalis to play with the Cape 
Town Symphony Orchestra (CTSO). Unsuccessful negotiations over a fee and 
bad timing for the CTSO put paid to that. But South Africans may yet 
hear the flawless if sometimes passionless trumpet of Marsalis -- the 
organisers say they will try to bring him out either next year or the 
year after. 
   Hopefully the festival will be a success, because Capetonians can 
look forward to this becoming an annual event. Miller and Spencer have 
secured the sponsors' support for the next five years, and are 
negotiating to have the festival concerts televised. 
   The Cape Town jazz festival runs from February 26 to March 3.

Arts and Culture 
Of Patrons And Peers 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Carol Brown 
 
   Johannesburg - Gerard Bhengu, forgotten KwaZulu-Natal artist, is now 
the subject of a retrospective. 
   One of my childhood memories is of attending an art exhibition at the 
Payne Bros store in Durban. The exhibitor was Tretchikoff -- the 
controversial, popular and very rich artist who held his road shows at 
the elegant art- deco store which housed a gallery. It was interesting, 
therefore, to learn that Gerard Bhengu was also one of the store's 
proteges. When one of Bhengu's other patrons, Phyllis Savory, considered 
producing a book on the artist's work, she stated that she wished it to 
be "on the same lines as the Tretchikoff book that Mr Timmins produced a 
few years earlier". The book on Bhengu did appear, but, unlike his 
contemporary, Bhengu became neither a household name nor a millionaire. 
   While comparisons between the two artists are spurious, it is worth 
noting that both were popular and promoted by the same gallery, which 
operated with a commercial bias. However, the art market during the 
Fifties and Sixties was not geared towards the payment of high prices 
for works by black artists. Bhengu's first patron, Dr Max Kohler, 
encouraged him to sign his name as "Bhenger" in the hope that its 
Germanic sound would be more acceptable to a white art-buying public. 
   The retrospective exhibition at the Tatham Gallery has been curated 
to bring these facts to the fore. Works are classified in sections to 
highlight patronage rather than style or subject matter -- an approach 
raising questions of influence, personal agendas and economic pressures. 
This curatorial method, while relatively unusual in a South African 
context, demonstrates a serious art-historical approach to the subject. 
   Bhengu was born in 1910 in the mission settlement of Centecow, 
attached to the Marianhill mission, in southern Natal. It was here that 
he encountered Kohler, who was an amateur ethnologist and commissioned 
Bhengu to produce illustrations for his ethnological texts. The 
discipline and accuracy necessary for this type of illustration suited 
Bhengu's talents and he produced detailed and meticulous images. These 
were contentious among his peers: attitudes towards ethnicity, 
nationhood and tribal identity were highly controversial, particularly 
following the Native Administration Bill of 1927, which made tribal 
chiefs the leaders of all black South Africans, and exerted control 
leading to the bantustans and apartheid. 
   But it was through his portrayal of ethnic types that Bhengu's art 
achieved its popularity, especially among the tourists who frequented 
the Payne Bros gallery. Seeing a number of his sepia portraits together 
makes it obvious that he perfected a slick technique which allowed mass 
production, although this doesn't detract from his ability as a 
draughtsman. 
   As well as portraiture he depicted the rural countryside of his 
youth, but his view differed from the early white artists such as Thomas 
Baines, Jacob Hendrik Pierneef and Clement Senque, who showed the land 
as majestically devoid of humanity and waiting for the white settler. 
Bhengu's landscapes were peopled, showing the black person inhabiting 
and working the land. As discussed in the catalogue by Leeb du Toit and 
Zaver Dinos, these images could be seen to express ideas of rightful 
ownership and perpetuation. 
   According to contemporary accounts, his freest and most creative work 
was that which no longer exists except through photographs, sketches and 
verbal descriptions. These were murals commissioned by the herbalist EG 
Tembe in 1959, and a mural for the Wesleyan Methodist Institute in 
Durban in 1942. They were both created for black audiences and the 
latter was said to be the earliest example of black protest art in South 
Africa. Both these murals have been destroyed, but written accounts seem 
to confirm that the fact of a different audience affected his work 
strongly. 
   Bhengu died, poverty stricken and unheralded, at the age of 80. This 
exhibition highlights his talent and the manner in which economic and 
educational pressures of his time influenced his art. It forms an 
important addition to South African art history, but unfortunately will 
only be viewed in KwaZulu- Natal. It deserves a wider audience. 
   The retrospective runs at the Tatham Gallery in Pietermaritzburg 
until January 7, and at Durban Art Gallery from January 28 to February 
26.

Business and Finance
Not Nailed By Success 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Vuyo Mvoko  
 
   Johannesburg - A levelling of the playing fields is necessary for 
black businesses to succeed, argues Dr Nthato Motlana.
   Chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), Dr Nthato Motlana 
is not out of the running for industrial finance company Johnnic. He 
told the Mail & Guardian recently that he is planning to raise R6-
billion for a stake in Johnnic, one of the three companies into which 
mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) has been 
unbundled. 
   Johnnic controls Times Media Limited and the South African Breweries 
among others. Motlana says R3-billion of the capital will come from Nail 
and its subsidiaries, one of which, Metropolitan -- which controls 
Methold -- has over R8-billion in net assets. 
   Motlana does not hide his political leanings which, over the past 
couple of weeks, saw him being accused of meddling with the editorial 
freedom of The Sowetan newspaper. 
   It was alleged that Motlana had been under pressure from the African 
National Congress to force Sowetan staff to "toe the ANC line". 
   While he admits to having been approached by President Nelson Mandela 
who raised problems with some of the Sowetan's articles, the man who 
says he was once seen as "the Trojan horse who acquired the paper on 
behalf of the ANC", denies any interference. 
   How do his ventures benefit the black community? Irate, he replies: 
"Whenever anybody goes into business, he goes for himself. Anyone who 
pretends to the contrary is a liar or a fool. Write that down, and go 
and tell them!" 
   He pauses, then bursts into laughter, apparently regretful at his 
cantankerous outburst. Then slowly, he continues: "Anyone who does not 
sleep, preparing and going from meeting to meeting, is doing it for 
himself. What happens to other people is as a result of your own 
personal empowerment." 
   Indeed, Motlana opposed a move by Anglo American to transfer 20 
percent of The Sowetan shares to a black community trust with 
beneficiaries such as the Educational Opportunities Council, the Get 
Ahead Foundation and a host of homes for the mentally handicapped, 
arguing that black "entrepreneurs", like their white counterparts, 
should have the opportunity of real ownership. 
   Motlana denies purchasing the impoverished weekly New Nation, now a 
sister publication of the Sowetan, because of ANC pressure. 
   The losing gamble was owing to the role the paper played in the 
transformation of the country, he says, but if it does not recover in 
the next six months, "we'll forget it". 
   'You know," he says with a smile, "I've paid my dues to my community 
and my country. I cannot understand why they don't pick on (Real Africa 
Group chairman) Don Ncube, Thebe Investments, or the Kunene Brothers. Is 
it obscene to make money? 
   "There are others who make money but they don't go ask them what they 
do for the community, they do that only to Motlana. They must go to 
hell, man! 
   "I'm sick and tired of Sam Shilowa and Zwelinzima Vavi. Sick! Sick! 
Sick! When they get stuck in the middle of a speech they insert Motlana, 
whoaaa! Whether they do not have the intelligence to think further than 
Motlana, I can't understand." 
   Motlana had been foretold, he claims, by people like international 
businessman Tony O'Reilly, that he would be hated for his business 
acumen. 
   "Sometimes I get mad when people think I started being involved in 
business because the ANC was unbanned and Nelson Mandela got out of 
prison." 
   "My first company was called Phaphama Afrika Commercial Enterprises, 
formed in the 60s, when it was almost impossible to do so. You had to 
kick shins and push hard, there were no loans for black people and no 
premises in town. 
   "I'm chairman of Lesedi Clinic, the first black-owned private clinic 
in this country. I'm the founder chairman of the 80 000-member Sizwe 
Medical Aid Fund. We built the Takalani home for the mentally 
handicapped in Soweto. 
   "When people ask me, how do you benefit your community? I say look 
back at my record: I've been involved in politics since age 18; detained 
as secretary of the ANC Youth League; on the dock with Mandela in the 
'Sisulu and 19 others' trial of 1952; once was chairman of 18 community 
organisations; formed the Get Ahead Foundation; went around the world 
and collected money to create a fund that helped people like Sakkie 
Macozoma get a Masters degree in Communication." 
   "Even before Black Like Me, we started Africare, the first black hair 
products manufacturing company. We did not succeed because banks would 
not give us money, our guys did not have MBAs, and we had no marketing." 
   Nail's hopes to raise the capital needed to purchase a stake at 
Johnnic were once dashed by capital constraints, he says. "I hope people 
will not say the Motlana group is being favoured. We have that critical 
mass. 
   If we don't do it, somebody else will". 
   Motlana says Nail was interested in buying a portion of Telkom, but 
was barred by Telkom's insistence that foreign companies must come, not 
in partnerships with local black companies in the name of black economic 
empowerment, but on their own. 
   He laments this, arguing no black company can provide "international 
connectivity, foreign capital, better management and new technology." 
   With regard to the pyramid control of businesses in the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange, he says it "has been the standard structure in South 
Africa. Look at Murray and Roberts, Sancorp, Sanlam, Anglo American. 
Then when a young black company like Nail goes to the stock exchange, 
they say No." 
   Talk of flattening the pyramids, he says, is not fair to the emerging 
black business, "there should first be a levelling of playing fields." 
   On Nail's plans for 1996: "We want to consolidate. We'd like to focus 
on telecommunications, obtain a TV licence, increase our stake in 
newspapers, and I won't tell you the rest." 
   "What people should be asking is, how did you get where you are. We 
can share ideas, form groups together and move forward."

South Africa 
Cricket: Breathing New Life Into An Old Game 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Jon Swift  
 
   Johannesburg - Paul Adams has brought unbridled enthusiasm and joy to 
a team which already has grit and courage 
   It is well as we move into a new year to savour some of the tragedies 
and failures of the 12 months just past. For the cricketers contesting 
the current series, the breaking of a savage countrywide drought has 
been an unwanted hindrance. For the squatters of Maritzburg it has meant 
total devastation and, in well over 100 cases, loss of life. 
   But on both admittedly widely different counts, one cannot but 
rejoice in the resilience of the human condition. The surviving 
squatters are hastily rebuilding their shattered lives and a nation 
mourns for them as they fight their way out of the morass of a 
catastrophic natural disaster. 
   And surely, no South African -- no matter how insensitive -- can see 
the lack of playing days the heavens have allowed against the touring 
English under Mike Atherton against any other backdrop. 
   Yes, the cricket is important and as lifegiving in its own way as the 
waters which have, in their overabundance after almost a decade of arid 
refusal, abruptly taken the lives of so many. 
   And yes, it is important to all of us in this emergent admix of 
peoples and tongues, cultures and conditioning, that the nation have 
success to show in the face of such adversities. 
   For as the flood-ravaged communities on the banks of the Umsunduzi 
tackle their devastated lives anew, cricket has been given a like chance 
to present a renewal of spirit to graft onto the courage and fortitude 
which has marked the ethos of this country's teams since our 
readmittance in 1992. 
   It has not been an easy series to quantify and certainly not an easy 
one for the players of both sides to contest. The disappointment of the 
rained-out first and third tests at Centurion Park and Kingsmead have 
been one factor. 
   The refusal of Atherton and his English batesman to bow to the raw 
pace of the South Africans has been another. Certainly, Atherton's 
unbeaten 185-run, 10-hour 44-minute stay at the crease to deny a result 
at the Wanderers in an innings of true cricketing integrity is not an 
individual effort which will be lightly discounted. 
   Neither can you lightly dismiss the maiden century by the gritty Gary 
Kirsten at the Wanderers or his two half-centuries which earned him the 
Man of the Match award in the drawn fourth Test at St George's Park last 
week. 
   But it was in the disappointment of Port Elizabeth with yet another 
Test without a result in a series which had rapidly been running out of 
steam that the essence of rebirth came to light. And fitting that St 
George's Park, the venue for the first international this country ever 
played when they took the field against CA Smith's English invaders back 
in 1889, should have provided it. 
   For two things made this meeting between South Africa and England 
different from any international played before. The first was a chubby-
faced youngster from the humble environs of Grassy Park on the Cape 
Flats with the strangled action of a capsized terrapin. 
   The second was a muscular politician with thick spectacles, a voice 
like broken glass and a former postal address on an isolated island not 
far off the coast from the mountain which looms large over Newlands 
where the two teams are currently engaged in the series decider. 
   Paul Adams became the youngest player to wear cricket's green and 
gold at 18 years and 340 days. It was only his sixth first-class match, 
an honour he rightly earned and, many would argue, two tests overdue. 
   Coach Bob Woolmer summed it up in one succinct phrase: "He looked 
like he's played Test cricket for 15 years," he said. Indeed. 
   Adams took a modest four wickets on a flat and unresponsive pitch in 
his debut, but in this performance, there was the roots of a renaissance 
in the game. Adams plays the game with the unbridled enthusiasm and 
inner joy which its originators in the Vale of Hambledon surely intended 
for the world's most glorious game. 
   In this alone, Adams has something to give back to the team which the 
exposure to the professional pragmatism of the English and the cynical 
sledging of the Aussies have taken from it. 
   It would be both premature and unpardonable to heap all the 
responsibility for ensuring this new spirit follows through on his young 
shoulders, but the sight of captain Hansie Cronje's smile when Adams 
dismissed Graham Thorpe to register what we must believe will be the 
first of many Test victims was evidence enough that the young man has a 
special magic about him. 
   And, just for a moment review the new life Adams injected into the St 
George's Park brass ensemble. The music even had Jonty Rhodes turning 
Mapantsula in the field. If this is the new voice of South African 
cricket, long may that voice roar. 
   Which brings us to the second man in the equation, Minister of Sport 
Steve Tshwete. Tshwete has never been shy of tacking his flag to the 
mast. He cried openly at South Africa's early cricketing successes and, 
though an avowed rugby man, has been one of the great advocates of the 
game under the new dispensation. 
   Tshwete forsook the padded seats of the official enclave, shed his 
jacket and took to the stands to join the extended membership band, wave 
the flag and add his voice to the on-going celebration that was the very 
heart of this dull draw. 
   One shudders to think of the discord Tshwete's vocal cords engendered 
in his immediate surroundings. But in Tshwete doing what he did, there 
was the very embodiment of what Krish Mackerdhuj and Ali Bacher had 
claimed as administrators and Kepler Wessels, Cronje and the teams they 
have led have attempted so ardently and so well to put into practice as 
players. 
   It is well that Newlands -- incidentally the venue of this country's 
second Test against Smith's tourists before the turn of the century -- 
has become so vital in the equation of the current England tour. 
   No cricket lover would begrudge the fact that a ground which retains 
its beauty and majesty despite the ravages development has wrought, 
should be the place to settle matters once and for all. 
   It is home to Adams, Kirsten and Brian McMillan -- perhaps the only 
player alongside Donald who can claim true world class among the South 
Africans during this series -- although the young spin bowler can only 
claim a fleeting relationship. 
   The crux of the issue though is not that Kirsten and McMillan have 
got centuries. Or that Atherton and Graeme Hick -- a superb 141 at 
Centurion Park -- have managed their top scores in Test cricket. 
   Neither does it hinge on wicketkeeper Jack Russell's world record 11 
dismissals behind the stumps to some wayward South African batting and 
his stubborn refusal to leave the crease after Meyrick Pringle had given 
him an early life in the same match. Or even that Shaun Pollock is 
developing into both a frighteningly dangerous new ball exponent and a 
polished lower middle order bat. 
   It all really hangs on a contrast of attitude. 
   England have always seemed to be playing not to lose. 
   The naggingly negative line adopted by Dominic Cork -- far and away 
the best of the England bowlers on tour -- and Richard Illingworth in 
the second innings at St George's is as much evidence of this as the way 
the tourists have packed their batting line-up and consistently refused 
to employ the erratic power and pace of Devon Malcolm. 
   Cronje and his side have played to win. That they have not yet 
managed this is proof of Woolmer's contention that they are not a 
collection of individual stars, but rather a cohesive, tough and 
sometimes uncompromising collective. 
   In this, perhaps Cronje and his men embody on the sportsfield, the 
refusal to lie down in adversity which has been shown by the sad spectre 
of the squatters on the banks of the Duzi. 
   For these are as much the people our current crop -- Hansie Cronje, 
Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullian, Jonty Rhodes, Brian 
McMillan, Dave Richardson, Shaun Pollock, Craig Matthews, Allan Donald, 
Jacques Kallis, Nicky Boje and Paul Adams -- are playing for as the 100 
000-plus who bought tickets for Newlands before a ball was bowled. 
   And who all the future wearers of the national flag -- above whatever 
emblem the officials come up with next -- must strive to represent. 
   The advent of Adams has shown what is attainable. And that cricket in 
this country can truly be for all, politician or pleb. There is new life 
in the old game yet.

Africa-at-Large
Soccer: All The Nations For The Cup 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Lungile Madywabe  
 
   Johannesburg - A host of Africa's top stars will converge on South 
Africa next week for the African Nations Cup finals 
   When Kenya's sports minister Hussein Maalinm Mohamed said that his 
country was withdrawing from hosting the African Nations Cup, because of 
a lack of funds, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not 
hesitate to appoint South Africa in their place. 
   If South Africa succeeds in its handling of the tournament, it may 
well be the recipe for hosting the 2006 World Cup. Caf president Issa 
Hayatou has already given his full backing to South Africa's bid to host 
the world's biggest soccer bonanza. 
   But for now the 20th African Nations Cup showdown starts next 
Saturday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg, with South Africa against 
Cameroon, the two-time winners of this tournament and 1990 World Cup 
quarter- finalists against England. Cameroon won the tournament in 1984 
and 1988. 
   South Africa will be hoping to increase to seven the number of 
countries to have won the tournament as hosts. 
   The Black Stars of Ghana, four-time winners, first won the 
championship in 1963 when it was held in Accra. They also hosted and won 
it in 1978. Together with Egypt they share the privilege of being the 
only countries that have defended the title. 
   The Black Stars will be looking to Leeds striker Tony Yeboah and 
captain Abedi Pele Ayew. They come to the tournament having last claimed 
it in 1982 when it was hosted by Libya. 
   Hoping to equal the winning ways of Ghana are the three-time winners 
the Pharoahs of Egypt who hosted the cup in 1959 and 1986, and made sure 
on both occasions that it stayed there. Egypt also won it on its 
inception in 1957 in Sudan. 
   Algeria won the cup in 1990, failed in Senegal in 1992, before a 
total nightmare in Tunisia 94 when they were banned for using an 
ineligible player. 
   Two other teams from Southern Africa have made it to the finals 
despite the politcal upheavals that have been taking place in their 
countries. Angola deserve all the support they can get from their fans. 
In the words of South African coach Clive Barker they "must surely be 
ranked the darkest horses of the tournament". 
   Mozambique will give a few of their opponents a run for their money, 
taking into account their recent performance against South Africa who 
beat them 3-2 after the visitors had taken the lead twice. 
   South Africa is once again surrounded by controversy with the 
chairman of the technical committee of the South African Football 
Association, Jomo Sono, who also serves as an adviser to Barker, not 
being informed of the final selection of the squad. The surprise 
exclusion of Brendon Augustine of Umtata Bucks was also a surprise to 
many. The insistence on including Lucas Radebe of Leeds United despite 
doubts about his fitness has also raised eyebrows. The Leeds coach has 
reservations about Radebe's ability to keep pace with the demands of the 
tournament. 
   Tunisia, who have been hosts twice and have never won the cup, will 
be hoping to put all the traumas of 1994 behind them. They are in the 
same group as Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, both of whom are favourites to 
finish first and second in the group forcing Tunisia to pack their bags 
early. 
   Gabon was the first team to pack their bags in Tunisia and the gods 
must surely have turned their backs on them. They are in the same group 
as the reigning champions Nigeria.. 
   Protests over the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists in 
Nigeria have made their team's participation in the tournament doubtful. 
Nigeria is to make a decision on Friday whether they are coming or not 
and, if they decline, then Guinea will be the replacements 
   Most of the Ivory Coast players come from the Asec Mimosa club and 
one wonders how their coach Pierre Pleimelding will be able to mentally 
refocus some of the players whose guts and determination were tested to 
the full when they recently lost to Orlando Pirates in the Champions 
Cup. 
   The stars of the tournament may well be Liberia, inspired by the 
European and African footballer of the year George Weah. They nearly 
withdrew from the tournament because of finance, and Weah had to dig dip 
into his pocket to make sure that Liberia make the best of their first 
appearance at the finals. 
   After many of the team members had been killed in a plane crash in 
Gabon in 1993, Zambia nearly won the cup in Tunisia when they were 
beaten 2-1 by Nigeria in the finals. Having come so close to winning the 
cup in 1994, this may well be their chance to lift it. 
   Burkina Faso come to the finals as the only team with an unbeaten 
record in the qualifying matches and are the first team from Africa to 
have qualified for the World Cup in 1974 in Germany. They have eight 
foreign-based players in their team. They will be counting on Seydou 
Traore who plays for FC Bressuirein in France and Abdoulaye Kassoum 
Ouerdraogo who is based in Germany with FSV Franfurt.   
   Zaire has won the cup twice, in 1968 and 1974. They were booted out 
in the quarter- final stage by eventual winners Nigeria in 1994. In the 
qualifying stages they beat Morocco at home, before going on to draw 
with Ivory Coast. Among some of their foreign-based players are Ngole 
Kona of Genderbirligi in Turkey and Mbote Ndinga of Vitoria Guimaraes.  
   Sierra Leone will be coming to the finals for the second time. They 
also nearly withdrew from the tournament for financial reasons. Kewullay 
Conteh of Atalanta in Italy and Lamine Conteh of SV Meppen in Germany 
will lead their team.

Africa-at-Large
Boxing: Take Me To Atlanta 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Julian Drew  
 
   Johannesburg - From humble beginnings in Venda, Ntsudzuluseni Ndou is 
heading for the Olympics in Atlanta. 
   In Venda Ntsudzuluseni means "take me to another place", and for 
Ntsudzuluseni Ndou boxing has done just that. The 18-year-old from 
Thoyandou is Atlanta-bound in July as a member of South Africa's Olympic 
team after winning the silver medal in the featherweight division at the 
All Africa Games in Harare last September. 
   Ndou is better known by his English name of Philip, which is easier 
on the tongue for most people. The tall matriculant is lean and mean and 
uses his long reach to stay out of trouble. He is confident about his 
prospects in Atlanta. "I think I will do well at the Olympics because I 
know there is nobody in Africa who is better than me," says Ndou. 
   A strange statement you might think for someone who was beaten to the 
gold medal at the All Africa Games, but for anyone who saw his final 
against Egypt's Saleh Abdelbary it is not surprising at all. To say he 
was cheated of victory is something of an understatement. "It was the 
worst decision I've seen in 45 years of amateur boxing," says national 
team manager Dan Bushney. 
   Ndou completely dominated the fight but when it came to adding the 
points from the scoring machines of the five judges it was clear that 
some of the North African judges were less than impartial in their 
observations. "It wasn't a hard fight for me. My hardest fight came in 
the semi-final against the Mauritian who was a very tough opponent. I 
found the final very easy in comparison but the judges robbed me. They 
said I was the loser but everyone else who saw the fight said I was the 
winner. The guys from Egypt and Tunisia just didn't want South Africa to 
win," says Ndou. 
   Such controversial decisions have long been part and parcel of 
amateur boxing. But internationally the situation has improved now with 
a wider spread of judges and fewer ideological divisions around the 
globe. 
   The new scoring system introduced at the Barcelona Olympics has also 
made it difficult to rig results. Now, for a scoring blow to count, 
three out of the five judges must hit the button on their scoring 
machines within one second. In Africa though there is a dominance of 
officials from North African countries and they are accused of helping 
each others' boxers at the expense of other countries. 
   According to Bushney, the only way to change this is to get more 
judges from the rest of Africa onto the African Boxing Confederation's 
panel which is an issue that South Africa intends addressing in the near 
future. 
   It was Ndou's victory over Josian Lebon of Mauritius in the semi-
final which impressed observers though. The short, stocky Mauritian was 
a strong and experienced fighter but Ndou fought intelligently to turn 
the tables on him. Ndou used body blows and moved quickly to tire him 
and kept him at arm's length so he couldn't land too many telling blows. 
"It was a difficult fight because we both knew each other's styles after 
sparring together at our training camp in Kroonstad before the All 
Africa Games. But Bodo (national team coach Bodo Andreass) had watched 
him closely in Kroonstad and he altered my style a little to confuse him 
and I just fought to my strengths," says Ndou. 
   Ndou only got into the national team last year after winning the 
South African title as a 16- year-old in 1993 and retaining it in 1994. 
He puts much of his recent improvement down to the arrival of Andreass 
at the end of 1994. Andreass is a former East German amateur boxer who 
spent four years coaching the Nigerian national team which won two 
silver medals at the Barcelona Olympics. 
   He came to South Africa at the request of the National Olympic 
Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) which seconded him to the South 
African National Amateur Boxing Organisation (Sanabo) under its 
Operation Excellence programme. "He is a very experienced coach and he 
knows a lot about boxing. He has really taught me a lot and that is why 
I did well in Harare. I think Nocsa should keep him on after Atlanta 
because our results have really started to improve under him," says 
Ndou. 
   The lessons he has learnt from Andreass are also starting to pay off 
at the Makwarela Boxing Club in Thoyandou where he coaches the other 
boxers in a makeshift club house in one of the classrooms at his school. 
"I have improved so much with Bodo and everything he has taught me I 
also teach my boxers here in Venda. I show them how to train properly 
and now we have two juniors and six seniors who are the best in Venda. 
This year they will go to the South African championships and I know 
they are going to do well," says Ndou. 
   For now though Ndou's eyes are focused far beyond the national 
championships and on the Olympic Games which are now just over six 
months away. "It is a great honour to fight for your country at the 
Olympics and it is important not to let your country down. I must go to 
Atlanta and work hard to show people what it means to be a South African 
champion and make people respect this country," says Ndou. 
   If Ntsudzuluseni Ndou can do anything like as well as he did in 
Harare in the much more demanding Olympic arena he won't have to worry 
about being taken to another place. He will be made for life and have 
his name etched indelibly in the annals of local sporting legend.

Africa-at-Large
[DOCUMENT] Luba Art Exhibit Opens

Museum for African Art (New York)
January 05, 1996 (19960105)

   New York - MEMORY: Luba Art and the Making of History is the first 
American exhibition to present the art and culture
of the Luba of Zaire and the first ever to explore how Luba works of art 
function in the reconstruction of memory and history.
   While Luba Sculpture is among the most beautiful of African arts, it 
also reveals astounding philosophical complexity.  The Luba, one of the 
most important kingdoms of central Africa (southeastern Zaire) from the 
17th through 19th centuries, highly value the recounting of royal 
history, and encode its complexity on an array of stunning art objects 
created precisely to stimulate and guide memory.
   MEMORY presents over 100 of these unique objects which enable the 
Luba to remember and re-interpret their collective past. Memory boards, 
beaded emblems, ornamented royal scepters and axes, thrones, divination 
instruments' wooden figures and body arts each have a particular visual, 
tactile and spatial vocabulary. It is this incised, symbolic coding 
system that helps the Luba remember the esoteric information, pivotal 
events, royal personages and political relationships that make up their 
collective history and individual identity.
   The Museum for African art is located at 593 Broadway (between 
Houston and Prince). General Admission is $4; $2 for children, students 
and senior citizens. Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday 10:30-5:30 
pm, Saturday and Sunday, 12-6 pm. For information call(212)966-1313

Sudan
Khartoum Attempts To Strengthen Its Defences At The War Front

Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)

   London - Reeling from the the speed of the recent Sudan People's 
Liberation Army (SPLA) offensive in the civil war, the National Islamic 
Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum has alternated between crying out for 
help from a limited number of friendly states and accusing all and 
sundry of aiding and abetting the SPLA in what the regime has described 
as a foreign invasion of Southern Sudan.
   The United States of America is at the top of the list of Sudan's 
enemies, closely followed by Israel, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and 
Egypt. Claiming that the SPLA had neither the means nor the technical 
know-how to carry out such an offensive, Khartoum has constructed an 
incredible conspiracy theory involving all of the above named states.
   According to Khartoum, Eritrea supplied the SPLA with tanks and 
weapons which were transported from Massawa on the coast through 
Ethiopia and Uganda and into Southern Sudan. Egyptian Military transport 
planes were also used to carry weapons and equipment via Uganda. So far 
the regime's propaganda ministry has failed to produce any evidence to 
back up its bizarre theory. The regime claims to have captured tanks and 
other weapons with Eritrean and Ugandan markings on them, and also 
claims to have claims to have killed or captured Eritrean  and Ugandan 
officers and troops.  However, Khartooum refuses to produce this 
evidence for independent verification. This is not surprising because it 
is not beyond the regime's capacity to forge such evidence.  At some 
point the regime claimed that it had killed 263 Ugandan soldiers at Kit. 
The claim was easily ridiculed because a British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC) news team was at Kit with the (SPLA) forces and could 
testify to Khartoum's lies in a "Focus on Africa" programme the 
following day,
   In Khartoum itself, the regime has tried to whip up a hate campaign 
against the few US nationals still resident there. The US embassy has 
countered this by issuing its own mimeographed statements and widely 
distributing them across the Three Towns capital. The US has denied 
providing any support for the SPLA or having any involvement with the 
opponents of the regime. The US regards Khartoum's allegations as being 
counter-productive to the ongoing dialogue designed to improve US-regime 
relations
  The US has taken Khartoum's threats seriously enough to recall its 
ambassador from Sudan for consultation. It is believed that while the 
ambassador was in Washington, D.C., he suggested that a forthcoming 
visit to the US by SPLA leader Colonel John Garang be canceled. The 
ambassador argued that to receive Colonel Garang at a senior level would 
give credence to reports of clandestine US support for the SPLA and as 
such could enflame the problems in Khartoum. In the event, the SPLA 
leader arrived on schedule and was received at the same official level 
he is usually accorded. In spite of the ambassador's concerns, it would 
appear that the Clinton administration finally took the view that to 
cancel the visit would be tantamount to giving in to the regime's 
blackmail. That would be an inappropriate way to conduct UA foreign 
policy, considering the number of rogue regimes it has to deal with 
world-wide. Khartoum protested about the visit, but Washington ignored 
them.
   The government of Uganda responded quite sharply to Khartoum's 
allegations and threats. In November, it had merely mentioned that it 
took Khartoum's threats to invade Uganda seriously and was on the alert 
to repel any such invasion. Last month, however, the Ugandans took a 
much stronger line and on 6 December a presidential statement demanded 
that Khartoum cease its support and assistance for the Lords Resistance 
Army (LRA) or Ugandan commandos would be dispatched into Southern Sudan 
to deal with the Ugandan rebel group.
  "If Khartoum continues to send in these armed bandits to kill our 
farmers, women and children in Northern Uganda, and to plant anti-
personnel mines in the countryside, we will have no choice but to send 
in our commandos to pursue, search and destroy the LRA bandits inside 
Sudan.
   Unable to motivate or properly supply its ground forces in the South 
and the Nuba Mountains, the regime has begun to depend more heavily on 
aerial bombardment of civilian targets. The regime has increased the 
number of raids it makes each day. In late November and early December, 
reports claimed that the regime had begun to use chemical warfare in the 
Nuba Mountains. The chemicals are believed to have been supplied by the 
Iraqis who have used such weapons against their own internal opponents. 
The Iraqis have also provided planes and troops
   The former Soviet republic of Belarus has sold ten planes to 
Khartoum. They are long range bombers and cost $150,000,000. The deal 
was a purely economic one rather than an ideological marriage between 
the two countries. As the regime is known to be strapped for cash, this 
deal begs the question of where the money to buy the planes actually 
came from. It is believed that Iran and the oil rich state of Qatar 
split the bill between them. The planes have already been delivered and 
have begun bombing raids over the South.  Belarus also supplied 
technicians and pilots.
  Iran has recently supplied the regime with other military equipment 
and weapons. It is also the regime's main supplier of fuel for its 
military operations in the South.
   The Islamic states of Indonesia and Malaysia have also supplied 
military equipment to the regime, having been swayed by the NIF's pleas 
that its Islamic system is under threat from the infidels and is 
therefore worthy of support
   The injection of equipment and weapons has yet to have impact on the 
fortunes of the regime in the war. It is doubtful whether they will have 
any real impact because in order to utilize the regime needs to have 
trained personnel at the battlefront. The regimes forces are demoralized 
at present and those in outlying posts are suffering from a shortage of 
provisions. The regime's troops are ill fed, ill supplied, ill equipped 
and ill motivated whilst operating in the hostile environment of the 
South. The recent SPLA victories have only added to their problems and 
reduced the morale even further.
   In Juba two battalions of troops have disobeyed orders to move out 
into the countryside by spinning out their requisition of necessary 
supplies for future operations. These troops were visited in December by 
a succession of the regime's leaders in a bid to build up their morale. 
Dr. Hussan Abdulla El Turabi and Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the foreign 
minister, both visited Juba. In addition, first vice president General 
Zubeir Mohammed Salih led a number of senior military figures on a visit 
to the troops,
   The regime's leaders are having to face up to the fact that troops on 
active duty in the South are less convinced by propaganda than the 
civilians in the North may be. These troops have experienced the reality 
of battle at first hand and know that the SPLA is a committed enemy 
fighting for a cause it believes in. They feel less enamored by their 
own cause and the brainwashing about angels and infidels they received 
before coming south.
   Khartoum's forces have very good reasons for feeling demoralized. A 
conventional army used to regular supplies and meals is now having to 
make do on subsistence rations. Whereas their enemy, the SPLA is used to 
such hard conditions, Khartoum's forces are not.  In many outlying 
military posts, the regimes troops are surviving on bread and hot onion 
sauce served once a day.
   The troops have also been immobilized by a fuel shortage and most of 
the transport vehicles are inactive. The troops have to carry out all 
their operations on foot. Ammunition is in short supply, replacement 
uniforms are non-existent and the conventional army now looks more like 
a poorly supplied guerrilla army than the SPLA does.
   Reports last month have spoken of large scale desertion by the 
regime's forces around Juba and they are trying to make their way back 
to Northern Sudan by whatever means available. In November, seventy 
soldiers returning to Juba from a defeat at Pageri boarded a steamer 
bound for the North rather than report to the Army HQ. The steamer was 
halted down river at Bor, eighty miles north of Juga, where the soldiers 
were arrested and detained. The regime fears that is demoralized troops 
return to the North and publicize the true situation in the war, then 
the public will clamor for peace and recruits for the army will be even 
harder to find that they are already.
   The regime has uncharacteristically issued a statement about the 
situation in both Kapoeta and Torit denying that there is any military 
confrontation with the SPLA around the two towns. The statement 
denounced the people who have been undermining the regime's war efforts. 
The denial was unsolicited and might shed further light on the situation 
if it is looked at in a more critical majjer. Why bother to deny 
something that has not been publicized by the enemy unless there is some 
truth in it? The SPLA has only reported on actual battle successes and 
has seen no need to make sweeping statements about the overall situation 
in the war. It is the regime which feels the need to do this and it is 
surely a sign of its own concern. 
   The battle fronts around Kaya, Kajokeji and Morobo have been quiet. 
Independent reports have revealed that the SPLA has put all three towns 
under siege together with the strategic town of Yei. Any SPLA victories 
in this sector would have positive repercussions on the situation in 
Western Equatoria and Bahr El Ghazal, as far as the guerrilla army is 
concerned.
   Attempts by the regime to distract attention away from Eastern 
Equatoria by launching offensives in Bahr El Ghazal and against Western 
Equatoria have so far failed. The attempts to arrange, through bribery, 
bases in the Central African Republic and Zaire, in order to launch 
attacks on Western Equatoria, have so far proved fruitless. The local 
officials have noted Khartoum's generosity and have made higher demands 
for payment. Khartoum's financial resources are limited and each time 
its representatives return to Sudan for more money, they get back to the 
CAR and Zaire to be faced by new officials, all expecting some kind of 
payment. Bribery is proving to be an expensive and inefficient way of 
conducting the war.
   The SPLA is still in control of Western Equatoria and its forces are 
ready for the regime's offensives from whatever direction. The most 
likely routes are from Wau across the Bo River, or from Rumbek, although 
the direct route from Juba via Rokon, Mundri and Maridi might also be 
targeted. There is an old hilly route from Yei to Maridi which the SPLA 
is also monitoring.
   The schism in the SPLA in 1991 handed much of Upper Nile to the 
regime because the SPLA-United forces, later to be renamed the Southern 
Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM), chose to work with the regime 
against the mainstream SPLA. Commander Nyuon's forces have since April 
1995 been controlling the overland route from Malakal to Bor and on to 
Kapoeta and Torit, by being in control of Ayot, Akobo and Watt. His 
forces are even siad to have reached as far North as the Zaraf Island of 
Panjak. In order to take advantage of this overland route in the dry 
season, the regime now has to fight its way for almost the entire 300 
kilometers  from Malakal. Commander Nuyon's SSIM forces are reported to 
have reached Doleib Hill, some fifteen hundred kilometers from Malakal.
   The regime's propaganda machine has released many stories in recent 
weeks reporting that 30,000 fresh troops have been airlifted to Juba, 
ready to take the battle to the SPLA.  The story made impressive reading 
for the Northern public but did little to threaten the SPLA in Eastern 
Equitoria because the truth is somewhat different. 
   In reality, the regime's press gangs in the North  have rounded up 
any male aged fourteen to twenty-one foolish enough to be seen in 
public. They have been dragged out of homes and schools or mearly 
rounded up off the streets. Instead of taking them to training camps in 
the North, they have been immediately airlifted to camps in Juba, from 
where there is little chance of escape. Forcibly enlisted into the 
Popular Defense Forces (PDF), they are being given rudimentary 
instruction on how to fire a rifle before being despatched to the 
battlefront. It is little wonder that the PDF's causality and mortality 
rates have been so high and its forces so ineffective. More than 3,000 
youngsters died on the battlefield at Awingbul alone in October.
   One of the unspoken tragedies of this press gang policy is that the 
relatives of the young men have no idea what has happened to them or 
where they actually are. Those lucky enough to go to a camp in the North 
rather than straight to the South are kept incommunicado from their 
parents and relatives who are not allowed to visit them. Inquisitive 
relatives are told that the young men have volunteered to train for the 
jihad. Parents of underage boys are told that they are undertaking their 
compulsory national military training in order to qualify them for their 
next stage of education.
   Whilst the regime's policy is quite successful at getting the young 
men to the South, it is less adept at motivating them to fight, even for 
the jihad. Once the young men have been exposed to rotting corpses, 
badly wounded contemporaries and a highly motivated enemy, they become 
utterly demoralized.
   Despite the regime's oft-quoted desire to send a one million strong 
militia force to the South, the SPLA continues to survive and fight 
back, leaving many observers to wonder why the regime even bothers to 
suggest it. mere numbers have proved to be insufficient in the heat of 
battle. Morale and motivation have proved to be far more significant  
and on both counts the SPLA is leaps and bounds ahead of the regime's 
forces.

Zambia
Taxpayers' Money Being Used To Deny Truths

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Lucy Sichone
 
   Lusaka - In the past months, State House has been running continuous 
advertisements in the government-owned media, especially the Zambia 
Daily Mail to refute all "unpleasant" stories carried by The Post on the 
government and President Chiluba. The denials are supposedly meant to 
discredit The Post and project it as a newspaper on a "malicious 
campaign" against Chiluba and his government. In this edition, Zambia 
Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone (right) gives her 
view of the newspaper and the propaganda journalism being orchestrated 
by State House.
   The Post was not my favourite newspaper.  Infact early in 1995 there 
was a period when in exercise of my right and freedom to speech, press 
and communication, I stopped buying The Post with one other independent 
newspaper which I still do not read.
    I began buying and reading The Post when it came to my attention 
that a propaganda department in the tradition of UNIP's Ministry of 
National Guidance but renamed productivity department had been 
established at tax payers expense for the sole purpose of containing The 
Post Newspaper. A propaganda institution is always established as a 
desperate attempt to hide the truth. That is why propaganda journalism 
and information dissemination is a unique speciality of vicious 
dictatorship such as Hitler's propaganda ministry which marketed murder 
of the Jews in gas chambers as hot and refreshing showers for the 
victims.
   Consequently, I considered it my duty to read The Post so that I 
could determine the reasons why Richard Sakala was spending scarce 
public money at a time when hospitals have no free medicines to give to 
under five children on rebutting Post stories especially if the said 
stories are not true and are therefore not worth the consideration of 
intelligent Zambians like myself.
   Upon my resumption of reading The Post and upon close scrutiny of the 
"Kim  II Sung" adverts by the productivity department on the issues 
raised by The Post, it became transparently clear to me that the target 
of the propaganda is not the substance of The Post stories; the target 
is the managing director, Fred M'membe.
   With all due respect to Fred, I should say that he does not posses 
all the awesome qualities and capacity for destruction of Zambia's 
integrity as a nation that are attributed to him by Richard Sakala and  
Chiluba.  But I am aware that Fred possesses a huge ego that attract 
attacks from an individual who believes that he should be the sole 
source of power in an alpha/omega sense. That is why in my case Fred is 
not my friend, like the apostles of Jesus the two (2) of us would not 
agree who between us is the greatest and since I do not manage a 
newspaper and I have no money for productivity advertisements to enable 
me to settle the issue of who is the greatest between Fred and myself; 
it is better we are not friends or foes.
   Coming back to the issue of Fred verses Fred, I was particularly 
intrigued by one of Sakala's advertisements which concerned a story in 
the International Herald Tribue which reported that the supremo of the 
Post Newspapers has been arraigned on so many criminal defamation suits 
that he may total up a record 100 years of imprisonment. 
   The international Herald Tribune is an "Establishment" paper whose 
unquestioned status in the press and media world is aristocratic.  It is 
the newspaper which I have observed is served with champagne in the 
first class cabin of British Airways as I make my measured and dignified 
way to the third class cabin.
   I was concerned therefore that a newspaper of the Herald standard 
could devote space and money on a pedestrian story about the possible 
imprisonment of some small time editor of a small time newspaper in a 
third world country.
   After much reflection and analysis of the issue, it dawned on me that 
the story was not about Fred M'membe and the possibility that he may be 
imprisoned for 100 years; the purpose of that international Herald story 
was about the current government of the Republic of Zambia and its loss 
of credibility, integrity, honest to an extent where the small time 
editor of a small time newspaper can rate a total of a 100 years 
imprisonment for alleging that the President's father is alive and well 
and was mistakenly asking for the fattened pig!!!
   The international Herald could have produced massive copy about 
Zambia's loss of good governance by writing about KK's deportation to 
Malawi, corruption and drug trafficking, obtaining money by false 
pretences ostensibly to write a fictitious constitution to stand the 
test of MMD governance; that the Herald did not use any of these serious 
and substantive issues to demonstrate Zambia's regression to 
dictatorship but instead used copy on mere Fred M'membe is evidence of a 
satirical indictment of our governors in the mode and style of Animal 
Farm.
   In short my dear Richard Sakala the enemy is not  M'membe but 
yourselves (reference Julius Caesar) The International Herald story, the 
non-aligned movement disgust with the intended deportation of KK, the 
not accepted constitution, our general loss of international 
credibility, voter registration apathy, the tunnels fiasco and M'membe's 
International Press Awards, which are irritating to all of us victims of 
press freedom are a consequence of government's misdeeds, dishonesty and 
incompetence.
   Recently, I was horrified to be told by the President himself that 
his humiliation at the non-aligned movement conference over the 
deportation of KK was a set up by KK himself as it was not government's 
intention to consign the former President to Malawi. The reports on KK's 
deportation were issued through the government media by government 
spokesmen.  I only repeat what I have stated elsewhere that it will not 
be possible for this government to change without a true and honesty 
confession of its sins of commission  and omissions and as long as 
Richard Sakala and even Chiluba continues to attribute the consequences 
of their misdeeds to KK, M'membe, Sichone (never one to leave myself 
out) etc there can never be any salvation for themselves or MMD and we 
have KK and UNIP to prove the truism of this political fact.
   The serious problem of the MMD government image as petty, vindictive 
and intolerant because of its incompetence will not be resolved by 
personal attacks on individual citizens their integrity and/or lack of 
it. After all news institutions such as the Herald Tribune , BBC do not 
use The Post  or Fred M'membe as the source of their copy. Any story 
which rates attention of reputable international media is based on 
proper research and collection of data on governance, press freedom, 
electoral systems and so forth. Personal attacks on individual citizens 
merely compound the problem and when the President becomes directly 
involved in the propaganda, the Presidency itself is brought into 
disrepute. In the circumstances, it becomes completely unacceptable, 
indeed it is criminal for the government to abuse tax payers money on 
the kind of advertisements that we have seen against The Post and 
M'membe when the culprits for our international disgrace are in cabinet, 
the police force, electoral commissioner and the public relations unit 
at State House.
   The producer and director of productivity department propaganda 
should be reminded that misuse of public funds on personal issues is a 
criminal offence. And one of these days, sooner rather than later, there 
will be need to answer charges of theft by public servant involving 
millions of Kwacha for personal gain. The Nuremburg trials have laid 
down the principle that "I was only taking orders" is not an adequate 
defence to save the person so accused from imprisonment or capital 
punishment. 
   Those advertisements whose only achievements has been to vest Fred 
M'membe with abilities and capacities which even the President of the 
USA does not possess should come to an end. Attention should be given to 
addressing those issues of misgovernance that have given the government 
a bad name at
international fora.
   Further and at a personal level, the obssession by the productivity 
government and State House with Fred has given him an edge in the 
undeclared contest between him and myself as to who is the greatest. In 
the circumstances I would have no choice but to commence proceedings 
against the Attonery General in which I would pray for the following 
orders: 
   That the productivity department should begin immediate 
advertisements against me for tarnishing Zambian's Human Rights Record 
with my clandestine domestic relations, Sam Ngoma can be retained to do 
the necessary copy with his earnings paid directly to the Times of 
Zambia to ensure that honest journalists like Hicks Sikazwe continue to 
receive their salaries. 
   That the said productivity department should be ordered to arrange a 
Nightline programme and address to the nation by the President  FTJ 
Chiluba in which it can be stated that specially prepared sharp tooth 
will be used to sort out the same domestic relations which I am using to 
tarnish Zambia's human rights record abroad and traumatising leaders 
children like Prince William, Prince Harry, John Major Jnr., Castro etc.
   I will need these orders in order to show Fred M'membe that he is not 
the greatest; that all of us ordinary citizens rate the same kind of 
attention from our government.I will stop here and once again find 
comfort in Byron "if I laugh at any mortal thing, it is that I may not 
weep".

Soccer: Nigeria Given A Chance

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Staff Reporters

   Luaka - Nigeria has been given an ultimatum by the Confederation of 
African Football (CAF) to reconsider pulling out of Africa's soccer 
tournament in South Africa or face sanctions. 
   The CAF gave the military government in Abuja until last evening to 
make it's final decision and threatened to suspend the country, which 
won the Africa Cup in Tunisia in 1994, from international competitions 
for up to six years.
   The ultimatum was  communicated to the Nigerian government yesterday 
in Younde, Cameroun by CAF president Issa Hayatou and  that Guinea was 
being drafted to take the place of Nigeria if they did not respond to 
the ultimatum.
   Nigeria announced last week that it was withdrawing from the Africa 
Cup of Nations on the grounds that South Africa could not gurantee the 
safety of the team in the tournament which starts this next week. 
Nigeria is favourite to win again this year.
   It is believed the Nigerian government was nursing grudges against 
South Africa because of the attitude shown by President Nelson Mandela 
after nine political activists from the minority Ogoni group were 
executed in Nigeria on November 10 last year.
   Mandela was at the forefront of a British Commonwealth campaign to 
isolate Nigeria after the executions. This led to a souring of relations 
between the two countries, both regarded as Africa's super powers. 
Officials in South Africa have said the tournament will go ahead with or 
without Nigeria. The games will be played in Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, 
Durban and Port Elizaberth.

Zambia Has No New Kit For Africa Cup Games

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Reuben Tonga

   Lusaka - Zambia has no new kit for the Africa Cup of Nations after 
their much publicised John Fashanu backed deal with Reebok flopped at 
the last minute when suppliers were reported to be on Christmas holiday. 
Instead Zambia has resorted to cheaply designed uniforms from 
Johannesburg to make up for the blow after efforts to get the London kit 
failed.
   Fashanu's representative a Mace yesterday confirmed the absence of 
the uniform saying arrangements were being made to get it from South 
Africa.
But FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka denied that there was no kit for the team
saying it would be picked in Bloemfontein, South Africa.
"It is not true to say we have no kit. Because arrangements have been 
made
for the kit. Instead of using the British Reebok we are going to use the
South African one which is better kit than what we had in the last
four-nations competitions," he said.
Zambia had protested over the poor quality of the kit it had been given 
by
Reebok at the Simba four-nations tournament- yellow  and green sets.
A Blue Orchid director Mace, currently in the country to finalise the 
kit
arrangment to be used by Zambia at next week's Africa Cup of Nations,
confirmed that the kit will be made in South Africa.

Zambia
How Has Entertainment Scene Been In 1995?

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Goodson Machona

   Lusaka - Let us continue with events of last year. Some dissatisfied 
musicians called for the dissolution of the Zambia Union of Musicians ( 
ZUM ) executive claiming it had mishandled cash and was not representing 
the musicians adequately.
   ZUM general secretary, Webster Malama, was even accused of faking the 
death of the Sakala Brother so that he could obtain welfare money. 
However despite the brahuha, ZUM managed to open a music resource centre 
at the Evelyn Hone college to help musicians without instruments.
   Shortly after, ZUM was given a short in the arm when it received a K4 
million grant from the government. However, a planned gig to commemorate 
the death of the national team flopped after the organisers, Jah 
Entertainment, failed to secure a suitable set of musical instruments.
   Lusaka-based playwright, Maurice Tembo formed a drama group called 
Forum For Drama ( FODA ) and lined up a series of programmes which, 
however, are yet to see the light of day.
   This year, the Lusaka theatre club degenerated into some rough house 
catering for boozers. Club manager, Norris Malauzi admitted that there 
was a problem but attributed the lack of artistic activity to the fact 
that most of the time the auditorium was booked by outsiders. 
   And, as matters degenerated, the playhouse was gutted but members 
managed to raise K20 million to refurbish the joint. On a brighter note, 
playwright Maurice Tembo made an appearance on the British Broadcasting 
Corporation television programme "Great Railways Journey."
   Tembo
   And while Tembo was shining on BBC, a University of Zambia student, 
Anderson Ngulube was awarded $5,000 by an American organisation for his 
poetry but he was unable to go and receive the award as he could not 
raise money for an air ticket.
   Another author, Beenwell Sinyangwe, had his book "Quills of Desire" 
mentioned in the coveted African Book Publishing Records ( ABPR ) while 
Zambian artist, Joe Muzala, was invited to the prestigious South African 
award exhibition which was held in South Africa sometime in June.
   In August, artistes of all shades converged at the Star Market and 
held a two day bash to commemorate the passing of former radio dee jay, 
Timmy Mvula. New Generation front man, Frank Chitembwe, flew to the 
United Kingdom and recorded a self titled solo album featuring some 
Samba, fusion of Zambian rock and gospel.
   About the same time too, emergent singer James Ngoma recorded a debut 
album entitled "Chamanyazi" which performed relatively well on the local 
market.   
   Amayenge
   The Amayenge had to cut short their American tour after they 
encountered problems. According to band spokesman, Brian Chilala, their 
promoter made off with their earnings while the band leader Chris Chali 
had to return home to attend his wife's funeral.
   Raggamufin don, Daddy Zemus, sold the rights to his "Salaula" LP to a 
newly formed promotion outfit Digital Network International but the move 
was condemned by most local musicians. For the first time, local 
musicians got together and petitioned the Zambia National Broadcasting 
Corporation ( ZNBC ) to begin paying them copyright royalties for any 
song or video's played on ZNBC.
   Shortly after, chairman of the Zambia Copyrights Society ( ZAMCOPS ) 
Jagari Chanda, was invited by the World Copyrights Organisation ( WBO ) 
to attend a copyright seminar in Switzerland.
   Towards the end of the year, a white girl was picked to represent 
Zambia at the Miss World pageant but the move was not without 
controversy. But perhaps the saddest moment of the year was when veteran 
singer, Derek Mbao, passed away after an illness while in prison.
   "Its the saddest moment in the history of Zambian music," ZUM general 
secretary, Webster Malama moaned. And before our tears could dry, the 
music fraternity lost yet another good musician in former Witch 
guitarist, Emmanuel Makulu.
   Tshala Muana
   Foreign singers made forays into the country.  Zairean sassy singer, 
Tshala Muana breezed in.  She was followed by another Zairean Yondo 
Sister.  A month later Le General, Dafao jetted in.  But his shows were 
far from impressive. Zambian singers based in foreign lands also paid a 
courtesy call to their
mother land.  
   Sweden-based singer Ken Simuyemba came into the country and so did 
the Ubale Girls and guitar virtuoso, Rikki Illilonga. The women ganged 
up and came up with a project called Women In Music  to promote women 
musicians.  Shortly after, they organised a talent show for emergent 
female musicians artistes at the Chainama hotel.   They have gone 
further and organised a tour of the Zimbabwe-based Zairean band, the 
Lubumbashi Stars which was be performing at various venues in Lusaka 
over the New Year period.
   Ras Willie
   Ras Willie who was facing a charge of trafficking in obscene material 
was acquitted by the Lusaka High court after the prosecution failed to 
establish a prima facie case against him. The Amayenge's planned tour of 
Zimbabwe fell through after the venues they had ear marked for their 
shows were booked by other people.
   Last week saw the crowning of Tamara Kaluba as Miss Universe-Zambia 
but the choice did not go down well with most revellers. Lastly but 
definitely not the least, the Go Banana's night club and the former 
Kuku's night club were given  new leases of life after extensive 
renovations .
   Hoping you have caught up with 1995, we look forward to taking you 
through 1996 with more and wider entertainment coverage.

Membe Joins Presidential Race

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by  Reuben  Phiri

   Lusaka - Clergyman and human rights activist Reverend Franklin Membe 
yesterday declared he was joining the race for the Zambian presidency in 
the forthcoming elections during a press conference at Lusaka's Fairview 
Hotel.
   Membe said that he had intended to contest for presidency in the year 
2001 but has been compelled to do it this year  because  "the rate at 
which the MMD government is going is dangerous".
   "I do not see any seriousness on the part of Chiluba to avert 
bloodshed in the country," Membe said. Asked what his chances were 
against MMD's  President Chiluba and UNIP's Kenneth Kaunda, Membe said 
with adequate funds and a fair election he could win.
   "Its never too late," he said. " MMD came together in less than a 
year." Membe said he will stand on a political party whose name he will 
be announcing soon after completing consultations. And Membe accused 
President Chiluba, without adequate proof, of using undemocratic methods 
to hold on to power.
   "He is recruiting more policemen and soldiers when people are 
suffering because he wants to use them to hold on to power,"Membe 
said."Because Kaunda has announced his intention to contest presidency, 
there is money for two thousand police officers."
   Reverend Membe is the estranged husband to local government and 
housing deputy minister Wendy Sinkala Membe.

Zambia Has No Policy On Information Technology

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Nkandu Kapepula

   Lusaka - If Kabunda Kayongo, the fourth minister in as many years at 
science and technology ministry, keeps her end of year promise to the 
information technology (IT), 1996 could be the dawn of a promising era.  
   On December 1, Kayongo used Computers Society of Zambia seventh 
computers communications fair as an excuse to declare she will roll out 
a national IT policy this year. Could this be another of those empty 
slogans? 
   That is not an uncharitable question to ask. Incidentally, this is 
not the first time government has gone public about the urgent need of 
an IT policy. Nor is it true to infer that there is no IT policy at the 
moment. It is there - a monumental patchwork of here-today-gone tomorrow 
guidelines.
   As far as history of both Kaunda and Chiluba administration goes, the 
IT portfolio has never been distinctly delegated. The result is that 
today four ministers are directly involved with the IT enterprise and 
are ostensibly pulling in different directions.
   Other than the science and technology ministry, communications and 
transport, information and broadcasting, and commerce, trade and 
industry, bureaucrats have separately courted the IT community with 
different agendas. Computer Society of Zambia, for one, gives the 
impression that there is no difference between the four. It collaborates 
with any of them as it deems convenient.
   And there lies the critical problem of lack of focus and absence of 
unity of purpose. The knock-on effect is that the IT industry is on the 
back step. Witness the confusion on trade tariffs, legislation on 
intellectual property rights, the resistance to open the telecoms market 
and a discordant skills development effort.
   As far as Penzanomics stretch, a compact disc (CD) bearing Yondo 
Sister's music is of the same value  as one with Micr-osoft's Office 95 
groupware! That is not all. Information and broadcasting ministry sees 
no impropriety in lumping computer programmes with poetry and music in 
its copyright laws. 
    Enter communications and transport ministry. It hand-picks the board 
of directors of the Communication Authority, the nat-ion's telecoms 
industry regulator, without representation from the native computer 
industry. Either the ministry is not convinced computers, communications 
and electronic media are converging and that it needs well-versed 
advisors in these fields or it has time-warped.
   When primary and pre-schools across the border in Mozambique and 
Namibia are being equipped with donated computer systems-thanks to their 
creative bureaucrats- God knows when the ever uncertain private 
initiatives of our universities will yield an IT prog-rammes.
   Far more striking, the guys at SGS and Zambia Revenue Authority do 
not care whether our nascent IT industry swims or sinks. Never mind that 
there is absolutely no computer hardware manufacturing here to protect 
from imports, their business is to make Zambians pay more than even the 
manufacturers demand.  
   Yes, SGS has been instructed to ignore invoice prices demanded by 
manufacturers and substitute them with what is in its 'opinion' is the 
right value. The reason is that the treasury under Ronald Penza, whom 
even MMD vigilantes cannot entrust to lead their obscure finance and 
economic committee, must collect more taxes to pay its hopelessly 
bloated civil services, finance dubious jaunts etc.
Surprisingly,  political rhetoric is heavily skewed towards hoodwinking 
a supposedly unassuming populace that this is the ideal climate to lure 
foreign investors. What is attractive about setting up a shop where one 
has to pay for receiving a call (not sending) on cellular phone? Not in 
an age where technology has improved so much that before long the cost 
of dialing Lusaka from New York would be the same as ringing one's next 
door neighbour, that is not science fiction but reality.
   For inspiration, India is a ready reference point,. Its software 
industry grew more than 50 per cent last year posting a turnover of 850 
million United States dollars. This is far much more than our export 
earnings from copper sales in the
corresponding period.

Zambians Used 7M Condoms In 1995

Post of Zambia
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Masautso Lungu

   Lusaka - About 7 million Maximum Condoms were used in Zambia in 1995 
alone, racking in about K52.5 million of income to local maximum agents, 
the Zambia Social Marketing Projects (ZSMP).
   And ZSMP has taken another step further to Reality, a female condom.  
"We've six months in which to access the market for Reality , but it is 
selling well in our outlets," said ZSMP marketing manager, Chris Mukkuli 
in an interview yesterday. "For instance we sold about 1, 500 packets of 
Reality in December, and we  hope that it will improve though there are 
more men buying it than women."  Mukkuli also disclosed that there has 
been overwhelming response from the public in Maximum Condoms.
   "We sold 6.7 million condoms in 1995. The level of acceptance and 
awareness is so high that every sexually active person would want to use 
the Maximum Condom," said Mukkuli. "That it is our business to see 
people using condoms to prevent the spread of the deadly diseases and 
promote family planning. "
   And the stores manager at S.J Patel Supermarket, Henry Mangani, is 
delighted by the figure sold which is close to the national population 
of
about 8 million people.
"We're proud that Zambia Social Marketing Project has sold 7 million 
condoms and I feel we've contributed to this figure as we've sold 
maximum condoms since they were introduced on the market," said Mangani. 
   Last year's figure accounts for over 50 per cent of all the sales 
ZSMP made between 1992 when it launched maximum and 1994. Between this 
period ZSMP sold only 12.2 million condoms. 
   Maximum is also changing the packaging of the condoms to make it even 
more appealing and convenient to carry. "We will this year change from 
the square shaped box to a pillow shaped package which will be more 
convenient for the consumer to carry," Mukkuli said.

Zambia Stock Trading Slowed by Small Number Of Firms

Post of Zambia
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Sipo Kapumba

   Lusaka - Trade at the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has been seriously 
affected by the low number of companies being floated there and the 
general poor state of the economy, experts have said.
   LuSE general manager Charles Mate and Finance Securities general 
manager Nduba Namoonde said, in separate interviews, on Wednesday that 
an increase in the number of listed companies from the present two, 
Chilanga Cement and Rothmans of Pall Mall, and the stabilisation of the 
economy could boost the level of activity on the LuSE.
And Mate said companies on the stock exchange could be likened to 
commodities and "the wider the variety on offer, the more likely the 
public was to being attracted to trade in them".
   However, Mate said the stock exchange cannot dictate to the 
government through the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund the pace at which 
companies should be floated to the public because this was their 
prerogative.
   This year Zambia Oxygen, Zambia Sugar and Zambia Breweries shares are 
expected to be listed on the stock exchange but their timetables is yet 
to be announced.
Mate also said the stabilisation of the economy through a reduction in 
inflation which in-turn could lead to a drop in interest rates would 
present shares as an attractive option to the traditional method of 
saving money in Zambia which is through maintaining bank accounts. "The 
wider participation of individuals in share ownership was an important 
objective of the privatisation programme which the LuSE was there to 
facilitate by enabling as many people as possible have access to shares 
in companies being privatised," Mate said.
   Namoonde said there is need for tax concessions to companies go 
public if the stock exchange is to develop. "For the stock exchange to 
grow the government needs to create a conducive atmosphere through tax 
concessions for companies which want to float their shares to the public 
on the exchange," he said. "The government should give tax relief to 
companies floating their shares to the public so that more are willing 
to do so."
   In addition, Namoonde said the government could help put public 
confidence into the exchange by stabilising the economy so that people 
do not simply concentrate on consumption but also start saving even by 
way of share ownership.

Controversy Slows Voter Registration

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Masautso Phiri

   Lusaka - Lack of visible control, direction and coordination of the 
work of the Israeli firm, Nikuv, contracted by the government to prepare 
the voters' register and cards is said to be frustrating the work of the 
Electoral Commission.
   And neither the government, through the office of the Vice-President, 
nor the Electoral Commission, through the Elections Office, seems to 
have discernible control over, or even knowledge of, the activities of 
Nikuv. And this apparent 'mystery' over Nikuv seems to be compounding 
the fears of the opposition that the ruling MMD wants to use the firm  
to rig the elections.  
   This 'invisible' control of Nikuv also seems to be one of the major 
obstacles to the smooth completion of the exercise.
   The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's lack of supervisory 
powers over Nikuv is said to have left the commissioners and officers 
frustrated. Issues of control of Nikuv, funding, cards distribution and 
registration appear to be the worrisome issue at play.
   "We have nothing to do with either the contract to register voters or 
Nikuv," said chairman of the Electoral Commission, justice Weston 
Muzyamba in a telephone interview last week.
   But it is not only the Electoral Commission and the Elections Office 
that knows little, or nothing, about Nikuv, the permanent secretary in 
the office of the Vice-President, to whom the firm is believed to be 
reporting, also seems to be uneasy about the firm's voters' registration 
business. 
   "I am not in a better position to discuss the subject. You have 
caught me off hand. I am not able to comment," said permanent secretary 
in the office of the Vice-President, Philip Daka, in a telephone 
interview last Friday. He was asked to comment, among other issues, on 
the government's ability to distribute the 4 million cards to voters who 
exercise estimates to registered by next week Wednesday. And the cards 
would only be available for distribution to the registered voters 
sometime in February.
   Opposition parties have expressed worry that some voters may not 
return to registration centres to collect their cards and they fear for 
the security of those cards whose owners would either have died or are 
unable to collect them for one reason or another.
   And the Electoral Commission, although appearing unhappy with this 
arrangement, is not prepared to criticise it.
   "This is what has been decided by government. Find out from the 
government chief spokesman if the elections commission was involved in 
this," said Electoral Commission spokesman Joel Sikazwe said in an 
interview last week. The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's 
frustration were also noticed and observed by leaders of the opposition 
who they met last week.
   "I noticed the difficult circumstances they are working under and it 
showed they were not happy about the arrangement," Zambia Democratic 
Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda observed in an interview last 
week. 
   "They said they had recommended the issuance of cards immediately 
after registration but the government refused." 
   But not even Nikuv officials, based at Lusaka's Hotel 
Intercontinental, are willing to explain their activities.
   "I am also a technician and I cannot say anything. I don't know what 
it has to do with you, anyway," said projects manager, Setton, in an 
interview last week when asked to explain his firm's role. "Are you a 
Christian, the Bible says don't force."

Major Parties Meet

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103) 
 
   Lusaka - Four presidents of opposition parties will today meet to 
formalise their common stand on several national issues.
   Secretaries of UNIP, Liberal Progressive Front and National Party 
have met three times to pave the way for today's meeting. 
   "The first meeting agreed on three issues - voter registration and 
Nikuv, constitutional reform and President Frederick Chiluba's 
citizenship," said special assistant for press to UNIP president Muhabi 
Lungu. "But we unanimously agreed to suspend discussion of President's 
citizenship because it might overshadow serious issues." 
   Today's meeting follows an earlier meeting between UNIP president 
Kenneth Kaunda and LPF president Rodger Chongwe at which an outline of 
common understanding was agreed. The two parties were later joined by 
the National Party and for today's meeting by the Zambia Democratic 
Congress.
   And yesterday UNIP officials were tight-lipped about the venue of the 
meeting.
   "We cannot announce the venue before the presidents agree," said  
UNIP's vice secretary general Fenwick Chifunda.

State House Snubs Group

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Goodson Machona
 
   Lusaka - State House has thrown out an offer by the Foundation for 
Democratic Process (FODEP) to mediate in the on-going 'conflict' between 
President Chiluba and Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe.
   In a telephone interview yesterday, President Chiluba's public 
relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, said the issues raised by 
M'membe in his letter to Chiluba were criminal and only the courts can 
settle the matter.
   "There is no question of reconciliation between President Chiluba and 
Fred M'membe," Sakala said.  "What is there is for the two parties to 
meet in court."
   But Women for Change executive director, Emily Sikazwe, says that if 
what M'membe wrote in his letter  was criminal then the President's 
attacks on him, to which he was responding, should also be criminalised. 
"If what M'membe wrote to the President is criminal then the President's 
remarks on M'membe on the Night Line  programme is also criminal," 
Sikazwe said.
   She said it was unfortunate that President Chiluba would like to take 
M'membe to court without waiving his own immunity so that he too can be 
prosecuted.
   "The President has immunity and it would be grossly unfair to take 
M'membe to court without waiving his immunity," Sikazwe said. 
   But FODEP general secretary, Bishop John Mambo, has maintained that 
his organisation will still go ahead and mediate in the stand off.
   "As FODEP we feel we should mediate in the conflict between  
President Chiluba and Mr M'membe," Mambo said in an interview yesterday, 
adding: "This week we will be writing to President Chiluba so that we 
can arrange a meeting for these people."
   He said going to court is not the best solution.
   "Court proceedings take between three to five years to conclude and 
that will not help anybody," Mambo said, adding: "We don't have to wait 
until M'membe or Masautso Phiri (Post special projects editor) has an 
artificial accident for people to act." 
   He dispelled claims by UNIP chairman, Malimba Masheke, that  "FODEP 
and MMD are one".
  "I am above a person that can be used by anybody," Mambo seethed and 
noted that it was President Chiluba's special assistant for press, 
Richard Sakala who is "not courageous enough to call M'membe to State 
House to discuss the issue. That is why we have decided to put a brake 
on this issue".
   But ZIMT president, Alfred Zulu, said no Non Governmental 
Organisation has the right to mediate in the matter.
   "If the President feels offended its up to the judiciary to take 
effect and not an NGO," Zulu said in an interview on Monday.
   The 'conflict' between Chiluba and M'membe has generated a lot of 
interest among civic and political leaders who have criticised FODEP for 
the stand it took over the letter written to President Chiluba by 
M'membe soon after his Christmas eve ZNBC  Night Line Radio programme.
   The Zambia Democratic Congress, the Zambia Civic Education 
Association, the National Party, the Liberal Progressive Party, the 
United National Independence Party (UNIP), the Zambia Independent 
Monitoring Team, the Inter African Network for Human Rights and 
Development (Afronet ) and the Catholic Commission for Peace and Justice 
have all come out in support of M'membe and criticised FODEP's stand 
which they described as "not neutral".
   Meanwhile State House has continued to run full page articles in the 
government owned and controlled newspapers accusing M'membe of being 
unpatriotic and of waging an international "anti-Zambia campaign".

Soccer: Zambians Predict 2-1 Victory Against Egypt

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Mildred Mulenga, PANA Staff Correspondent 

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian soccer fans on Friday predicted their team 
will beat Egypt 2-1 in the quarter-finals of the 1996 Africa Cup of 
Nations to be played Saturday at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, 
South Africa. 
   Some 80 percent of Zambian soccer fans who called into a programme on 
national radio Friday morning said Zambia, runners-up in the 1994 Africa 
Cup of Nations played in Tunsia would the tough Egyptian side 2-1. Only 
one caller said Zambia would be beaten by Egypt. He predicted a 0-1 
margin. 
   Zambia who qualified for the quarter-finals on Wednesday after 
beating Sierra Leone 4-0. The Zambian coach Roald Poulsen said Zambia's 
quarter final match against Egypt would be "tough". A local analyst 
Ponga Liwewe said Thursday evening that Zambia has to play a more 
attacking game because the Egyptians are good at holding the ball and 
are "solid" at the back. "We need other players to get to the scoring 
point to put in goals in the first half," Ponga said. 
   Another analyst Anthony Kasolo said Zambia has to cut the Egyptians 
wings were they are known to run the ball well. He said the Zambians 
should also avoid lettting the Egyptians to break their defense in 
counter attacks. The two also expressed concern at what was Zambia's 
relaxed style after scoring five goals and two goals against Burkina 
Faso and Sierra Leone in the first half. 
   Zambia, who during the opening match against Algeria drew 0-0 have so 
far scored nine goals in two games after beating Burkina Faso 5-1 and 
Sierra Leone 4-0 to qualify for the quarter-finals. With five golas to 
his credit, Zambia's skipper Kalusha Bwalya is currently the top scorer 
at the ongoing tournament.

Mozambique
Outrage Grows Over Interior Minister's Remarks

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   MAPUTO, Mozambique - In spite of growing public outrage at his 
remarks, Mozambican interior minister Manuel Antonio has defended his 
position that prisoners have only themselves to blame if they die of 
hunger in police cells. 
   Asked by the daily paper "Noticias" to clarify his position, Antonio 
simply repeated that his ministry does not have the money to buy food 
for prisoners, and that they are in jail because of the crimes they 
committed. 
   "I repeat my statements," said Antonio. "Who asked them to commit 
crimes ?" 
   Many of those incarcerated in prisons run by the police are in fact 
not convicted criminals but detainees awaiting trial. The minister did 
not seem to make a distinction between the two. 
   In an interview published on Monday, Antonio is reported to have 
said: "These men who die, it's really because there's no food to give 
them. They're not maltreated." But the minister added: "A man has to 
die, he has his limits. When his time's up, it's over. He goes. It's not 
because they've been maltreated by the police." 
   The Mozambican Human Rights League has sent a strong protest to 
President Joaquim Chissano, suggesting that Antonio be sacked. The 
minister told "Noticias" he did not care about the league's stance. 
   One of the country's leading lawyers, Carlos Cauio, head of the 
Mozambican Bar Association, described the minister's words as "an 
assault on human dignity". 
   The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Maputo, Cardinal Alexandre dos 
Santos, told the independent news sheet Mediafax, "I intend to speak 
with the minister of the interior. I think that by talking we can 
resolve a lot of things." He described the fate of prisoners as 
"worrying", and added "perhaps it's not just a food shortage -- it's 
because the food is being stolen."

Africa-at-Large
Weekly Press Review

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent

   DAKAR, Senegal - War and soccer were the issues attracting the 
attention of the Africa Press this week. 
   Newspapers in Addis Ababa and Dakar commented on the ongoing Africa 
Cup of Nations. 
   The Monitor of Addis Ababa focused on Nigeria's absence from the 20th 
tournament. "Almost everyone is affected by the absence of the Super 
Eagles," it said. It wondered if this was not fatal: "To Mandela? To 
Nigerian strongman Sani Abacha and to African football? "The only losers 
are African soccer and the football crazy African fans who put soccer 
before politics," it said. 
   Nigeria, it continued, was "by all account" the best football nation 
in Africa. The country, it added, was "big in many ways": population, 
economy, oil and politics but for the average African, all these factors 
matter little. "Soccer comes first and here lies the big 
disappointment," it said. Recounting how Nigerian fans travelled 
worldwide to support the Super Eagles it concluded: "
   The ultimate losers...will definitely be ordinary Nigerian fans who 
had nothing to do with Abacha's decision. "When elephants fight, it is 
the grass that suffers most. What a fitting African adage," it said. 
   As the event moves closer to the final, Dakar's Le Soleil noted that 
after the initial surprise in the tournament "the entire tournament had 
become an affair for the favourites": Algeria, Egypt and Zambia. These 
countries, it said, "have logically bulldozed their way to the 
quarterfinal." 
   From soccer politics to real politik, several Nigerian papers 
condemned the coup d'etat in Sierra Leone which overthrew Capt. 
Valentine Strasser. This condemnation coincided with the visit to 
Nigeria of the new military leader in Freetown, Brig. Julius Bio. 
   The Daily Sketch, of Ibadan, noted wearily that coups used to be the 
business of colonels and their superiors in fairly backward countries. 
They struck in Greece in 1967, in Portugal in 1974 and Spain in 1981. 
"They were then the sick men of Europe, economically and politically. 
Though their economies are yet to become ruddy pink, their politics has 
firmly stablised, a democracy that works, that the military readily 
surbodinates itself to," it noted. 
   "In West Africa, young officers appear to see coup-making as a bit of 
mess fun," it said. The semi-official paper noted that Strasser had set 
general elections for Feb. 26. "Many important Sierra Leoneans took him 
seriously enough to put themselves forward as presidential candidates. 
The new rulers, former lieutenants of the deposed one, have said that 
they are all for a return to democratic rule. But they have not been as 
illuminating with regard to when this will be," it said. 
   But Kenya's largest circulation daily newspaper, the Daily Nation, 
noted that Bio had, in fact, been quick to assure the world he would not 
derail the elections. "How times have changed. A time was when those 
staging coups across Africa did not feel compelled to justify their 
action as swiftly as Brigadier Bio is trying to do," it said. 
   It wondered whether Bio's junta would follow through with elections 
as scheduled "or will they borrow a leaf from another West African 
nation to stay just within reach of another coup, another day?" it said 
in implicit reference to Nigeria's situation. 
   While Strasser alleged that he was ousted because he wanted to 
maintain the election schedule, Bio said that he overthrew Strasser 
precisely because the captain did not really want to hand over to a 
democratically elected civilian government. "
   At the root of the confusion is the fact that members of the 
country's ruling military were not convinced that the military has had 
its fill of political leadership," the Nigerian Tribune, published in 
Ibadan, said. "The division within the hierarchy of the Sierra Leonean 
military epitomises the crisis and perhaps helplessness of African 
states which have been under military rule," it added. 
   For its part, The Vanguard of Lagos, noted that Africa had 
demonstrated its commitment to democracy but Sierra Leone was among the 
uneviable trio [the others being Gambia and Nigeria] still under 
military dictatorships. "We expect the new leaders to meet the people's 
quest for democracy so that the country's name could be deleted from the 
bad list. "
   To this end, Brigadier-General Bio and his clique should do nothing 
that would lead to the postponement of the elections already slated for 
February 26 this year," it said. 
   The press in Burundi, Kenya and Zaire commented on the suggestion by 
United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali that UN troops be 
sent to neighbouring Zaire in readiness to intervene in Burundi to stem 
the genocide shaping up, it seems, in degree and fashion as had happened 
in neighbouring Rwanda. 
   Nairobi's "Daily Nation" castigated the U.N for dilly-dallying on 
whether or not to send the peacekeeping. However, it exonerated Boutros-
Boutros Ghali and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, 
of blame. Despite its nasty experiences at peacekeeping, it said, "it 
would be an ironic tragedy" if, unwilling to preempt a tragedy now, "it 
later spends millions in a tribunal to investigate and indict murderers 
in what may well become the Burundi genocide." 
   The Burundi government-owned newspaper, Le Renouveau, said "foreign 
intervention will never solve Burundi's problems." Instead of a "foreign 
occupation force", it said, there should be "massive aid" to the 
country's millions of orphans. 
   Le Compatriote of Kinshasa said that the "international community and 
African countries should threaten the Burundi government with sanctions 
so as to force it to end the violance against civilians." 
   La Manchette, also a Kinshasa paper, said given the gravity of the 
situation, the United Nations seretary-general should again plea for the 
dispatch of UN troops to Zaire. 
   But La Nation, a Bujumbura privately-owned weekly, said that only 
Zaire's Mobuto Sese Seko would gain by this. "It would allow him to 
emerge from his world political isolation and gain centre stage." Rather 
than sending troops, it said, the U.N "should give the regular [Burundi] 
army the money it would have to spend maintaining the Blue Helmets, or 
help the Burundian judiciary arrest the putschists and masterminds of 
the October 1993 massacres." 
   Another tragedy discussed by Ibadan's Daily Sketch, was Liberia. It 
attacked ULIMO faction leader Roosevelt Johnson for acquiring weapons, 
ambushing West African peacekeeping troops and killing and capturing 
scores of them. It noted that many of the dead were Nigerians and that 
the peacekeeping commander, a Nigerian, said he would not send his men 
to incapacitate Johnson. 
   To add insult to injury, it said Johnson "sounded unrepentant, even 
exultant," during a radio interview. "An ant has painfully tweaked the 
tusk of an elephant and he appeared to be getting away with it," it 
said. This, it said, was "all very well" if one was dealing with an 
opponent that did not suffer from a superiority complex. "Mr. Johnson 
appears to," it said. "He should be given the Prince Johnson treatment. 
He should be made to beg to be taken out of Liberia," it said. 
   The World Bank representative in Nairobi, Steve O'Brien, last week 
warned that it was unlikely that donor countries would give funds to 
poor nations come July 1996 because no pledges had been forthcoming. 
   Against this forecast, the Kenya Times, the ruling party newspaper, 
said: "The bottom line is that African nations, which have hitherto 
heavily relied on donor assistance, must contrive ways of pulling 
themselves out of the economic hardships by their own bootstraps." 
Pinpointing one of Africa's problems as the lack of a sound 
technological base it advised thus: "All Africa ought to do is to learn 
how to benefit from international patents like they have done in Japan, 
South Korea and Taiwan and other countries who survived on borrowed 
technology. This will make Africa self-reliant."

Kenya
Shilling Hits Record Low

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Kenyan shilling hit its sharpest fall in almost 
a year Thursday when it plummeted to 59.1 from 55.50 to the US dollar. 
   The fall came as the World Bank announced it had suspended further 
disbursement of loans to the East African state after government over-
expenditure and corruption in high places. The bank said it would review 
disbursement of funds to Kenya in a joint mission with the International 
Monetary Fund. 
   Kenya was to have presented two loan applications for USD 165 million 
to the bank's board in Washington Thursday. The loans were to finance to 
major road projects. Most of Kenya's bilateral donors are withholding 
funds until the country and the World Bank and the IMF sort out their 
differences.

Benin
Soglo Threatens To Rule By Edict

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Ali Idrissou Toure, PANA Correspondent


   COTONOU, Benin - Benin president Nicephore Soglo threatened Thursday 
evening on national television to use edicts to implement the state's 
general budget and the Third Structural Adjustment Programme (PAS-III), 
which has been postponed three times by parliament. 
   Speaking at the end of a meeting with employees at the National Oil 
Products Marketing Company (SONACOP), Soglo said he would be "obliged to 
use the mechanisms provided for by the institutions" if there was a 
"block" or "hindrance to the normal operation of the State". 
   Benin's parliament has demanded that the government renegotiate the 
terms of the structural adjustment programme with the World Bank. But 
Soglo has said this is "a rejection" of the programme which has already 
been approved by the bank's board. 
   A decision taken by the bank cannot be put into question, he added. 
"Our country needs foreign resources and a budget to meet the challenges 
of 1996," the president said. This programme has stirred differences 
between the government, on the one hand, and the unions and parliament 
on the other.

Burundi
Bujumbura Police Arrest Union Leaders, Journalists

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Police in Bujumbura have arrested several trade 
unionists, politicians and journalists suspected of being ringleaders in 
a recent one-week strike. 
   The strike, from Jan. 15 to 21, was called to force the resignation 
of the government of President Sylivestre Ntibantunya, on allegations 
that he has been secretly been backing Hutu guerrillas in their fight 
against the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army. 
   The latest arrests came a few days after that of Deo Niyonzima, who 
heads a Tutsi group known as "The Youth Solidarity for the Defence of 
Minorities", which spearheaded the work-stoppage. Niyomzima was arrested 
by the police after a James Bond-type chase in the streets of the 
Burundian capital. 
   A trade unionist at the National Institute of Public Security, 
Innocent Massunzu, was arrested Thursday evening for his alleged role in 
the strike. As part of a crackdown against the strike's leaders, the 
government has placed Hitimana Mathias and Cyrille Sigejeje under house 
arrest for the past 20 days. 
   Hitimana is Chairmen (People's Reconciliation Party while Sigejeje 
heads the Rally for Democracy and Social Development. The government has 
also detained two independent journalists, 
   Doweri Dismas of the weekly "La Balance" and Jean-Marie Bizimana of 
"La Nation", another weekly. Doweri allegedly wrote articles that 
insulted cabinet ministers while Bizimana is accused of trying to divide 
and demoralise the army during the strike. 
   The Tutsi-dominated army did not back the strike. Reliable sources in 
the justice ministry said arrest warrants had also been issued for 
secondary school teachers and university lecturers suspected of being 
behind the anti-government work stoppage. 
   At the beginning of the strike, the Tutsi Burundian Prime Minister 
Antoine Nduwayo cautioned the organisers the government would take stern 
action. Burundi has been rocked by political instability and ethnic 
violence since October 1993, after the Hutu democratically elected 
President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated in a failed coup d'etat by 
elements of the Tutsi-dominated army.

Nigeria
Prisons Full of People Awaiting Trial

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Some 35,750 inmates are awaiting trial in Nigerian 
prisons, some for the past 10 years, according Internal Affairs Minister 
Baba Gana Kingibe. 
   These suspects represent about 65 percent of the total 55,000 inmates 
in the country's jail houses. At a briefing Thursday in Abuja, the 
nation's capital, the minister said "even convicts are human beings and 
are entitled to basic rights." 
   He said "it is hard enough being behind bars and harder still not to 
be accorded proper care and treatment whilst in prison." To decongest 
the prisons, Kingibe, Nigeria's Foreign Minister until early 1995, urged 
the police and courts to speed the judicial processes. He said the 
"principle of modern-day incarceration emphasises correction in 
preferecne to punishment. 
   Part of this principle is the entitlement of the prisoner to decent 
environment and decent feeding." To this end, the minister said 
government recently increased the inmates' feeding allowance by 100 
percent from 30 to 60 Naira per head. ( 85 Naira exchanges for one 
U.S.dollar in the populous West African country where the minimum wage 
is below 25 dollars a month).

Nigeria and Sierra Leone
Freetown Denies Nigerian Involvement in Coup

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - The secretary to Sierra Leone's new military 
government, John Benjamin, has dismissed speculation that Nigeria had 
anything to do with the recent coup in his country. 
   He told journalists in Freetown Thursday it was baseless to accuse 
Nigeria of involvement in the January 16 bloodless coup that toppled 
Capt. Valentine Strasser and swept his former deputy, Brig. Julius Maada 
Bio, to power. 
   Nigerian defence minister Brig.Gen. Fred Chijuka was the first to 
deny any nigerian involvement in the palace coup, which he described as 
an internal issue for Sierra Leone. Benjamin, who also served as 
secretary to the deposed Strasser regime, however, confirmed that 
Strasser's decision to vote against Nigeria in the last Commonwealth 
Summit in Aukland, New Zealand, had caused a big rift in Sierra Leone's 
former cabinet. 
   He was quoted as saying "Nigeria has done so much for us and there 
was no justification for antagonising her." The Commonwealth Summit 
suspended Nigeria over the November 10 execution of nine of its citizens 
convicted for murder. They included the author Ken Saro-Wiwa. 
   The Gambia was said to be the only African country that voted against 
the Commonwealth action on Nigeria. 
   Nigeria has troops in Sierra Leone, helping the government fight the 
four-year-old war against the rebel Revolutionary Front. Bio has visited 
Nigerian military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha to condole him on the recent 
death of eldest son, Ibrahim. He died whenthe presidential jet in which 
he was travelling crashed.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leonean soccer lovers have expressed 
disappointment at their country's elimination from the ongoing 20th 
Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa. 
   Freetown residents wore long faces Thursday after Zambia trounced the 
Leone Stars 4-0 Wednesday in their last group match to send the Sierra 
Leoneans on an early exit from the tournament that had provided a 
welcome diversion from the political crisis at home. Sierra Leone saw 
yet another military coup on January 16. The Stars had beaten Burkina 
Faso 2-1 in their opeining match, with 16-year-old Mohammed Kallon 
showing a lot of promise. Their 2-1 loss to Algeria in the second match 
had still left fans with some hope until the Zambians nailed the Stars' 
coffin.

Nigeria Alert Over Reported Hazardous Waste Import

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria has put its customs and immigration units on 
a red alert over impending delivery of a consignment of hazardous waste 
ordered by an unnamed firm. 
   Officials said here Friday the warning had been received by the 
Transport Ministry, which in turn directed the customs services to take 
action. All the area comptrollers have been instructed "to beef up 
surveillance and put officers on red alert" to foil the attempt to 
smuggle the waste into the country, the officials said. 
   The port health division is also said to be taking precautionary 
measures. Details of the alleged waste and the importer have not been 
given, for what officials called "diplomatic and security reasons." 
   Nigeria was a victim of toxic waste dump by an Italian firm in 1988. 
The dump in Koko, midwestern Nigeria, sensitised the country and put her 
in the forefront of international anti-dump campaign. Nigeria set up the 
Federal Environmental Protection Agency following the incident.
   A year later, Abuja promulgated a tough decree, prescribing life jail 
for any person convicted of importing hazardous waste into the country. 
Collectively, African coutries also adopted the Bamako Convention 
forbidding the trans-boundary transportation of toxic wastes.

Hundreds Of Bank Debtors To Face Trial

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   LAGOS, Ngieria - At least 337 major debtors of 12 failed Nigerian 
banks are to face trial under a new government decree, officials said 
Friday. 
   Prominent politicians, businessmen and traditional rulers are said to 
be on the debtors' list kept by the Nigerian National Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, charged with debt recovery. 
   More than six billion naira are said to be involved in the 12 
insolvent banks (85 naira =1 USD). Details and names of the affected 
people or commencement of trial were not available, but prosecution 
lawyers are said to have been provided with the list. A new decree to 
stem a spate of bank failures in the West African country, prescribes up 
to 21 years inprisonment for a convict, in addition to hefty fines. 
   Five special tribunals are currently trying the chief executives of 
the failed banks. Bank sources say more than 120 of the bank chiefs are 
in detention awaiting trial. 
   Many of the banks floated during the heady days of "easy money," have 
fallen foul of government's new strict regulation to sanitise the 
banking and finance industry.

Zimbabwe and Ethiopia
Case Involving Mengistu Put Off

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - A Harare regional magistrate said Friday that the 
man charged with trying to kill former Ethiopian strongman Mengistu 
Haile Mariam would have to stand in court, even without a defence lawyer 
because his trial had been repeatedly postponed. 
   Regional Magistrate William Cutler told Abraham Kinfe, 35, that his 
case was dragging for too long. Kinfe was charged in November 1995 on 
two counts of conspiracy to attempted murder and of illegal possession 
of arms of war, Kinfe, who is still looking for a lawyer to defend him, 
was remanded in custody to February 2. 
   Kinfe, an Ethiopian, wanted to assassinate Col Mengistu to revenge 
the alleged killing hundreds of people during his rule. There was tight 
security within and outside the court, with an armed policeman sitting 
inside. 
   Kinfe said his interpreter was not translating accurately what the 
magistrate was saying. 
   The trial was postponed for seven days in November 1995 after an 
application by Kinfe's lawyer, Tinofara Hove of T.K. Hove and Partners, 
that his client needed medical examination. 
   The trial was again postponed after another application in which Hove 
said there were outstanding issues which needed redress. In both cases 
the regional magistrate granted the applications with some reluctance.

86 Foreigners Deported Over Alleged Fraud

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerian immigration authorities deported at least 
86 foreigners suspected of financial fraud in 1995, officials said 
Friday. 
   Immigration Spokesman Bayo Afolabi said 112 Nigerians were also 
denied foreign trips during the same period, over alleged dubious 
practices including possession of forged passports. 
   The new director of the immigration service, Sahabi Dange, spoke 
recently of an intensified drive to help curb the advance fee financial 
scam known as locally as "419." Nigerian and foreign businessmen have 
fallen victim of the practice, which has brought international disrepute 
to the already politically troubled West African country. 
   However, Nigerian officials say it normally takes the citizens and 
their foreign collaborators to commit the crime. Officials have urged 
diplomatic missions in Nigeria to advise their nationals to follow 
appropriate procedure when doing business in Nigeria. Immigration 
officials also say some citizens of other African countries of forging 
Nigerian passports for the commission of crimes, for which Nigerians are 
being blamed. It is not clear from which African countries there 
criminals are from.

Foreigners To Invest More

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Foreign investors pumped in over 1.1 billion 
Zimdollars (about 122 million USD) between June 1993 and December 1995 
following government decision to open up the Zimbabwe Stock exchange to 
foreign investors. 
   Total foreign purchases since June 23 1993 totalled 2.15 billion ZD 
(239 million USD), while the net inflow was about 1.119 billion ZD (124 
million USD), market analysts said on Friday. Quincor Stockbrokers said 
in their January bulletin the stock market, once dubbed the world's 
worst performer in 1992/93, had recovered during the past three years 
and was last year ranked third best performing stocks in emerging 
markets by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). "Over the past 
12 months, the market has had its ups and downs. 
   In general, the mining index moved in sympathy with the industrial 
index. The first three months of 1995 were bad for Zimbabwean equities, 
but both sectors rallied from intra-year lows in march to reach all-time 
record levels in October," the company said. 
   However, the market was in 1995 affected by a rash of poor results 
released by quoted companies, particularly during the last quarter of 
the year, which showed the negative effects of the 1994/95 drought, 
Quincor said. "The last batch of poor results and announcements 
depressed sentiment, but none were a surprise to the market. 
   Overall, the market is looking fairly valued on the prospect of 
reasonable rains," it said. Quincor predicted the market will this year 
benefit from a good rainy season, which would see the key industrial 
index breaching the 4,800 level for the first time. 
   Meanwhile, the industrial index on Friday reached an all-time high of 
4,257, having gained 24 points on the back of active trading during the 
morning. Minings, however, remained unchanged with reasonable turnover 
in key counters. 
   The index close nine points up at 1,341.43 points.

Lesotho
King Moshoeshoe II Buried

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   MASERU, Lesotho - Several leaders from Southern Africa joined 
thousands of mourners Friday in paying their last respects to King 
Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho who was buried Friday. 
   The King was buried at the national mountaintop shrine of Thava 
Bosiu, outside the capital Maseru, at a ceremony attended by presidents 
Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Frederick 
Chiluba of Zambia and Sir Khetumile Masire of Botswana. 
   Masire, who spoke on behalf of the other leaders, described King 
Moshoeshoe as "an illustrious son of Africa", adding: "The whole of 
Africa, as well as the world at large, have suffered an enormous loss." 
   King Moshoeshoe, 57, and his driver were killed when his car went off 
a Maluti mountain road January 15 early in the morning. The vehicle 
rolled down the mountain for about 500 metres before coming to a halt. 
He had gone to inspect his cattle posts. 
   Pathologists who examined the King said he suffered multiple rib and 
head fractures. A member of the royal family dismissed rumours that the 
King Noshoeshoe had died because of foul play. "The royal family is 
satisfied that his majesty left to join his ancestors because his time 
had come. Any claims and counter-claims and questions are, therefore, 
not true," said Chief Masupha Seeiso, the King's brother. 
   King Moshoeshoe was a constitutional monarch who wielded no legal 
powers. He was enthroned in 1960, succeeding Queen Regent Mansebo 
Seeiso. He was dethroned in 1990 after a coup d'etat by Maj. Gen. 
Justine Lekhanya and replaced by his son, King Letsie III, under the 
orders of the military. 
   In turn, King Letsie staged a royal coup in 1994, ousting the 
government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle and immediately suspending 
the constitution. However, the action received international 
condemnation and the coup was reversed in less than a month following 
the intervention of the leaders of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. 
   Letsie, however, only abdicated after promises that his father would 
be reinstated. 
   King Moshoeshoe returned from exile in Britain in 1993 when the 
military ruler at the time, Maj. Gen. Elias Ramaema surrendered 
government to civilian rulers. King Moshoeshoe regained his throne on 
January 25 1995. 
   Crown Prince David Mohato Bereng Seeiso, 32, [King Letsie III] is 
expected to succeed his father at a date to be announced.

Comoros
President Djohar Returns To Moroni

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - President Siad Mohamed Djohar returned to 
Moroni Friday, accompanied by a delegation of the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), according to a statement released by the 
continental body on the same day in Addis Ababa. 
   The return of the Comorian leader after several months in "forced 
exile" in the island of Reunion followed an agreement reached earlier 
this week between the country's political parties at a conference held 
in Madagascar under the auspices of the OAU. 
   He was taken to the island by French troops who put and end to a 
military take over of the Moroni government by mercenaries headed by Bod 
Denard in September 1995. 
   "Djohar and the OAU delegation headed by Assistant Secretary General 
Vijay S. Makhan, were welcomed on arrival in Moroni by Prime Minister 
Caabi El Yachroutu of the national unity government of Comoros and 
members of his government," the release said. 
   The OAU brokered an agreement with the Comorian parties at meetings 
held in Antananarivo on January 21 and 22, which provides for the 
holding of free and fair elections on March 6 and 16, under the 
supervision of the OAU and the United Nations. The OAU delegation 
currently in Moroni will hold a preliminary meeting of the follow-up 
committee with participants of the Antananarivo conference. 
   It will also be attended by observers from the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and France who are currently in Moroni. 
"This Committee which is provided for in the Antananarivo agreement is 
responsible for the implementation of the clauses of the agreement", the 
OAU statement said.

Nigeria and Gambia
Bilateral Pact To Set Up Youth Scheme

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria is helping Gambia set up its youth service 
scheme under a new bilateral pact, officials said Friday in Abuja. 
   Six senior officials of Nigeria's National Youth Service Corps, set 
up in 1973, have been seconded to Banjul on the programme based on a 
1994 request by the Gambia, the officials said. A director of Nigeria's 
corps, Grey Anegwea, now assumes that position of the Gambian Youth 
Service Scheme, which started last week. 
   Nigeria's corps, under which fresh university graduates serve one 
year in parts of the country other than their own, is designed to 
promote national unity and integration in the country of 100 million 
people with diverse ethnic groups. About 500,000 people have passed 
through the programme, launched under by former military ruler Gen. 
Yakubu Gowon, after Nigeria's civil war that ended in 1970. 
   Nigerian Youth Service Corps officials say the first intake of the 
Gambian service is expected to be mobilised at the end of the 1995/96 
academic year. The director-general of Nigeria's service, Col. Soyemi 
Sofolufe, says Nigeria is prepared to assist other African countries 
that have an interest in setting up a similar programme.

Liberia and United States
U.S. Envoy Commends African Peace Force

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent

   UNITED NATIONS - United States Ambassador to the United Nations 
Madeleine Albright has called on the international community to support 
the African Peace Monitoring Group in Liberia, or ECOMOG, in its efforts 
to end years of civil war. 
   Speaking at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Liberia Thursday, 
Albright commended the force and its field commander, Brig. Gen. John 
Inienger of Nigeria, for his determination to carry out its mandate. 
   "Overall, at least for now, I found Ecomog performing well," she 
said. "They seem to be playing a neutral and constructive role now, as 
opposed to various times in the past." 
   ECOMOG was sent to Monrovia in 1990 by the 16-nation Economic 
Community of West African States (Ecowas). The peacekeepers were shelled 
on their ships in their first attempt to come ashore. The force was 
enlarged at one stage to include troops from the East African states of 
Tanzania and Uganda. They withdrew due to a delay in the peace process. 
   Albright said, "despite Ecomog's losses in recent weeks, I was 
impressed by Gen. Inienger's resolve to move forward in the face of 
adversity." 
   She added, "We [the U.S.] believe Ecomog deserves our support." 
However, she said that Ecomog's force structure should be more 
diversified among member states of the region if it is to constitute an 
authentic regional peacekeeping operation worthy of international 
support. "We also believe that Ecomog must enter into a status of forces 
agreement with the Liberian National Transitional Government so that 
Ecomog's operations in Liberia are appropriately regulated," she said. 
The deployment of Ecomog across Liberia in December 1995 was made 
possible by the 10-million-dollar pledge by the U.S. to assist the force 
logistically. "
   The vehicles Ecomog desperately needs to facilitate disarmament and 
demobilisation have begun to arrive under the 10-million-dollar pledge," 
she said, and said other countries should help. Nigeria has the largest 
contingent in Ecomog. The force, along with the U.N. Observer Mission in 
Liberia is expected to monitor the implementation of the Abuja 
Agreement, signed by the Liberian warring factions in August. 
   The agreement is widely seen as a last-ditch effort to end the six-
year civil war, which has claimed 150,000 lives and sent half of the 
country's 2.5 million people to seek refuge in other countries.

Zambia and Rwanda
Trial Preparations for Genocide Suspects

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent
 
   LUSAKA, Zambia -  The Rwandese government has trained more than 300 
magistrates, prosecutors and other court staff to help try suspected 
perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in that country.
   Rwanda Foreign Minister Anastase Gazana said in Lusaka Wednesday that 
his government will try some of the genocide suspects under a United 
Nations mandate which in 1995 set up the Rwanda International Genocide 
Tribunal to bring the culprits to book.
   He said that under the tribunal's terms of reference governments, 
including Rwanda itself, had the powers to try anybody suspected of 
involvement in the genocide in which an estimated 1,000,000 Rwandese 
died and millions of others forced to flee for safety.
   Gazana arrived in Lusaka Tuesday to brief Zambian government 
officials about the identity of some of the suspected authors of the 
genocide who are believed to be hiding in Zambia.
   A team of experts have arrived in Arusha, Tanzania, to prepare for 
the trials by the tribunal chaired by South African Judge Richard 
Goldstone.
   The tribunal is expected to start hearing evidence by March, 
according to Gazana.
   Rwanda has appealed to the international community to turn over to 
the tribunal any suspects who might have taken refuge in foreign 
countries.
   Gazana Wednesday handed the Zambian government a list of some 500 
suspects including former Justice Minister Agnes Ntamabyaliro who is 
suspected to be in Zambia.
   Lusaka said it detained some suspected Rwandese fugitives who would 
be handed over to the tribunal.
   Gazana said his government was not particularly interested in 
securing death sentences for the suspects but that it was necessary that 
"justice" was done.
   "We are not particularly looking for death for the perpetrators (of 
the genocide), we want justice to be done in order to reconcile those 
who had been wronged".
   Victims of the genocide were mainly people of the minority Tutsi 
ethnic group and some liberal majority Hutus.
   Gazana said the Kigali government recommended that foreign 
governments who imprisoned any of the genocide suspects should ensure 
that they were excluded from prerogatives of mercy so that they could 
serve the full terms according to international law on genocide.
   Gazana who was accompanied by Zambian Justice Minister Mukabenzi 
Marthe returns to Kigali Thursday.
   He has undertaken similar missions to several other African countries 
seeking to have suspects repatriated and handed over either to the 
tribunal in Tanzania or to his government.

Rwanda
Government Calls for International Support to Rebuild

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent
  
   LUSAKA, Zambia - Nearly two years after at least one million of its 
people were massacred in an organized genocide, Rwanda is appealing to 
African and other states to support her national reconstruction and 
rehabilitation efforts.
   The appeal is contained in Kigali's foreign ministry memorandum 
entitled "The General Situation in Rwanda" after the genocide.
   The document urges the international community to pledge to take 
joint concrete actions to advance peace, justice, reconciliation, 
stability and development in Rwanda and the rest of the Great Lakes 
Region.
   " All the nations must be determined to prevent future genocide, 
ensure reconciliation with justice relating to the tragic genocide and 
massacres in Rwanda in 1994 and encourage the return of refugees to 
their home-countries," said the memorandum.
   The memorandum was issued to PANA late Wednesday by visiting Rwandan 
Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana.
   It said that among the specific actions the world community could 
undertake to assist in rebuilding the country included mobilization of 
financial resources for social and economic rehabilitation.
   Rwanda also called for the acceleration of the international 
tribunal's effort to try genocide suspects and urged all concerned 
governments to hand over suspects to the international court. 
Deliberations are expected to start next March in Arusha, northern 
Tanzanian.
   A conference in Kigali last November on the "Genocide, impunity and 
accountability: A dialogue for national and international response" 
recommended that the rehabilitation process in Rwanda should include 
reconstituting the moral, physical, socio-economic and psychological 
values of the survivors of the genocide.
   Kigali has set restoration of education, justice, agriculture, health 
and repatriation of refugees as among the priorities in the national 
reconstruction and rehabilitation process.
   Rwanda also recommended to the international community to set up a 
genocide compensation fund for the genocide victims.
   The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government estimates that 1.5 
million of the two million refugees who fled to neighboring Burundi, 
Tanzania and Zaire have returned to the country and were currently being 
rehabilitated.
   But reports from the Burundi-Tanzania border indicate an outflow of 
Rwandan Hutu refugees from Burundi to escape attacks from Bujumbura's 
Tutsi-dominated army.
   The Hutu refugees fled into exile fearing reprisals from the mostly 
Tutsi RPF, which took power in Kigali in July 1994.
   The RPF, mainly composed of sons of Uganda-based Tutsi exiles, had 
been fighting the army of the late Rwandan President, Juvenal 
Habyarimana, since Oct. 1, 1990.

Nigeria
Population Hits 100 Million

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - The population of Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
state, has hit the 100 million mark, the country's National Population 
Commission has said.
   A 1991 census by the commission put the country's population at 88.5 
million with annual growth estimate of 2.83 percent.
   Commission's spokesman Ahmed Hameed told journalists in Lagos that 
based on the growth rate Nigeria's population had reached 100 million by 
December 1995.
   The World Bank and several United Nations agencies estimate the 
country's population at more than 100 million.
   The 1991 figure stirred much controversy, with some states claiming 
they had been under-counted.
   The commission has, however, said the protests could not invalidate 
the census, Nigeria's first in almost 20 years.
   Censuses are a sensitive subject in Nigeria, a politically polarised 
federation of diverse ethnic groups.
   Groups said to have larger populations often demand a greater share 
of the national cake.
   Hameed said the population commision plans another head count in 
2001, adding that at least three years of preparation would be needed to 
ensure reliable data is obtained.

Liberia
Boutros-Ghali Urges Extension of UN Mission

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent
 
   UNITED NATIONS, New York - United Nations Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has asked the Security Council to extend the mandate of 
the United Nations mission in Liberia for four months, despite the 
setback in the peace process caused by recent fighting in parts of the 
country.
   In his latest report to the council on the U.N. Observer Mission in 
Liberia (UNOMIL), he recommended that the mandate, which expires at the 
end of this month, be extended until May 31.
   The UN chief said "during this period, I expect the LTG (Liberian 
National Transitional Government) and faction leaders to provide their 
full cooperation to ECOMOG and UNOMIL in stabilizing the situation and 
in vigorously moving ahead with the implementation of the Abuja 
agreement."
   He also called on the international community to reconsider urgently 
its current level of support to the Ecowas Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to 
enable it to carry out its responsibilities under the agreement.
   Boutros-Ghali described as a setback the recent fighting in 
Tubmanburg and the delay in implementing key aspects of the Abuja 
agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital Aug. 19, 1995.
   He said the "peace process suffered a setback when Gen. Roosevelt 
Johnson's wing of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for 
Democracy (ULIMO-J) attacked ECOMOG in Tubmanburg on Dec. 28 1995."
   Under the schedule of implementation of the agreement, the 
disengagement of forces was to have been completed by Sept. 26 while 
disarmament was to have started Dec. 1.
   Boutros-Ghali said "the peace process is now at a critical juncture 
and the full support of all concerned will be required to overcome the 
recent setbacks."
   He warned faction leaders that ECOWAS (Economic community of West 
African States) and the international community could not support the 
Liberian peace process indefinitely.
   Meanwhile, the UN chief has announced his intention to appoint a 
senior electoral officer to follow, on a full-time basis, the 
preparatory phases of the electoral process in Liberia.
   He said he would also send a technical mission to Liberia to consult 
with the LNTG and ECOWAS, among others, in drafting a framework for the 
observation and verification of the electoral process.
   Under the Abuja accord, legislative and presidential elections are 
scheduled for Aug. 20, 1996.
   The agreement is widely regarded as the most-promising effort to end 
the six-year fighting in Liberia, which has claimed 150,000 lives and 
displaced a large percentage of the country's 2.5 million people.

Benin
Airline Has Financial Woes

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Ali Idrissou, PANA Correspondent
   
   COTONOU, Benin - Air Afrique's board of governors holds its 87th 
session Thursday and Friday in Cotonou against a background of financial 
trouble at the airline.
   The company is trying to raise 5.8 billion cfa, out of some 15 
billion cfa (1 U.S. dollar = about 500 cfa), needed in new investment.
   Sources close to the airline said France already had given the 
company, in which it is a major partner, 9.2 billion cfa in new 
financing.
   Air Afrique in December disclosed it was in urgent need of new cash 
to sustain operations. Most of the money will go toward paying for four 
planes bought between 1991 and 1994.
   The company has serious cash flow problems. Member states owe it some 
four billion cfa in unpaid flight tickets. Air Afrique's own debt is 
estimated at at 200 billion cfa.
   According to the same sources, French and American experts have urged 
a radical restructuring of the company, including a "long term 
privatization of the company, with gradual state disengagement."
   The changes are centered on cutting costs and making operations more 
efficient.
   Foreign shareholders -- Air France, the French Development Fund, the 
West African Development Bank and DHL -- have a 49 percent of stake in 
Air Afrique.
   Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Central African Republic, Ivory 
Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Togo own 51 
percent of the company.

Soccer: Algeria's Desert Warriors In Quarter-Finals

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Randy Zormelo,PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Striker Khaled Louncini led Algeria to 
a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso in a Group 'B' clash in Port Elizabeth 
Wednesday, qualifying his side for the quarter finals of the 20th 
African Cup of Nations in South Africa.
   Louncini rocked Burkina in the second minute with a lethal header off 
a left-footed cross from Sidi Ahmed Zerrouki.
   The 'Stallions'  bounced back five minutes later but missed the 
target as Aboubabcary's close range shot went screaming centimetres over 
the bar. Half time score was 1-0 againt the stallions.
   The Burkinabe's, rejuvinated by changes at the beginning of the 
second half, dominated proceedings, making several assaults towards the 
Algerian goal.
   But Algeria struck again in the 76th minute when Louncini put 
midfielder Moussa Saib through to score the second goal.
   The Stallions of Ouagadougou pulled one back when striker Boureima 
Zonga slotted in a header off a cross from Ibrahima Traore.
   Meanwhile Zambia made mincemeat of Sierra Leone with a 4-0 drabbing 
in a wet Group 'B' match played Wednesday in Bloemfontein.
   The 1994 vice-champions were in great form with skipper Kalusha 
Bwalya scoring a hat-trick (2nd, 9th and 84th minutes). Midfielder Modon 
Malitoli completed the rout in the 88th minute.
   In Durban on the same day Angola held Cameroon to 3-3 draw in the 
Group A match. But the two sides are out of the competition.
   In the earlier Group A match played in Johannesburg Egypt upset 
hosts, South Africa, 1-0. But the victory margin was not enough to 
topple South Africa from its perch in the group. The Pharaohs are 
runner-up.
   Quarter final line-up: South Africa vs Algeria; (Johannesburg) Zambia 
vs Egypt (Bloemfontein). The other four quarter finals pairs will be 
decided after Thursday's matches.

Sierra Leone  
Rebels Declare Unilateral Cease-fire 

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
      
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United 
Front declared a one-week unconditional cease-fire in its four-year war 
in the West African country. 
   RUF spokesman Fayia Musa said in an interview broadcast late Tuesday 
that the move was in response to the peace offer from Sierra Leone's new 
military rulers. 
   He said the group ordered its units to stop "all the ambushes and 
fighting" immediately. 
   This is not the first cease-fire in the civil war, which has defied 
several peace moves including the one initiated by the Organization of 
African Unity. 
   Musa said the latest RUF offer is to allow humanitarian relief reach 
civilians in the rebel-controlled area. 
   Sierra Leone's new military ruler, Brig. Julius Maada Bio, in one of 
his initial gestures since assuming power after the bloodless coup Jan. 
16, invited the RUF to negotiate to end the war and the country's 
polititcal crisis. 
   Bio also promised amnesty for the rebels and renewed his commitment 
to democracy, saying the Feb. 26 national elections will proceed as 
planned by the man he overthrew, Capt. Valentine Strasser. 
   Musa said the group was committed to peace, but he reiterated the 
organization's demand to postpone the national elections. 
   Diplomatic sources in Freetown say both sides were to begin 
reconciliation talks that could signal the return of peace to Sierra 
Leone. 
   The diplomats say the government could agree to the rebels' request 
and postpone the polls, if only to be seen as accommodating all 
interests in the democratic process. 
   Bio heads a 17-member military ruling council. 
   Sierra Leone, with four million people, is rich in diamonds, gold and 
other prized minerals, but the civil was has devastated its economy, 
prompting successive governments in Freetown to seek foreign military 
assistance.

Somalia
Security Council Still Committed to Peace

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent
   
   UNITED NATIONS, New York - The Security Council, which voted in 1995 
to end its mission in Somalia, pledged to remain involved in the peace 
efforts, saying it takes the situation there very seriously. 
   "We do not wish the implication to be given that somehow what is 
going on in Somalia is of no consequence to us, that Somalia has been 
abandoned," Council President John Weston of Britain said after a 
discussion of the secretary-general's latest report on Somalia. 
   He also said the council supported the efforts of the Nairobi-based 
United Nations Political Office for Somalia, which is "keeping a 
watching brief on that country." 
   Weston said the council had noted the "heroic efforts" of 
humanitarian and other agencies whose presence in Somalia was doing much 
to prevent the worst tragedies from happening in the country. 
   Weston expressed the hope the emergence of regional administration in 
various parts of Somalia would lead to "new possibilities for setting up 
a proper centralized government again in that country." 
   In the report, released on Monday, the Secretary-General said the 
current situation in Somalia was characterized by "political 
instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general lawlessness." 
   He said "the political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a 
debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction 
leaders failed to honor their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 
March 24, 1994." 
   However, the Secretary-General noted that an all-out civil war, which 
many feared would follow the withdrawal of U.N. forces from the country, 
had been averted despite its lack of progress toward national 
reconciliation. 
   The Security Council, citing lack of progress in efforts to end the 
Somali conflict, withdrew the UN operation in Somalia in March

Africans Among Journalists Killed In 1995

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
   
   DAKAR, Senegal - Twenty-eight Africans were among 50 journalists 
killed in 1995, according to a survey conducted by Paris-based 
'Reporters Sans Frontiers'quoted by French 'Frequence Libre'newspaper 
Wednesday. 
   The paper attributed the high number of African journalists killed 
last year to the Algerian crisis and the conflict in the Great Lakes of 
Central Africa. 
   Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union followed with ten 
victims including five in Russia, two in Tadjikistan, and one each in 
Azerbaidjan, Croatia and the United Kingdom. 
   The American continents lost eight people -- four in Brazil, two in 
Colombia, one in Canada and one in Mexico. 
   The four other victims whose nationalities were not disclosed were 
killed in Asia.

Kenya
Government Urged to Drop Press Legislation

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
   
   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Union of African Journalists (UAJ) has appealed 
to the Kenyan government to drop plans to introduce press legislation. 
   The call was made Tuesday in Cairo by UAJ's President Mahfouz 
Elansary and Secretary-General George Odiko. 
   Speaking during the closure of a three-week seminar attended by 20 
African journalists, the two said the envisaged legislation would only 
help to suppress the media industry "making it less productive." 
   "There  are already enough laws in Kenya to deal with individuals and 
organizations so the union sees no good reason for the country to 
introduce more restrictions on the press," Odiko said. 
   The two union leaders said the proposed laws were intended to create 
fear among individuals wishing to establish independent broadcasting 
stations and media publishing houses. 
   Elansary said if the bills are passed in parliament, Kenya risked 
joining the list of countries that had muzzled the press. 
   Meanwhile, the Association of Free and Independent Press (AFIP) has 
asked Kenya's attorney-general to withdraw the draft bills saying they 
were a betrayal of his commitment to the democratization process. 
   Recently, the attorney-general published the draft 'Kenya Press 
Council Bill'which, if passed, will lead to the creation of a council 
charged with the registration of journalists and the massa media. 
   The government also published the 'Kenya Mass Media Commission' which 
is expected to regulate the operations of the mass media, including 
registration of newspapers and licencing of newspapers and broadcast 
media.

Senegal  
Mosquito Trap Raises Hope in Anti-Malaria Fight

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Aly Coulibaly,  PANA Correspondent
   
   DAKAR, Senegal - The French Institute for Research and Development 
Cooperation (ORSTOM) is currently experimenting with a mosquito trap to 
eradicate that malaria carrier. 
   ORSTOM entomologist Robert Vincent said the trap, fitted with a bulb, 
is similar to the one that his organization developed 20 years ago to 
catch tse-tse flies. 
   He said that a Dutch collegue, Bart Knols, has been studying for two 
years the effectiveness of the mosquito trap, which has also been tested 
in Tanzania for five years. 
   Among the study's goals is to find factors that make human blood 
attractive to mosquitoes. 
   So far, the researchers have found that people with smelly feet are 
more likely to attract mosquitoes at night, especially when it is hot. 
   "Heat is a physical attraction for the mosqitoes, especially when the 
human body attains 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The 
mosquitoes particularly like the feet," Vincent said. 
   The mosquito trap has an entrance but no exit. So when the malaria-
carrying insect enters, it can't leave. 
   Scientists hope to eradicate vast areas of mosquitoes, as was the 
case with tse-tse flies. 
   Recent World Health Organization figures indicate that from 1985 to 
1989, between 12 million and 22 million people suffered from malaria 
each year in sub-Saharan Africa.

Nigeria 
More Illegal Health Centres Closed

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - The Nigerian government has closed some 15 more 
illegal private health centres in an effort to rid the country of 
quacks. 
   Last October 40 such clinics were shut in Lagos, Nigeria's business 
capital. 
   The latest closures announced Tuesday were in the midwestern state of 
Edo where, as in Lagos state, a taskforce has been set up to regularize 
private medical practice. 
   Taskforce officials say some of the affected health centres were 
unregistered, while others lacked relevant personnel and equipment. 
   The taskforce in Edo said some of the closed clinics were being run 
by medical personnel in government employment, which is illegal.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Gold production in Zimbabwe in 1995 exceeded 24 
tons for the first time in more than five decades, the Chamber of Mines 
of Zimbabwe said on Wednesday. 
   An official said figures just released showed output was 53,556 
pounds worth more than 288 million U.S. dollars. 288 million. 
   Gold is Zimbabwe's foreign currency earner after tobacco. 
   The official said production had increased on a monthly basis during 
1995, with notable producers such as Cluff Resources Zimbabwe Ltd and 
Falgold leading the way. 
   Cluff, whose UK-based parent recently agreed to a takeover bid by 
Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, owns Zimbabwe's largest underground gold 
mine at Bindura, some 50 miles north of Harare, the capital.

South Africa 
New Kwazulu-Natal Peace Initiative Underway 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent
   
   PRETORIA, South Africa - A new large-scale initiative is underway to 
bring peace to South Africa's strife-torn Kwazulu-Natal province. 
   Hopes are running high here that Monday's meeting between President 
Nelson Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and African National Congress (ANA) Chairman in Kwazulu-Natal Jacob Zuma 
has set the ball rolling for a new and meaningful initiative. 
   The three leaders agreed to push for an imbizo, a traditional-style 
gathering of the Zulu nation, as the first step in the new peace drive. 
   Mandela announced after the meeting that he would be making immediate 
contact with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini to ask him to hold a meeting 
of Zulu traditional leaders as soon as possible to arrange for the 
holding of the imbizo. 
   Mandela and Chief Buthelezi would also atttend the meeting. 
   The South African president described the meeting of the Zulu nation 
as "a matter of urgency." He said neither the ANC nor the IFP could 
settle the matter through armed warfare. 
   "Only negotiations between the respective peoples can bring about a 
solution," Mandela added. 
   The imbizo is expected to be the largest meeting ever held as part of 
the peace process in Kwazulu-Natal. 
   Monday's meeting followed another bloody weekend in which at least 40 
people were killed in Kwazulu-Natal.

Zambia 
Donors Tie Aid to Good Governance 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent 
   
   LUSAKA, Zambia - Swedish ambassador to Zambia Anders Johnson Tuesday 
in Lusaka reiterated Western donor demands that the Movement for 
Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba 
maintain "good governance" as a condition for development aid. 
   Johnson said that Sweden considered that a succesful implementation 
of Zambia's economic and democratic reforms required "decisive, bold and 
skilful political management" and wide support of the people. 
   "To muster and maintain such support, burdens as well as benefits 
have to be shared among population groups in a reasonably balanced 
manner..." said Johnson when he signed for his country's 27 million 
dollars aid package to help Zambia's socio-economic and democratic 
reform process. 
   In a specific reference to the current wrangle between Chiluba's 
government on the one hand and the opposition and other pressure groups 
on the other on the best mode of adopting the country's draft 
constitution, Johnson said that Zambia deserved a constitution that 
could stand the test of time. 
   He also said Sweden expected the government would undertake orderly 
preparations for and implementation of the scheduled local government 
and general elections this year. 
   Johnson said that there was need to allow a "vibrant" civil society 
and a free press which he said were all vital to ensuring enhancement of 
democratic values. 
   Political analysts understood Johnson's remarks as an indirect and 
polite rebuff to Chiluba's government which has insisted on passing the 
draft constitution by a parliament it dominates. This is contrary to 
popular demands that it be submitted to a national constituent assembly. 
   The government has opposed a proposed march in the capital by civil 
society groups Friday to press for demands that the draft constitution 
be  passed by a constituent assembly. 
   Chiluba said last Friday while opening the 1996 session of his MMD-
dominated parliament that those agitating for a constituent assembly had 
"an axe to grind" with the government and that acceding to their demands 
would be tantamount to resorting to "jungle law" in the managment of 
national affairs. 
   Critics of Chiluba's stand on the adoption of the constitution have 
charged that the president intends to "hijack" the constitution by 
getting MMD members of parliament to pass controversial clauses in his 
favor. 
   The MMD has recommended in the constitution that only second-
generation Zambians should contest the republican presidency. 
   This has been widely condemned as an attempt to bar former president 
Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents, from the polls. Kaunda plans 
to challenge Chiluba for the presidency. 
   Some sources supporting the government recently accused Kaunda of 
prevailing on the donor community to deny Chiluba aid if he insisted on 
maligning political opponents. 
   The Paris Club donor community which last December granted Zambia 
some 800 million dollars in aid said the funds would be disbursed only 
if the community were satisfied there was a commitment to "good 
governance" on the part of Chiluba's government, among other conditions.

United Nations and Somalia 
Boutros-Ghali Decries Political Stalemate

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent  
   
   UNITED NATIONS - An all-out civil war, which many feared would follow 
the withdrawal of the United Nations forces from Somalia, has so far 
been averted but the country remains volatile, UN secretary-general 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said. 
   He said the situation in the country has been characterized by 
"political instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general 
lawlessness." 
   "The political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a 
debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction 
leaders failed to honour their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 
24 March 1994," Boutros-Ghali said in his latest report on the country. 
   He said the stalemate had caused political leaders to focus on the 
development of regional administrative structures and a peaceful climate 
in their regions. 
   "It is unclear at this point whether such regional authorities will 
be formed in most of the regions in Somalia," he said, adding that a 
central governing authority was urgently needed to take charge of the 
country. 
   Boutros-Ghali said some Somali leaders believe serious progress 
toward national reconciliation would only be possible if Gen. Mohammed 
Farah Aidid of the Somali National Alliance withdraws from Baidoa, which 
he captured Sept. 17. 
   The warlord should also to rescind his "unilateral proclamation of 
himself as 'president' of Somalia." 
   "Durable peace cannot be achieved in Somalia without a process of 
sufficiently broad-based consultations among the Somalis themselves," 
Boutros-Ghali said. 
   He said the U.N. security council might wish to reiterate its call 
for Somali parties to adopt this approach. 
   The secretary-general promised he would continue to maintain the 
Nairobi-based U.N. political office for Somalia so that it could 
continue its efforts to maintain and expand contacts with all Somali 
parties. 
   On the humanitarian front, he said the most urgent needs were food 
and essential health systems support, particularly immunization and 
measures to control the spread of epidemic diseases such as cholera. 
   "The low level of food production, continued political instability 
and other factors combine to make international assistance to somalia 
essential," he said. 
   He said U.N. agencies would continue their current programs in the 
country. 
   The U.N. Security Council, citing lack of progress in the Somali 
peace process, pulled its multi-national forces out of the country on 
March 31, 1994.

South Africa
Future Of Government of National Unity Uncertain

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent
   
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa - South African President Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress (ANC) has said it is opposed to the 
continuation of a government of national unity after 1999. 
   The ANC said Tuesdays such a government would become an obstacle to 
multi-party democracy if it became a permanent feature. 
   The ANC was reacting to the weekend call by National Party leader and 
Deputy President F.W. de Klerk for the continuation of governement of 
national unity after the 1999 general election. 
   The ANC statement said the government of national unity had been 
conceived as a necessary element in  South Africa's transition from 
apartheid to democracy. It had served the country well, paving the way 
for smooth political transition and laying the foundation for 
reconciliation. 
   But, said the ANC, multi-party democracy needed various political 
parties representing different political persuasions. While inter-party 
cooperation was a positive element, a forced coalition denied the 
majority political party the right to decide freely on how to pursue the 
best interests of the majority of the people.

   DAKAR, Senegal - The city of Phoenix, Arizona, in the Southern United 
States will host a major conference on business, trade, investment and 
exposition on Africa in April, organisers said Tuesday. 
   According to a statement released to PANA the event, billed to 
attract prominent Africans and African-Americans, will be held at the 
Phoenix Civic Plazza April 10-13. 
   "This conference will bring together the key private sector players 
that are promoting African development," said Robert Sherman, whose

   "Participants will have the rare opportunity to interact with them on 
a one-on-one basis, share ideas and experiences, explore business 
opportunities and, above all, build alliances. 
   "They will also use the opportunity to exhibit and showcase their 
products, services and technologies to vendors from Africa," he said. 
   There will be workshops on topics such as agriculture and agro-
business, capital markets and banking, education and training, energy 
development, information technology and multimedia, health care, housing 
and construction, mineral exploration and tourism, among others. 
   Panels and roundtable discussions will include Africa's investment 
and business climate, South Africa's role in fostering African 
development, strategies for sustainable development in Africa, trade and 
investment incentives for U.S.-Africa commerce, Western media and 
Africa's business image, and women in African development.

Zimbabwe 
Tall Tales of A Failed Joint Venture 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Tawona Tavengwa. PANA Correspondent
   
   KADOMA, Zimbabwe - A casual visitor to the giant National Glass 
Company plant in the Central Zimbabwean town of Kadoma would think that 
the noise coming from within is that of production machines in full 
swing. 
   That certainly is not the case. The noise is only that of local 
maintenance workers servicing the plant and oiling the wheels while 
awaiting the international chamber of commerce (ICC) in Paris, France, 
to decide the fate of the 70-million-Zimdollar (7.8 million-U.S.dollar) 
plant. 
   The factory is at the centre of a legal wrangle between the 
government of Zimbabwe through its investment arm, the Industrial 
Development Corporation (IDC), and its partner in the failed glass 
production joint venture, Romania's ROMSIT. 
   The company, hailed as the first undertaking of its kind in the 12-
nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), was commissioned 
in 1990 by President Robert Mugabe amid much publicity. 
   Soon after that, it began facing serious financial and operational 
problems which led to its closure in 1993. 
   Most of these handicaps were centred around the production of 
unusable sheet glass which occurred for several months in succession. 
   When the local construction industry rejected the glass, the company 
stopped production and switched over to marketing imported Chinese 
glass. 
   This was meant to be a temporary move aimed at meeting the basic 
overheads while solutions to its problems were being sought. But it was 
a short-lived effort. 
   During the 1992/93 financial year National Glass incurred a loss of 
41.4 million Zimdollars (4.6 million U.S. dollars) up from 19.4 million 
Zimdollars (2.2 million U.S. dollars) the previous year. 
   When the Zimbabwe government asked the Romanians to finance repair 
costs of the plant and to write off some loans, they refused. 
   This refusal sparked a wrangle which was taken to the Paris-based ICC 
in 1994 for arbitration. 
   The manner in which the IDC and ROMSIT now regard each other is a 
direct contrast to the warm and open relationship which characterized 
the early days of the venture. 
   During the early stages, 30 Zimbabweans were sent to Romania for 
specialized training in glass making. 
   Romanian consultants also came to the country in large numbers in an 
effort to transfer their expertise in glass making to locals. 
   All in all, the company employed about 180 locals and it was expected 
to produce 13,000 tons of glass sheet every year when local demand for 
such glass at the time was just between 8,000 and 9,000 tons. 
   This left a reasonable amount for export to SADC states, most of 
which were, like Zimbabwe, very excited about the venture. 
   "This represents typical technology transfer from Romania to 
Zimbabwe. We have many friends around the world who give us fish, but 
they do not want to teach us how to catch the fish. You have taught us 
how to catch the fish. We are very grateful," said Kumbirai Kangai, then 
minister of industry and commerce. 
   Today, government and IDC officials do not want to say much about the 
plant or the impending case for fear that any ill-advised statements may 
get to the ears of the Romanians, who will then use them in court when 
the Paris hearings finally commence. 
   In the meantime, a small staff of six remains at the plant, working 
as facilitators to the IDC's legal team in Paris. 
   Guards at the place confirmed that at one point just after the 
plant's closure, their services were terminated, leaving the place 
vulnerable to thieves. 
   Vital machine components were stolen during this period, prompting 
IDC management to order the re-engangement of the guards. 
   The joint venture's other major investments included a housing estate 
in Kadoma which consisted mainly of garden flats which were meant for 
its workers. 
   The sprawling estate, although now leased to a real estate agent, is 
also rotting like the glass plant, with signs of neglect all over. 
   Until the case is resolved, the houses will likely remain as they 
are, uncared for. 
   Meanwhile, the company, though long closed with very little prospects 
of ever being re-opened, still owes several companies, including the 
local authority about 1.3 million Zimdollars (144,440 U.S.dollars). 
   The authority recently took the matter to its lawyers and another 
legal wrangle might soon be in the local courts, an action that may 
jeopardize efforts to settle the original case in Paris.

Kenya Dominates East African Tea Market 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
   
   NAIROBI, Kenya - The amount of tea offered at the Mombasa auction 
registered a 17-percent increase in 1995 to reach 173.7 million 
kilograms (382.14 million pounds). 
   According to the annual tea purchases report issued by the Africa Tea 
Brokers Limited, the amount was 25.7 million kilograms (56.54 million 
pounds) higher than the 148 million kilograms (325.6 million pounds) 
kilograms sold by the action in 1994. 
   The report shows that Lipton Limited topped the list of buyers with 
purchases of 27.8 million kilograms (61.16 million pounds) followed 
closely by Vanrees limited with 20.9 million kilograms (45.98 million 
pounds). 
   Kenya continued to dominate the Mombasa auction with 155.3 million 
kilograms (341.66 million pounds) of tea sold last year. Uganda folowed 
with 8.6 million kilograms (18.92 million pounds) and Tanzania with 6.52 
million kilograms (143.44 million pounds). 
   For Uganda, this represented a two-percent drop from the 1994 figures 
and seven percent for Tanzania. Brokers were not able to establish 
reasons for the drop for both countries. 
   War-torn Rwanda which performed poorly in the 1994 season 
surprisingly recorded a 566-per-cent increase with 733,084 kilograms 
(1612.88 pounds) offered, an indication that farmers in the country were 
back to work after the bloody ethnic violence rocked the country in 1993 
and 1994. 
   Neighboring Burundi also afflicted with ethnic violence, recorded a 
37-per-cent increase with 1.7 million kilograms (3.74 million pounds) up 
from 624,000 kilograms (1,372,800 pounds) in 1994. 
   The sharpest drop of 94 percent was recorded by Malawi. 
   During last week's tea auction in Mombasa, Egypt and Pakistan 
registered strong interest in Kenyan tea joining traditional buyers such 
as United Kingdom. Sudan, Yemen and the Middle East nations are also 
showing interest in the auction. 
   But the prices of tea in the international market have been low due 
to a glut. 
   Tea is also facing stiff competition from soft drinks and other

Nigeria 
Highway Toll Commercialized

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's military government has raised fees 
payable by motorists using federal highways and contracted 25 companies 
to handle the toll collection as part of privatization of inefficient 
government agencies. 
   Works and housing minister Brig.Gen. Abdulkarim Adisa said in Lagos 
Monday the 100 percent increase covering the nation's 28 toll plazas 
comes into effect Feb. 1. 
   Trucks and luxury buses pay 50 naira as against 25 naira previously, 
while smaller vehicles have had their fee reduced from 10 to five naira 
(85 naira = 1 U.S. dollar). 
   The minister said the privatization was aimed at stemming "the high 
level" fraud that had characterized toll collection since 1978. 
   The ministry also hopes to draw on the efficiency of the private 
sector in toll collection, he added. 
   Only vehicles belonging to the armed forces, the police, road safety 
corps and other force services are exempt from paying toll. 
   However, Adisa stressed "it must be borne in mind that govenment 
remains the owner of all toll plazas and will continue to regulate and 
control their operation in order to maintain a healthy balance between 
the interest of the contractor operators and the public. 
   Until now, some govenrment workers regarded deployment to tollgates 
as a source of self-enrichment.

Soccer: Tunisian Barred For Vulgar Language 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Randy Zormelo, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Tunisian Football Association Chairman 
Nasser Benhassine was barred Monday from the touchline and changing 
rooms for using foul language as a referee at the African Cup of Nations 
games taking place in South Africa. 
   Benhassine will therefore match the final Groupe D match between 
Tunisia and Ivory Coast Thursday from the enclosed private suite of the 
Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth. 
   He is accusecd of directing "vulgar and offensive" remarks at both 
the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and South African referee 
Petros Mathabela. 
   The incident occurred during the Ghana-Tunisia clash last Thursday 
when Benhassine lost his temper because of some decision taken by 
Mathabela in the match won 2-1 by Ghana. 
   Benhassine, who heads the Tunisian delegation to the tournament, 
later apologized for his outburt but insisted he was right in objecting. 
   "I am sure the referee's mistakes were unintentional and I am sorry 
about the comments. But at least on two occasions, he should have given 
us a penalty for foul play and he didn't", Benhassine told journalists. 
   He denied having sworn at Mathaebla or CAF officials. 
   "I did not swear at any stage. I told the referee that it was a shame 
he had officiated the game so badly," Benhassine said. 
   "And I told CAF officials that I thought they had a duty to respect 
nations and appoint referees who are capable of handling important 
matches such as these. I still can't understand why they appointed him," 
he said. 
   Journalists covering the matches in Port Elizabeth have criticized 
the poor officiating by referees. 
   Benhassine is the first official to be barred from the touchline 
since the tournament kicked of Jan. 13.

Soccer: Burkina Faso Fires Coach 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Victor Tsuai, PANA Correspondent
   
   JOHANNESBURG - Burkina Faso has fired its coach for being 
outmaneuvered at the current African Cup of Nations soccer finals being 
played in South Africa. 
   Idrissa Traore's sacking came shortly before Burkina Faso's all-
important game against Algeria Wednesday. 
   Traore, axed for what the Burkinabe administration termed "poor 
results the team has achieved and bad placement of the players", was 
immediately replaced by his assistant, Calixte Zagre. 
   Burkina Faso made the announcement shortly before their departure 
from Bloemfontein for Port Elizabeth where they take on Algeria in a do 
or die battle at the Boet Erasumus Stadium on Wednesday. 
   The suspension was announced by Burkina Faso's Football Association 
General-Secretary Ferdinand Nikiema. 
   Sources within the Burkinabe team disclosed Traore and Kikiema had 
not seen eye to eye since their team arrived in South Africa on Jan. 9. 
   The relationship between the two soured more when Burkina Faso lost 
their opening game 2-1 against Sierra Leone and went on to receive a 
deflating 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Zambia. 
   Burkina Faso, however, are expected to pack their bags and leave the 
country after their game against Algeria, whether they win or lose.

Delay In Releasing Nigerian Budget Weighs Down Stock Exchange

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - The delay in releasing the 1996 budget and the 
attendant suspense is affecting activities on the Nigerian Stock 
Exchange(NSE), officials said Tuesday.
   In two weeks of trading in the new year, a total of four million 
sharesworth 15.6 million Naira were traded in 509 deals in Lagos, Ibadan 
and Kano floors of the Exchange. This marginally raised the all-shares 
index by 7.94 points to close at 5103.33 by last weekend. (85 naira = 1 
USD and 100 kobo = one naira).
   A breakdown showed that 413 deals were traded in Lagos for 3.2 
million shares valued at 14.2 million Naira compared with 299 deals for 
1.2 million shares worth 10.7 million Naira recorded on the floor the 
previous week.
   Turnover in Ibadan stood at 400,000 shares valued at 7.8 million 
Naira in 76 deals, as against 23 deals for 21,511 shares worth 300,000 
Naira recorded in the previous week.
   The Kano floor traded 400,000 shares worth 6.4 million Naira in 20 
deals compared with a previous 96,094 shares worth 1.2 million Naira in 
22 deals.
   On the Lagos floor, the second-tier securities market with a market 
capitalisation of 900,000 Naira from 1.2 million shares in 3 deals 
recorded the highest trading in volume terms.
   The banking sub-sector followed with a turnover of 800,000 shares 
worth 2.4 million Naira in 48 deals.
   In the over-all equity price movement, the bullish trading in the 
petroleum products marketing sector culminated in a "landmark price" 
recorded byFrench oil conglomerate, TOTAL. Its unit share, which opened 
at 29.78 Naira closed at 30 Naira, a historic high in the 33 years of 
the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
   Brokers hailed the development as a measure of confidence in the 
official deregulation policy.
   Some 34 other securities in the equities sector also recorded gains 
at th estock market ranging between 1 kobo and 23 kobo, while John Holt 
lost 30 kobo due to price adjustment for dividend payment.
   In Nigeria, the government usually announced the national budget on 
January 1. This was delayed in 1995 and officials say the 1996 estimates 
are not ready.
   Industrialists are not happy with the delay saying it slows down 
economic activity

Zimbabwe Expects Boom In Tobacco Prices

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Tobacco prices at this year's auctions are 
expected to be higher compared to those paid in 1995 amid indications 
the Zimbabwean crop is in demand from both local and overseas buyers, 
growers said.
   In an interview last week, Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) Vice-
President Rob Webb said prices had been on the upward trend since 
1992/93, when theyfell drastically due to over-production in the major 
growing countries.
   "The ZTA's position is that we should see an increase in prices 
compared with those achieved in the 1994/95 season considering that 
world stocks hav ebalanced and demand for our crop is high," Webb said.
   Tobacco auctions are expected to open in April and run for over 20 
weeks.
   Last year, an average price of 13.80 Zimdollars per kg (then 1.73 
USD) was paid, realising 2.336 billion ZD (then 292 million USD).
   Webb said market intelligence showed demand would come from China, a 
huge producer and buyer of tobacco, where 1.7 billion kg had just been 
produced, down from the original forecast of 2.3 billion kg.
   "So there is a shortage and we can confirm that the Chinese have come 
here in the last two months and placed firm orders with all the 
merchants," hesaid.
   This year, Zimbabwe was expected to produce about 210 million kg of 
flue-cured tobacco, slightly up from the 198 million kg sold last 
season.
   Webb said the tobacco crop was looking good and growers were headed 
for a bumper season provided the current wet weather persists for 
another eight weeks.
   Meanwhile, Webb said Brazil and Zimbabwe - the world's leading 
producers of flue-cured tobacco - were calling for a fair price for 
their crop,particularly from leading manufacturers.
   He said although the two countries were the two most expensive 
producers, they nevertheless grew a quality crop without subsidies, 
unlike farmers in the United States and Europe.
   "We are trying to talk to each other about the price we should be 
receiving from manufacturers and merchants. Our basic message to 
Brazilian growers is that we should not expect to be paid third world 
prices," Webb, who recentlY returned from a marketing trip to Brazil, 
said.

Germany Agrees To Destroy Zambia's Toxic Waste

Panafrican News Agency
January 15, 1996 (19960115)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia and Germany have signed a one-million-U.S.-
dollar contract for Germany to destroy 300 tonnes of expired pesticides 
that have been accumulating in an agricultural depot inthe Zambian 
capital, Lusaka, since 1984.
   Environmental Council of Zambia Director James Phiri said Sunday that 
the agreement had also been sponsored by the local office of the United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the FAO.
   Zambia lacks the technology to clean up the mess and has sought 
Germany's help.
   Phiri said that the consignment would be shipped through Tanzania. 
Zambia has already sought Tanzanian permission for the transportation of 
thechemicals.
   The United Nations based Convention on Toxic Materials all but bans 
its transportation across borders. However, it allows countries without 
the appropriate technology to contract others to destroy the toxins.
   Special conditions are needed for transport. These include tight 
packaging to avoid leakage. However, completely banded is the dumping of 
the waste by developed countries in undeveloped states.
   Zambia is reported to have substantial amounts of dangerous 
agricultural waste pesticides, particularly in the countryside. The 
government said earlyi n 1996 that it would take an inventory of the 
materials and collect it for destruction outside the country.
   Zambia's deputy agriculture minister, Gibson Nkausu, had estimated 
that thejob could cost some four miliion dollars.
   Nkausu warned then that government would, in future, surcharge 
agricultura lchemical dealers and users, apart from imposing statutory 
fines for flouting environment laws in handling their merchandise.
   The latest "state of the environment report" released last week by 
the Environment Council of Zambia said that commercial farmers in the 
country used more fertilisers, on average, than those in other sub-
Sahara African countries.
   According to the report, Zambian farmers used some 450,000 metric 
tonnes of agricultural chemicals during the 1992/93 farming season 
compared to 150,000 tonnes consumed two decades ago.
   Environment officials attributed the increased consumption rate to 
government's own promotion campaign of the agricultural industry since 
the 1970s to help attain national food self-sufficiency.
   The report noted that the use of chemicals had also contributed to 
soil acidity in areas and poisoning of some water catchments.
   Zambia imports almost 90 percent of the country's chemical 
requirements for agricultural and health purposes and it is estimated 
that 200 different pesticide trade names are currently in use.
   Zambia's environment council has said that lack of legislation on the 
importation of the chemicals had sometimes led banned pesticides coming 
into the country, thereby endangering environment, man and animal.

Donors to Fund Africa's Anti-Onchocercosis Project

Panafrican News Agency
January 17, 1996 (19960117)
by Mbakou, PANA Correspondent

   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - The Africa Regional Director of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), Dr. Ebrahim Samba says he has convinced donors to 
continue financing the continent's anti-onchocercosis programme until 
theyear 2007.
   Speaking at a news conference at the WHO regional office in 
Brazzaville,Congo, Samba cited the World Bank, the United Nations 
Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture of Organization among 
donors which have shown interest in funding the programme.
   The UN health agency will be the executing body, added Samba, who was 
coordinator of a highly successful river-blindness eradication project 
in 11West African countries before he became WHO regional Director in 
1994.
   He said the new project estimated to cost of 120 million U.S dollars, 
will cover 16 African countries.
   Samba spoke to newsmen after a long tour of Europe, the United States 
and several African countries. He said the donors had also pledged to 
provide drugs, particularly ivermectine, to all the countries involved.
   He commended the emerging new partnership with U.N agencies, 
particularly the Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, the 
Fund fo rPopulation Activities (UNFPA), the International Labour 
Organization and other bilateral cooperation agencies in combating the 
incapcitating disease.
   According to figures released here, river blindness afflicts 18.5 
million people in 27 African countries.
   The debilitating disease, which affects rural dwellers, is spread by 
a small but aggressive black fly which breed on the banks of fast-
flowing rivers.
   The female fly lays its eggs in the eyes of human beings, infecting 
and sometimes disfiguring the skin around the eyes.

Nigerian Authorities Link Bread To Cancer

Panafrican News Agency
Janaury 16, 1996 (19960116)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Bread was never in short supply on the breakfast 
table of many Nigerians until economic recesssion set in several years 
ago.
   But as austerity began to bite harder, loaves have gone thinner, 
although they cost thrice the normal price, and beyond the reach of the 
average Nigerian.
   But there is new twist to the availability of this erswhile staple, 
once regarded as the common man's food.
   Health and Food Administration officials have issued a warning that 
Nigerians risk contracting cancer through eating bread.
   At the centre of the controversy is a chemical known as "potassium 
bromate,"which bakers use in the treatment of flour.
   Nigeria's Food and Drug Administration agency was the first to raise 
an alarm on the chemical. The health warning is now echoed by the 
standard organisation of nigeria.
   Negotiations between the organisation and the Flour Millers 
Association is said to have broken down, with the warning from the 
organisation it might be forced to close down flour mills that fail to 
stop the use of the dangerous chemical.
   The millers are asking for a grace period of between six months and 
one year to phase out the use of the chemical.
   But the Director-General of the association Joseph Abalaka says this 
is too long and unacceptable, adding that an alternative, ascorbic acid, 
is available.
   He says "we cannot afford to risk the lives of Nigerians by allowing 
another six months of grace for the injection of cancer-causing agent."
   PANA has learnt that another round of negotiation has been called to 
end the deadlock.
   Despite being more expensive, some Nigerians say they cannot do 
withoutb read. The mills closure would unleash scarcity and make the 
commodity even more expensive.

   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Kenya government is to offload another 20 
percent of its shareholding in the National Bank of Kenya later in 1996.

   The shares were sold for 10 shillings each for a minimum of 500. 
[56.02Shillings = 1 USD].
   The share price has since appreciated reaching 31 shillings a share 
in the last 12 months.
   After the floatation, the government will have 22 percent stake and 
the public 40 per cent.
   The National Social Security Fund will have 37.5 percent stake in the 
bank.
   The bank's Executive Chairman, John Simba, said its profit jumped 
from 429.2 million shillings in 1994 to 633.3 million shillings in 1995.

Gabon Secures 77 million Dollars Loan from ADB

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   DAKAR, Senegal - The Board of Directors of the African Development 
Bank (ADB), has approved a loan amounting to 53 million UA (about 77 
million dollars) for the funding of a major road project in the central 
African state of Gabon.
   The amount, mobilised from the resources of the bank's soft loan 
affiliate, the African Development Fund (ADF), carries a variable 
interest rate and is repayable within 15 years after a 5-year grace 
period, the ADB said in a statement.
   It involves rehabilitation of the Franceville-Laleyou road and the 
upgrading and surfacing of another stretch between Laleyou and 
Lastoursville in the south-eastern part of the country.
   The project forms part of the bank's development strategy in Gabon 
which aims at diversification of the economic sector through promotion 
of agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism.
   The ADB has so far undertaken 25 operations in Gabon at a total cost 
of 528.9 million UA (about 808 million dollars), in 21 projects, two 
structural adjustment schemes and studies.
   Initiated in 1963, the resources of the Abidjan-based bank is 
currently estimated at some 33 million dollars.
   The bank group is owned by 52 African governments and 25 non-African 
countries.

Traditional Medicine Becoming Popular in Zimbabwe

Panafrican News Agency
January 17, 1996 (19960117)


   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - High medical fees and the rising cost of 
drugsare forcing many Zimbabweans to resort to traditional medicine, 
which in the past was regarded as primitive.
   A combined traditional and conventional medical clinic, which started 
as a nexperiment soon after independence in 1980, reported an upsurge in 
the number of people seeking treatment in 1995.
   In an interview here, founder member and co-ordinator of the clinic, 
Barbar aSibanda, said 1995 was a busy year as patients, whose ailments 
modern medicine would have failed to cure, took to the clinic whose 
charges were lower than other health institutions.
   "Though I cannot give figures, the workload was more than what we 
expected.A lot more people are now aware of our services which have 
produced goodr esults," said Sibanda.
   The clinic, which pioneered the use of traditional herbs and modern 
medicine under one roof, has since opened a 20-bed maternity wing and a 
rural clinic in Chief Sigola's area in Matebeleland, South Western 
Zimbabwe.
   Patients have the choice of being treated by a medical doctor or 
traditional healers.
   Sibanda said the experiment had over the years proved that the two 
systems could be integrated to treat difficult diseases like mental 
illness, cancer, infertility and reversal of symptoms of the deadly 
AIDS.
   "Since we opened, we have never recorded any deaths of patients 
during the course of treatment. Our success rate rate is almost 100 
percent," she said.
   Dumezweni Sidambe, who heads the traditional section, which includes 
mid-wives, said infertility was a growing problem among young couples.
   He attributed it to over use of contraceptives at an early age, 
saying by the time they decided to have children, damage would have set 
in.
   "We have assisted hundreds of couples whose marriages were on the 
verge of breakdown to have children. Although we cannot claim to cure 
aids, we can safely reverse the symptoms," said sidambe.
   Sibanda said the clinic also ran a spiritual/faith healing section to 
cater for Christian believers and a free health advisory service.
   "We also have plans to open a herbal pharmacy and add a theatre to 
our maternity wing," said Sibanda.

Africa-at-Large
Weekly Press Review

Panafrican News Agency
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent


   DAKAR, Senegal - Nigeria's withdrawal from Africa Cup and Yemen's 
"war" with Eritrea were among the most important editorials in the 
African press since the New Year started.
   The privately-owned Lagos newspaper, The Guardian, gave several 
reasons for Nigeria's demands for security guarantees for its players 
but also pointed to the path Abuja should take with regards to Nigeria's 
participation in the tournament. 
   "No responsible government would expose its citizens to clear and 
present dangers over which it has been forewarned,"itsaid.
   For example, it said, since the Munich massacre of its athletes in 
1972, Israel "has constantly"asked for such guarantee. 
   No government, it said, could legislate against snippers and going to 
South Africa would amount to taking risks. 
   "But what is wrong with that against the pledge by South Africa? We 
ought to take South Africa for her words for such guarantee would oblige 
her government to bend over backwards to guarantee the safety of 
Nigerians,"it said. 
   By withdrawing from South Africa '96, the government has also shown 
that "it no longer feels safe"in the world.  
   "That this is even happening to us in Africa makes itall the more 
shameful and worrisome. This is why South Africa '96 ought to provide an 
opportunity for some soul-searching,"itsaid.
   It wondered why Nigeria had become so unwanted. Why this nation, 
which used to be touted as "The Giant of Africa,"now felt so unsafe even 
within the continent ?. 
   "The solution to all this is for the government to urgently take 
steps that will bring it back to the internationa lcommunity, it said. 
   "The government should consider rescinding the withdrawal because our 
participation offers opportunities for Nigeria and South Africa to move 
closer to understanding and rapprochement on the diplomatic front. The 
implications of ourwithdrawal are not in our interest."
   This view was shared by another privately-owned Lagos daily, the 
Vanguard. 
   "If the point government wants to make is about the safety of our 
players, we believe it has been made and the South African authorities, 
CAF and FIFA have taken notices of it. 
   "The logical thing now is for us to be in South Africa,so that the 
Super Eagles can fly the nation's banner as the continent's defending 
champions,"it said. 
   In Addis Ababa The Monitor commented on the insecurity in the Horn of 
Africa, the most recent example being the two-day battle between 
Eritrean and Yemeni forces on the Hanish Islands. 
   "Unless urgently settled the recent Asmara-Sanaa controversy has the 
potential to degenerate into a large-scale crisis involving other intra 
as well as extra regional actors,"it said. "And this must not be allowed 
to happen under any circumstance."
   It warned: "Once a minor conflict goes out of control,the price that 
would be paid to restore the equilibrium would be extremely painful. 
Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia should serve as living reminders that there 
is no dividend to be reaped from aconflict."
   Dakar's Sud Quotidien focused its attention on the change of prime 
minister made by Mauritania President Maouya Ould Taya. He got rid of 
the youthful Sidi Mohammed Ould Boubacar for Cheikh Alavia Ould Mohamed 
Khouna. 
   Why? 
   "To prepare better for the next elections,"it said. 
   Another reason, it said, was because of the recent poor relations 
between Libya and Mauritania: Ould Boubacar is considered a Libyan 
sympathiser and an adherent of Kadaffi's Green Book. 
   Ould Boubacar's departure became imminent, it said, when his 
potential rival and former Interior Minister Lemrabott Ould Sidi 
Mahmoud, returned to government. 
   Behind all this, it said, was Taya's wish to balance the power among 
the regions of the country. The appointment of a native of the Eastern 
Region as prime minister replacing one from the Central Region, it said, 
was "a clear demonstration of this."
   The Eastern Regions, the most populated parts of thecountry, voted 
largely for Taya during the 1992 presidential elections. But it noted 
that the electorate here, in part, joine dthe opposition during the 
municipal elections of 1995. This shift and the gains by the opposition 
in the strategic region, it said, explained Taya's choice. 
    Notwithstanding the effort to appease voters in the east, it said 
"few changes are expected in the current cabinet so as not to 
frustrate"other communities. Three months after being unbanned by 
Nigerian military rulers, the National Concord newspaper of detained 
millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola, returned to the newsstands 
Tuesday. 
   In a front page editorial entitled "A New Start, A New Resolve,"the 
Concord said it was returning to the newsstands as a "beneficiary of an 
official reprieve of sorts." The daily said that it had been banned for 
18 months along with other titles of the Concord Press "without reason 
and without recourse to the due process of law."
   Saying it was glad to rejoin the "front ranks of the Nigerian 
press,"the Concord, however, said it did not "regard the unbanning as a 
special favour to be reciprocated with a show of remorse and 
contriction, but as belated undoing of what should not have been done in 
the first place."
   In its 15 years of existence, the paper said, it had"consistently 
championed the ideals of a free and responsible press". 
   Nigeria, it said, needed to make rapid progress toward democracy. 
   "The fundamental truth,"it said "is that without democracy, there can 
be no self-actualisation of the citizens, no public accountability, no 
good government and, ultimately no meaningful development."

January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - To improve corporate governance of Zimbabwean 
companies, the country's Institute of Directors (IOD) plans to introduce 
and enforce an acceptable code of conduct.  
   The IOD is a non-profit, voluntary body established to promote 
excellence, enterprise and integrity in directors of companies.   IOD's 
Executive Director, John Dittrich said Tuesday his group would work with 
such organisations as the Zimbabwe stock exchange to promote good 
business ethics in line with international trends.   "We want to promote 
the establishment of audit committees to ensure that management is 
cultivating good ethics," Dittrich told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News 
Agency.  
   He said the IOD would study far-reaching recommendations made in the 
United Kingdom by the Cadbury report, which called for more transparency 
in the running of publicly quoted companies.  
   "As we progress, there is going to be greater awareness of the real 
responsibilities of a director: to make them understand that it's not 
just a question of sitting on a board of a company," Dittrich said.  
   Executive or non-executive directors, he said, had to appreciate the 
problems and future plans of the companies on whose boards they sat, and 
be seen to be making meaningful contributions.  
   Dittrich said among other strategies to improve corporate governance, 
the iod would hold a series of seminars and conferences where a wide 
range of issues about running a company would be discussed.  
   "We are not an examining body, but one of the features of our 
activities during 1996 will be in the area of training and seminars to 
inform people in business about their responsibilities." 
   He said the IOD would also during the year broaden its membership 
base so as to achieve a large and diversified membership of the 
institute and try to achieve effective representation of directors' 
views to government and other regulatory bodies as well as the business 
community.  
   "We want to demonstrate that we are providing members with the 
services that they need and, in that regard, developing our relationship 
with government ministries will encourage people to join the iod because 
they can derive some benefit from such membership,"Dittrich said.  
   The institute would also consult and make representations to 
government on matters affecting the Zimbabwean business companies 
particularly during annual pre-budget meetings with the Ministry of 
Finance.

Cameroon
Biya Expresses Hope

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   YAOUNDE, Cameroon - The Cameroonian President Paul Biya has expressed 
satisfaction over economic progress made by his country during the year 
1995.  
   "After several years of recession, Cameroon is back on the road to 
growth"with a 3.3 per cent rate, Biya said in an address to the 
Cameroonian nation on national radio and television.  
   Cameroon, like the other countries in Africa's Franc Zone, had a 50 
per cent devaluation of its currency in Januray 1994.  
   Biya said the devaluation had led to some recovery and state revenues 
had risen to 45 billion f cfa in 1995 as against 17 billion cfa the 
previous year (1$ US =480 cfa).  
   The liberalisation of the economy, he said, had made it possible for 
a positive trade balance.  Biya said there had also been a a 13 per cent 
increase in foreign investments in the country.  
   He reiterated his willingness to continue +the ruthless war"initiated 
in June 1995 against customs fraud and sabotage of the national economy.  
   "If recovery efforts proceed normally, the year 1996 will enable 
Cameroonians to see, at last, the end of the economic crisis,"Biya said.

   DAKAR, Senegal - Lesotho's Timothy Thahane, a loser in the bid to 
succeed Babacar Ndiaye at the the African Development Bank (ADB) in Cote 
d'Ivoire, started work Monday as vice-president for the World Bank's 
relations with the United Nations.  
   Thahane, who was the bank's secretary at the time he run for the ADB 
presidency from May to September, lost the race to the Moroccan Omar 
Mohamed Kabbaj, the Word Bank said in a communique. He will in his new 
post be charged with strengthening, coordinating and developing 
relations between the financial institution and the United Nations. The 
bank's president James Wolfenson said Thahane had been appointed "on the 
strength of his broad understanding of the of the functioning of 
international organisations.
   "Thahane is going to strengthen and increase our partnership with the 
United Nations,"he added.  
   Thahane was since April 1980 vice-president and secretary of the 
World Bank. Prior to that, he was the bank's secretary (1974-1976), then 
deputy-administrator (1976-1978) and ambassador of Lesotho in the United 
States (1978-1980).

Zambia
Foreign Reserves Dwindle 

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)
by Muengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Government expenditure on importation of famine 
relief food and debt servicing commitments have contributed to the 
depletion of Zambia's foreign reserves said by central bank officials to 
have been around only USD 220 million dollars by last November.  
   According to Zambia's central bank statistics published Tuesday, 
Zambia had USD 257 million last October but this fell to USD 219.296 the 
following month.  
   Central bank officials said in Lusaka Tuesday that December figures 
were not yet computed.  
   Debt serving over the same period increased to USD 34.million for 
November from USD 16 million the previous month.  
   Zambia is to import an estimated 1,000,000 tonnes of famine relief 
maize to meet the shortfall caused by several dry seasons.  
   The country has an external debt of USD 6 billion dollars and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December granted it some USD 850 
million as balance of payments support, debt servicing and project and 
goods and services financing for 1996.   The Paris Club donors have said 
however that disbursement of the funds is dependent on Zambia's "good-
governance"record and continued adherence to a harsh structural 
adjustment programme.   Most Zambians, whose standard of living has been 
adversely affected by a general economic decline, blame the programme 
for their current economic hardships.

Zimbabwe
Industrialists Express Economic Worries

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Industrialists in western Zimbabwe on Tuesday 
said business confidence was at its lowest level in years and warned of 
job losses as companies struggle to survive the country's harsh economic 
climate.
   "From an employment view point, its sheer gloom and despondency. 
There is so much de-industrialisation and I see more retrenchmenzs,"said 
Mr. Harding, a member of the Matabeleland Chamber of Industries (MCI's) 
labour committee. He said in an interview all of Zimbabwe's economic 
indicators were negative with many companies holding huge stocks because 
of depressed domestic demand and less competitive exports.  
   Several companies in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, were 
liquidated or forced to retrench staff last year due to a lack of export 
incentives, high interest rates and a decline in profitability.
   At least 10 companies in the region had either closed down, downsized 
or relocated to other places, according to the MCI. Most companies which 
had seen their competitiveness eroded by high wage costs would continue 
retrenching, cutting part time jobs and overtime pay, compelling 
consumers to tighten their purse strings further to cope with negative 
growth in real incomes, Harding said. 
  He said it was unlikely retrenched workers would be rehired since 
companies would be trying to produce cost-effectively.  
   "The low corporate productivity thus reduces the government's revenue 
base," he said. He predicted a trend, by cash-strapped workers, to press 
demands for better wages and salaries commensurate with the high cost of 
living.  
   The problem was that current high rates of inflation were built into 
production costs, putting basic products beyond the reach of many 
people.
   Harding said although Zimbabwe's rainfall pattern had been 
favourable, there was uncertainty on whether more rains would last for 
some time to sustain fragile recovery underway. "Besides, even if we 
have good rains, the economic effect would be felt around october or 
November,"he said.
   The MCI warned that unless measures were undertaken to encourage both 
domestic and foreign investment, the country could be "turned into a 
nation of shopkeepers rather than manufacturers".

Mozambique
More State Firms to be Privatised

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   MAPUTO, Mozambique - As part of the privatisation process in 
Mozambique, the government is selling 80 per cent of the share capital 
of a state company specialising in cold storage and air conditioning 
systems.  
   The company, Enafrio, has been valued at USD 1.6 million. It 
currently employs 144 workers and is the only company of its kind in 
Mozambique.  
   Among other state companies coming up for privatisation soon are the 
tea-processing company (Emocha), and the farm implement factory (Agro-
Alfa).   The shipyard at the central port city of Beira and Hidraulica 
de Maputo, a company specialising in irrigation systems and civil 
construction, will also be sold in the near future.  
   However, the most important privatisation this year will be the sale 
of 51 per cent of the share capital of the national commercial bank. 
This will be the first privatisation of a state-owned bank in Mozambique 
and could happen in June.   Since 1992, the Mozambican state has sold 
nealy 550 companies. Forty-five of these were large companies and 
included the country's cement factory and brewerries. Their sale earned 
the state USD 5 million.

Angola
Luanda's Tall War-Induced Environment Agenda

Panafrican News Agency
Janaury 1, 1996 (19960101)
by Peter Masebu, PANA Staff Correspondent

   DAKAR, Senegal - The guns might completely go silent in Angola in 
1996 but they will leave behind gigantic ecological and environmental 
problems. 
   Three decades of civil war, starting with the anti-colonial struggle, 
caused so much environmental degradation that no Angolan can claim to 
have escaped from its effects. 
   Angola's Director of Environment, Joao Da Costa Vintem, said in an 
interview with PANA recently that although the country is vast with a 
small population of about 10 million, many people have moved to urban 
centers, mostly located in fragile coastal lands. 
   "Most of the war-displaced people moved to Luanda, Benguela or 
Lobito, slashing trees in the surrounding areas for fuel or to create 
plots for cultivation," he added. 
   Vintem said these activities have further helped the northward 
advance of the Namib desert, which occupies a large portion of 
neighboring Namibia's territory. 
   The rural-urban exodus, Vintem said, has more than trippled the 
populations of Angolan towns including Luanda, the capital, which was 
originally meant to host 500,000 people. 
   "The huge population inflow has led to the destruction of most public 
amenities, especially urban water supply and sanitation systems. Solid 
and liquid wastes abound everywhere causing endemic diseases like 
diarrhea and cholera as well as malaria," he said. 
   Vintem hopes that the Nov. 20, 1994 Lusaka peace accord between the 
government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola, UNITA, will soon be fully implemented "so that people can return 
to their natural sites after the removal of mines, the greatest 
environmental hazard in rural areas." 
   Enormous environmental degradation has also occured in diamond mining 
areas which are now full of pits. 
   "Mining companies also diverted water from rivers leaving the 
population without water, especially in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sud," he 
said. 
   The Angolan Environment director said discussions were underway to 
ensure that the mining companies involved take part in efforts to 
restore the environment. 
   "The government has to find a way of ending the anarchy reigning in 
the mining area since the removal of restrictions on people to enter the 
area which existed under the former one party rule," added the director. 
   As a major off-shore oil producer, Angola also suffers from oil 
spills in its coastal waters, endangering the once abundant fish there. 
   The shores off the oil-rich Cabinda enclave has been so polluted that 
government had to ask the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company to help in cleaning 
up operations. The oil company has appointed a Swiss firm, which has 
taken water samples from the polluted sea coast. 
   To reverse these dangerous trends, the Department of Environment has 
asked the government to include an environment national plan of action 
among its priorities when negotiating with aid donors, the first of 
whose meeting took place in Brussels last September. 
   Vintem said approaches had also been made to the World Bank to 
finance feasibilities for an environment protection code and the 
creation of an environment information center. 
   "I know that government's priority will be the reconstruction of 
destroyed cities like Huambo, Kuito and others. But locally sourcing 
environment funds is important because the environment forms the basis 
for sustainable development," he concluded. -0-

Cameroon
Ecological War Between Humans and Elephants

Panafrican News Agency
January 1, 1996 (19960101)

   DAKAR, Senegal - Living together is more and more difficult for 
villagers and elephants in northern Cameroon as the animals pose a 
continuing menance to farms and even local housing.  
   The Conservation News Service from the World Wildlife Fund has said 
"about 350 elephants destroyed 285 hectares of crops belonging to 516 
families" in Cameroon in 1995.  
   Quoting Dourga Albert, a wildlife chief forest warden in Cameroon, 
the journal said the damage affected not less than 3 127 people, 
directly.  
   In a report for the WWF, John Nchami Tafor, said there were some 20 
000 elephants in Cameroon.  
   About 2 000 elephants (Loxondonia Africana Africana) live in northern 
Cameroon's dry savannah. They are essentialy gathered in the Waza and 
Kalamaloue national parks. The others (Loxondonia Africana Cyclotis) 
spread into southern Cameroon's thick tropical forests.  
   Relations between human beings and elephants are particularly 
strained in the dry savannah, where the situation has worsened in the 
last five years, says the WWF.  
   In July 1992, said WWf, 320 marauding elephants destroyed 5 000 
hectares of crops. This was at a time of drought and poor food security.  
   Some 22 000 people suffered from the starvation that followed.  
   Between May and November 1993, a large herd of some 850 elephants 
destroyed 1 700 hectares of millet and cotton in Mayor Kani and Mayor 
Louti districts in the north, leading to further harm to peasant 
incoomes.  
   Between May and September 1994, 400 to 500 elephants destroyed millet 
and cotton throughout the country.  
   A lack of food and water is the main source of the conflict between 
human settlements and the elephants, the WWF says. 
   It says a full grown elephant needs some 140 kgs of food (grasses, 
leaves, fruits, roots, bark) daily. It also drinks 100 litres of water 
daily and can move up to 30 kms just for a cold bath.  
   As farms and tourist camps take over their places, Cameroon's 
elephants are turning to crops to feed themselves.      
   Experts say the number of elephants in Cameroon has increased due to 
the country's adoption, reluctantly, of a global ban on trade in ivory 
in 1989.  
   "When they migrate, elephants follow a precise direction. If they 
find crops on their way they destroy them" says Hillaire Manga, a 
wildlife department head in northern Cameroon.

Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire)
Collaborative Study Launched on Ebola

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)

   DAKAR, Senegal - After the discovery of an Ebola patient in Cote 
d'Ivoire recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a 
two-year study aimed at identifying the natural host reservoir of the 
deadly virus in that country.
   The study will involve representatives of virtually every laboratory 
facility in the world "that is capable to safely handling the Ebola 
virus for study," says the U.N health agency in a news release. 
   A team of researchers will concentrate their efforts on Tai forest 
where a new sub-type of the Ebola virus was isolated from a Swiss 
primate researcher thought to have been infected in late 1994 while 
performing an autopsy on a dead chimpanzee from which the same Ebola 
sub-type was isolated.
   "The Tai forest of Cote d'Ivoire is considered to be a more conducive 
site for such investigation, as it is a well defined ecosystem that has 
been extensively studied and one where the disease is known to be 
present," the WHO release said. 
   The new study group will base their initial investigation on the 
research by the Swiss-Ivorian ethology team of which the infected 
researcher was a member. 
   "The focus of investigation is the relationship among primates, other 
vertebrates, anthropods and perhaps human beings in the region of the 
Tai forest," said the WHO press release.  Among the closest contacts of 
the chimpanzees are Colobus monkeys, which serve as a major food source 
for the chimpanzees, it added. 
   The 12-member informal working group involved in the study held its 
first meeting Dec. 15, 1995.The meeting was also attended by seven WHO 
professionals, including four from headquarters and three from the 
African region.
   Among the Africans in the research team are Dr Deogratias 
Barakamfitiye and Dr Kadri Tankari from the Brazzaville-based Africa 
Regional Office. These were involved in another study on the Ebola 
virus, which killed at least 250 people in Kikwit, Zaire between April 
and June 1995.The findings are not yet out. 
   The Ebola virus is one of the most pathogenic viral agents known to 
man, causing death in 80 percent or more of infected cases. 
   The World Health Organization said last year that it wilL hold an 
international symposium in Kinshasa, Zaire in March on the Ebola virus 
and the haemorrhagic fever it causes.

Zimbabwe
Over 150 People Regain Sight

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Over 150 residents of Gokwe in Zimbabwe's Midlands 
Province suffering from various eye disorders had their eye sight 
restored during a Raleigh International expedition between October and 
December 1995.
   In a report on Tuesday chronicling its 10-week programme of projects 
throughout Zimbabwe, Raleigh said one of the highlights of the 
expedition was organising an eye camp in the Gokwe area in which 156 
patients with cataracts and other eye disorders had their eye sight 
restored, often after years of blindness.
   A further 6,137 people in the area underwent tests to determine the 
degree of eye sight loss. 
   The free eye operations and tests were conducted in conjunction with 
the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Council For The Blind and the 
American-based Charity See International. 
   The expedition, which was Raleigh International's 13th to Zimbabwe 
comprised 10 projects and 108 participants from Britain, Hong Kong, New 
Zealand, Singapore and Zimbabwe.
   Other projects undertaken included the building of a fire tower at 
the Chilojo cliffs, Gonarezhou national park, to provide early warning 
of damaging bush fires.
   With funding from the British High Commission, Raleigh International 
started the construction of an accommodation block for 28 elderly 
residents of the Zimbabwe New Hope Home at Gatsi in the Honde valley. 
   The participants also built two new pans and repaired seven bore hole 
pump houses providing water supplies to wildlife in the Hwange National 
Park in Western Zimbabwe.

Nigeria
Doctor Researching a Male Contraceptive

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - A Nigerian doctor Nnaemeka Amobi and his British 
counterpart Christopher Smith, both of the London King's College, are on 
the threshold of a scientific breakthrough in the development of male 
contraceptive.
   According to a recent issue of the "new scientist' magazine, the 
research of the two physiologists on the unusual side-effects associated 
with two drugs --phenoxybenzamine used in the treatment of high blood 
pressure and thioridazine for schizophrenia -- has proved beneficial.
   It is common knowledge in medical circles that both drugs prevent 
ejaculation, although men who take them still experience orgasms. 
   But their side-effects such as drowsiness had made the drugs 
unsuitable for prescription as contraceptives for men. 
   The research by Amobi and Smith showed that the drugs prevent 
ejaculation by "temporarily paralysing the sperm duct muscles" 
responsible for transporting sperm from the testes to the penis," the 
magazine said. 
   The two doctors were quoted as saying the research finding could 
result in a safe male contraceptive pill. 
   They say unlike the female version, the male pill could be taken as 
and when required. 
   Smith believes the "discovery opens up a new category of 
contraceptive. It gives rise to the first chemical vasectomy because the 
drugs can control the duct using a pincer movement." 
   Amobi agrees, saying the discovery would be of great benefit to 
developing countries in their quest for effective population control 
measures. 
   Above all, he said, "vasectomies are regarded with great suspicion," 
in the this part of the world.

 PERU: PERUVIANS DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR LIMITED STAKE IN TELEFONICA SHARES 
placement

 The Peruvian government had no hesitation in acclaiming the placement of 
Telefonica del Peru shares on the New York stock exchange at the beginning 
of the month as an unqualified success. The domestic sale of shares was also 
over-subscribed, though as an exercise in 'popular capitalism', it was a bit 
of a let-down.

 The 23.5% holding that the government put up for sale raised a total of US 
Dollars 1.1bn, US Dollars 918m of it in New York, snapped up by around 500 
institutional investors. It was, as the Financial Times noted, the first big 
test for Latin American equities since the Mexican devaluation crisis at the 
end of 1994, and Peru came through it with flying colours.

 The international offering was oversubscribed by five times, even though 
the Peruvian economy had been faltering recently -presumably because 
prospects for second-half growth are generally reckoned to be good.

 The domestic offering was equally successful, with about 263,000 people 
applying for US Dollars 323m worth of shares, payable in instalments, under 
the much-hyped 'citizen's participation' scheme.

 But the international demand was so great that many small Peruvian 
applicants were cut out at the last minute, when it was decided to halve  
their allocation, to only US Dollars 148m. So much for the aim of broadly-
based, share-owning democracy.

 The ombudsman (defensor del pueblo), Jorge Santisteban, called for 'greater 
transparency' with future 'citizen's participation' offers. In an attempt to 
repair some of the damage, President Alberto Fujimori announced on 11 July 
the sale of 3% of the shares still in state hands on the domestic market. 
That will leave the government with only 2%.

 Like CANTV in Venezuela (see Page 6, inside), Telefonica has a monopoly of 
conventional telephony until the end of the century, and it has big 
expansion programmes under way, with investments totalling US Dollars 1.6bn 
by 1998. But, unlike its Venezuelan counterpart, Telefonica is the country's 
biggest company, and is likely to remain so until the Camisea natural gas 
project comes on stream.

 The Peruvian government hopes the Telefonica exercise, coming hard on the 
heels of the letter of intent accord with the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), will usher in a run of international successes for Peru. This should 
culminate in a Brady debt-rescheduling deal before the end of the year, 
which could reduce Peru's US Dollars 10bn commercial bank debt by about 
half.

 First come talks with the Paris Club on Peru's US Dollars 9.65bn bilateral 
debt, beginning in mid-July. The team led by economy minister Jorge Camet 
hopes that Peru will secure as favourable treatment as Russia earlier this 
year, including rescheduling of payments over 20-25 years.

 ECUADOR: POLITICS: BALANCING BANKERS AND INDIANS: BUCARAM WILL HAVE TO 
DEVELOP  SKILFUL POLITICAL JUGGLING ACT

 President-elect Abdala Bucaram announced a few days after his election on 7 
July that he would be flying to New York before his inauguration (10 August) 
to reassure bankers and business leaders about his intentions. This was 
probably a wise move, as his pre-election rhetoric about smashing the 
oligarchy and governing for the poor had caused a certain amount of unease 
in those spheres.

 The presence of a trio of bankers in his economic team (see WR-96-28) was 
expected to reassure his US audiences. And Bucaram adviser Jose Miguel Salem 
promised laws to encourage foreign capital to stay in the country and to 
attract new investors.

 But all this courting of the private sector raises the problem of balancing 
reassurance, on the one hand, with the expectations of Bucaram's other 
supporters, and particularly the increasingly assertive Indian movement, on 
the other.

 Decisive factor. All observers agree that the active or tacit support of 
the Indian organisations that backed Freddy Ehlers' candidacy in the first 
round (see WR-96-19 & RA-96-04) was a decisive factor in Bucaram's run-off 
victory. Indian leaders such as Luis Macas, president of the Confederacion 
de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (Conaie) and deputy-elect for Nuevo 
Pais-Pachakutik, have made clear their view that they have earned a voice in 
the new administration commensurate with their growing political importance.

 Both Bucaram and Jaime Nebot had seemed to favour the idea of Macas being 
elected chairman of the 82-seat congress, but that prospect appeared to 
recede in the wake of the second-round voting. 'We have decided not to make 
a pact with any party, but to wait and see what those parties will do and 
what their relations with the government will be, as we intend to maintain 
Nuevo Pais's independence,' said another Indian leader, Jose Maria 
Cabascango, on 11 July.

 Macas said just before the second round: 'Nebot and Bucaram represent two 
economic power groups disputing political power, to consolidate their 
hegemony. They have never identified with our struggles or our proposals in 
the past; on the contrary, they dismissed and suppressed them.'

 New political style. Conaie and other Indian organisations, such as the 
Organizacion de Pueblos Indigenas del Pastaza (Opip), have developed a 
distinctive political style, combining mainstream left-wing causes, such as 
state-ownership of 'strategic' sectors of the economy, with cultural and 
social aspirations, such as the preservation of local self-government and 
resistance to the impact of economic development in the Oriente jungles.

 This complex political articulation of highland and jungle interests adds 
to the instability of Ecuador's party structure, as it creates new 
possibilities for circumstantial alliances and splits with other 
organisations, and greatly increases the fragmentation of the centre-left 
segment of the Ecuadorean political spectrum, which accounts for about a 
third of the seats in the new congress (see box).

 Environmental issues. These factors were reflected in Ehlers' insistence on 
the importance of traditional Indian values in his election campaign, and 
particularly on environmental issues, which coincided with the viewpoints of 
middle-class ecological organisations. And the concepts of multi-culturalism 
and multi-ethnicity have become the common currency of political debate in 
Ecuador, with even the right-wing Nebot paying lip-service to such ideas.

 Two new oil-related projects have already met with fierce Indian 
resistance. Opip complained in late June that a contract with the US company 
Arco to build a 165km feeder pipeline through Indian lands had been signed 
behind their backs; and the Huaorani ethnic group protested in mid-July that 
the drilling by a three-company consortium of a well with potential 
production of 2,200 barrels per day in their territory would exacerbate the 
inflow of settlers on to their lands.

 The Huaoranis threatened to take the law into their own hands unless the 
government acted to remove the 5,000 colonos already there.

 SPECIAL REPORT ON INDIANS

 We predicted as long ago as 1994 that Ecuador's increasingly assertive 
Indian organisations would soon assume a more important political role, and 
would become a factor to reckon with in decisions on the Oriente oil 
industry. See our Special Report, Indians: New Factor on the Latin American 
Scene, June 1994.

 COSTING THE PLEDGES

 Economist Jaime Zeas has attempted to cost the various spending promises 
made by Bucaram during the election campaign. He concluded that they would 
imply expenditure of US Dollars 2.35bn, or almost two-thirds of the 1996 
budget of US Dollars 3.7bn.

 The most expensive items would be:

 Construction of 6,000km of local roads (US Dollars 450m);

 Increases in teachers' salaries and in the health and police budgets (US 
Dollars 422m each);

 Extension of social security coverage to family members (US Dollars 407m);

 Creation of banks for coffee, cacao, handicrafts, small industries and 
foreign trade, plus a ministry for Indian affairs (US Dollars 170m);

 Subsidies for rice, milk, meat and petrol, and 50% reduction in 
agricultural products (US Dollars 55m);

 Cheap medicines and free maternity service (US Dollars 35m)

 Soft credits for house building (US Dollars 20m);

 School breakfasts (US Dollars 13m);

 COLOMBIA: PRIVATISATION: FURTHER DELAYS FUEL DOUBTS: 'LACK OF POLITICAL 
WILL' HALTS US Dollars 731M ASSET SELL-OFF

 Two more failed attempts to bring the private sector into the running of 
Colombia's public assets have added to the growing scepticism with which 
analysts regard the Samper administration's commitment to its privatisation 
programme. As neither Bogota's communications company (ETB) nor Medellin's 
public companies (EPM) are national, the government has not been blamed 
explicitly, but given its past record - in 1995 only US Dollars 6.5m of a 
planned US Dollars 333m was actually sold off - critics are hardly surprised 
at the latest setback.

 It was Samper's predecessor, Cesar Gaviria, who began the 'apertura' of 
Colombia's economy back in 1989. The ensuing programme of economic 
liberalisation relied partly on extensive privatisation to boost foreign 
investment, which has increased steadily since then to a record US Dollars 
1.6bn last year, excluding petroleum. And even despite the recent political 
crisis, Colombia remains a 'stable economy' for investment, with steady 
growth and controlled inflation.

 So when Jose Antonio Ocampo, the current Director of National Planning, 
recently stated that US Dollars 30.2bn of investment was needed in 
Colombia's infrastructure between 1995 and 1998, and that 40% would come 
from the private sector, it seemed likely that privatisation or at least the 
selling of concessions in the transport, energy and telecommunications 
sectors was on the horizon.

 Reforms subsequently began in the Civil Aviation Authority, the electricity 
generators, parts of Ecopetrol and its gas subsidiaries,  and Telecom, as 
well as various financial institutions including the Banco Popular, to 
prepare them for privatisation.

 The government then scheduled for the end of 1996 the completed sell-offs 
of 4 airports, 5 companies created to transport and manage gas pipelines, a 
nickel production plant, the Banco Popular and two other financial 
corporations. In addition, the bidding processes for between 51% and 60% of 
3 hydro-electric and 5 thermoelectric power stations, as well as for two 
telecommunications' licenses worth US Dollars 150m, were all to be 
completed.

 According to Confis calculations (see graphs), this impressive list of 
envisaged privatisations will net the government US Dollars 725m in 1996. So 
with over half the year gone, critics are becoming increasingly concerned as 
to why not a single peso has to date entered the government coffers.

 While officials put the endless delays down to technical hitches, some 
critics are more blunt. As one observer commented, 'this government has no 
intention of selling because the idea of promoting private participation is 
not in their philosophy.' Clemente del Valle from the Ministry of Finance 
denied this charge, arguing that irrespective of ideology, it was reality 
that would ultimately convince the doubters of the benefits of 
privatisation.

 And to be fair to the government, there have been many setbacks. Not least 
was a constitutional court ruling last year which halted the key Banco 
Popular privatisation until the 'sector solidario' -unions, active or 
pensioned workers, employees' funds- had been guaranteed a stake. The ruling 
stemmed from a law introduced as part of Samper's own social programme which 
sought to 'democratize' state sell-offs, effectively giving first refusal on 
share offers to the 'sector solidario' and thus delaying the whole process 
by up to three months.

 Having received the final go-ahead from the council of Ministers, the Banco 
Popular privatisation is now back on track. But as one hurdle is cleared, 
another appears on the horizon, for now investors are complaining that the 
asking price of US Dollars 318m is grossly inflated.

 Similar variations of to-ing and fro-ing dog most of the government's 
privatisation plans, feeding criticism that the required political will to 
find a way through the upsets is just not there.

 Only 15% of the US Dollars 1.5bn electricity sector sell-off is to go ahead 
this year, Rodrigo Villamizar, the Minister of mines, recently announced, 
because further 'sweeteners' are needed to make it an attractive offer for 
private investors.

 But why had this not been thought of before? One analyst told Semana that 
the government treated privatisation like a simple case of placing a 
classified ad in a newspaper to sell a house, and that it was therefore 
inevitable that all these 'technical hitches' kept arising.

 Whatever the reasons for the delays, the bottom line is that the government 
has no choice but to privatise as it desperately needs the proceeds to 
finance part of its social programme. And having staked his political future 
on this programme throughout his corruption trial, Samper would be well 
advised to succeed.

 REGION: FOCUS: HOW GOOD A GUIDE ARE 'THE MARKETS'?: HEADLINES CROWD OUT 
DEEPER ANDEAN TRENDS

 To judge from the performance of the stockmarkets, investors are having no 
easy task figuring out which way the Andean economies are heading. Colombia, 
which at first had seemed impervious to the 'Tequila Effect', began to slide 
last year, and by mid-1996 was the only country in Latin America to register 
a dollar-term decline. Peru, which last year was the only country to 
approximate the high yields of the 'pre-Tequila' years, was in 1996 showing 
a first-half gain of only 16%. Venezuela, whose three-year recession has 
only just bottomed out, was by end-June showing the best results in the 
hemisphere: a dollar-term gain of 56.5%.

 The Colombian decline can be attributed largely to the political 
uncertainty, now somewhat dispelled, about the threat to President Ernesto 
Samper's tenure of office. The other reactions seem linked to 'headline' 
developments: the big privatisation deals in Peru, the imminence of a deal 
between Venezuela and the IMF.

 Despite the proliferation of sources of information about the region, and 
the acceleration of its delivery, investment decisions continue to be 
affected by headlines and news flashes: the grasp of underlying trends 
appears to be weak --indeed a recent survey of 'market operators' conducted 
by our sister service, the on-line Latin American Network, showed an 
alarming number uninterested in anything but last-minute, deal-related news.

 The problem is compounded by the slow emergence of properly analysed 
information on the underlying trends --which in the case of the Andean 
countries continue to show Colombia in the most solid position.

 From a series of recently-published studies (some of them up to two years 
in the making), the following valuable insights emerge.

 The 1980s saw the rising relative cost of capital appear as a strong 
constraint on investment: Colombia is among the few Latin American countries 
where this did not discernibly affect investment.

 In common with most of Latin America, the Andean countries have seen the 
rewards taken by capital rise far more than those of labour. In Venezuela, 
labour's share fell by 10% in 1980-90 while that of capital increased 48%. 
In Bolivia both fell, but labour's fell 1.7 times more than that of capital. 
In Colombia both rose (as also happened in Ecuador).

 Another shared Latin American trend is the declining efficiency of the use 
of capital, as measured by capital-output ratios. But over the past decade 
Colombia's decline has been only half the average for six of the largest 
Latin American economies. Since its best period, in the mid-1970s, the fall 
in efficiency has been almost four times greater in Venezuela than in 
Colombia.

 Over the past decade, Colombia was the Andean country which most increased 
the share of its GDP devoted to research and development: a fivefold rise, 
compared with only 1.2 to 1.4 times in Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela, and a 
decline in Peru.

 One area where Colombia compares badly with its neighbours is that of the 
technological upgrading of its exports. Its ITS, an index which measures the 
share of medium- and high-technology products in exports to OECD countries, 
has fallen markedly since 1980, while those of Peru and Venezuela have 
increased.

 This, however, must be seen against the fact that Colombia's export trade 
has the highest share of manufactured goods in the Andean region (indeed, 
the fourth-highest in the whole of Latin America): almost twice as much as 
Peru, two-and-a-half times more than Bolivia, almost three times as much as 
Venezuela, and eight times more than Ecuador.

 Similarly, Colombia's exports are the most diversified in the Andean 
region. Seen from the opposite end of the scale, its 'concentration index' 
has more than halved over the past decade, while those of Bolivia, Ecuador 
and Venezuela have diminished only slightly, and Peru's has remained 
unchanged.

 NOTE ON SOURCES

 The list of the top 100 publicly traded companies in Latin America, ranked 
by sales, has been published by Latin Trade, a Miami-based magazine devoted 
mainly to company news.
Other data for this article came from the following studies:

 Strengthening Development: The interplay of macro- and microeconomics 
(Eclac, 1996).

 The Manufacturing Sector in Latin America and the New Economic Model, by 
Professor John Weeks, in The New Economic Model in Latin America and its 
Impact on Income Distribution and Poverty, edited by Victor Bulmer-Thomas 
(institute of Latin American Studies, London, 1966).

 Sistemas de Innovacion y Especializacion Tecnologica en America Latina y el 
Caribe, by Ludovico Alcorta and Wilson Peres (Eclac, 1996).

 DO COMPANY RANKINGS HELP?

 Which Andean countries have publicly traded companies which rank among 
Latin America's top 100? The question was asked at a recent private meeting 
in London attended by a number of 'operators' in Latin American investments.

 No-one produced the correct answer --only one: Peru [Telefonica del Peru 
ranks 65th, Southern Peru Copper Corporation 72nd].
This position in the overall ranking can be misleading as to the relative 
sizes of big concerns in the Andean region: apart from those two companies, 
no Peruvian firm is big enough to rank among Colombia's top five, and only 
three (La fabril/Pacifico, Peruano Suiza and Gloria) would make Colombia's 
top ten.

 By comparison, two Venezuelan companies (Sivensa and Elecar) are in the 
same range as Colombia's top five, and two more (Vencemos and Mavesa) are 
within the range of Colombia's top ten.

 Colombia's top tier, with sales of US Dollars 246m to US Dollars 665m, is 
roughly comparable to the second tier of big firms in Argentina.

 The inability to pick Peru as the correct answer is unsurprising, but not 
only because that country's top two are in a category of their own: when the 
list of top firms in all three countries was checked against a well-known 
guide to Latin American companies, the 'finds' included only two of 
Colombia's top ten, two of Peru's top 15, and three of Venezuela's top five.

 VENEZUELA: PRIVATISATION: PETKOFF PLEDGES POLITICAL WILL: AFTER SEVERAL 
FALSE STARTS, SELL-OFF SHOULD SPEED UP

 When the proposed sale of the state-owned Aeropostal airline was postponed 
for the sixth time at the end of June, it did not augur well for Venezuela's 
supposedly rejuvenated privatisation programme. Sell-offs peaked in 1992, 
when 10 companies were disposed of; since then the programme has been 
languishing, with only five, six and two sales in the past three years, 
respectively.

 Confidence growing. But the Caldera government is adamant that it is 
serious about giving a boost to the undertaking, now that a deal has been 
successfully struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and prospects 
for the Venezuelan economy look more promising than for some time (see WR-
96-292).

 It is ironic that this new departure should take place under the auspices 
of a former left-wing guerrilla. But Teodoro Petkoff, the planning minister, 
has left no doubt that privatisation is a fundamental element of the 
government's economic policies (see RA-96-04), and the political will is now 
there. 

 New York presentation. The privatisation minister, Alberto Poletto (whose 
formal title is president of the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela), set out 
his stall in a presentation for potential investors in New York on 26 June. 
The biggest industrial conglomerate still in state hands is the 17-unit 
Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG); by the time the sell-off is 
completed, only three companies will still be run by CVG.

 The aluminium industry is the jewel in CVG's crown, and pre-qualification 
of bidders was to begin in July. Venezuela's is the world's seventh-largest 
aluminium producer, with an annual output of 630,000 tonnes and exports of 
425,000 tonnes. The government hopes to raise at least US Dollars 2.5bn from 
the industry's sale. Aluminium export revenues average around US Dollars 
800m.

 CVG owns four companies that take part in all stages of bauxite, alumina 
and aluminium production: Bauxilum, Carbonorca, Venalum (415,000 tonnes of 
aluminium a year) and Alcasa (210,000 tonnes). Carlos Ernesto Sanchez, 
president of Alcasa, said at the end of June that he expected the auctioning 
of all four to be completed by the first half of December.

 One of the biggest problems facing the government is to come up with an 
attractive formula for potential buyers, as the four companies have 
accumulated internal and foreign debts totalling more than US Dollars 1.2bn, 
about half of which is owed to the government itself in unpaid taxes. 
Merrill Lynch is advising on possible approaches to this conundrum.

 Sanchez noted that the four companies are now making an operating profit, 
and recent debts have been mainly the result of exchange losses. Reynolds of 
the US has an 8% stake in Alcasa, and a Japanese consortium led by Kobe 
Steel has 20% of Venalum.

 Iron and steel, too. The other CVG units that are being put up for sale, 
notably the Sidor integrated steel operation and the Fesilven iron plant, 
are expected to raise a further US Dollars 1bn, perhaps next year.

 The CVG units that will not be sold are Electrificacion del Caroni 
(Edelca), the power generating company that runs the massive (10,000MW, 
second largest in Latin America) Guri dam; the Ferrominera del Orinoco iron 
ore mine at Cerro Bolivar; and the Minerven gold-mining operation.

 Telephone auction. The government also has high hopes for the sale of the 
49% of shares it still holds in the CANTV telephone company. Petkoff 
announced in mid-July that the auction would take place in November on both 
the Caracas and international stock exchanges -assuming that both the US 
authorities and the Venezuelan congress approve the arrangements.

 He said he expected the sale, which is being organised by the Lehman 
Brothers and S G Warburg investment banks, to bring in between US Dollars 
1bn and US Dollars 1.5bn. Other government sources have put the estimate as 
high as US Dollars 2bn.

 The first 40% tranche of CANTV shares were sold during the administration 
of President Carlos Andres Perez in 1991. A consortium led by GTE of the 
United States bid US Dollars 1.88bn. The remaining 11% were reserved for 
CANTV's employees.

 CANTV has a number of attractive features, not the least of which is a 
monopoly on conventional telephony until the year 2000. The company's 
concession runs for 35 years, renewable for a further 20. It has 2.8m lines 
installed.

 Banks sale. Poletto was accompanied in New York by Ester de Margulis, head 
of the Fondo de Garantia de Depositos Bancarios (Fogade), the state agency 
that has been give the job of reorganising and selling-off the banks 
nationalised in the wake of the 1994 financial crisis.

 Margulis told her audience that the Banco de Venezuela would be the first 
bank to be reprivatised, probably in August. The book value of Venezuela's 
oldest bank is thought to be about US Dollars 60m. Banco Tequendama is to 
follow in September, Banco Consolidado in October, Banco Latino at the end 
of 1996 and Banco de la Republica early next year. Poletto said he hoped 
their sales would fetch between US Dollars 6bn and US Dollars 7bn.

 Among a long list of other assorted enterprises that the government 
proposes to sell off are three regional power companies (Nueva Esparta, 
Enelbar and Enelven-Enelco); the Dianca and Puerto Central shipyards; the 
Monay cement works, and a string of hotels (which includes the cable car 
from Caracas to the coast).

 The big exception to the privatisation rule is the state oil company, 
PDVSA, one of the biggest and most successful in the world, with annual 
sales in excess of US Dollars 26bn. The symbolic importance of PDVSA, 
created after the nationalisation of the oil industry in 1976, is so great 
that no government would dare to suggest it should be sold.

 PDVSA off the agenda. 'The privatisation of PDVSA is not on this 
government's agenda, and those who propose such a move are fundamentalists 
who think that its would solve all the country's problems,' said Petkoff on 
12 July.

 PDVSA president Luis Giusti is among those who have suggested a half-way 
house, selling say 15% of the company's shares to help pay off the US 
Dollars 27bn foreign debt and give a boost to the non-oil sectors of the 
economy. But energy minister Erwin Arrieta made clear that even such a 
compromise was politically inconceivable.

 Over the past few years, however, PDVSA has entered into a number of 
contractual arrangements with foreign oil and gas companies, to attract 
much-needed capital into the industry. Earlier exercises included 
concessions to reactivate marginal fields and to help extract the extra-
heavy oil of the Faja del Orinoco.

 The latest modality of the 'opening' of the oil industry was the signing of 
eight risk contracts with international consortia at the beginning of the 
year (see RA-96-01). The association agreements were finally signed on 10 
July, giving the new PDVSA subsidiary Corporacion Venezolana de Petroleo 
(CPV) and the eight consortia 30 days to set up the operating companies.

 Petrochemicals opening. Petkoff also announced that foreign capital would 
soon be invited to invest directly in the petrochemicals industry, dominated 
by the PDVSA subsidiary Petroquimica de Venezuela (Pequiven). The state 
company turns out 3.2m tonnes of products a year, and a further 2m tonnes in 
a number of joint ventures with domestic and foreign private companies.

 Petrochemical exports are expected to total US Dollars 760m this year. 
Information minister Fernando Egana said on 10 July that up to 200 new 
companies could be created in this sector by the year 2005 -by which time 
exports could reach US Dollars 2.5bn.

 AEROPOSTAL SAGA GOES ON

 As for Aeropostal, a number of airlines, including Avianca of Colombia and 
Delta of the US, showed an interest, but when it came to the crunch none of 
them could put down the US Dollars 2m deposit by 2 July required to enable 
them to proceed to the next stage: an auction with a reserve price of US 
Dollars 28m.

 The airline, founded in 1929, ceased operations in 1994, after a strike, 
with losses of US Dollars 38m. At its peak it had 16 planes and 40% of the 
domestic market -as well as services to Atlanta, Orlando and the Caribbean. 
Its assets were valued at more than US Dollars 60m in 1994.

 COLOMBIA: VIOLENCE: POLICE ACCUSED OF EXECUTING SUSPECTS: AND CONTRACT 
KILLING RAISES 'COLOMBIANISATION' FEARS

 Two events in mid-July summed up the alarming institutional breakdown in 
Venezuela. The Policia Tecnica Judicial (PTJ) published figures indicating 
that there had been 821 murders in Caracas in the first six months of the 
year, 747 of them with firearms; 630 of the victims were between the ages of 
18 and 30.

 And President Rafael Caldera publicly rebuked his justice minister, Enrique 
Meier, for criticising his predecessor's running of the ministry, 
particularly the prison service.

 Fewer murders, but ... The murder rate in Caracas was actually down on the 
same period last year, when 936 people died violent deaths in the capital. 
But PTJ chief Jesus Lazo Ricardi noted that insecurity was very widespread 
in the city, largely as a result of the high levels of drug and alcohol 
consumption.

 Most of the killings were at weekends in the hillside barrios surrounding 
the capital, where the police presence is very low and armed gangs hold 
sway. Another consequence of the absence of police is that lynchings (eight 
in the first six months) and vigilante groups have become commonplace.

 The commander of the Policia Metropolitana (PM), General Rafael Damiani, 
estimates that he would need double the number of officers he has at his 
disposal to provide an adequate service to the capital's 4m inhabitants.

 'Extra-judicial executions.' Not that the poorly trained and paid PM's 
reputation is very high. In mid-June the police managed to stop an armed 
robbery at an ice-cream parlour in the city centre, killing one of the 
attackers, and at the cost of the life of a young policewoman -the first to 
die on active service.

 But sympathy turned to outrage when the two surviving criminals were 
subsequently found dead in a hospital morgue, their bodies riddled with 
bullets. They had earlier been filmed by Radio Caracas Television being 
taken away in handcuffs by the police.

 Here was evidence that the PM were carrying out 'extra-judicial executions' 
-an increasingly frequent occurrence according to human rights 
organisations, such as Provea, which counted more than 270 in Venezuela in 
1994-95.

 The PM was forced to hand over the officers involved in the operation to 
the PTJ, public prosecutor Ivan Dario Badell ordered an inquiry and seven 
policemen were later arrested. RCTV complained that it had received 
threatening phone calls and PM patrol cars had been seen passing in front of 
the building.

 Contract killing. Days later public opinion received a further shock when 
the son-in-law of former presidential candidate Jose Vicente Rangel (now a 
prominent TV commentator) was shot dead as he delivered his daughter to a 
Caracas kindergarten, in what appeared to be a contract killing. This, 
together with the growing frequency of kidnappings, is widely seen as a 
further step towards the 'Colombianisation' of Venezuelan society.

 Meier earned Caldera's wrath by accusing his predecessor, Ruben Creixems, 
of permitting human rights abuses in Venezuela's nightmarish prisons. 
Caldera publicly contradicted him, and called Creixems to the presidential 
palace to offer a formal apology.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 BOLIVIA/ Rural poverty. According to a report by the UN Population Fund, 
94% of rural households live below the poverty line, and the rate for cities 
is 51%. The study identified exceptional poverty in the urban areas of El 
Alto, Trinidad, Oruro and Potosi. 

 Chagas clampdown. The government has requested funds from the World Health 
Organisation to help it implement a five-year, US Dollars 70m programme to 
eradicate Chagas disease and malaria, which are present in 60% of the 
country. The authorities currently spend US Dollars 3m annually on 
fumigation projects in the areas affected by Chagas disease, and coordinate 
activities with Argentina, Peru and Brazil to combat the presence of 
malaria-carrying mosquitoes in frontier regions. A larger proportion of the 
population is affected by the two diseases than anywhere else in the 
Americas.

 Forest protection. After two years of debate congress has passed a forestry 
law aimed at protecting remaining woodland areas, which are deforested at a 
rate of 1,400 square kilometres per year, according to conservation group 
estimates. Under the law the state will grant 40-year concessions on forests 
to the private sector at a cost of US Dollars 1 per hectare per year, on the 
condition that the companies replant new forests. The law has been attacked 
by timber companies, who say the price should be only US Dollars 0.30 per 
hectare, and by Indian groups and the opposition, who say the price is too 
low. 

 COLOMBIA/ Fuel reserves. Oil reserves will last for another 20 years, or 
for 30 if used in conjunction with natural gas, at the current rate of 
consumption, according to the state oil company Ecopetrol. It estimates 
reserves at 2.9bn barrels of oil and 7.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 
though this does not include the fields discovered earlier this year in 
Piedemonte Llanero, whose potential has yet to be calculated.  

 Perry gets WB post. Guillermo Eduardo Perry, finance minister from 1994 
until his resignation three months ago, has been appointed Chief Economist 
for the Latin America and Caribbean Region of the World Bank. Perry studied 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is specialised in the 
fields of fiscal and energy policy. He held the post of mines and energy 
minister between 1986 and 1988. 

 ECUADOR/ Energy investment. Over the last four years the energy sector has 
attracted investments worth US Dollars 2bn, according to the ministry for 
energy and mines. The oil sector alone attracted around US Dollars 880m in 
the last six months, with Occidental Petroleum planning a further US Dollars 
600m this year.

 PERU/ Petrolube sale delayed. Labour minister Jorge Gonzalez Izquierdo 
announced that the sale of Petroperu's Petrolube plant, due to take place 
later this month, will be postponed until October. The lubrications branch 
is the second of Petroperu's subsidiaries due to be privatised, following 
the sale of the La Pampilla refinery in mid-June.

 Agricultural export growth. The value of agricultural exports will reach US 
Dollars 820m in 1996, a 37% increase on the US Dollars 600m recorded last 
year, according to the exporters' association, Adex, which also estimates 
that exports from the sector could be worth an annual US Dollars 1bn within 
four years.

 Copper profits down. The mining sector expects to receive US Dollars 250m 
less than its projected total revenue of US Dollars 1.3bn for this year, as 
a result of the fall in international copper prices following the 'Sumitomo 
scandal'. The price of the metal has fallen to US cents 90/lb, compared with 
an average of US Dollars 1.33/lb in 1995. 

 Corruption charges. A Lima judge has begun proceedings against second Vice-
President Cesar Paredes Canto, on extortion charges. Canto allegedly used 
his influence to gain an extended licence for the US airline Export Air, one 
of companies involved in the scandal over the sale of Argentine arms to 
Ecuador during the border war with Peru in 1995.  

 European food aid. The European Union has signed two agreements pledging 
food for 160,000 schoolchildren and 1,365 displaced families in the central 
highlands. Between July and December this year 2,240 tonnes of food will be 
distributed to children in the departments of Junin and Pasco. Families 
resettled in the department of Ayacucho will receive provisions under a 
food-for-community work scheme between now and June 1997.

 VENEZUELA/ Orinoco floods. A state of emergency has been declared in six 
southern states following severe flooding along the course of the Orinoco 
river caused by heavy rains. Worst affected is the state of Amazonas, where 
40,000 Indians, mostly Yanomamis, Yekwanas and Guajibos, have been forced to 
leave their river-side villages and are now dependent on provisions 
airlifted in by military helicopters.
  The authorities are warning that the greatest danger to the local 
population may come after the floods recede, when conditions will be ripe 
for malaria and hepatitis epidemics.

 REGION/Mercosur talks. At a meeting in Caracas the trade ministers of the 
Andean countries agreed to collectively negotiate trade liberalisation with 
the Mercosur countries, following moves by Bolivia to seek closer commercial 
ties with the Mercosur at the end of June.

 Peru, which has already begun talks with Mercosur, confirmed that it will 
remain a member of the Andean Community, and trade and industry minister 
Liliana Canale announced proposals to harmonise the group's tariff 
structure, which at present Peru considers too complicated.

ACTIVITIES AT MEGAWATI"S PDI HQ SUSPENDED 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Activities at Megawati
Sukarnoputri's new party headquarters in East Jakarta were suspended
at 11:20 a.m. Friday.

    A statement posted at the headquarters' gate said activities
will remain suspended until the party obtains permission to use the
office from the mayor of East Jakarta.

    The statement, signed by Tarto Sudiro, an executive of
Megawati's faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), also
said that matters regarding the new headquarters are being handled
by their lawyers.

    Megawati, who was ousted as PDI chairman in a congress in Medan,
North Sumatra, last June, has set up the East Jakarta headquarters
barely two weeks ago.

    Her faction occupied the party headquarters in Central Jakarta
before supporters of the rival faction, led by newly installed PDI
chairman Soerjadi, took over on July 27.

    The violent takeover sparked riots which according to the
National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) left  five dead and
more than a hundred injured.

    On Monday, the mayor of East Jakarta, Lt Col Sudarsono, ordered
Megawati to close down the headquarters by Thursday afternoon,
citing complaints from the local community that it was set up in a
residential area.

    However, Sudarsono on Thursday extended the deadline by 24
hours.

    One of Megawati's lawyers, Pontas Nainggolan, has said that they
were meeting officials of the mayor's office Thursday afternoon to
discuss the deadline's extension.

PRESIDENT ASKS PPP TO GROOM ITS CADRES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto said on Friday
that the United Development Party (PPP) should concentrate in
consolidating its position by grooming party cadres to address
future challenges.

    Future challenges require the party to groom its cadres, PPP
chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum quoted the head of state as saying.

    Ismail met the president to discuss among others matters related
to the 1997 general elections.

    The president has once asked the National Defence and Security
Council (Wanhankamnas) to draft procedures for organising political
campaigns to ensure that they do not cause any negative impact.

    He also reminded the three political parties --the PPP, the
ruling Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)-- not to use
the campaigns as a "show of force" as this could only lead to
clashes.

    The political parties will contest 425 seats in the 500-seat
Parliament next year.  The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the
Armed Forces (ABRI), whose members do not vote for any of the three
parties.

    Metareum said his party agrees to the holding of dialogue-based
campaigns without leaving out mass-based campaigns.

    The PPP chairman also said that 60 percent of their candidates
for parliament are neophytes.

    Earlier, the president also received ulemas from Jakarta and its
environs grouped in the Ulemas Forum.

    The president expressed gratitude to the ulemas for their
support for his leadership.

    "I only want to devote my life in the interests of the nation
and the state.  May Allah allow this," he said.

    He also reiterated that differences in opinion in a democratic
society are natural and that these differences should be solved
through deliberations to reach an agreement.

    "Go ahead with your arguments at the forum," he said.

INDONESIA"S PUBLIC HEALTH RATES LOWEST AMONG ASEAN COUNTRIES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sep 27 (ANTARA)-  Health Minister Sujudi  admitted
Friday that public health conditions in Indonesia rate the lowest
among ASEAN member countries.

    The fact should spur the country's medical community to do their
utmost to improve  public health services, he said.

    "The Health Ministry has been striving to improve the conditions
of public health by providing  relevant infrastructure facilities,
medical equipment and
improving health conditions all over the country," said Sujudi after
installing nine senior ministry officials in  new posts.

    He said the country was still facing various challenges in the
health sector, among other things, the task of raising the
life-expectancy of Indonesians from 62.7 years in the Fifth
Five-Year Development Plan to 73 years at  the end of the second
long-term development cycle.

    The government was also encouraging efforts to lower
the infant mortality rate from 58 per one thousand of born babies to
only 25 per one thousand  and the  maternity death rate from 390 per
100,000 deliveries  to only 200, he said.

    Indonesia's present life-expectancy of 62.7 years was also still
the lowest among ASEAN countries such as the Philippines (66.5),
Thailand (71.3), Malaysia (72.6), Brunei (76) and Singapore (77.1),
he noted

    The country's current maternity death  rate of 390 per 100,000
deliveries  was still high compared with the Philippines (250),
Thailand (180), Malaysia (120), Brunei (15) and Singapore (14), the
minister further said.

    Sujudi said that malaria, diarhea, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS
were among the diseases requiring particular attention to improve
the health conditions of mothers and their babies.

    "But the most important thing is making  all the people
understand that the improvement of public health is the
responsibility of all," he said.

OPERATIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL FIHSING TO BE INCREASED 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesian Armed Forces Commander
General Feisal Tanjung said here on Friday operations to fight
illegal fishing in the country's waters will be increased.

    He said the operations would be stepped up even though the armed
forces had no plan to acquire more ships.

    Tanjung said the endurance, expertise and equipment of the
country's fishermen had to be improved so that they could fish up to
the Exclusive Economic Zone.

    He said the armed forces would take stern actions against any
poacher or individual suspected of protecting illegal fishing.

TELKOM CONCLUDES CONTRACT WITH LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR EQUIPMENT SUPPLY 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Bandung, Sept 27 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia's state-owned
international telecommunications operator PT Telkom announed in New
York Friday it concluded a contract worth 22.7 million dollars with
Lucent Technologies for expanding the firm's data communication
network and services for business customers.

     Telkom's public relations chief T Hedi Safina said the state
company also announced details of phase II covering its strategic
partnership with Lucent Technologies to assist the entire plan of
building the world class telecommunications network in Indonesia by
year 2000.

     He said Telkom also announced a data network expansion and plan
for 1997 covering a unique partnership in the form of knowledge
transfer with Lucent Technologies during its financial roadshow by
Telkom's president to New York, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, London
and Boston, for the dissemination of information on the latest
development of Telkom to the international financial community.

     Indonesia with a telephone density rate of about 1.4 for every
100 people, planned to expand the existing telephone network by the
installation of at least another five million lines during the
implementation of its telecommunication development program in the
current Sixth National Development ending in 1999.

     Telkom's president AA Nasution said the telecommunications
industry in Indonesia has been growing very rapidly.

     Therefore, in view of the development and continuation of
deregulations in Indonesia's telecommunications industry and the
mounting competition, one of the most important things Telkom should
do was to promote the management of networks and capacity of the
subscriberes, he said.

     The knowledge transfer program is a combination between formal
training in the classroom, practice and the facilities of Lucent
Technologies and AT & T in the United States, with the support of
training in Indonesia.

     The experts of Lucent Technologies and AT&T will cooperate with
the management and staff of Telkom in sharing knowledge and
experience.

     Meanwhile, vice president of International Services of Lucent
Technologies Greg Hughes said Telkom wished to achieve a world class
operational standard to support the development of its networks.

     The knowledge transfer program was already started in April
1996, and by the end of this year the management and staff of Telkom
will finalize several parts of the program, Hedi Safina said.

INDONESIA"S FRUIT IMPORTS THREE TIMES ITS FRUIT EXPORTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bogor, W Java, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesia imports an average
of 112,000 tons of fruits worth US$7.83 million every year or three
times the value of its fruit exports which totals only US$2.6
million a year, an expert said.

    The wide discrepancy between imports and exports should  prompt
the country to spur and step up  horticultural production, Rector of
the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) Prof Dr Soleh Solahuddin
said here Friday.

    The rector made the remarks at the signing of a cooperation
agreement between IPB and PT Mekar Unggul Sari, the company running
the Mekar Sari national horticultural garden at Cileungsi, West
Java.

    According to Solahuddin, the cooperation was also expected to
improve the national agricultural image in  global trade.

    "The declining national agricultural image must be elevated
through  modern agricultural development," he added.

    Solahuddin also pointed out that despite its richness in fruits,
Indonesia was lagging behind other countries in  fruit cultivation
due among other things to its limited capability to produce superior
seeds.

    Meanwhile, President Director of PT Mekar Unggul Sari Siti
Hutami on the occasion expressed the hope that the cooperation could
improve the quality of local fruits so that they could compete with
those produced by other countries.

EMBASSY SUPPORTS IDEA TO FORM FORMER U.S. VISITORS FORUM 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Medan, N Sumatra, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta
supports a proposal to use the U.S. International Visitors Program
(IVP) in Medan as a forum for Indonesian young professionals who
once visited the U.S., a U.S. diplomat said.

    The idea of forming an association of Indonesian young
professionals who once visited the U.S. was very good because it
would re-open contacts among the IVP participants in the region or
between them and members of the U.S. community they used to know,
Second Secretary at the U.S. Embassy Shawn Dorman said here Friday.

    Dorman was here along with U.S. State Department  official for
Indonesian affairs Lucy Abbott for a meeting  with a number of
former Indonesian visitors to the U.S. at the building of the
Indonesia-America Friendship Association (PPIA).

    IVP is a program for the exchange of professionals, which is
managed by the education and cultural affairs agency of the U.S.
Information Center. It invites members of the international
community to come the U.S. every year.

    On the occasion, Dorman also promised to deliver the hope of
Executive Director of PPIA's Medan chapter Jasamin Saragih to
relevant U.S. officials in Jakarta who were expected to attend the
inaugurating ceremony of IVP in Medan in the near future.

    In 1995, the U.S. government invited at least 16 Indonesians
with different educational and professional backgrounds, including
journalists and intellectuals to make a month-long tour of the U.S.

    According to reports from an association of international
visitors to Los Angeles (IVCLA), the 16 Indonesians were among 1000
IVP participants from across the world.

    The IVP participants every year had the opportunity to visit Los
Angeles during their tour of America, IVCLA's honorary chairman
Richard J Riordan said.

    Riordan pointed out that the 16 Indonesians along with other IVP
participants from 140 countries in the U.S. were expected to know
more about the life of U.S. urban people and U.S. urban
environmental innovation programs.

    IVCLA's executive director Janet Elliot said her side expected
that the IVP participants would maintain the good relations of
friendship with the American people they had become acquainted with.

    During their stay in the U.S., the Indonesian IVP participants
discussed various matters with U.S. officials, non-government
organizations and members of local communities.

INDONESIA"S CONSTRUCTION SECTOR TO FACE CHALLENGES ON GLOBAL MART 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Yogyakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesia's construction sector
will  face special challenges in the structural and engineering
aspects on the global market, a researcher said.

    Foreign investment in the construction sector in the country has
also been increasing since the construction industry was opened to
foreign investors in 1992, lecturer and researcher at the Technical
Faculty of the Atma Jaya University in Yogyakarta Peter F Kaming, M
Eng., Ph.D said on Friday.

    Kaming made the remarks in his speech on Indonesia's  human
resource development in the face of construction industry challenges
on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of Atma Jaya University.

    According to Kaming, foreign investors in the construction
sector entered Indonesia due among other things to the presence of
their partners in other sectors, who needed building facilities like
warehouses and factories.

    He further said Indonesia should follow other ASEAN member

countries like Singapore which had no natural resources but  were
aware of the importance of  human resources development in their
economic development.

    He therefore hoped  that Indonesia could take further advantage
of the cooperation with other ASEAN members in  the interest of
national economic development.

    He also pointed out that in macro terms , AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade
Area) would give mutual advantages to its  member countries but in
micro terms , it would be an arena of competition among them.

    Kaming likewise hoped Indonesia would not become an object in
the "zero game" because it would then only be a loser.

PNG AGREES TO SETTING UP OF BORDER CHECKPOINTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Manokwari, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Papua New Guinea (PNG) has agreed
to an Indonesian proposal for either side to set up a checkpoint for
traffic across their common border, according to an Indonesian
official who attended recent Indonesia-PNG border talks.

    The border talks took place aboard a ship, the Ciermai, last
Tuesday,  Indonesia's border liaison official FX Suryanto Sriwardoyo
told ANTARA Friday.

    He said  the two checkpoints would be set up at spots on the
border between Indonesia's Jayapura district  and PNG's province of
Sandau.

    He said Indonesia would build the checkpoint in its region while
the other one in PNG would be built by the PNG government.

    He said it was hoped by the two governments that the two
checkpoints would facilitate across-the-border visits by their
citizens and trade between their peoples.

    During the meeting, Indonesia also asked the PNG to immediately
realize its plan to build a road between Vanimo  and Sandaun.

    Suryanto said Indonesia had already built a 75- kilometer road
from Jayapura to the border.

    Indonesia was expecting the PNG to finish a remaining stretch of
1.5 kilometers of road from Wutung that would l connect the two
countries, he said.

    Regarding the question of around 3,000 Irian Jayan border
crossers in PNG's Is Awin detention camp, Suryanto said their return
would depend on the PNG government.

    Last year it was the UNHCR that handled their return but now
after the UN body had closed its office in PNG, the repatriation was
not running smoothly.

    The Indonesian government in Irian Jaya had already declared its
preparedness to receive the repatriates any time, he said.
     According to Suryanto, the  UNHCR had closed its representative
office in PNG because the cases it dealt with so far were mere

border crosser problems.

    Regarding the extradition or deportation of Irian Jaya security
distrubing gang (GPK) members who are still in PNG, Suryanto said
that the issue would be discussed by the Indonesian ministry of
justice with its PNG counterpart.

GOVT CONTROL STILL NEEDED IN FOOD, BEVERAGE TRADE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sep 27 (ANTARA)- The food and beverage trade in

Indonesia still needs a measure of governmental control to ensure
smooth and even distribution,  a trade  spokesman said here on
Friday.

    Thomas Darmawan, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Food
and Beverage Traders (GAPMI), said  governmental  intervention was
still needed to overcome  difficulties food and beverage businessmen
were encountering in the marketing of their products all over the
country.

    He also said certain agricultural products should be subject to
a government-controlled collection and distribution system to ensure
their continuous availability and their prices' stability.

    Citing rice as an example, Darmawan said  governmental control
on trade in this commodity was necessary to guarantee sufficient
supply and proper distribution.

    Keeping food available to people throughout the country at
affordable prices was in the interest of the success of national
development , he said.
      According to Darmawan, the application of governmental
controls to the food and beverage trade was common in foreign
countries such as Australia and some  European countries.

    "In  Australia there is an Apple Board and farmers' associations
for other products," said Darmawan who is also chairman of the
Indonesian Communication Forum on Food.

    The main function of farmers' associations was to maintain
balance between supply and demand so that farmers would always have
reasonable selling prices, he said.

    Indonesian food producers should learn a good lesson from the
implementation of trading schemes in other countries, he said.

promote their products in the Chinese market.

    Following the opening of the exhibition on Thursday, three

    Data from the Indonesian embassy show that trade balance between
Indonesia and China from January to July this year reached a total
of US$1.86 billion in favour of Indonesia.

    During that period, Indonesia exported various non-oil/gas

MILY COMMANDER: IRIAN JAA GPK LEADER KILLS FOUR HOSTAGES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jayapura, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Major General Johny Lumintan, the
VIIIth (Trikora) Military Regional commander, has accused Thadius
Yogi, leader of the Irian Jaya touble maker group (GPK Irja) of
killing four people who had been held hostage.

    Maj Gen Lumintang has blamed Yogi for the four deaths in two
separate recent hostage cases in the province.

    The four hostages killed by the GPK leader were Navy Panekenan
and Matheus Lasamahu in Mapnduma, and Tumaji and Maksum, workers of
logging company PT Kamundan Raya.

    In January the GPK Irja took 26 people, including seven
Europeans, hostage in central Irian Jaya.

    They released one foreigner and 14 of the Indonesian hostages.
The remainder escaped in May following a rescue operation launched
by units of the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI), during which two
Indonesian hostages were killed.

    An armed group kidnapped 16 workers of a logging company, also
in central Irian Jaya, on August 14.

    Fourteen of the hostages were either released or escaped their
captors but two of the hostages were found dead in the jungle on
September 16 with ABRI saying their bodies had wounds indicating
torture and slaughter.

    Troops clashed with the armed group last month, during which one
of the captors, identified as Pius Orok Yane Magai Yogi, was shot
dead. The ABRI claimed then that the dead Yogi was the leader of the
group.

    Lumintang said that Yogi was responsible for the four deaths,
although in the first hostage case, the military have said that the
GPK kidnappers were headed by a man identified as Kelly Kwalik.

    He did not elaborate but said that the ABRI units would continue
to hunt down GPK members in Irian Jaya.

    Central Irian Jaya, the site of the hostage dramas, is covered
by mountainous jungles and experiences heavy rainfall and
temperatures as low as ten degrees Celcius.

EAST JAKARTA MAYOR SEALS MEGAWATI"S PARTY HQ 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - The East Jakarta Municipality
authorities here on Friday afternoon sealed the new headquarters of
ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati
Sukarnoputri at Jalan Raya Tengah No. 1, Condet, Pasar Rebo in East
Jakarta.

    Tens of officials, accompanied by stick-wielding policemen, put
notices on the front gate and door of the building, declaring the
premises sealed by the order of the Mayor of East Jakarta,
Sudarsono.

    "It is now closed down and there should be no activities here
pending negotiations between city authorities and (the Megawati)
side," said Rajak Gogi, the head of East Jakarta's law and order
department, who led the team that closed the building.

    The notices said that the closure was based on a law forbiding
offices in residential areas, and warned of legal action against
anyone attempting to break the seal.

    Sudarsono earlier this week sent a letter to Megawati ordering
her to "immediately close down" the new party headquarters, saying
it breaches a government decree against using "residential homes as
offices for business purposes."

    Megawati, the daughter of the late President Sukarno, opened the
office Sept 9 in the East Jakarta suburb of Pasar Rebo, to replace
the party's main headquarters in downtown Jakarta after it was
seized on July 27. The seizure triggered widespread riots, the worst
in 22 years.

    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, an official of the Megawati faction,
said that the party executives will continue with their task.

    Another Megawati ally, Mangara Siahaan, said they already had an
alternative headquarters but declined to give further details.

FOREIGN NURSING ACADEMIES STILL NOT ALLOWED IN INDONESIA 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Banjarmasin, S Kalimantan, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Foreigners are
still not allowed to establish paramedic academies in the country so
that existing paramedics need for the time being not worry about
foreign competition, a government health official said.

    But Dr Hadisantoso, head of the Health Ministry's Paramedic
Education Center, also said by year 2003 the situation would be
different and Indonesian paramedics should therefore use the interim
period to improve their professional capabilities.

    Hadisantoso was speaking at a workshop organized by
Muhammadiyah Nursing Academy here.

    He said  foreigners would be allowed to set up nursing academies
in Indonesia only after year 2003 when the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) would begin. The country's doors to free trade would be
further opened in 2010 for other countries in Asia and the Pacific
and in 2010 to all other countries in the world, he said.
     In view of the foreign competition due to be encountered in the
not so distant future, all health educational institutions in the
country should create more medical attendants of good quality from
now,  he added.

    According to Hadisantoso, the Health Ministry had also made
efforts to improve the quality of paramedics in the country through
among other things the holding of courses and workshops.

AIR FORCE CHIEF: PURCHASE OF F-16S STILL INDECISIVE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Solo, C Java, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Air Force Chief of Staff Vice
Marshal Sutria Tubagus said the United States government has not
decided whether or not to sell nine of its F-16s to Indonesia,
because the US Congress was still discussing the matter.

    "However, whatever their decision on the sale of the F-16s,

which costs nine million US dollars per plane, it would be no
problem for Indonesia, because Indonesia still have a choice for
other equally powerful aircraft," he said when installing young air
force officers in Solo Saturday.

    Indonesia chose these fourth generation F-16s because of their
technology, he said.

    Indonesia, he added, became more confident in  the F-16s because
some other Asean member countries were also using these aircraft and
appeared to be satisfied with their potentials.  And in case repair
was needed, Indonesia would always be able to ask for assistance
from the other Asean member countries, he said.

    If the government has the money and the purchase of the F-16s
has to be cancelled, Indonesia could always turn to the French
Mirage-2000s jet fighters, he said.

    In the meantime, he added, Indonesia has purchased Adhock 100
and 200 aircraft, which will undergo a trial flight on the occasion
of the 51st anniversary of the Indonesian Armed Forces on October
25.

    The new jet fighters were to replace aging aircraft.  Indonesia
has now two squadrons of Adhock 100 and 200 jet planes and one
squadron of F-16s.

    The purchase of these aircraft was actually under the third
five-year program, while the first five-year program covered the
preparation of all the aircraft of the air force, and the second
five-year program was aimed at increasing the potential of the
existing squadrons according to standard, and in the next five years
new planes would be purchased.

    The newly-installed air force officers, he said, were expected
to become reliable personnel in facing the rapid progress of the
time.

BATAM AUTHORITY ISSUES RULINGS ON HOUSE OWNERSHIP FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Batam, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Research and Technology Minister as
Chairman of the Batam Authority BJ Habibie  has signed a decision on
house ownership for foreign nationals on Batam Island.

    "I have just signed the decision and it goes into effect as of
now," Habibie, who is also head of the Agency for Assessment and
Application of Technology, said in Nongsa Point Marina, Batam,
Saturday.

    The occasion was also attended  by Indonesian Ambassador to
Singapore HBL Mantiri, Tourism Director General Andi Mappisameng,
and business tycoon Ciputra as well as a number of Singapore
businessmen.

    Habibie said foreign nationals, wherever they came from, Asia or

Europe, were allowed to own a home of their own on Batam Island,
providing they worked in Batam according to the regulations, in
possession of a smart card, and were members of a golf club in the
area.

    The property they may own were houses in resort areas,
condominiums, luxury houses in real estates each worth at least Rp
200 million with a 70-year lease.

    Habibie said the decision was not a solution to the gloom in the
property sector on Batam Island, but a follow up of Government
Regulation Number 41 of 1996 on the right of foreigners to own a
house in Indonesia.

    Developers on Batam island would become encouraged and enjoy the
fruits of the regulation.

    Meanwhile, First Assistant to the Batam Authority Chief Gunawan
Hadisoesilo said on a separate occasion that the decision was
applicable on Batam Island only, and the foreign nationals wishing
to have such property did not necessarily have to be actually
staying in Indonesia.

    By owning a house in Batam, he added, a foreigner would come to
Batam much more often, which may encourage growth of other sectors,
while the government would receive one percent of the sale of each
house.

    Habibie also said the Batam Authority would go on with its plan
to build infrastructure projects, including the Asia Port in Kabil.

    Besides YTL from Malaysia, Indoport from the United Kingdom
signed a contract on the building of a US$ 900 million container
terminal in Kabil on the basis of the BOT (build, operate and
transfer) basis for 60 years.

    The British investor will build the terminal in stages with a
capacity for 2.5 million TEUS from 1997 to 1999, and with an
increase of 1.8 million TEUS in 2000.  Along with YTL, the terminal
would have a capacity for 15.4 million TEUS by the year 2000s.

    Habibie said Asia Port has bright prospects, because
containerized goods for export would continue to increase sharply,
not to mention containers coming from other countries.

GOVT TARGETS READYING OF 20,000 HA OF PEATLAND IN 1996/97 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bogor, West Java, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - The government has targeted
the preparation of  20,000  hectares of peatland in Central
Kalimantan for rice farming in the 1996/1997 budget year, Public
Works Minister Radinal Moochtar said here Saturday.

    The 20,000 hectares would be part of the government's
one-million-hectare peatland conversion project in Central
Kalimantan province, the minister said.

    Speaking to reporters  after attending  a seminar organised by

the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) here over the weekend,
Moochtar said since work was begun on the project last February,
2,000 hectares of the peatland had been cleared for rice planting.
     He said  to meet the 20,000-hectare target in 1996/1997, an
average of 70 hectares of the peatland per day had to be cleared,
adding that the work required much manpower and heavy-duty
equipment.
     The minister said the project also included the building of an
irrigation system.  So far, 175 km of secondary and 500 km of
primary irrigation canals had been  created.

    The minister also said removing logs and roots from  the
peatland  was one of the most difficult parts of the clearing work.

    "We want the farmers who will grow the rice to receive the land
in ready-to-use state,"  he said, adding each farming family would
be given two hectares to cultivate.
     The farmers would be people from outside Kalimantan who had
agreed to be resettled under the government's transmigration scheme.

     But before being moved to the peatland project, they would
receive training in peatland farming methods since they had never
worked peatland before. IPB would contribute instructors for the
training.

    The minister said experts from IPB were also involved in the
preparation of a report on the environmental impact of the national
project.

ABILIO: DISCUSSION OF E. TIMOR ISSUE POSTPONED BECAUSE PORTUGAL IS AFRAID 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Dili, E Timor, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - East Timor Governor Abilio
Jose Osorio Soares said the postponement of the talks on the East
Timor issue in the 51st General Assembly session of the United
Nations increasingly indicated that Portugal was afraid of solving
the problem of the land that it has dominated for 450 years.
    "It is actually in the interest of Portugal to postpone the
talks on the East Timor issue, otherwise 'he' would certainly lose,"
the governor told the press on the postponement of the talks, after
closing a Golkar working conference in Dili on Saturday.
    "We can draw a conclusion that the postponement of the talks was
because Portugal was afraid it would lose in a voting in the United
Nations," he said.
    A solution to the issue at an international forum could be
reached through other means, such as through a tripartite meeting
between the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers under the
auspices of the United Nations Secretary General.

    However, if some day all countries would force a discussion of
the East Timor issue at the UN General Assembly, that would be the
time when Portugal can no longer refuse.
    The countries which have always abstained, should urge Portugal
to immediately accept the matter to be taken up at the UN General
Assembly for a solution, he said.
    The postponement was announced by a Dutch diplomat, Aryan P
Hamburger, at the General Affairs Committee session on September 18
discussing the agenda of the 51st UN General Assembly.
    The idea on the postponement was supported by the Philippine
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Felipe H
Mabilangan.  With no other delegates responding, the Committee
decided to postpone the talks on the East Timor issue and entered it
in the interim agenda of next year's UN General Assembly.
    Talks on the issue at the UN General Assembly have been
postponed 14 times since the subject was raised in 1983.
    Meanwhile, East Timor House Speaker Antonio Freitas Parada said
it would be useless to discuss the subject at the UN General
Assembly, because the integration of the former Portuguese colony
into the Republic of Indonesia has become a reality.
    Anti-integrationists abroad were only serving their sweet own
interest by using funds provided by non governmental organisations
in other countries to finance their activities, he said.
    Antonio pointed out that the most important thing for the people
of East Timor was to build the area with their own funds and forces.
    Other countries have become fed up with talking about the East
Timor issue, because in the 20 years of integration vast progress
has been made in the area, and in the welfare of the local
population.
    In the meantime, chairman of the East Timor chapter of the
ruling Golkar political party Armindo Soares Mariano said the party
wanted  an early settlement of the issue.  It would depend on the
Portuguese government, because it was them who made an issue out of
the integration in the first place, he pointed out.

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Some 40 foreign
sailboats  participating in a round-the-world voyage organized by
the Trade Wind Committee are expected to arrive here on October 3

Atlantic Ocean  called at ports along the eastern parts of the
American continent until it sailed around the most southern tip of
South America to reach the Pacific.

    In the Pacific, the group made stops in Fiji, New Zealand and
Australia. It would arrive in Kupang from Darwin, Australia,
Soenarto said.

    The boats were scheduled to leave Darwin on Saturday and head
for Indonesia where after Kupang, they would also stop in Bali and
Jakarta before returning to Gibraltar.

    The journey would end in Gibraltar in October next year.

ABRI CHIEF : "OTB" REFERS TO PKI"S POLITICAL STRATEGY 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Armed Forces (ABRI) Chief General
Feisal Tanjung said here on Saturday the term "formless
organisation" (OTB) referred to the political strategy launched by
the outlawed Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) members rather than
to its semantic meaning.

    "It is therefore improper for a handful of people to ask for a
review of the term "OTB" from the standpoint of grammar," he told a
meeting  about the latent danger of communism among the younger
generation.

    If the term "OTB" was considered wrong from the standpoint of
grammar, this would only be logical as PKI members never knew how to
use the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia) correctly and
properly, he said.

    The PKI members only knew how to use force and opportunities as
well as to overthrow colleagues and enemies, he said.

    The term "OTB" originated from the PKI members themselves
instead of government apparatuses or ABRI members, he said.

    "I seems that it is naive if some people have vilely responded
to the statement issued by the ABRI about the term "OTB" some time
ago, by saying that it was the ABRI which is the "OTB" or Omong
Tanpa Bukti (speaking without evidence)," he said.

    Quoting the ABRI's intelligence and socio-political analysis of
finds in several regions, Tanjung said PKI had metamorphosed.

    "To most experts in communist teachings, the metamorphosis is
not new because it is a built-in process. The built-in process and
classical style however have often made us inattentive and less
watchful," he said.

    The ABRI chief said the PKI members also knew well how to win
the public's sympathy through the so-called peaceful and human
propaganda.

    He said the former PKI members had neither permanent friends nor
permanent enemies. They only thought of how to satisfy their
interests.

    "To satisfy their interests, the former PKI members can do
whatsoever by, for instance, adopting attitudes down from
democrat-like attitude to violent, radical, uncivilized and inhuman
actions," he said.

    "Through the peaceful propaganda the PKI members have made a
number of survival attempts or activities in the last 30 years," he
said.

BALI ADM STILL PONDERING FEASIBILTY OF JAA-BALI BRIDGE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Denpasar, Bali, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Bali's provincial

administration is still pondering the feasibility of  a Java-Bali
bridge and has yet to discuss the matter with the central
govertment, Bali Deputy Governor Ida Bagus Ardhana said here
Saturday.

    Ardhana, who is also chairman of Bali province's Regional
Development Planning Board (Bappeda), said the provincial
administration was considering the proposed Java-Bali bridge from
various aspects, namely  economic, environmental, infrastructural,
and also social and cultural.

    He said Bali's House of Representatives (DPRD) was doing
likewise with the help of inputs from  non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) , informal community leaders and various
concerned agencies.

    According to Ardhana, a preliminary study of the project's
feasibility was already made by a technical agency. "The Bali
administration will discuss the results of the study with its
counterpart in Java," he added.

    He said he believed a Java-Bali bridge would no doubt  smoothen
transportation of people and goods between the two islands.

    However, certain problems  needed to be resolved before the
bridge could actually be constructed.

    Among the problems was the fact that the capacity of Bali's land
transportation facilities were not matched to the normal traffic
flow from Java.

    "Road conditions in Bali should be improved to make them equal
to those in Java," he said.

    In Java, roads had already been made strong enough to
accommodate  containers which was not the case in Bali, he said.

    He also said the flow of people from Java would  become a
problem to the Bali administration if the bridge was realized.

    "Denpasar municipality and Badung district have a  higher
economic growth rate than Java because they have become tourist
destinations. Migration from Java will burden the two regions in
Bali," he added.

    If realised, the project on Bali's side would  be located in
Jembrana district, a region with a growth rate of only six percent,
the lowest among Bali's districts.  Bali's overall economic growth
rate was seven  percent per year during the last three five-year
development plans.

    "The low economic growth rate of Jembrana district has caused
small growth in jobs as well," he said, adding that the provincial
administration had had to enforce special  policies to help the
district's economic development.
     For instance, the provincial administration decided to stop
construction of new star-rated hotels in Badung district and
Denpasar in an effort to divert investors in the hotel industry to
Jembrana district.

    He said  the Bali administration had also developed five tourism
destinations in Jembrana. Jembrana, according Ardhana, had now
become a location for development of medium-scale industries.

MINISTER: TALKS ON ENVIRONMENTAL TAX ALREADY DONE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Denpasar, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - State Minister of Environment
Sarwono Kusumaatamadja has said there have already been talks
between his office and the directorate general of tax and excises
about the proposed environmental tax for motor vehicles.

    "We have discussed about the issue with that directorate
general," he said here over the weeken.

    Sarwono made the statement in response to the wish for the
imposition of environmental tax for motor vehicle as expressed by
Bali Governor Ida Bagus Oka at the inaugural ceremony of the first
liquified petroleum gas station in the attendance of Mines and
Energy Minister IB Sidjana on the resort island Saturday.

    According to him, his side was waiting for the proposal
currently being processed at the ministry of mines and energy.

    Prior to the imposition of the tax, people should first get
information on alternatives of fuel oil which is not difficult to
get in the country which is rich in energy, he said.

    By providing the people with various energy alternatives, the
government could then impose a progressive tax which on the other
hand  also provides incentive for users of environmentally-friendly
energy resources.

    In Jakarta around 700 taxi cabs have been using LPG fuel.

    The minister said by the end of the year around 20 new LPG
stations would be set up in the capital.

N SUMATERA ALSO TO HAVE LARGE DREAMLAND 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Medan, Sept 29 (ANTARA) -- The Martabel dreamland in North
Sumatera currently under construction may become Indonesia's proud
in the international world.

    The mega project, the development of which was started in May
1996 in hilly and forested land near the Medan-Brastagi highway,
will have various sports facilities, including an international
standard 36-hole gold course, a dreamland, animal farm, water park,
cultural centre and 3,000 villas.

    This was said by head of the project Irawan Tjandra when
receiving a group of 20 Malaysian businessmen visiting the project
on Sunday, in the presence of operational director Antona Dihardjo,
financial director Wahi Kartono and marketing director Gavin J.
Rostron.

    They said the project was being built with funds provided by the
business community in North Sumatera under the coordination of North
Sumatera Governor Raja Inal Siregar and Irawan Tjandra.

    The investment in the project built in stages on 1,000 ha of
land and scheduled for completion in eight years, amounted to Rp 250
billion.

    In the first stage of the realisation of the project, according
to the operational and marketing directors, an 18-hole golf course
was being built under the supervision of Grantham Golf Construction
of the united States.

    The gold course, built on green hills with a number of man-made
lakes, is slated for completion in May 1997, but only with nine
holes.

    The building would then be continued with 18 holes designed by
world gold legend Greg Norman, which could be used for international
tournaments.

    The construction of the golf course to be named Martabe
Sejahtera Golf Club (MSGC) will be funded by the 250 founding
members each of whom with a shareholding of Rp 60 million.

    The next stage will be the building of a dreamland like the one
in Ancol, Jakarta, on 30 ha of land, an animal breeding farm on 100
ha, and a water park.

    Very specific buiildings in the Martabe dreamland include a park
for people of advance age and a cultural park with traditional
miniature houses of all parts of Indonesia.

    Also to be built in the complex are 3000 villas of standard
type, and 50 exclusive ones respectively on 5000 and 10,000 square
meters of land.

    Upon completion, Martabe may become the largest of its kind in
Indonesia encompassing sport and recreational facilities, a
dreamland and animal farm.

    "The dreamland will become one of the most comprehensive tourist
destination for foreign tourists visiting North Sumatera, and
another pride for Indonesia besides the one in Jakarta," Antona
Dihardja said.

    Meanwhile, the Malaysian businessmen, led by Datuk Lim Liong
Sek, they were very keen in becoming members of the Martabe
Sejahtera Gold Club as one of the concrete realisations of the
northern growth triangle involving Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

CHINA KEENLY INTERESTED IN INDONESIA"S TRADE POTENTIALS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Beijing, Sept 29 (ANTARA) -- Chinese businessmen appeared to
have become keenly interested in Indonesia's trade potentials, such
as in products, commodities, services as well as construction.

     The great interest was displayed during an economic seminar
over the weekend relating to the trade fair "Indonesia Opportunities
96" opened in Beijing last Thursday.

     However, the seminar addressed by Indonesian Ambassador to
China Juwana and the leaders of the state-owned companies taking
part in the trade fair, was closed to the media.

     In the course of the seminar, businessmen from Tianjin, an

important seaport for exports and imports, said they wish to
establish cooperation in the building of roads and ports.

     They even suggested the establishment of a sister-city
relationship between their city and a seaport city in Indonesia,
following the now three-year old Beijing-Jakarta sister-city
relationship.

     They also wished to purchase ground support equipment and
services displayed on the occasion by the private company PT Narofel
Teknik Indonesia.

     The Chinese business community also appeared to be interested
in the potentials of Indonesia's aircraft industry for the first
time represented by the Bandung-based state-owned aircraft industry
IPTN.

     The other Indonesian commodities in which the Chinese
businessmen were interested included fruits, textile (polyester),
rattan and wooden furniture, and even dried cassava represented in
the fair by the Hasanuddin cooperative society from South Sulawesi.

                                  National pride

     Meanwhile, chief organizer Budi Moeffreni of PT Indo Asean
Persada said on a separate occasion that Indonesia Opportunities 96
has really become a national pride.

     The appreciation and great interest of the Chinese community
were reflected in the numerous wreaths expressing congratulations
from local leading business people.

     At least five memoranda of understanding have been signed
during the occasion, including two on big business deals between PT
Citra Lamtoro Gung and Guangdong on the construction of a 166-km
toll road with an investment of Rp 913 billion, and between the
surveyor PT Sucofindo and its Chinese counterpart, China National
Import and Export Commodities Inspection Corp. (CCIC).

     MOUs on investment included a cooperation in the constructioni
of cement factories, both in China and in Indonesia (two plants).

     The Chinese, Budi said, wished Indonesia to hold such trade
fairs on a regular basis to introduce Indonesia's trade potentials
to the Chinese business community.

     For promotional purposes, PT Indo Asean Persada signed a
cooperation agreement for the dissemination of information about the
Indonesian business world by a local media in 25 million copies of
its publication.

     Indonesia Opportunities 96 to last till the end of this month,
is joined by 31 business companies with 250 support officials
including promotion personnel, managers, directors, and company vice
presidents.

17 RESCUED AFTER INDONESIAN VESSEL SINKS OFF MALAYSIA 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Penang, Malaysia, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Seventeen Indonesian crew
were rescued  by local fishermen Sunday after their cargo vessel
sank during a storm off  Malaysia's northern island of Penang late
Friday.

    Police said a trawler found the Indonesians clinging to two
rafts made  from lifebuoys, plastic water bottles and life jackets,
at 2 a.m. Sunday  (1800 GMT Saturday), several miles off Penang
island.

    On reaching the island, the crew, aged 17 to 42 years, were
taken to the  police district headquarters to alert the authorities
who had already resumed their search at daybreak Sunday.

    District police chief superintendent Tan Seng Eng said all the
crew had  been accounted for after earlier reports said there were
18 on board.

    More than 60 rescuers and five marine police patrol boats were
engaged in the search for the crew and the 300-tonne ship, the KM
Kurnia Abadi. The ship has yet to be located.

    The vessel, which was transporting timber, left northern Sumatra
in Indonesia Thursday and was scheduled to dock at Penang port
Friday night.

    A distress signal was sent late Friday to the shipping agent in
Penang.

    Search efforts were hampered by rough seas and lack of
information on the  exact location of the vessel.

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Denpasar, Sept 29 (ANTARA) -- Jean McKinnon, of New Zealand,
published a book entitled "Vessel of Life - Lombok Earthenware", the
result of a three-year research work in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara.

     The 180-page publication also carrying colour pictures was
launched on Sunday evening by head of the Bali office of the
Ministry of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications NK Mardhani at the
Agung Rai Museum, Ubud, some 35 km east of Denpasar.

     The launching in Bali was the second, while the first one was
conducted in Jakarta by Minister of Education and Culture Wardiman
Djojonegoro and New Zealand's Trade and Negotiations Minister Philip
Burdon on September 11, 1996.

     The book, printed in English to be marketed in various
countries, will in the first stage be published in 2000 copies.  The
third launching will be conducted in Lombok in a not too distant
future.

     Jean McKinnon, once an expert staff under a craft cooperation
project between the New Zealand and Indonesian governments covering

three villages in Lombok, said when the project was launched in 1988
the people was engaged in the small-scale production of ceramics and
earthenware in earning their daily living.

     One year after the coopertion project was launched, special
training was organized for mostly women craftspeople in designs of
vessels and earthenware.

for export, besides to meet domestic needs and sold to Bali and
neighbouring West Nusa Tenggara.

     In the beginning of the export drive, only one or two
containers of the products were exported, but at present the volume

MEGAWATI TO SUE E JAKARTA ADMI FOR CLOSING NEW HQ 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Ousted chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati Sukarnoputri on Monday said she will
file a lawsuit to protest the sealing off of her new headquarters by
the East Jakarta mayor.

    A lawyer representing Megawati said the suit could be filed at
the State Administrative Court (PTUN) as early as Monday.

    "The lawsuit could hopefully be filed at the PTUN by Monday,"
said Pantas Nainggolan, one of Megawati's lawyers.

    East Jakarta Mayor Sudarsono on Friday closed the new
headquarters of Megawati's faction of the PDI, citing violations on
residential zoning laws.

    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, a member of the party executive
board, said they will continue with their daily activities in
another place.

    "We will start looking for a new headquarters and we will
announce it as soon as we find one," he said.

    The closure of the headquarters came exactly two months after
supporters of new PDI chairman Soerjadi forcibly took over the main
party headquarters in Central Jakarta on July 27.

    Nainggolan also disclosed plans to demand the closure of the

office of Soerjadi's faction in his residence.

    "We will urge the government to be consistent and close down
Soerjadi's office in his residence," Nainggolan said.

    Megawati's lawyers and supporters argued that the closure was
discriminatory because many homes in the Indonesian capital have
been converted into offices.

    Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership in June by a party
congress held by the rival faction which elected Soerjadi as new
chairman.

    Her ouster triggered widespread protests which led to the July
27 riots after the raid on the PDI headquarters.

INDONESIA WILL OPPOSE NEW ISSUES AT WTO MEETING 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia will reject new issues
raised by industrial countries at the WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore in December, Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo
said today.

     "We will reject discussion on new issues which might be brougt
by industrial nations, including multilateral agreement on
investment, labour standard, government purchases and the problem of
competition," Tunky told reporters after a meeting with President
Suharto.

     He said Indonesia will take a firm stand against discussing
these new issues, particularly when they are disfavouring the
country's national interest.

     Indonesia already has its own regulations on investment and
labour law which would not be sacrificed for the interest of the
planned multilateral agreement, he added.

     But Indonesia will participate in the discussion of all issues
already agreed upon at the Uruguay Round meeting in Marakesh two
years ago, Tunky said.

     He said Indonesian officials have been preparing necessary
materials to be brought to the Singapore meeting scheduled for mid
December.

     It would be the first WTO Ministerial meeting among trade and
economic minsters to be held, he said.

     He also reported to the President about his recent trip to
Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico to
promote Indonesia's industrial products to the region.

     Tunky said Indonesia has been suffering a large trade deficit
against Latin American countries over the years.

     Last year Indonesia exported some US$525 million worth of
commodities to 12 Latin American countries while its imports from
that region reached about US$1 billion, he said.

     Indonesia needs to intensify its trade promotion to Latin

American countries to win more direct trading because many
Indonesian goods and products have entered their market via a third
countries, he said.

SOLO LAUNCHES GREAT SALE TO ATTRACT TOURISTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Solo, C Java, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Minister of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications Joop Ave said Solo will soon launch a month-long
great sale to attract more tourists to come to the Central Java
town.

    "The Solo Great Sale is a breakthrough in efforts to promote the
town's tourism potentials," Ave told newsmen here Sunday.

    During the event, which starts October 15, various products,
such as handicrafts, batiks, artworks, textile and textile products
and food will be sold at discounted prices, he said.

    He added that the great sale not only targets foreign visitors
but also Indonesians who often travel and spend their money abroad.

    "It is better for Indonesians to spend their money at home,
since our products are just as competitive (as those found abroad),"
he said while observing the preparations for the great sale.

    The local administration will also stage cultural shows at the
Surakarta and Mangkunegaran sultanate palaces and other public
places.

    Meanwhile, Solo Mayor Imam Sutopo said the great sale, to cost
about Rp 380 million, aims to promote the tourism potentials of
Solo.

    Its opening will coincide with the inauguration of the
Adisumarno airport as an international airport.

    Several airlines and hotels will also offer discounted rates
during the month-long festivital, Sutopo said.

    According to the mayor, three places, namely the Surakarta
sultanate palace, the Mangkunegaran sultanate palace and Taman
Sriwedari Tourist and Commercial Centre, have been set as venues for
the great sale.

    Some 70 companies have confirmed their participation, he added.

HAMID TURNS OVER TAPES OF PRD ACTIVISTS" SPEECHES TO ISLAMIC SCHOOL 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jombang, E Java, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Armed Forces (ABRI) chief of
social and political affairs, Lt Gen Syarwan Hamid, on Sunday turned
over to the Tebuireng Islamic boarding school cassette recordings of
speeches made by activists of the People's Democratic Party (PRD).

    The cassette tapes, received by school caretaker KH Yusuf
Hasyim, were meant to serve as a reminder of the atrocities of the
Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in their 1948 and 1965 revolts.

    Hamid said the speeches, delivered by PRD chairman Budiman
Sudjatmiko and Dita Indah Sari who are both under detention, reflect
the group's communist ideology.

    He called on the younger generations not to follow their
examples and instead increase their awareness of communist
activities to protect the country from the latent dangers of
communism.

    He noted that PKI remnants and the wide social gap in the
country could still lead to the revival of communism.

    Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher, who was also present,
urged Indonesian moslems to be vigilant of communist elements who
try to infiltrate religious groups.

    The government has blamed the PRD for inciting the July 27 riots
which rocked Jakarta, killing at least five and injuring scores of
others.

MPS CALLS FOR HALT TO OPENING OF TUNNEL NEAR AL AQSA MOSQUE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - The House of Representatives (DPR)
on Monday urged Israel to halt the opening of a new archaeological
tunnel near Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, saying the move is hurting
the world Moslem community.

    "I am very concerned about the Israeli move because the Al Aqsa
Mosque is sacred to Moslems.  That is why I call on Israel to scrap
the move to open the new tunnel," Abu Hasan Sazili of the Functional
Group (Golkar) at the DPR said.

    He said Israel should be consistent with its previous commitment
to creating peace in the Middle East.

    "The world community will respect Israel, if the Benjamin
Netanyahu government refrains from such an arrogant and one-sided
action," he said.

    He also appealed to Arab countries to remain united in the face
of the Israeli move to open the new tunnel.

    Meanwhile, chief of the House Commission on foreign affairs,
information, defence and security, Aisyah Aminy, said the Israeli
move is inseparable from Netanyahu's policy.

    She said the Israeli prime minister has given priority to his
personal and group interests, while ignoring the peace agreement
reached by his predecessor and the Palestinian leadership.

    If the Netanyahu government is serious in creating peace, it
must halt the opening of the new tunnel, she said.

    She urged Israel to immediately take concrete steps to create
peace in the Middle East.

    "Peace should become the goal, otherwise there will never be
peace between Palestine and Israel and in the Middle East," she
said.

    Abu Hasan Sazili also appealed to the United States not to
defend Israeli interests.

    "The United States should not adopt double standards, where on
one hand it longs for peace in the Middle East, but on the other
hand continues to assist Israel in every international forum, such
as the United Nations," he said.

    Meanwhile, H Imam Churmen said the opening of the new tunnel is
not only the problem of Palestinians but also the global Moslem
community.

    "The Israeli government must know that the building is a sacred
place of worship for Moslems, Christians and other religious
followers.  It is only logical if the world community has seriously
responded to the opening of the tunnel and pressed for its halt,"
Churmen said.

    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry on Friday issued a statement
strongly condemning the opening of the tunnel and the shooting of
Palestinians by Israeli troops.

    At least 53 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed in the
worst riots since the West Bank and Gaza came under Israeli
occupation in 1967.

    The statement calls for restraint from all sides in the conflict
and respect for existing peace agreements.

RIAU"S COAL RESOURCES ABLE TO GENERATE 1000 MW OF POWER 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Pekanbaru, Riau, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Riau has not only oil but
also coal resources which can generate thousand megawatts of
electricity, a Riau official has said.

    The head of the provincial mines office, Gaffar Siddik, said
here on Monday that survey results had revealed the presence of two
million tonnes of coal reserves in the Cerent area, Indragiri Hulu
district, which so far had not been exploited.

    "PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem (coal mining company) is at
present conducting surveys in this area and according to an original
plan a powerplant will be set up with a total capacity of 2 x 600
MW," Gaffar said.

    But there is also a possibility that the coal will be processed
for marketing abroad and that depends on the processor's calculation
whether it is more profitable to use the coal for power generating

or for marketing abroad, he added.

    According to the mines office chief, apart from PT Batu Bara
Bukit Asam, a Malaysian investor is also interested in utilizing the
coal in Cerenti for power generating.

    If the Malaysian side as well as PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem
are interested in conducting similar activities they can cooperate,
because according to plan the projected power plant will have a
total capacity of 2 x 600 Mw, and part of its production can be
exported to Malaysia, Gaffar said.

PRES CALLS ON TAMAN SISWA TO FORM COOPS WITH OTHER BODIES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto called on the
management board of the 74-year old Taman Siswa educational
institution not to hesitate to set up cooperations with other bodies
to boost its development.

    "The head of state has called on Taman Siswa to establish ties
with other institutions as it only accepts assistance from its
graduates," general chairman of the Ki Hajar Dewantara Foundation,
Soesilo Soedarman, said at the Bina Graha presidential office here
Monday.

    Soesilo and other members of the foundation's management board
met with President Soeharto to report on the foundation's program.

    The Ki Hajar Dewantara Foundation was formed to obtain financial
assistance for Taman Siswa.

    Soesilo, an alumnus of Taman Siswa who is now the coordinating
minister for political and security affairs, expressed concern that
the absence of significant improvement will make it difficult for
the institution to attract more students.

INDEPENDENCE FIGHTERS GIVEN FINANCIAL AID FOR HOUSE RENOVATION 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto on Monday
approved a proposal by the Independence Fighters' Advisory Body to
speed up the disbursement of Rp 1.5 million in aid to enable each
independence fighter to renovate his house.

    "The aid should be disbursed quickly while they are still

alive," the council's chairman, Hamid Algadri, quoted the head of
state as saying.

    Most of the independence fighters are aged 80 and above, Hamid
said.

    The Social Service Ministry is expected to immediately process
applications filed by 400 independence fighters for such aid, he
said.

    Hamid, along with Lasmidjah Hardi, Sarli Kusumo Dirdja and HML
Datuk Penghulu Besmet the president to express their gratitude for
the "Satyalencana Perintis Kemerdekaan" Award they received
recently.

    He said 300 out of 402 independence fighters have not received
the award.

    The president has also agreed to confer the award on the 300
independence fighters immediately, hoping that all independence
fighters would receive the award before they die, Hamid said.

1996 Will Be A Good Year For Business In The Middle East

NICOSIA - The year ahead will be good for business as regional
economies, especially those of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC),
begin to re-emerge from under heavy burdens imposed by the Gulf
crisis. More Arab states will implement market-oriented
liberalisation measures.

Politically, 1996 will carry mixed blessings for the region, with
good and bad landmarks. Elections scheduled in the self-rule areas
of Palestine, Israel and Iran bear various elements of uncertainty.
Each of these polls will generate a different momentum, whether
positive or negative will depend on the outcome. With talks moving
forward on the Syrian-Israeli track, 1996 could mark the beginning
of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace. The six GCC states will
continue to experience internal difficulties and tensions between
fellow-members. The situation in Saudi Arabia has improved. External
security for the GCC is guaranteed by the US. The possibility of the
UN lifting the embargo on Iraq - now in its fifth year - is remote
as US presidential electioneering gets into full swing in the autumn
(see Oil Market & Downstream Trends in this week's APS Review).

In North Africa, the struggle by governments against Islamic
militancy will continue, but the intensity will be less than in
recent years. The militants do not have the financial, military or
popular support required to overthrow regimes. Turmoil in the Red
Sea region and East Africa will also continue, amid military
hostilities between Yemen and Eritrea, while Sudan and Somalia sink
deeper into internal chaos - with Ethiopia not far behind.

Regional politics will become more complex. Questions such as border
disputes, water-sharing and trade imbalances will lead to a new set
of dynamics, some of which will be negative. The role of the US as
the main influence in the Middle East will remain unchanged, but not
unchallenged. The European Union (EU) will expand its linkages with
North Africa and the Mediterranean rim. Russia will be an
unpredictable factor, as the Communist Party has re-established
itself in that country; together with its leftist allies the party
is set to control 217 out of the 450 seats in the Duma following the
December elections.

The Turning Point

1996 will be decisive for the peace process, mainly because of what
it holds in store for Israel. General elections in the Jewish state
are scheduled for October, but with the government led by the Labour
Party having a majority of one in the Knesset, the polls may be
brought forward as early as May. A victory for the right-wing Likud
would mean disaster, with the party having pledged not to return the
Golan Heights to Syria. On the other hand, Premier Shimon Peres has
said he would not hold a referendum on returning the Golan, saying
the people can show their opinion in the general elections. Peres,
with strong US backing, wants to have a Declaration of Principles
with Syria before the elections. As an added incentive to the Arab
side, Peres on Dec. 22 said: "Give us peace and we will give up the
nuclear (option). If there is peace we would denuclearise the Middle
East". Rewards for what has been achieved have begun pouring into
Israel, which has seen a huge rise in foreign investment in 1995.
Yet Israeli society remains deeply divided about peace and its
implications as shown by the assassination of Premier Rabin in Nov.
1995.

Jordan now is a "most favoured" country in the Middle East for the
US and Israel. It is moving quickly to reap the rewards of peace.
The economic aspects of peace will bear fruit as from 1996. Jordan's
geo-strategic importance will increase as its shift away from the
regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq becomes clearer. Ties with Iran are
strained as well, with a recent tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats.

Lebanon will be ready to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1996, if
the latter is able to reach an agreement with Syria (see below).
Beirut is prepared to ensure calm in South Lebanon, with Syrian
help, and has said it is ready to deploy 25,000 soldiers there if
Israel withdraws from the "security zone". Its businessmen are the
ones best poised to take on the opportunities and competition that
would result from a peace treaty. Syria will continue to have a
guiding role over all affairs of importance in the country, taking
into account concerns about Lebanon's sovereignty expressed by
French Defence Minister Herve de Charette during a meeting with
Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam in Paris on Dec. 19, 1995.

Palestine, as a state, will not materialise in 1996 but key aspects
of statehood will be put in place. As self-rule spreads from the
Gaza Strip and Jericho to cover Tulkarem, Nablus, Qalqilya,
Bethlehem, Ramallah and other towns, a legislative council will be
elected on Jan. 20, 1996. Differences among Palestinian factions
will get narrower as the benefits of peace become more obvious (Vol.
43, 187-188). However, Arafat has denounced donor nations for
failing to keep aid promises; on Dec.18, he said that of $720m
promised only $120m was delivered. He was speaking on a tour of the
GCC states, which will boost funding to the Palestine National
Authority (PNA) in 1996, but not on the scale of the pre-Gulf crisis
era.

Syria holds the winning cards for 1996. With the latest initiative
for peace under a 10-point programme proposed by Peres, the US and
Israel have recognised Syrian control over Lebanon and Assad's
status as the key leader in the Arab World. In the small window of
opportunity available before Israeli elections, Assad would move to
ensure that Peres is re-elected premier in Israel. This could mean
an Israeli-Syrian Declaration of Principles in 1996, if Israel
agrees to pull out from the Golan in a limited time-frame. An Assad-
Peres summit, which "could take place in three to four months"
according to Israeli Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir,
would mark the start of a definitive peace between Syria and Israel.
Assad cannot afford to risk the alternative of peace in 1996, as
that would guarantee a Likud victory and isolation of Damascus by
Washington - perhaps by expanding the "dual containment" of Iran and
Iraq into a "triple containment" to include Syria. The peace process
will not survive such a scenario. An important goal for Assad is
"economic parity" with Israel.

Iran, which opposes the peace process, will be squeezed tighter by
the US in 1996. Prospects for an improvement in its economic
situation are slim. Parliamentary elections set for April-May 1996
appear likely to result in favour of hardline traditionalists who
are preparing a strong challenge against the pragmatists of
President Rafsanjani. The outcome of those elections will decide the
fate of the presidential polls in 1997, when Rafsanjani's final term
is to end. Tehran's regional ties are likely to get worse before
they get better, as countries neighbouring Iran build stronger ties
with the US. But Tehran is betting on a strategic alliance with
Moscow.

Iraq has no chance of getting the UN embargo lifted in 1996.
President Clinton will have no motivation to take such a risk in an
election year, and signs that Iraq has been trying to rebuild its
arsenal of long-range ballistic missiles will deter even those who
want sanctions lifted - like Russia, France, China and other
countries. The UN Special Commission's recent semi-annual report
took the US and British position that the embargo must remain in
force, because Iraq had not revealed all its secrets. On Dec. 21, UN
investigators found guidance systems for missiles of 3,000 km range
dumped in the Tigris River. US Ambassador to the UN Madeleine
Albright affirmed later that sanctions would be in place for a long
time to come. Yet chances of President Saddam Hussein being
overthrown are slim, despite regular reports of defections by army
officers. One way for Baghdad to get the embargo lifted would be to
indicate readiness to make peace with Israel, but Saddam is yet to
take this bait.

Turkey, having reached a customs union agreement with the EU in
December 1995, now faces a tough year ahead. The Islamic Refah Party
(RP) of Necmettin Erbakan won 21.32% of the votes in general
elections on Dec. 24, 1995, getting 158 of parliament's 550 seats.
Tansu Ciller, whose True Path Party came second with 135 seats,
resigned as prime minister and was soon talking of a coalition with
Mesut Yilmaz's Motherland Party (ANAP), which won 132 seats, and
other secular parties. Such a coalition would come under strong
pressure from RP, which is opposed to the EU agreement and many
other things. The elements of uncertainty were underlined on Dec. 22
when Chief of the General Staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi warned
the Islamists: "The Turkish armed forces has adopted a contemporary,
democratic and secular outlook and is opposed to all kinds of
dogmatism and reactionary attitudes." In 1996, the next government
would have to deal with an estimated 100% inflation rate and strike
threats by public sector workers. Externally, such a government
would be less effective in dealing with Turkey's growing geo-
strategic worries arising from its role as a bridge between "oil-
rich" states in the Caspian Sea region and Europe. It will also have
to deal with the Arab League's Dec. 17 threat to take action against
Ankara if it refuses to discuss Euphrates water sharing with Syria.

GCC Complexities

That internal security is a big problem for the GCC was recognised
at their 16th annual summit in Muscat on Dec. 4-6, 1995. The summit
was marked by a rift between Qatar and other members which may widen
in 1996. Bahrain, affected by unrest since December 1994, would have
to move fast to adjust to the implications of the peace process. Its
role as an offshore banking centre is no longer secure, and an
underlying cause of the unrest was economic hardship faced by
Shiites in the emirate. Employment of locals is now a top priority.
Alternative sources of income to boost the economy are being
pursued, such as tourism. Spending cuts slashed its budget defict by
some 40% in 1995 and a similar trend is expected for 1996.

Kuwait, which has the most democratic system in the GCC, has so far
been free of violent internal opposition. But on Dec. 15, 1995,
Defence Minister Shaikh Ahmad Hammud Al Sabah revealed that an arms
cache was seized at a farm in the emirate, hidden by a group that
"sought evil for Kuwait". Yet Kuwait has managed to overcome worst-
case scenarios forecast after its parliamentary elections in October
1992 gave Islamic parties a big number of seats in the National
Assembly. The ruling Al Sabah family will find ways to co-exist with
the vocal National Assembly, despite more embarrassments likely in
1996 as a result of corruption allegations against former oil
minister Shaikh Ali Khalifa Al Sabah.

Oman, having celebrated 25 years under Sultan Qaboos in 1995, will
continue to function as a positive force in the region. Its moderate
yet unique approach could become especially useful as subtle power
games within the GCC intensify. At the same time, it will boost
links with Israel, further consolidating its importance as a key US
ally in the region. The sultanate is moving ahead fast in terms of
economic liberalisation, with priorities in 1996 to include
privatisation and diversification away from oil.

Qatar would find itself in an uncomfortable position in 1996, having
alienated the other GCC members at the Muscat summit. The young
Qatari emir, Shaikh Hamad, and his delegation walked out in protest
at the appointment of a Saudi, Jamil Hujailan, as GCC secretary
general. Shaikh Hamad also said he would boycott all GCC meetings
attended by Hujailan. But his position changed immediately as
Hamad's father Shaikh Khalifa, whom he had ousted on June 27, 1995,
appeared in Abu Dhabi at the start of a GCC tour and vowed he will
regain power in Doha.

Saudi Arabia, for the first time in many years, recently experienced
a combination of uncertainties related to the Riyadh bomb explosion
in November and to the subsequent hospitalisation of King Fahd. But
the issue of succession to the throne had been resolved prior to
President Clinton's visit to the kingdom in October 1994. Now Crown
Prince Abdullah is the acting head of state and, according to the
1994 deal, he will be the next king. The more difficult power
sharing arrangement between Abdullah's conservative camp and the
progressive camp of Fahd's "Sudairi Seven" is yet to materialise and
could prove to be a difficult objective. At the same time, the
kingdom will have to deal with new external dynamics generated by
the peace process, the conflict between Eritrea and Yemen, strained
relations with Iran, etc. On the positive side, "good results" were
announced on Dec. 17 after talks between Riyadh and Sanaa on
settling their border dispute. Despite some inherent problems, the
Saudi economy will fare better than it did in the past three years,
marking a break with the difficulties faced from bearing the biggest
burden of costs related to the Gulf crisis.

The UAE will remain the most stable and relatively the wealthiest
among GCC states, unless its territorial dispute with Iran over the
islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa escalates into
war. This is not likely in 1996, but some fiery rhetoric can be
expected from hardliners during the parliamentary elections in Iran.
Both sides want a peaceful solution but there are few prospects for
this as neither side would back down from its position. Iran has
said it is ready to fight an 80-year war for the islands.

North Africa

The level of violence in Algeria has subsided somewhat, amid the
victory of President Liamine Zeroual in the November elections.
Having strengthened his position by gaining legitimacy inside and
outside the country, in 1996 Zeroual will try to further isolate and
divide the violent Islamic groups, while trying to strike political
deals with those willing to renounce violence. These could include
FIS leader Abassi Madani, now living in a villa in suburban Algiers
as a "detainee", as well as the FIS Executive Bureau's provisional
head Abdelkader Hachani and FIS leader overseas Rabah Kebir.

Egypt managed to crush Islamic militancy more effectively in 1995.
Crackdowns will continue in 1996 both inside and outside the
country. Cairo's insecurity about its regional leadership role will
reflect on the way in which it relates to Israel and other states on
issues such as (a) the hostilities between Yemen and Eritrea, in
which it has charged Israel of playing a role; (b) the nuclear
question, now that it is bound indefinitely by the NPT while Israel
is not; and (c) Islamic militancy, having accused Sudan of fomenting
instability in Egypt and warned it of retaliation.

Libya will remain isolated under limited UN sanctions, unless it
surrenders the two men wanted by Britain and the US for their role
in the Lockerbie bombing. That is not likely to happen. Added
external pressure may be applied in 1996, at the most perhaps
through a limited embargo on Libyan oil. A full embargo like the one
on Iraq would not get support from Europe or the Arab World. Qadhafi
will come under stronger internal pressure, as the pain from the
sanctions gets harder to bear.

Morocco and Tunisia will move closer to the EU in 1996. Tunisia in
particular is a test case for European economic integration with
countries of the Mediterranean rim. But inherent political problems
remain - lack of real democracy and human rights - in EU relations
with both Morocco and Tunisia. But both have implemented rigourous
economic reforms in recent years. The Arab Maghreb Union will sink
further into obscurity in 1996, as member states from Libya to
Mauritania follow their own course in diplomacy, including ties with
Israel.

Red Sea Trouble

The flare up of military hostilities between Eritrea and Yemen on
Dec. 15, 1995, over the strategic but disputed islands, has sparked
off a new set of negative dynamics. The Arab League accused Eritrea,
which has close relations with Israel, of a premeditated attack.
Eritrean forces used Israeli-supplied boats and telecommunications
equipment, which according to Sanaa were provided in return for a
pledge by Eritrea to hand over one of the disputed islands to become
an Israeli military base. Asmara suggested arbitration by the
International Court of Justice at The Hague while Sanaa warned it
will regain the Hanish Al Kabir island by force. Egypt has warned of
the geo-strategic implications of the conflict - whoever has the
islands controls the Bab El Mandeb straits and access to the Red Sea
- while the Cairo newspaper 'Al Akhbar' accused Israel of backing
Eritrea. This was denied by Israel.

Sudan, a pariah among most Arab countries and the West, will
continue to deteriorate economically, while the political situation
would get worse. The military/Islamic regime has been unable to
deliver victory against the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA), or any real improvements in the economic situation. As
relations with Egypt and other neighbours continue to worsen,
support to the SPLA from external sources such as Uganda and Eritrea
would rise. The regime will come under pressure from opposition
groups based in Cairo. In addition, tensions between the central
establishment and the various region are increasing as southern
politicians seek constitutional guarantees of more power, including
the reservation of the second highest post in the country - that of
first vice president - for a southern Christian.

Somalia has sunk back into chaos and civil war that existed before
the US-led UN intervention in December 1992. Things would get worse
in 1996; but this time the UN and the US would not step in to help.

Yemen, while engaged in a military conflict with Eritrea, is
beginning to face internal problems which would get worse in 1996.
Relations between the ruling General People's Congress (GPC) and the
Islamic Al Islah movement have been deteriorating steadily. Islah
efforts to impose strict Islamic practices in the south have turned
violent, including arson attacks against cinema houses and other
aspects of Western culture. A split between the GPC and Al Islah may
not mean a repeat of the May-June 1994 situation, when the country
was torn by civil war, but it could lead to further violence in
Yemen.

WINDS OF EDUCATION: English requires 'professionals'

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By MINORU WADA
Special to Asahi Evening News

Are Japanese teachers seen as professionals? This question has
been vexing me since the Central Council for Education, an
advisory panel to the education minister, submitted the summary
of its discussions on education reforms of the 21st century in
Japan.

Profession is defined in my dictionary as "any type of work
which needs a special training or a particular skill, often one
which is respected because it involves a high level of
education."

Many dictionaries offer "teaching" as a typical example of a
profession. However, I wonder if this definition is taken
seriously by those who advocate the introduction of English at
the elementary school level in Japan.

With respect to the reforms in English education in Japan, the
council has proposed that English should be taught at elementary
schools throughout the country. Naturally, this proposal should
be accompanied by concrete administrative measures to implement
it. The quality of teachers who teach English to elementary
school children is the key to the success of the new proposal.

When you read the education reform summary carefully to know
what the council thinks about this important issue, you will find
a passage which goes like this: "For the purpose of providing
primary school children with the activities that will allow them
get used to English and the life and culture in foreign
countries, it is hoped that the potential of native speakers of
English and that of Japanese people who have had wide experience
living in foreign countries are utilized."

I think this is a great idea. However, it is surprising that
you can find no mention of the roles of Japanese elementary
school teachers who are "professionals" in elementary school
education. I wonder if the council does not expect Japanese
teachers to play an important role in the teaching of English in
elementary school.

A debate arose as to "professionalism" versus "amateurism"
when the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program (JET) was
established about 10 years ago.

In the debate, opponents of JET claimed that only
professionals were qualified to instruct Japanese students, but
those people involved in the debate--from Japanese educators to
assistant English teachers (AET) themselves--agreed that team
teaching of Japanese teachers of English and AETs would be the
best way to make the most of Japanese teachers of English.

What interested me much in the debate was the point that no
amount of theory or experience in an AET's native country was
necessarily effective in a Japanese setting because of the
sometimes conflicting teaching styles between Japanese teachers
and AETs, but what interested me even more was the fact that no
serious discussions were made about "professionalism" of the
Japanese teachers.

When it comes to the teaching at the elementary education
level, you need to pay much more attention to the psychology of
your students, and the psychology is often ingrained in Japanese
culture. I believe that Japanese teachers' role is essential to
the teaching of English in elementary school because they know
their children's behavior, values and so on much better than
people from foreign countries and people who have lived in
foreign countries for a long time.

But the problem with Japanese teachers in elementary school is
that they are not necessarily speakers of English, and because of
that they often have difficulties in communicating with native
speakers of English to whom they should explain the psychology of
Japanese school children.

I strongly believe that those people who advocate the teaching
of English at the elementary level should propose the ways to
solve this problem.

In team-taught English lessons in junior high schools it is
possible for Japanese teachers to give input about their students
to AETs because they are specialized English teachers and can
communicate in English. In team teaching, Japanese teachers can
use their knowledge and ability as "professional" teachers of
English.

Of course, I know quite well that there are communication
problems between Japanese teachers of English and AETs. But
theoretically, Japanese teachers can have the role of designing
and managing their classes by using their professionalism.

Bullying and violent behavior are now raging in schools in
Japan, and it is essential that teachers of any subject as well
as teachers of English learn more about their students' minds.
They should know more about how their students think, feel and
behave in their school life. They need to have more training as
"professionals" who can read the psychology of their children
more than any other people.

I wonder why advocates of the introduction of the teaching of
English do not say anything about this important aspect of
education. Their endeavors to improve English education in Japan
is epoch making. But that makes me wonder all the more why they
want to count so much on native speakers of English and Japanese
who have had the chance to live abroad. I want to know how they
think about Japanese teachers' professional expertise.

University.

EDUCATION: Sankhon grateful for strict upbringing

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Ousmane Sankhon, the public-relations manager of the
Japan-Guinea Association, has become a popular figure on TV talk
shows. A former official with the foreign ministry of Guinea,
Sankhon, 47, worked at the Guinean Embassy in Japan for eight
years beginning in 1972 before becoming a celebrity.

Sankhon said his father, who ran a farm while serving as a
local official, kept strict discipline in his very large family,
discipline he is grateful for.

I was born to a very large family. Altogether it had about 45
members--my father, three mothers, 22 brothers and sisters, and
relatives. In Guinea, such an extended family is not uncommon.

Dad worked on the farm while doing a stint as a local public
servant. He knew everything about his family. He knew how many
chickens we had, when the children got new shoes, how many dishes
there were in the kitchen, and so on.

He was tough with his children, so I feared him very much.
When he was angry he would thrust out his right forefinger. I was
very scared.

I got punished many times because I used to pick fights with
some of my brothers. I was also whipped on the leg or the hips.
It hurt me awfully. Dad had 22 belt whips on the rack at the
front door--one for each of his children

But he was also kind to us. How sweet he looked when he
smiled. Every time I got a good grade report I showed it to him.
"Good boy," he said, and he always bought me a shirt and a pair
of shoes. Dad and I went shopping together, walking hand in hand.
I was very happy.

My father taught me the importance of responsibility. Once,
when I was taking care of the sheep, one of them went astray. I
couldn't have my supper until I found the animal and brought it
home. It was already dark, but I looked for it with the help of
my brothers. I was desperate.

I also worked on the farm. Dad told me to plow a plot of land,
but he left me to do it my way. Sometimes I worked until 8 at
night. I remember the happy moments when I walked home, carrying
a hoe on my shoulder

In Guinea, adults severely scold children for making mischief
even if they are neighbors' children. When a kid has done
something wrong, you take him to his parents, and they always
thank you.

People in Guinea respect families that strictly discipline
their children. Parents with a spoiled child often take him to
such a family so he can live there for a while and change his bad
habits.

My father died when I was in the third grade of middle school.
I like the saying that goes something like this, "Parental advice
and cold sake have a slow effect." I am grateful that Dad was
tough with me. I respected him. I still do.

During a Japanese TV talk show I was on, the MC asked a senior
high school girl what she disliked most about her father. "He
stinks," she said. I was surprised.

I like Japan very much, so let me offer a bit of advice. The
most important thing for children is their families. Working
fathers should go home early. And they should be in good shape
when they get home.

Imagine a father who gets home late every night, drunk and his
tie loose. I wonder what his children would think of him.

EDUCATION: In language-school battle for students, a gentler success

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By KAZUNAGA FUKUSHIMA
Asahi Evening News

As large language schools successfully win more students
through expensive advertising and by opening accessible branches
in expensive locations, more smaller schools are feeling the
squeeze. Some are even being pushed out of business.

But one small English language school is finding a way to
survive in this highly competitive environment by offering
something many of the larger, profit-oriented schools
don't--quality of education.

Quest 21, which provides language courses designed to suit
individual needs, was opened near JR Kichijoji Station in April
by some former teachers of Sony Language Laboratory (SLL) after
that school became one of the casualties of the fierce battle for
students.

SLL, which was a pioneer among language schools in this
country after it was started in 1962 by Sony Corp.'s subsidiary
Sony Enterprise, was sold to other schools in March. A Sony
Enterprise spokesman said SLL faced ballooning deficits in recent
years as more students were wooed by new schools with big
advertising campaigns.

Teachers became concerned that the takeover of SLL by other
schools, which was announced in February, would mean a departure
from the school's original teaching methods and materials.

After unsuccessfully petitioning Sony Enterprise to continue
running SLL, a group of the teachers decided to open Quest 21 to
maintain an education policy of placing priority on individual
needs.

Quest 21 produces courses of study for individual students who
have specific purposes in mind when they want to learn English,
said Duane Sturm, a former SLL teacher and now president of Quest
21.

For example, when a housewife said she wanted to master
English in a short period of time in accordance with her specific
needs and ability, the school prepared lessons to meet her
schedule.

In another case, responding to a request by a mother who has a
disabled son and who wants to attend international conferences
for the disabled, the school held a lecture on words and
expressions that are often encountered in such occasions.

Unlike most language schools, Quest 21 hasn't adopted a
flex-time system, in which schools sell students a large number
of lessons in a package deal. As such deals usually require
advanced payment, schools can secure longer-term financial
stability. However, the advance payment system is often cause for
conflicts when students want to quit the school and demand
refund.

Quest 21 collects tuition fees based only on three-month
semester. Kunitsugu Noritake, a former SLL student and one of the
founders of Quest 21, said financial stability is attainable even
without advance payments.

"If the human relationship between students and teachers is
solid, students won't quit the school," he said.

He said the school expects students who appreciate the school
to bring in other students. Some come to take advantage of the
excellent teachers.

For example, one student returned to the school because of the
enthusiasm of her teacher, Patricia Sturm, wife of Duane and
another founding member of Quest 21.

"The reason why I come to Quest 21 is to want to be taught by
Mrs. Patricia," she said. "She has a technique which induces the
attendants to spontaneously speak their opinion in English."

The student said she likes the teacher's interest in using
newspapers and magazines as teaching material.

The students at Quest 21 have an opportunity to freely
exchange opinions with teachers during discussion class, for
which students get to choose the theme.

Then the teachers at Quest 21 clip the articles relating to
the themes from magazines and newspapers to encourage attendants
to aggressively discuss issues.

For instance, in a recent class, eight housewives who are
students selected euthanasia as the topic for discussion.

Quest 21 is also well-known because its teaching method works
well for students who have returned from abroad. Returning
students tend to lose their positive attitude toward speaking and
discussing in English because of cultural conflicts, said

Patricia Sturm.

She encourages returnees to maintain and improve their
positive attitude through discussion with other students who have
the same experience of having lived overseas.

But questions about whether such a cost-inefficient school can
sustain itself remain.

Noritake says Quest 21 needs 60 more students than the 90 it
currently has for a stable operation.

"But," he said, "we don't insist on profits. Rather, we expect
Quest 21 to be recognized as a non-profit educational foundation
in the future."

Duane Sturm agrees.

"Although it isn't easy to keep running Quest 21, we want to
keep providing student-oriented education," he said.

Fake budget report wastes \13 million

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

A statistics office in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries submitted a false explanation in seeking a 13
million yen budget allocation for a new machine, well-placed
sources said.

A funding request based on the false explanation has already
been incorporated into the ministry's fiscal 1997 budget request.

The office in the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau's
Statistics and Information Department wants the new device to
replace one it now uses to enhance work efficiency in its
troublesome task of calculating the rice harvest index.

But the 13 million yen request was made in the name of other
products, since the device sought by the statistics office has
not yet been developed and thus the funding item was not likely
to pass muster. The office was planning to ask a manufacturer to
develop a pilot model after obtaining the 13 million yen.

Officials in the office now admit that the request is a
violation of procurement rules, and said that they will use the
funds in the budget request to purchase the products specified.

But those products are, in fact, not needed, representing a
waste of public money. "We wanted to promote a plan as fast as
possible," said an official.

in the office. "Because it came to light, we decided to buy
the products that we requested, although taxpayers' money will be
wasted."

BUSINESS: INTERVIEW: TAIKI SAITO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, YAMAICHI: RESEARCH
INSTITUTE

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Domestic economic ripples from the U.S. election

By AMY SHIRATORI
Asahi Evening News

Q: Do you think U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposed
economic policies would be effective?

A: If the Republicans retain control of Congress, Clinton's
efforts would be blocked, and no policy change would come about.

The budget deficit would inch down, but not disappear in 2002
as Clinton says. The financial markets have already taken this
scenario into account.

Q: How effective do you think Republican candidate Bob Dole's
economic policies would be?

A: Dole's proposed policies would work only if the Republicans
have full control of Congress. If the Democrats control Congress,
Dole might compromise with them in a detrimental way, agreeing to
accept spending to protect low-income people because his proposed
tax cuts would benefit the middle to upper class.

I don't think Dole will get elected for proposing an income
tax cut.

Ordinary citizens did not look favorably on the debate to
balance the budget earlier this year, because they knew that
Republican-proposed tax cuts benefit the rich mostly.

Republicans and the supply-side economists always exaggerate
the scope of economic growth resulting from a tax cut, and the
cut would not bring about a balanced budget by 2002.

The capital gains tax cut proposed by both Clinton and Dole is
not looked on favorably either because people realize it needs to
be balanced by cuts in medical welfare.

Q: Which candidate's becoming president will benefit Japan?

A: It would be best if the status quo is maintained. It is
uncertain what a Republican president would do. Republicans are
proponents of free trade, but past Republican presidents have
taken a tough trade stance.

Democrats espouse protectionist policies and press Japan to
open up its market, but Japan's trade balance is dropping, and it
can hardly be said anymore that the U.S. trade deficit is caused
solely by Japan.

I think the trade surplus will continue to drop although the
rate of decline will slow down. The yen will average 105 yen to
113 yen in six months.

Q: Would the adoption of Clinton's proposals lead to slow U.S.
growth?

A: I estimate the economic growth between July and September
to be between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. But I project economic
growth between October and December will dip below 2 percent, and
that for the first half of next year it will be under 1 percent.

The U.S. economy shows both strength and underlying weakness.
The strength is that corporations have completed their inventory
adjustments, so they can easily increase production.

But consumption, particularly for durable goods and housing,
will not increase further. This is because the long-term interest
rate increased 1 percent from the beginning of the year, and
expansion has already lasted for 5! years.

Another point is that past consumption was made by borrowing
money, and households need to adjust their balance sheets.

Finally, the layoff of people hired in conjunction with the
Atlanta Olympics and the end of Olympic-related construction will
squeeze down on private demand. But I don't think the United
States will enter a recession.

The Fed can easily loosen its monetary policy because unlike
in the past recovery phase, prices have not been rising.
Expansion will pick up again in the latter half of next year.

Q: Is it unlikely that the Fed will raise interest rates?

A: That's not clear, because mixed indicators showing both a
strong and weak economy will be reported. I think there is a 70
percent chance that the Fed will not raise the federal funds rate
this year.

But the Fed might raise the rate as a preventive measure
against inflation at the next Federal Open Market Committee
meeting Sept. 24 if a strong index is reported. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is a Republican, so he does not have to feel reluctant
to raise rates before the election.

But Greenspan will not raise the federal fund rate in October
or November because that would be seen as a political move.

Q: What will be the effect on the economy if the Democrats
take charge of Congress?

A: The Democrats are now becoming favorites to win in the
House.

The current economic growth has been brought about because of
corporate restructuring. Corporations have been reinvigorated,
but private individuals have not, and their dissatisfaction has
worked to the advantage of the Democratic Party, which has
patronized the middle and lower class.

Democrats controlling Congress would tend to increase welfare
spending for these people, and blunt efforts to reduce the budget
deficit. The market has a deep distrust of a Democratic Congress.
There will be a triple downward spiral of falling stocks, bonds
and the dollar.

Q: Should Japan raise interest rates or compile a
supplementary budget for more fiscal stimulus?

A: Japan will not raise interest rates in September or October
even if the U.S. Fed raises the rate, because of the weak Tankan
report on business confidence in an economic recovery last week.

Japan should do no more than to increase the call rate late in
the year, if necessary, and provide another 2 trillion yen
construction spending boost in a supplementary budget, which I
think the government will do.

This is necessary to offset a 5 trillion yen tax increase from
the consumption tax hike next April.

Taiki Saito became senior economist and deputy general manager
of the economic research division at Yamaichi Research Institute
of Securities & Economics, Inc., in December 1994. He joined
Yamaichi Securities Co. in 1978 after graduating from
Hitotsubashi University. He specializes in the U.S. economy.

National Briefs

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Music star falsely declared taxes

Tetsuya Komuro, a musical impresario living in Tokyo's Minato
Ward, filed a modified income tax return after the Tokyo Regional
Taxation Bureau found he had failed to correctly report income of
about 110 million yen earned in fiscal 1994, tax officials said.

The 37-year-old producer and composer had reported the 110
million yen income, including royalties on compact discs he had
produced, as business income of his company, Tetsuya Komuro
State, instead of personal income.

The tax officials ruled the amount as Komuro's taxable
personal income because he had not transferred the copyrights of
the CDs to the company.

Komuro composed and produced some popular songs, for singer
Ryoko Shinohara and other musicians, which became million sellers
in 1994. He declared the royalties on the songs as his company's
income.

Girl dies while crossing tracks

A 12-year-old girl who went out Sunday night to find her
missing cat was killed when she entered a level crossing and was
hit by a train, police said.

Ayako Kume, a student at Higashi Elementary school in
Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, had left home saying, "I'll look
for my cat," according to her father Seiichi, 47.

The area is serviced by the JR Minobu Line.

Climbers tumble to their deaths

A rock climber died after falling Sunday from the
Ichinokura-sawa cliff face on Tanigawa-dake mountain in Minakami,
Gunma Prefecture, police said.

The dead climber was identified by police as Kozo Murotani,
43, a designer living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. Murotani was
climbing the cliff with a friend Sunday morning when he
apparently slipped and fell about 100 meters, police said.

Ichinokura-sawa is one of the most popular rock-climbing
cliffs in the nation and was crowded throughout the weekend,
police said.

In a separate accident, another cliff scaler died Saturday
evening on Machihodo-sawa of Koidemata-yama, a mountain in the
Tanigawa Range, in Niiharu, Gunma Prefecture, police said.

The dead man was identified by police Masanori Ito, 36, a
Kawasaki city official living in Aoba Ward, Yokohama.

Company officials found dead

The president and the director of an Osaka-based company were
found dead in the company's reception room Sunday evening, police
said.

Yasuo Hiyane, 60, president of Oyasu-Yosetsu Kogyo-sho, a
welding shop of Toyonaka City, Osaka, killed himself by taking
poison after bludgeoning to death Hideharu Matsumoto, 52, the
firm's director, police said. Their bodies were found by the
president's wife.

According to police, Matsumoto was found lying face down. He
apparently had been hit by a blunt weapon that left a bruise on
his head, police said. Hiyane's body was leaning on a chair with
a bottle of medicine beside him. Hiyane's body showed no sign of
being hit, police said.

Hashimoto hesitant on ekection date

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Sunday that he will
decide in the middle of this month the dates for convening an
extraordinary Diet session and for dissolving the Lower House for
an election.

The main issue before the extraordinary Diet session will be a
supplementary budget.

Hashimoto said he will decide the political schedules after
learning the results of Okinawa Prefecture's Sunday referendum on
a reduction of U.S. military bases and for a report on the
April-June gross domestic product (GDP) to be released in
mid-September.

Hashimoto revealed his plans during separate talks with Koichi
Kato, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
and Finance Minister Wataru Kubo.

Kato told Hashimoto that the LDP is divided over whether there
should be an early dissolution of the Lower House.

Hashimoto and Kubo agreed to cautiously consider the need for
a supplementary budget after they learn the result of the GDP
report.

Hashimoto had said earlier that he would call an extraordinary
Diet session in October to discuss a supplementary budget and
other issues. But he seems to have changed his mind for fear that
an extra session would lead to an immediate dissolution of the
Lower House.

If the extraordinary session is called, the ruling coalition
will face fierce attacks from opposition parties on next April's
hike in the consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent, and
allegations that Kato recieved a questionable donation from
now-defunct steel maker Kyowa Co.

The main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) says
it will submit a bill in the extraordinary session to keep the
consumption tax rate at its current 3 percent.

Shinshinto members also say that unless Kato resigns his post
as LDP secretary-general they will boycott all deliberations in
the extraordinary Diet session.

Sasebo dockyard row flares again

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

A six-month-old agreement that ended a heated dockyard dispute
between a Japanese shipbuilder and the U.S. Navy at the port of
Sasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture is threatening to unravel because
of ship repair regulations.

SSK (Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.) agreed in February to end
its opposition to the U.S. Navy's plan to use free-of-charge the
company's No. 3 drydock to repair a warship after the navy hired
the company to do the work.

But negotiations over the terms of the contract for the work
on Bellow Wood, an amphibious assault ship, broke down when the
navy insisted that the company follow American
regulations--including those governing working conditions--when
doing the repairs.

"The U.S. forces have the mentality of the post-war Occupation
Forces," said SKK President Ryutaro Hasegawa. "No. 3 Dock will be
taken away (from our control) little by little."

On Thursday, hundreds of company union members held a rally at
the dockyard, surrounding the 900-meter circumference No. 3 dock
in a human chain to protest the planned repair work on the Bellow
Wood at the dock.

A 1968 agreement between SSK, the Japanese government and the
United States gives U.S. forces priority in using the drydock at
no charge, on just seven days' notice. SKK assumed control of the
dock from the Japanese government in the same year.

Tension erupted between the company and the U.S. forces in
mid-January when the navy requested the use of the drydock to do
seven months' of repair work on the Bellow Wood.

The company argued that it would lose about 36 billion yen of
its income if the dock was occupied for such a long period.

"I have always been pro-American. In emergencies, we will help
U.S. forces. But in normal times, we don't welcome something that
will send the company into bankruptcy," said Hasegawa.

The issue was considered settled when the U.S. Navy agreed to
contract the repair work on Bellow Wood to SSK, with the terms of
the work to be decided by the company, Hasegawa said.

Bacteria facilities barely coping

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

The nation's two storage facilities for bacilli samples are so
ancient and understaffed that future epidemics of bacterial
infection will be hard to contain, bacteriologists say.

Bacteria samples are necessary for determining the cause of
infection and studying methods of treatment, as well as for
understanding their genetic composition.

But they are stored at only two places in Japan--Tokyo
University and Osaka University.

Directors of these facilities complain that little has been
done over the years to improve these storage areas.

"There's been no progress so far," said professor Takeshi
Honda, the director of the Osaka University facility. "If the
present situation is allowed to continue, I must say that the
next time there is an outbreak, researchers may not be able to
come up with timely solutions to contain it."

The two facilities are run on an Education Ministry budget
that can hardly be called generous--a very lean 1.2 million yen a
year for Tokyo and slightly over 800,000 yen for Osaka, the
bacteriologists say.

And the ministry recognizes only one full-time researcher
each.

The Tokyo University storage facility occupies a corner of a
research wing dating back to the late 1920s. The tiny,
16.5-square-meter space holds refrigerators and freezers that are
crammed with test tubes containing 500 kinds of germs, including
O-157, salmonella, cholera, tuberculosis and dysentery bacteria.

Following the massive O-157 food poisoning epidemic, the
facility provided about 10 research institutes of food makers in
the Kanto area with samples of this E. coli bacillus.

But with its meager operating budget, inadequate equipment and
the barest skeleton staff, the outfit is a far cry from its much
more developed British, German and American counterparts, the
bacteriologists say.

For this reason, many Japanese researchers send for samples
from overseas institutes.

"Unlike the American facility at Maryland, which publishes a
catalogue of several thousand strains of bacteria and supplies
samples to researchers around the world, we are unable to even
meet all domestic requests for samples," lamented professor Shiro
Kanegasaki, director of the Tokyo University facility.

"And our freezers are ancient, `vintage' affairs," he said.
"We have to haul in tons of dry ice whenever there is a power
outage."

The situation is no better at the Osaka University facility
which mainly stores E. coli bacilli.

"We've had to discard some samples for lack of storage space,"
Honda said.

Some researchers have appealed to the Health and Welfare
Ministry to create bacteria sample storage facilities and
pertinent information services of the European and American
caliber, but the ministry has "no immediate plans for action," a
ministry official said.

In addition, Honda of Osaka University has been trying to
persuade the Education Ministry to upgrade the existing
facilities.

In recent years, bacteriology has been steadily overtaken by
virology, according to Kanegasaki. In 1977, 56 of 80 medical
schools around the nation taught bacteriology. Today, the course
is offered at less than half of those schools.

"The declining status of bacteriology as a branch of medical
science has definitely to do with the present plight of our
facility and Osaka University's," Kanegasaki said.

COMMENTARY: Politics lost for weords

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By YOICHI FUNABASHI
Asahi Shimbun

CHICAGO--After covering the Republican National Convention in
San Diego and the Democratic National Convention here, I am sick
and tired of speeches. I feel as though I made the trips to cover
speech contests.

The conventions were held to nominate the presidential
candidates of the two parties but a succession of speakers
preceded the nominees, Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton, to
the rostrum. Most of their speeches were partisan, just battering
the opposition. Could they really be called speeches?

The speakers' words were packaged with audio-visual effects.
During a speech on crime, a rape victim stepped onto the podium
and talked about the horrors she had experienced, interrupting
the speech like a television commercial.

Other speakers waded into the audience like talk-show hosts.
Giant screens made hilarious exchanges between speaker and
audience possible.

At a time when music and videos are packaged to sell products
and people, it may not be strange that speeches are "packaged"
like music videos. Does this mean that the karaoke machine is now
an essential part of giving a speech?

These gimmicks, I suspect, are causing a qualitative
deterioration in speeches, weakening the power of words.

In the interest of playing up the appearance of party unity,
both parties scheduled speeches that deviated from the "scripted"
party line only at times when the major national networks would
not air them.

While shortened speeches were a welcome phenomenon, there was
a quid pro quo: a preponderance of slogans like bumper stickers.
And there were too many tear-jerking stories.

Yet some speeches were moving. Colin Powell, former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged Republicans to be magnanimous
to those with whom they disagree. Based on his own experience,
Senator John McCain portrayed Dole as a "quiet hero" who went
about his work silently. Despite his disagreement with Clinton on
welfare, the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave a sermon on why he should be
supported in his reelection bid.

My overall impression is still that too many words were used
at the conventions. But I attribute the torrential verbiage to
the conviction that "politics are a matter of persuasion," and
persuasion primarily depends on words.

Exactly the opposite is true of Japanese politics. But this is
neither laudable nor tasteful. The Japanese machismo along the
lines of the well-known TV commercial catchphrase--"A man
silently drinks such-and-such beer"--is nothing but an expression
of distrust in words and reason.

During the Morihiro Hosokawa administration, Teiichi Tanigaki,
a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, attacked the prime
minister for his flip-flops over his proposal to replace the
consumption tax with a national welfare tax.

Speaking in a Lower House plenary session, Tanigaki said,
"When politicians are lost for words, power of speech, they have
no choice but to rely on muscles and money. Don't you think a
fascistic `muscle power' mode of politics is holding sway?"

The accusation was to the point. But the same thing can be
said of the present coalition government of Liberal Democrats,
Social Democrats, and Sakigake.

Remarks made by government and coalition officials over the
planned 2-percent increase in the consumption tax to 5 percent
next April are so divergent that they make one wonder which of
them is true. What strikes me is that the government and the
coalition are lost for words.

It seems that in Japan, words lack even the frail lifespan of
ice cream.

The approach of the next Lower House election under the
single-seat constituency system makes the political aphasia--the
loss of ability to use or understand words-- all the more
worrying for party politics in Japan.

The single-seat system has been adopted on the premise that it
will force voters to choose between parties, which will have to
spell out their differences in policies and in the leadership
capacity of their presidents. It is a system that works only when
parties vie with words.

Japanese politicians should give more speeches. I do not care
whether they act like talk-show hosts or employ a karaoke
machine.

In fact, under the present circumstances, I cannot afford to
care for the quality of speeches. I call for--no, I plead for--a
speech contest among the parties in Japan.

Matsumoto told to pay \790 million for gassing

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

The Tokyo District Court this morning ordered Aum Shinrikyo
founder Chizuo Matsumoto and other two cult leaders to pay 790
million yen in damage compensation to victims of the cult's Tokyo
subway sarin attack last year and to their families.

Presiding judge Hisashi Yamazaki said the three should be
regarded as having tacitly admitted to their involvement in the
gassing, because they failed to challenge the plaintiffs' claim
that they ordered and conducted the attack.

Although Matsumoto, 41, known as Shoko Asahara, had refused to
answer whether he admitted the same allegation in a criminal
trial, the civil court today said that he was the mastermind of
the subway attack.

The sarin nerve gas attack on March 20, 1995, killed 12 and
sickened 5,500.

Those ordered to pay compensation along with Matsumoto were
Ikuo Hayashi, 49, the former head of the sect's self-designed
"Treatment Ministry," and Masami Tsuchiya, 31, the former head of
the "Chemical Division."

Hayashi has admitted his involvement in the gassing, while
Tsuchiya opted to remain silent when accused.

Twenty-two people who were sickened in the gassing and 16
bereaved family members of seven who died filed the suit to seek
790 million yen in damages from the three and 12 others.

Matsumoto, Hayashi and Tsuchiya and 12 other Aum members.

Three of the other 12 named in the suit are still fugitives.

The civil suit will be considered settled when any of the 15
accused pay the money.

Matsumoto had already been ordered to pay over 360 million yen
in compensation in other damage suits related to crimes allegedly
caused by the sect, and in refund of donations the sect had
accepted from followers.

Matsumoto is believed to have little private assets, and has
so far paid only 650,000 yen out of 10 million yen demanded by
one group of plaintiffs in refund of their donations to Aum.

Hurt Akebono at a crossroads

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By JOHN De BELLIS
Asahi Evening News

If you consider Akebono's 12-3 record at the Nagoya tournament
in July after six months of crippling injuries, you begin to
understand that this is a man who is capable of beating the odds.

The 27-year-old Hawaiian-born yokozuna defied probability by
blazing through the ranks of Japan's most traditional sport. But
becoming the first non-Japanese to reach the sport's pinnacle was
arduous, and now he suffers the pain to substantiate it.

Injuries have put his longevity in doubt. His knees, on which
he had surgery in 1993, are the main problem. Too often, they
have given way beneath his 204-centimeter, 224-kilogram frame.

"When I was on the rise, I thought I was invincible," Akebono
said, flashing a smile that seemed to fade with the realization
that his career could be cut short. "I am also at the point that
if I get over this wall, it will decide my future, how long I do
sumo," he said quietly. "I want to be yokozuna for 10 years."

But as Akebono--formerly Chad Rowan and now a naturalized
Japanese citizen--prepares for the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament,
which begins next Sunday, there are doubts as to whether his body
can continue to endure the punishment it has absorbed during his
eight years in sumo.

His Hawaiian-born stable master, Azumazeki--formerly Jesse
Kuhaulua--has some concerns about his protege's training methods.

"He struggles because he doesn't work on his shiko (sumo-style
leg stomps for developing the lower body) more," Azumazeki said.
"If he does that, I think he can stay on top another four or five
years.

"You need shiko to succeed. It gives you balance and helps you
dig. Look at Konishiki. His size is tremendous (274 kilograms),
but he still does his shiko practice. That's why he's lasted so
long."

When Akebono pulled out of the January tournament on the
fourth day, he began to realize his mortality. The explosiveness
was gone from his tachiai (charge), so he was unable to attain
proper balance.

"When you get hurt in one place, you tend to favor that spot,
and then other things begin to be affected," Akebono said.

In March, he decided to skip the spring tournament because of
lingering pain in his knees and ankles. And it was painful--both
figuratively and literally--for him to watch his career slowing
to a halt.

"Many athletes who are at the top of their sport go through
trials," Akebono said, admitting that he has entertained
self-doubts and considered a world in which he could not wake up
each day and know he was the best. "I was doing so well after I
became yokozuna; I thought that nothing could stop me."

But that perception was shattered. Now, questions swirl around
his mind. Is retirement near? "Sometimes I think about it, but
not every day," he said. "I'd get stressed out."

If it weren't for the bad knees, it could be like it was
before--massive arms pumping and thrusting, opponents landing in
the third row.

"It frustrates me," Akebono said. "You think about things that
you would never consider if you weren't hurt."

But he said he believes he will overcome the injuries. And
even get better. "When I was hurt, I studied my sumo on video. I
still watch videos. I watch them to improve my techniques."

An avid Internet surfer, Akebono occasionally comes across
sumo interviews and analyses, or reads them in newspapers. Some
of them question his future.

"I don't really pay attention to that," Akebono said. "What
people see, and the person doing it, are two different things. I
haven't been shining like before, but I think, deep down inside,
that if I keep pushing, it will come back."

By the time Akebono entered the dohyo for the Tokyo summer
tournament in May, he was learning how to wrestle with pain. He
racked up a respectable 10-5 record and began to feel that
returning to top form was truly possible.

By Nagoya, Akebono was again dominating opponents. He went
12-3. "I thought I was going to take the whole thing," he said.
"But on the 14th day I hurt my shoulder."

He regards that injury as nothing more than a bump on the road
to recovery. "Right now my timing is off and I still feel pain in
my shoulder," Akebono said, "but if I keep practicing hard, I
should be ready."

MY FAVORITE HOME PAGE: Motor Link Page

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

"Just like many other freelance writers, I use this home page
when I need to check some detailed facts about automobiles when I
face a deadline," said magazine columnist Kazuhisa Kimura.

The Motor Link Page is divided into sections representing 18
major car makers from all over the world--five Japanese and 13
foreign.

If you click, for example, on the Nissan section, you can see
not only the home page of the firm but also the home pages of its
overseas subsidiaries.

In the site for Mercedes Benz, visitors can see
personally-produced pages on the manufacturer's vehicles as well
as its official Web site.

Kimura, a great lover of cars, accesses the Motor Link Page
quite often to update his knowledge about Italian, German and
other countries' cars. He came across the home page, while
surfing on the Internet.

"The home page is useful to get new information about foreign
cars, as well as their specifications--especially when I don't
have much time to check my facts before deadline," the writer
said, adding that the site is also fun visually.

However, Kimura said the quality and quantity of information
provided by the home page needs some improvement in some fields
in order to become on a par with popular Western auto magazines.

It's been about a year since he started to use the Internet
for professional and hobby-related purposes. His first encounter
with the Internet came at an Internet cafe, he said.

BOOKS: A marriage of religions

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By AKIO OGAWA
Asahi Evening News

While many Japanese still bow and pray in front of their
shrines and temples, many take the origins of these rituals for
granted--as if the mystery of religion is timeless.

Before Buddhism arrived in 538 A.D. via China and Korea, Japan
was a land of kami (a variety of indigenous, almost-animistic
Shinto deities), and school textbooks tell us what happened since
then--coexistence of Shintoism and Buddhism.

But these same texts largely fail to explain how and why this
remarkable merger took place in the first place.

Akio Yoshie, a history professor at the University of Tokyo,
tries to fill in the void using language understandable to laymen
in his latest book, "Shinbutsu Shugo (Merger of Shintoism and
Buddhism, Iwanami Shoten, 650 yen).

The history starts with what is called the Yamato Court,
Japan's first central authority, which consolidated its rule in
the mid-seventh century, and, in the early eighth century, its
rulers had two of Japan's first historical books compiled. The
books depicted the ruling family as the descendants of
mythological Shinto kami from heaven.

In those days, the court's rulers doubled as the highest
Shinto priests. As such, they ruled over various clan leaders,
village chieftains and grassroots villagers who believed in the
variety of kami. Clan leaders and village chieftains also had
similar double roles in their communities.

In other words, the original Shinto was the backbone of the
Yamato Court's rule.

But Yoshie points out in his book that a strange thing
happened from the eighth to ninth century--the mushrooming of
jingu-ji, or Buddhist temples in and around Shinto shrine
precincts.

Why, according to Yoshie, has to do with the production of
rice.

During the Nara era (710-794), the rice production increased
by leaps and bounds, thanks to fast expanding irrigation networks
and newly reclaimed paddy fields.

The change produced a wide economic gap between the local
government officials and country rulers and the villagers and
farm hands. The wealthy feared reprisals from the poor, and at
the same time they felt a strong sense of guilt.

Against this backdrop, Yoshie says, the uneasy rich sought
comfort and salvation from Buddhism, a religion of tolerance, by
building the jingu-ji.

The central rulers, who were also the highest kami priests,
had no choice but to leave Buddhism and the jingu-ji since their
own local heads were among the newly converted.

According to Yoshie, this was the first stage in the curious
mixing of Shintoism and Buddhism.

The second stage began with tales of ghosts and disasters that
struck the imperial palace, killing noblemen and terrifying
emperors to death. These events during the early part of the
Heian era (794-1195) were recorded in various documents in the
ninth and early 10th centuries.

The most famous ghost was that of Sugawara-no-Michizane
(845-903), a top nobleman-politician who lost in a power struggle
and died in exile in Kyushu.

Social unrest characterized this period as Emperor Uda
(867-931) and Emperor Daigo (885-930) in particular tried to
consolidate the imperial dynasty again by reasserting imperial
ownership of the nation's land that had been mainly privatized a
century earlier.

Bloody power struggles

This and other maneuvers by the emperors triggered power
struggles, sometimes bloody ones, in Kyoto. The social unrest
coincided with the burgeoning of the samurai who opposed to the
imperial rule.

That was where the Buddhist monks--especially, the esoteric
ones who were steadily building up their influence--hopped in.

They presided over one prayer session after another in many
parts of the country on the pretext of ridding the nation of the
ghosts and evils they blamed for the disasters. In reality,
however, they were fanning the social unrest.

At the peak of the disorder, Yoshie argues, Taira-no-Masakado
(?-940), a samurai leader, seized power in the Kanto region and
proclaimed himself an emperor in 939.

The emperors reacted by trying to soothe and overcome the
ghost of Sugawara-no-Michizana, which they saw as the symbol and
cause of the social unrest.

They hosted their own prayer sessions. For almost 30 years,
they also paid repeated tributes and contributions to the
Anraku-ji Temple that took care of the exiled nobleman's tomb in
Kyushu and to Kyoto's Kitano Shrine which was dedicated to his
soul.

During that time, samurai and Buddhist monks gradually changed
their strategy, realizing that it was easier to expand their
influence by joining hands with the imperial palace rather than
rebelling against it. This concluded the second stage.

In the third stage in the development of the religious
coexistence, the imperial rulers and noblemen along with their
courtiers and ladies-in-waiting began to practice their own
religion more vigorously, "sharpening their sense of purity"
which is the overriding concern in Shinto.

Ironically, however, the sharpened sense of purity paved the
way for the ruling class to ardently subscribe to the Buddhist
belief in Jodo, or the utopian "Pure Land beyond the Western
Ocean," by the end of the 10th century.

The development, writes Yoshie, was a new stage of coexistence
or rather integration between Shintoism and Buddhism.

In the further evolution of the integration or the fourth
stage, Buddhist theologians tried to absorb Shintoism beginning
in the late Heian era (the late 12th century) with a new theory.
Under this theory, all Shinto deities were interpreted as
incarnations of a variety of Buddhist deities, including Bosatsu
(bodhisattva).

Yoshie points out that the new theory turned out to be a great
success. Most shrines throughout the country had accepted it by
the middle of the Kamakura era (1185-1333). Even the deities at
the Ise Shrine at the top of the imperial Shinto hierarchy
followed suit.

Why the success? Yoshie explains that the emerging samurai
class (the Kamakura government was the first samurai regime)
sought Buddhist theories that pardoned killing--the job of the
samurai--over the Shinto's emphasis on purity. The newly emerging
merchant class also preferred Buddhist theories that preached
equality for all since the controlling samurai class at the time
began establishing a strictly hierarchical society.

The book ends with what Yoshie calls the fourth stage of the
integration during which Buddhism gained the upper hand.

But from where Yoshie's book leaves off, the relationship
continued to go through further twists, some violent.

Nationalistic Shinto theories developed during the Edo era and
ultimately culminated during the Meiji Restoration in the
establishment of the State Shinto where the religion again
centered around the imperial family.

Consequently, the Japanese today bow in front of many shrines
dedicated to original kami and not incarnations of the Buddhist
deities.

Many questions remain about what happened to the complicated
marriage of Shinto and Buddhism after Yoshie's so-called fourth
stage.

The author would do well to provide some answers with a sequel
to this well-researched and informative book.

FEATURE: Lack of water-safety education taking its toll

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By LILY MATSUBARA
Asahi Evening News

Every year, July first marks the beginning of the National
Police Agency's (NPA) annual ritual of tallying up the casualties
of summer leisure.

And every year, the Japanese newspapers' faithful devotion to
a three-inch column on the death toll hardly raises an eyebrow.
They pass for mere statistics. Nothing more, nothing less. And
tragically, nothing learned.

Most of these leisure-activity accidents occur at sea, about
twice as many as in the mountains. An average of 2,000 cases of
water-related accidents are annually filed with the NPA (compared
to 1600 mountaineering accidents). Of these, 1300 result in
deaths. And approximately 200 children die each summer.

But despite these grim statistics, the Ministry of Education's
guidelines on physical education classes do not include practical
lessons in water safety.

While children are all taught to swim freestyle and
breaststroke for at least 25 meters by the time they reach junior
high school, they are not instructed on the fundamental
principles of water safety or told of the many dangers of
swimming in the sea.

"In elementary school, teachers brought us outside to the
(public) roads to teach us about road safety," said Masahiko
Kobayashi, Secretary-General of the Japan Life-Saving
Association. "There are no similar practical lessons in water
safety when it comes to swimming lessons in schools."

According to the NPA, 45 percent of water related accidents
occur in the sea while only 2.3 percent occur in swimming pools.
Another 31 percent of the accidents occur in rivers.

"Those involved in accidents at sea are either swept away by
the tide and undercurrents or get caught in the wave and drown,"
said Kobayashi. "There are even cases of people being swept away
by their floaters because of high winds."

The NPA says most, if not all, accidents are avoidable.

"Even when bad weather causes an accident at sea, it is still
an avoidable problem," said a spokesman for the NPA. "There are
always announcements on weather conditions, and it is up to you
to heed them or not."

Carelessness

Both Kobayashi and the NPA point out that ultimately, personal
indiscretion is the cause of death. The rules are simple --if you
drink or feel unwell, don't swim; look out for coming waves; be
aware of tides and undercurrents; don't use floaters at sea in
high winds.

But, as simple as they seem, the rules still need to be
taught.

"Schools in close vicinity to the sea might have practical
lessons in water safety. But for now, we do not have plans to
include compulsory personal survival skills in our curricula
guideline," said Nobuyuki Ikeda at the Education Ministry's
Physical Education Department.

According to Kobayashi, this problem is compounded by the fact
that there are only 2,500 accredited lifeguards--officially
certified by the Japan Life-Saving Association--spread over just
50 of Japan's 1,400 beaches. The rest of the lifeguards are made
up of uncertified high school students and local residents
working at summer jobs.

In Australia, where life-saving is well established, the ratio
of lifeguards to the population is about 1:170; in Japan, the
ratio is 1:48,000.

"There are insufficient life-saving clubs in Japan," Kobayashi
said. "Only 40 clubs are registered with our association. And
although life-saving clubs at the local level and in universities
have been increasing in the last five years, it is a sad fact
that we have very few officially qualified life-savers in
beaches."

Simply learning how to swim is not enough. Children must learn
that swimming in pools is drastically different from swimming in
the sea.

Life-saving skills

Although 18 years is the minimum age required to learn actual
life-saving skills in Japan, Kobayashi attests that anybody of
any age can be taught how to read tides, currents and wave
movements--vital knowledge necessary for protection from the
seemingly unpredictable sea.

"In Australia, children as young as 6 years old have the
opportunity to learn about practical water safety," said
Kobayashi. "Under the guidance of life-savers, children are
actually made to feel the pull of tides and undercurrents. And
they are taught ways to brace against them."

But as yet, no system for ensuring water safety skills and
knowledge exist in Japan, he said, blaming the dearth of
certified life-saving trainers .

Private swimming lessons available to the public normally do
not offer such courses unless they belong to one of the 40
registered life-saving clubs. And despite the Education
Ministry's keenness to have children learn how to swim, teaching
techniques on personal survival are absent from school curriculum
guidelines.

The NPA makes a yearly effort to give school children lectures
on water safety and it increases its patrol around accident prone
areas. But, even so, since the beginning of July, 382 deaths have
already occurred (some 21 others are still unaccounted for).
Sixty of the victims were children.

"I personally wish that schools would someday include personal
survival skills as part of their swimming lessons," said
Kobayashi.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Swimming is no
exception.

LIFE: How stressed are you?

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By TOSHIO JO
Asahi Evening News

Which would be more devastating, your wife's death or your
company's bankruptcy?

A ridiculous question? Not for Japanese men in their 40s and
50s, who are committing suicide in increasing numbers because of
rising work-related stress, experts say.

Middle-aged men actually suffer the same amount of stress when
faced with their company's failure as they do when a spouse dies,
according to a survey by a group of Osaka-based psychotherapists.

The survey recorded the results of a stress test designed and
conducted by Makoto Natsume, director at the Mental Health
Promotion Division at the Osaka Prefectural Mental Health Center,
and his colleagues.

The 1988 test asked some 480 men between the ages of 40 and 59
to rate the intensity of shock they would feel in the above
scenarios on a scale of zero to 100. Men in their 50s gave both
crises the same average score 78. Men in their 40s scored their
wives' deaths at 80 and failure by their companies at 78.

The survey's startling revelation of an all-consuming
corporate culture was clear when it was conducted during the peak
of the economic boom in 1988.

It has become tragically clearer in the last eight years.

Restructuring blues

As Japanese companies reel from the effects the deep economic
recession that began in 1991, middle-aged employees are facing
stress from overwork, bullying and the once-unthinkable
possibility of losing their jobs.

The result: More of them are killing themselves.

According to the National Police Agency, 3,626 men in their
50s committed suicide last year, up from 3,080 before the
recession in 1991. Among these, 898 killed themselves because of
"economic and livelihood related problems," leading all of the
age groups in the number of suicides committed for similar
reasons.

While many say the economy is on the rebound--many pointing to
rising corporate earnings--companies are continuing unprecedented
restructuring programs that are putting many long-time employees
out of work and generating more stress for those who watch their
job security erode around them.

In May, the nation's unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, its
highest since 1953 when the government first began providing
jobless data.

"The number of patients being treated for stress-related
problems here at the Osaka center has increased over the past few
years," said Natsume, a work stress specialist. "The number of
female patients has increased, too, as a logical consequence of
the increase in working women.

Suicidal tendencies

"I estimate that about 60 percent of these patients have
expressed a desire to die, and about 30 percent actually try to
commit suicide."

In terms of personality, people who are diligent at work and
feel strong work responsibility are most prone to work-related
depression, Natsume and other mental experts say.

Toru Sekiya, head of the Sekiya Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic in
Tokyo's Shibuya Ward, agrees.

"I cannot help predicting that the number of suicides by
people in these age groups (40 to 60) will further increase,"
said Sekiya.

In addition to the threat of job losses, corporate
restructuring has several other stressful effects, Sekiya said.
One is that as companies reduce their employees, the remaining
workers have to work hard to take up the slack.

Another effect is bullying.

"In some cases, computer workers or clerical workers are
reassigned to become salesmen, which is a typical case of
bullying," Sekiya said.

Sekiya described one patient who came to his clinic because of
the stress he felt after an unfair transfer.

"He could not kill himself. He could not go to work. And he
could not tell his wife about what happened, feeling that she
could never understand his situation. In the end, he had nowhere
else to go but the clinic," he said.

Natsume of the Osaka center shared a similar story about a
48-year-old man who tried to commit suicide after a successful
26-year career with a general trading house.

Natsume said the man, who had a wife and son, was transferred
to Europe to be vice president in charge of the company's
branches in there. He was forced to live alone. As sales faltered
and the company headquarters pressured him to improve them, the
man became stressed.

He started to have trouble sleeping at night and began feeling
lonely without having anyone to talk to. Six months after he was
transferred to Europe, he tried to commit suicide by taking
sleeping pills.

Natsume said the man was found by a neighbor in a coma, but
his life was saved.

The man and his wife turned to Natsume for professional help.
After six months of resting and counseling, he got over his
depression, and returned to work.

"He was lucky because his wife was very understanding and
never said anything negative even though he had to take months
off work," Natsume said, adding that good family relations and
hobbies for relaxation purposes are two key elements in leading a
healthy life and helping deeply stressed people who have become
depressed.

Work-related suicides or karoshi (death caused by overwork)
has drawn the attention of lawyers.

In March, a landmark ruling was handed down when the Tokyo
District Court ordered Dentsu Inc. to pay about 120 million yen
in damages to the parents of an employee who killed himself in
August 1991. The court attributed the suicide to depression
caused by overwork and lack of sleep.

Since the start of 1996, a Karoshi Hot Line Service, a legal
advice and counseling service provided by a nationwide group of
lawyers, has received many calls from the relatives of men who
have killed themselves because of work-related depression.

Feeling responsibility

One of them was a 40-something middle manager for a
manufacturing company. He committed suicide because of depression
brought on by his sense of heavy responsibility at work, his
relatives said. Before he died, he would come home around 11 p.m.
and leave home 4:30 a.m.

Another man in his 40s threw himself into the path of an
oncoming train. He had to work long hours on weekdays and work
even on weekends. Before he took his own life, he often
complained to his family members that he could not sleep at
night.

"Japanese salaried men in their 40s and 50s should learn more
from younger people, who do not see work as being everything in
life," said the Osaka center's Natsume.

"I believe that one of the darkest sides to the ongoing
restructuring within the Japanese business community is the fact
that many of the people who have been let go contributed to
better workplace human relations. Their departure has made the
Japanese workplace atmosphere and environment cold and less human
at the expense of productivity."

Sex shop slaying investigated

Tokyo police began questioning four employees of a chain of
sex-related businesses, arrested on suspicion of fraud, violation
of the Stimulants Control Law and the Swords and Firearms Law,
over the disappearance late last year of the owner of the
business and a manager, police said Friday.

Police said they suspected the owner and the manager, both 33,
were murdered for money and their bodies were dumped somewhere.
Last Thursday, investigators raided four clubs belonging to the
sex chain, police said.

The four were arrested in separate cases.

In January, the owner's father reported to police that his son
had been missing from his condominium in Shibuya Ward since
December last year, police said. Police say gangsters, as well,
may have had a role in the disappearance.

Foreign residents left out of disaster drills

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By MASAYOSHI SUGA and TARO KARASAKI
Asahi Evening News

While acknowledging that many foreign residents were left out
in the cold in the Jan. 17, 1995, Great Hanshin Earthquake, many
local governments say they have not included programs to help
non-Japanese residents during the annual disaster prevention
drills that will be held this week throughout the country.

Tokyo, home to more than 260,000 registered foreigners from
160 countries, and the location of hundreds of embassies and
consulates, conducts a disaster prevention drill today.

The drill by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government will be carried
out on the assumption that an earthquake of the same magnitude as
the Hanshin quake had hit Adachi Ward. One of the key
responsibilities of the metropolitan government during such a
crisis would be to communicate with foreign victims and relevant
organizations, such as foreign embassies and consulates.

However, while a disaster headquarters will be operated by
senior officials to rehearse command and communications
procedures, no member of the metropolitan government's
International Affairs Division will be included in the
headquarters team.

This is despite the fact that the office's main task in the
event of an earthquake would be to coordinate programs to help
foreigners and communicate with organizations, embassies and
consulates.

"No specific programs involving foreigners have been included
in this year's drill," said Tetsuo Imasu, head of the division.
"But we hope we will be able to incorporate some measures next
year."

The division last week announced a program to hire 200
language volunteers, both Japanese and non-Japanese, who can help
in the event of disasters. Their jobs will cover a wide range of
activities, including providing information for foreigners and
printing foreign-language materials, helping foreigners at
shelters and assisting foreign rescue teams.

The division plans to train the volunteers and hopefully
include them in next year's drill.

The Kobe Municipal Government says that it has not included
any special programs involving foreigners in its disaster
prevention drills scheduled for Tuesday.

"We are still trying to put together a manual for foreign
residents on what to do in a disaster. Any plan to hold a special
drill for foreign residents will have to come after that," said
Takashi Yokotani of the Kobe Citizen's Service Bureau.

Yokotani said the manual should be completed by the end of
this fiscal year and the bureau would possibly study plans on how
to incorporate foreigners in drills in fiscal 1997.

"We have invited representatives of various community groups
(to the drill), and if they have any contact with foreign
residents, I would assume that they would convey whatever knowhow
is needed," said Yokotani.

However, the head of a volunteer group in the Kansai region
questions whether the city-run disaster drills are the best way
to help foreigners prepare for disasters.

"I don't think that it is such a good idea to have the
government set up everything," said Taro Tamura, head of the
Center for Multicultural Information and Assistance.

"What local governments should do is to nurture and answer the
needs of non-profit groups that are close to the foreign
residents. In the end, that should help foreign residents in a
disaster situation," said Tamura.

Tamura's group will today provide advice on how to prepare for
disasters in a special radio program to be aired on the
Kobe-based FM station Cocolo.

The program will provide advice on where foreigners can go to
get relief supplies and how to apply for gift money.

The Kanagawa Prefectural Government also said it does not plan
any special programs for foreigners in its drill today, but will
hold a joint communication exercise with the U.S. military forces
in the prefecture.

The city government of Nagoya does not have any plans to
include foreign residents in its drill, but the city office for
international exchange will hold a lecture on Sept. 9 on how to
prepare for an earthquake.

"We are aware that it is important to involve foreign
residents. But as many foreign residents are located in scattered
communities, it is difficult to get them all together," said
Fumitaka Kito of the Nagoya International Center.

Conventions show chameleon side of U.S. politics

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By YOICHI FUNABASHI
Asahi Shimbun

CHICAGO--Both Republicans and Democrats blurred their
traditional party lines at presidential conventions last month to
woo crucial floating voters for their candidates, Bob Dole and
Bill Clinton.

In past presidential elections, Republicans made it a rule to
underscore patriotism, while Democrats used to give top priority
to standard of living.

In an attempt to disguise their hawkish and dovish feathers,
however, Republicans and Democrats presented strikingly similar
stances in San Diego and Chicago on key policy issues such as the
role of government, family ties and crime.

It seems that Republicans and Democrats had better trade their
mascots, the elephant and the donkey, for the chameleon.

Republicans and Democrats have also shed their traditional
images as the stern father and the affectionate mother.

Republicans selected Susan Molinari, a representative from New
York, as the convention's keynote speaker to project a soft image
to win support from women--the lack of which is viewed as Dole's
Achilles' heel.

The party election machine tactically focused TV cameras on
her five-month-old daughter, held in the arms of Molinari's
father.

The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has taken a harder line
since Democrats suffered a devastating defeat in elections two
years ago largely because male white voters expressed discontent
with the party's generous welfare spending, lax crime control,
and liberal affirmative action programs.

Democrats have recently attacked big government, even scaling
down welfare programs which had long been the core of their
platform.

In point of fact, huge fiscal deficits afford little policy
leeway to either Republicans or Democrats other than to propose
small government.

While the two parties try to transform their images,
traditionalists are shaking both camps.

Jesse Jackson galvanized his Democrat audience by criticizing
"fundamentalist" Republican elements seeking to minimize welfare
support, restrict foreign imports, oust immigrants, and oppose
abortion.

But the Democratic Party, too, has been a patchwork of many
interest groups. The disappearance of the old threat from the
former Soviet bloc has made this more evident, as it cast loose
divergent voices within both party folds.

As rhetorical strategy, Republicans and Democrats have
similarly labeled themselves as progressives, shunning such
Right-Left stereotypes as conservatives and liberals.

Clinton is particularly adept at this, and he is often derided
as a "Republican Lite," like the beer, or in this sense a
pseudo-Republican.

That is why Molinari pleased Republican audiences when she
made fun of the president's opportunism. She said her speech
--like Clinton's campaign promises--will not last long and will
sound just like a Republican's.

At the same time, her words revealed the frustrations within
the Grand Old Party, whose traditional policy strengths have been
successfully mimicked by the Democratic Party.

In his showdown with the

73-year-old Dole, Clinton, 50, portrays himself as the man who
represents the interests of 77 million U.S. baby boomers.

In his nomination acceptance speech, Dole said he wants to
serve as a bridge to regain the U.S. values in the good old days
--the values he himself represents.

The patriotism voiced by someone like Dole, whose right hand
is handicapped from World War II injuries, exerts tremendous
pressure on Democrats, particularly on Clinton, who has been
accused of shirking military service during the Vietnam War.

To fight back, Democrats mobilized young children--among them
Clinton's daughter Chelsea--at the convention, to symbolize their
contrary argument that the next president must serve as a bridge
to the future, not to the past.

When he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his birthday
shortly before the convention, Clinton said yesterdays will
outnumber tomorrows from now on.

His reference to yesterdays seems to suggest the huge
political clout that the U.S. baby boomer generations have
acquired to protect their interests.

Clinton intentionally did not invite Jimmy Carter to the
convention. Carter ignominiously lost reelection in 1980, and
Clinton did not want his own nomination tarnished by association
with the former Democratic president. The snub may also reflect
Clinton's own ego, his belief that he belongs to a generation
completely different to Carter's.

At the conventions, Dole and Clinton were evenly matched.

If outward show is all that matters in politics, the
Republican Party might have taken a slight lead.

In their speeches, Dole dwelt on his past and Clinton listed
policy challenges. Dole may have better impressed voters with
sincerity, whereas Clinton may have displayed greater political
dexterity.

But the booming economy and comfortable leads in opinion polls
are firmly supporting the Democrat incumbent. Clinton is content
to draw on his track record in office, and evades direct
engagement with Dole that might narrow the gap and lend more
credibility to the challenger.

It is often a mistake, however, to judge the entire trend of
U.S. politics from the speakers and delegates at presidential
conventions.

The consciousness of floating, middle-of-the-road voters
--once described as the country's silent majority--is quite
different from those people who have recently occupied the TV
screens.
