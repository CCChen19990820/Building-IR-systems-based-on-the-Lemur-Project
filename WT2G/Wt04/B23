<P><H3><KBD>Playing the trump card of uncertainty</KBD></H3>


<P>Republicans in the United States are promoting legislation that would insist on scientific risk analysis before any tightening of environmental regulation.  The proposals are not acceptable. 

<P>PUBLICATION last month of studies showing falling sperm counts in British men is a reminder of the insidious threat posed by environmental pollutants.  Not that pollutants are necessarily the source of the falling sperm counts reported over recent years.  Changes in women's lifestyles may also have affected the development of male fetuses, while men's smoking and prolonged driving in tight trousers have also been suggested as possible causes.  The statistics of sperm decline are themselves controversial.  But endocrine-disrupting chemicals affecting fetal testes are prime suspects. 

<P>In assessing the potential impact of such pollutants, the current limitations of science are all too apparent.  When, as with trace chemicals and particulates, low doses may be important, epidemiology becomes important.  But it can accomplish only so much.  True, it can provide useful information at lower levels of exposure than can be explored in laboratory tests on animals; it can also help to relate the results of such tests to effects on humans.  But epidemiologists acknowledge that their studies of human populations can be unavoidably afflicted by statistical uncertainty, because samples sometimes have to be small.  Such factors become important when apparently small consequences of low exposure may amplify the effects of common diseases.  And although progress is being made in understanding mechanisms by which, for example, dioxins may harm humans, the number of possible molecular pathways in such cases is still considerable, while mechanisms are even less well understood for atmospheric particles that are suspected carcinogens. 

<P>Where the issues of pollution have become politicized, uncertainties within the science provide a notorious opportunity for the conflicting parties in any environmental dispute.  That was the case when the chemical industry used its knowledge of atmospheric models to resist restrictions on chlorofluorocarbons, and when Greenpeace and UK Nirex, responsible in the United Kingdom for nuclear waste disposal, use hydrogeological models in disputes over Nirex's plans to test a site for a subterranean repository. 

<P>This week's Briefing focuses on the role of science within two debates which have become even more highly charged: the unprecedented involvement of right-wing politicians in environmental legislation in the United States, exemplified by debates over atmospheric particles; and the extraordinary (but possibly transitory) victory of Greenpeace over the Shell oil company in an environmentally innocuous plan (as it appeared to its originators) to sink an oil storage buoy - the Brent Spar - in deep water off northwest Scotland. 

<P>The common theme is science-based risk analysis.  This can be seen pessimistically as a way of highlighting scientific uncertainties.  After all, a classical risk analysis derives the probabilities of various outcomes by analysing all the possible paths by which each may materialize.  So, for example, in assessing risks to human health from chemically contaminated fish, the US Environmental Protection Agency has presented a framework in which, for just one chemical, estimates of many factors ranging from possible environmental pathways to coefficients of absorption - all uncertain in conceptual terms or in measurement terms or both - have to be amalgamated to make a quantitative risk assessment possible.  The accumulation of uncertainties looks daunting, and provides ample opportunity for groups with vested interests to promote a biased perspective.  But such risk analysis, by assessing scenarios comprehensively, also has valuable potential for establishing common ground. 

<P>Suppose, in the case of Brent Spar, that the environmental impact analyses made by Shell are vindicated by the working group set up by the UK government.  Greenpeace's accusations that Shell's science was deficient would be seen to be exaggerated, and the common ground between the factions might have increased.  But Greenpeace is unlikely to change its position as a result because its overriding principle of environmental precaution in the face of residual scientific uncertainties and future dumping possibilities would still be politically tenable. 

<P>In the United States, Republican zealots and some industries are likely to go on playing the same card of uncertainty and precaution in the opposite direction for as long as they can, while - as the Briefing describes - they propose risk-analysis legislation that would turn that card into a trump.  But their position with respect to particulates is much less defensible than that of Greenpeace on Brent Spar, because the epidemiological evidence is so suggestive of significant risk to the population whereas mechanisms are poorly understood.  The US legislature should reject the demands being made of science before regulatory change.

<P><B>Assessing environmental risks: why science alone is 
not enough</B>

<P><B>Greenpeace Business Feb/March 1996
</B>

<P>Has the public got distorted view of environmental risks? The accumulation of 
scientific facts and risk assessments are no longer sufficient to ensure public 
acceptance over a wide range of issues. For  example: 

<P>the Brent Spar wasn’t dumped; 

<P>a prolonged inquiry into Nirex’s proposal to build an underground nuclear waste 
dump is taking place in the UK amidst growing public opposition; 

<P>manufacturers and retailers world-wide have yet to convince consumers of the 
benefits of genetically engineered products. 

<P>How should businesses respond when faced with public responses like these which 
they find irrational?  The commonest answer has been to conduct a rational risk 
assessment and add a spoonful of public education to pre-empt emotional responses. 

<P>Decisions will then, it is claimed, be based on science rather than emotion. 
Conventional thinking in government and industry has been that the public is simply 
over emotional, ignorant or both. But there is mounting evidence that it is not a 
misunderstanding of science or the facts on the part of the public which leads to 
conflict on these seemingly technical matters. Research shows that genuine, rational 
and legitimate concerns of the public are illogically excluded from so-called rational, 
scientific risk assessments. The system needs changing if it is to work. 

<P>In the case of the Brent Spar it was impossible to raise the principle of whether 
dumping rubbish at sea was acceptable at all. The framework for decision-making only 
allowed consideration of the particular metalwork of the Brent Spar. In the public’s 
mind, however, allowing the dumping of one oil installation could lead to more being 
dumped into the sea in the future. In addition, the fact that the public are urged and 
bound by law not to dump their rubbish in the environment, while an industry was 
treated very differently, was also totally excluded from the decision-making. 

<P>At the inquiry into Nirex's proposed dump, questions about less dangerous sites are 
being avoided. Nirex has created a scientific forum for debate which allows it to 
bypass discussions of safety until a later date, possibly well into the next century, by 
which time the economic momentum behind a dump at Sellafield will be difficult to 
dislodge. 

<P>When it comes to genetic engineering the risk assessment looks at the dangers out of 
context. Crops genetically engineered to be resistant to chemical herbicides are 
assessed in isolation from their intended use with herbicide. Only technical details can 
be debated, not the pros and cons of producing herbicide resistant plants or their 
impact on the use of chemicals. Whether genetic engineering is desirable at all is never 
considered. 


<P><B>PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES
</B>

<P>To the public, the strategy of containing debate inside a narrow so-called rational 
scientific framework acts to exclude legitimate discussion of the issues of public 
policy which lie behind them. The presumptions hiding behind the rational 
approaches in these three cases are that; dumping waste at sea is a positive option; that 
the nuclear industry’s short term economic interests are more important than the health 
of future generations; and that risking irreversible change in the genetic make-up of 
nature is an acceptable cost of a new industry. None of these presumptions is founded 
in science. They reflect a particular view of the world which is often at odds with 
public values and perceptions. 

<P>As effective wider debate is not allowed they tend to flare up at unexpected moments, 
as they did with the Brent Spar, when the underlying feelings can get some purchase. 
So they are not expressions of irrational emotion or an anti-science sentiment, but 
symptomatic of deeper divisions between the public and its institutions, including 
business. 

<P>Since none of this is about science, it will not help to provide more scientific facts 
about the impact of dumping the Brent Spar, the hydrogeology of the rocks under 
Sellafield or gene flow from genetically engineered plants. Whilst research also shows 
that the public is interested in, and has confidence in science to address the problems of 
the world, scientific approaches become viewed with suspicion when operating within 
a framework that rules out relevant questions. 

<P>Public education as a response to public anxieties is, therefore, more likely to fuel 
the cynicism with which such exercises are increasingly viewed. People quite sensibly 
evaluate risks partly in terms of whether or not those in control can be trusted and 
what risks they face by having to trust them. PR exercises which result in people being 
patronised as ignorant and irrational are unlikely to reassure the public and lessen the 
sense of risk. 

<P>Following the decision not to dump the Brent Spar, Shell is now investigating some 
200 disposal options. A whole Aladdin's cave of alternatives had been concealed, 
which are now available for business to develop. In contrast, Nirex and the nuclear 
industry will face prolonged, drawn out battles over nuclear waste well into the next 
century if they refuse to address long term safety now. 

<P>Genetic engineering could face the same sorts of battles. Businesses have been 
reluctant to accept labelling of products and have cast off public concerns about the 
morality of genetic engineering as non-scientific. 

<P>Greenpeace will continue to challenge these so called scientific approaches to risk.

<P>Extract from<H2><KBD>Body of Evidence - The effects of chlorine on human health</KBD></H2>Greenpeace report. May 1995<BR> 

 <P>5.1.1<B> Risk Assessment</B>

<P>It is not uncommon for governments to use risk assessment as the basis for setting allowable rates of release for organochlorines. The risk assessment consists of solving a series of mathematical equations that are supposed to represent the physical, chemical and biological behaviour of a toxic chemical: its release from the source; its interactions with wind, rain, heat, light and other environmental factors; its deposition in, movement through and continuing interactions with the environment; its uptake in and movement within the body of a human 'receptor'; and its interactions with and impacts on the many processes taking place within the organs and cells of the human body, including effects such as cancer, that may occur 20-40 years after exposure.

<P>Since many of the chemical's interactions are not  addressed and most of those that are addressed are far from completely characterised, the risk assessment's mathematical equations offer, at best, only very remote approximations of a few of the complex interactions of the chemical in the real world. In addition, many of the numerical factors that are inserted in the array of equations in order to arrive at the final calculation of risk are the products of other remote approximations. For example, one key number is the chemical's carcinogenic potency, which has been known to vary by a factor of 2000, depending on which experimental data are used.

<P>Risk estimates are currently calculated for cancer. Other, more subtle effects such as immune suppression, neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental effects are not addressed. Moreover, sufficient toxicological data for conducting an assessment exists for only about 2 percent of all commercial chemicals.

<P>Like every other method for predicting the future, risk assessment is plagued by lack of essential data and fraught with uncertainties, many of which may never be resolved. As a result, risk estimates derived from this procedure are at least as much matters of opinion as they are matters of science. As described by the former director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency:

<P><I>"We should remember that risk assessment data can be like the captured spy: if you torture it long enough, it will tell you anything you want to know."</I>

<H2>GENETIC ENGINEERING AND THE ENVIRONMENT</H2>

Genetic engineering enables scientists to transfer genes between species, for instance from animals to plants and from bacteria to plants or animals. All the boundaries of conventional breeding are broken down. Our understanding of species as distinct from one another will be transcended by the power of the technology.

<P>Many applications of genetic engineering, particularly agricultural, depend on the release of genetically manipulated organisms (GMOs), including plants, animals and microbes, to the environment. How will these organisms, whose genetic makeup has been controlled by man bypassing natural evolution, affect the environment? Will they form the "green" solution to pollution and starvation?  Greenpeace does not believe that genetic engineering will provide the answers to these problems but that new environmental risks will be created while the fundamental problems go unaddressed.

<P>The patenting of genetic material and life forms will not only speed the industrialisation of genetic engineering and therefore the release of GMOs to the environment, but will also put the control of genetic resources into the hands of the multinational industries.

<blockquote>
<H1>10th November 1996: 1st ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF KEN SARO WIWA</H1>

<br><br>
<P> <B>On this, the occasion of the first anniversary of the execution of  
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his fellow activists, Greenpeace woud like to
comment on the context giving rise to this senseless  
tragedy.  The nine activists we remember today were united  
over their concern about the environmental destruction of the Niger delta. 
The oil industry, including but not limited to Royal Du
tch Shell, has for years been and remains the engine of this 
destruction.

 <P>  Relatively few people live in such close proximity to the ravages 
of inadequately controlled and monitored oil development as do the Ogoni
people, but as we now know climate change caused
 by the use of oil and other fossils fuels is  an additional  
environmental menace  to all.

 <P>  Events such as these must spur a rapid conversion from destructive 

to re newable energy and to the building of a sustainable economy.  On this
sombre anniversary, oil exploration is pushing furthe
r into the last remaining frontiers and wilderness areas, into 

fragile ecological areas and into the human environment.  As a rule,  the
easily exploitable oil reserves are gone. As a consequence the
 oil companies are advancing on reserves that were previously viewed 
as inaccessable or off-limits.  These developments come at a time when 
scientific opinion tells us that if we only burn the produ
ction of known oil reserves, and leave existing reserves untouched, 
we could already trigger irreversible and dangerous climate change which
would transform life as we know it.

  <P> In the broader context the activism that occasioned reprisals 
against nine environmentalists from the Niger Delta could be viewed as
another warning to the rest of us.  What is happening in Nigeri
a is in some respects  a repeat of similar ravages caused by oil 
development elsewhere and is mere prelude to tragic events  world-wide.  
More tragedy and pain is inevitable unless  the rest  of us 
stop to  turn our attention to the oil industry, not only in Nigeria 
but around the world, and decide if we can continue to allow our civilization
to be fueled  on destructive and polluting energy so
urces.
   
<P> In 1992, at the  Earth Summit in Brazil, governments  agreed on and 
pledged commitment to the goal of stablizing and then reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases below dangerous levels. This was base
d on scientific estimates that a cut of greenhouses gases of 60-80% 
would be necessary to prevent potentially dangerous climate change. If this
commitment is to be honored and a response to  the thre
at of global climate change realized, we must forego the development 
of even the known oil fields and seek to develop solar and other energy
forms, many of which are already cost-effective.


        <P>    Why in this context, should a conflict between the oil 
industry and people whose land unfortunately sits on top of an oil field
persist to the point of tragedy?  Moreover, what justificat

ion is there for Shell and other multinational oil companies to fail, 
as they have in Nigeria, to even meet the environmental standards imposed on
the industry in their home countries?

    <P>   The foregoing calls into question whether continued oil 
development in Nigeria can be justified.  If, however, Shell continues to
operate in Nigeria, Greenpeace calls for the following:  

<P>1. &nbspIn addition to the current Niger Delta Environmental Survey (NDES) 
a full and independent international inquiry into Shell's and other oil
companies' operations in Nigeria to determine whether the
y comply with the environmental laws of Nigeria and the standards of 
the industry prevalent in Europe and North America.  

<P>2.  &nbspShell's public commitment to operate under the highest standards 
imposed on the industry worldwide.    

<P>3. &nbsp Shell's public condemnation of the execution of environmental 

activists and insistance on the immediate release of all environmental
activists still confined as a result of acts of conscience.  

<P>4.   &nbsp Publication  by  Nigeria and all other  fossil fuel producing 
countries of the total  annual  greenhouse gases which  result from the
production of  oil, gas and other fossil fuels  each year,  

and as a proportion of global emissions.  </B>

<H1>KEN SARO-WIWA'S CLOSING STATEMENT TO THE NIGERIAN MILITARY
APPOINTED TRIBUNAL</H1>
<p align=center><H4>Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria</H4>
<p align=center><a href="ken.gif"><img src="kent.gif width=74 height=76> 99kb Gif</a><a href="ken.jpg">26kb Jpeg</a>
<p><H1>My lord,</H1>

<p>We all stand before history.  I am a man of peace, of ideas. 
Appalled by the denigrating poverty of my people who live on a
richly endowed land, distressed by their political
marginilization and economic strangulation, angered by the
devestation of their land, their ultimate heritage, anxious to
preserve their right to life and to a decent living, and
determined to usher to this country as a whole a fair and just
democratic system which protects everyone and every ethnic group
and gives us all a valid claim to human civilization, I have
devoted my intellectual and material resources, my very life, to
a cause in which I have total belief and from which I cannot be
blackmailed or intimidated.  I have no doubt at all about the
ultimate success of my cause, no matter the trials and
tribulations which I and those who believe with me may encounter
on our journey.  Nor imprisonment nor death can stop our ultimate
victory.
<p><a href="ken2.gif"><img src="ken2t.gif width=72 height=46> 109kb Gif</a> <a href="ken2.jpg"> 38kb Jpeg</a> 
<p>I repeat that we all stand before history.  I and my colleagues
are not the only ones on trial.<p><a href="#shell">  Shell is here on trial</a> and it
is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding
a watching brief.  The Company has, indeed, ducked this
particular trial, but its day will surely come and the lessons
learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my
mind that the ecological war that the Company has waged in the
Delta will be called to question sooner than later and the crimes
of that war be duly punished.  The crime of the Company's dirty
wars against the Ogoni people will also be punshed.
<p><a href="ken3.gif"><img src="ken3t.gif width=72 height=46> 64kb Gif</a> <a href="ken3.jpg"> 19kb Jpeg</a> 
<p>On trial also is the Nigerian nation, its present rulers and
those who assist them.  Any nation which can do to the weak and
disadvantaged what the Nigerian nation has done to the Ogoni,
loses a claim to independence and to freedom from outside
influence.  I am not one of those who shy away from proesting
injustice and oppression, arguing that they are expected in a
military regime.  The military do not act alone.  They are
supported by a gaggle of politicians, lawyers, judges, academics
and businessmen, all of them hiding under the claim that they are
only doing their duty, men and women too afraid to wash their
pants of urine.  We all stand on trial, my lord, for by our
actions we have denigrated our Country and jeapordized the future
of our children.  As we subscribe to the sub-normal and accept
double standards, as we lie and cheat openly, as we protect
injustice and oppression, we empty our classrooms, denigrate our
hospitals, fill our stomachs with hunger and elect to make
ourselves the slaves of those who ascribe to higher standards,
pursue the truth, and honour justice, freedom, and hard work.  
I predict that the scene here will be played and replayed by
generations yet unborn.  Some have already cast themselves in the
role of villains, some are tragic victims, some still have a
chance to redeem themselves.  The choice is for each individual. 

<p>I predict that the denoument of the riddle of the Niger delta
will soon come.  The agenda is being set at this trial.  Whether
the peaceful ways I have favoured will prevail depends on what
the oppressor decides, what signals it sends out to the waiting
public.
 
In my innocence of the false charges I face Here, in my utter
conviction, I call upon the Ogoni people, the peoples of the
Niger delta, and the oppressed ethnic minorities of Nigeria to
stand up now and fight fearlessly and peacefully for their
rights.  History is on their side.  God is on their side.  For
the Holy Quran says in Sura 42, verse 41:"All those that fight
when oppressed incur no guilt, but Allah shall punish the
oppressor."  Come the day.

<H3>GREENPEACE DISRUPTS SHELL RECEPTION AT ART GALLERY</H3>
<p>Activists Climb Building And Hang Modern Work Of Art To Protest 
Shell Oil's Support of Nigerian Military Government 
 
<p><font size=+1>WASHINGTON, January 24</font> -- Greenpeace activists today forced Shell
Oil to cancel a planned dinner reception at the Phillips
Collection art gallery in Washington, and added their own work
of art to the museum, unfurling on the outside of the building
a 7 x 14 foot rendition of Edvard Munch's expressionistic "The
Scream" with a modern message: "Stop Shell In Nigeria."   

<p>While environmental, human rights, labor and Nigerian activists
were demonstrating outside the gallery, two Greenpeace activists
climbed over the side of the gallery's roof two stories
up and descended several feet to display the large painting.  

<p>"We are here today to tell Shell to clean up its act and not
simply its corporate image," said Greenpeace's Steve Kretzmann
in Washington. "As we have learned from dealing with South Africa
in the 1980s, the best way to change an oppressive regime is for
corporations to pull out and stop the flow of money. We must
boycott Nigerian oil and get Shell out of Nigeria."
 
<p>As the demonstration began, Shell cancelled the PR dinner for top
journalists, congress members and lobbyists. The dinner was
apparently an attempt by Shell to retrieve its ailing public
image.

<p>Greenpeace is part of the International Roundtable on Nigeria,
a broad coalition of human rights, environmental, labor, and
religious organizations calling for an immediate oil embargo
against Nigeria to isolate the brutal dictatorship of Sani
Abacha. Shell's collusion with the Nigerian regime in last
November's execution of nine Nigerian activists, including Nobel-
prize nominated writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, has spurred worldwide
condemnation of Shell, and driven South African President Nelson
Mandela to spearhead the call for an oil embargo. 
 
<p>Dr. Owens Wiwa, brother of Ken Saro-Wiwa, arrived in the United
States January 24.  He will be travelling to New York,
Washington, Toronto, and San Francisco to document human rights
and environmental abuses in his Ogoni homeland at the hands of
the Nigerian government and international oil companies. 
According to Dr. Wiwa, Shell offered to negotiate Ken Saro-Wiwa's
release from a Nigerian prison if international protests were
called off. 
 
<p>Oil accounts for over 90% of Nigeria's exports and 80% of
government revenues, and Shell produces fully half of Nigeria's
total oil output. Sadly, many local communities have suffered
environmental damage from Shell's drilling and production
activities. Of the 110 countries in which Shell operates, nearly
40% of the company's oil spills and leakages occured in Nigeria.

<CENTER><H3>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
		
<P>THE EUROPEAN UNION FAILS TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES AGAINST NIGERIA: GREENPEACE</H3></center>
		
		BRUSSELS, 6 December 1995 -- The European Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday clearly recognised that the situation in Nigeria requires international action. However, they have stopped short of applying the only measure that would have any effect - an oil embargo against Nigeria.<p>
		<p>
		The European Union agreed to a series of visa restrictions, the expulsion of Nigerian military personnel from the European Union and limiting sporting contact.  None of these measures send a strong enough message from the international community to the Nigerian government and Shell.<p>
		<p>
		"Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were executed as a result of their campaign against the environmental destruction of their homeland by Shell," said Paul Horseman of Greenpeace International, "Despite its strong condemnation of the executions and the Nigerian dictatorship, the international community has not taken any real action, instead they have said business as usual."<p>
		<p>
		In January, the trials of 19 more activists are scheduled to begin in Nigeria.  They face the same charges and penalty as Ken Saro-Wiwa.  The activists are in jail because they have been campaigning against the environmental devastation of their homeland by the oil industry - predominatly Shell.<p>
		<p>
		"The Nigerian regime will stop at nothing to ensure that the oil production continues, hence an oil embargo is the only real measure which sends the right message to both industry and to Abacha's regime." added Horseman<p>

<CENTER><H1>MOVEMENT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE OGONI PEOPLE (MOSOP)


<P>19 MORE OGONIS FOR THE JUSTICE AUTA SPECIAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL</H1></center>

MOSOP wishes to inform the general public in Nigeria and the international community that charges have now been formalised for the arraignment of 19 more Ogonis before the sol-called Ogoni Civil Disturbances Special Military Tribunal, in January 1996.<p>

Names of the detainees are contained in Charge no. OCDT/PH/3/95, dates 18/9/95 and are as follows:-<p>
1.  Bariture Bano Lebee, <BR>
2.  John Banatu<BR>
3.  Babina Vizor<BR>
4.  Pogbgara Zorzor<BR>
5.  Friday Gburuma<BR>
6.  Yedah Naasikpo<BR>
7.  Paul Deekor<BR>
8.  Elijah Lekie Badom<BR>
9.  Blessing Israel<BR>
10. Taagalo K. Monsi<BR>
11. Kagbara Basseh<BR>
12. Adam Kaa<BR>
13. Sampson Ntignee<BR>
14. Godwin Gbodoo<BR>
15. Samuel Asigha<BR>
16. Nwinbari Papa<BR>
17. Benjamin Kabari (alias Monday Kabari)<BR>
18. Baribuma Kumanwe<BR>
19. Ngbaa Baovi<BR>


<P>MOSOP wishes to note that although Taagalo Monsi (10), Ngbass Baovi (19) and Baribuma Kumannwe (18) were arrested in the last week of October and first arraigned in a magistrate's court on Friday, Octoboer, 27 1995, their names are curiously contained in a charge dated 18/9/95. Again. while Michael Dogara was arrested, arraigned and detained with them (27/11/95) he is not on the charge list because they found out he comes from Bodo, thenative town of late Chief Edward Kobani.<p>

MOSOP also wished to draw attention to the fact that Mr Adam Kaa had actually been in detention in the bori camp cal since March 1995 for some other matter before the May 21, 1995 suspects were brought in there but was erroneosly taken to the BIIB cell where he was surprisingly "identified" by Alhaji Kobani during an identification parade there. These errors were pointed to Major Paul Okuntimo who ignored the plea.<p>

The witch hunting of Saro-Wiwas MOSOP members, youths, chiefs and elders alike  have been itensified  in the bid to leave no trace of activism in Ogoni.<p>
MOSOP calls on all men of goodwill at home and abroad to put pressure on government to disband the military tribunal which has now been left in place specifically for the Ogonis. You must act to prevent further judicial murders in Ogoni.<p>

Durnu Sakaar, Secretary, MOSOP Crisis Management Committee.  <p>

<p align=center><H1>KEN SARO WIWA AND 8 OGONI PEOPLE EXECUTED:  BLOOD ON SHELL'S HANDS</H1>

<p>London--10 November 1995--The blood of Ken Saro-Wiwa will permanently stain the name
of Shell, Greenpeace said today in response to the news that Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
Ogoni were, according to widespread rumours, hanged this morning in Port Harcourt,
Nigeria.
 
<p>"Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged today for speaking out against the environmental damage to
the Niger Delta caused by Shell Oil through its 37 years of drilling in the region.  Ken Saro
Wiwa was campaigning for what Greenpeace considers the most basic of human rights:  the
right for clean air, land and water.  His only crime was his success in bringing his cause to
international attention," said Thilo Bode, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.   

<p>Greenpeace warned that any protest in the Niger Delta today, non violent or otherwise,
would likely be met with military force and further massacres.  Bode appealed to General
Sani Abacha to let the Ogoni people voice their grief without fear of violence and further
deaths. 
 
<p>Shell's call for "quiet diplomacy" in the 11th hour following the confirmation of the death
sentence by the Nigerian Ruling Council has a hollow ring.  Shell had ample opportunity to
demonstrate concern over the 17 months of Ken's incarceration and trial.  They chose to
maintain their cosy relationship with the military dictatorship to secure oil profits rather than
condemn, the brutal and unjust arrest and later sentencing of non-violent environmental
campaigners.
 
<p>"If Shell and the Nigerian military think that the hanging of Saro-Wiwa has removed national
and international outrage, they're wrong.  Greenpeace today reaffirms its dedication to
continue the campaign against environmental destruction by the oil industry," said Mr Bode.

<p>In his closing address to the tribunal,  Saro-Wiwa stated
"I repeat that we all stand before history.  I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial. 
Shell is here on trial and it is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding a
watching brief. The Company has, indeed, ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely
come and the lessons learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my mind
that the ecological war that the Company has waged in the Delta will be called to question
sooner than later and the crimes of that war be duly punished.  The crime of the Company's
dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished." 
 
<p>"In my innocence of the false charges I face here, in my utter conviction, I call upon the
Ogoni people, the peoples of the Niger delta, and the oppressed ethnic minorities of Nigeria
to stand up now and fight fearlessly and peacefully for their rights.  History is on their side. 
God is on their side.  For the Holy Quran says in Sura 42, verse 41:"All those that fight
when oppressed incur no guilt, but Allah  shall punish the oppressor. Come the day."

<TITLE>GREENPEACE CALLS ON SHELL TO CONDEMN NIGERIAN DEATH SENTENCES </TITLE>

</H2>
<p align=center><a href="ken.jpg">26kb Jpeg</a><a href="ken.gif"><img src="kent.gif width=74 height=76> 99kb Gif</a>



<p>London--8 November 1995--Greenpeace today called on Shell
International to publicly condemn the death sentences imposed on
Nigerian environmentalists by a military tribunal. 


<P>Today the Nigerian Ruling Council agreed to accept the military
tribunal's ruling that Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other Ogoni should
be sentenced to death by hanging -- for murders they did not
commit.  It is understood from sources in the Niger Delta that
military are looking for a "secret location" in which to carry
out the hangings -- which could now happen any time. Ken Saro-
Wiwa and the other nine remain in the Bori military camp but
could be moved to this location and hanged any time. 

<P>"It is extraordinary that Governments right around the world have
condemned the death sentences of the Ogoni people but Shell,
which has actually been working in Ogoniland, has not offered a
single word of regret," said Paul Horsman of Greenpeace
International. 

<P>More than 14% of Shell's worldwide oil production comes from
Nigeria. 

<P>As a major investor in Nigeria, and as a company which depends
on the rule of law and stability in the countries where it
operates Shell cannot and should not stay silent when a
country's constitution is so clearly breached, with such violent
and unjust consequences, as has happened in this case. 

<P>One of the main reasons that Ken Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni
leaders are now facing the death penalty is because of their
campaigns against the environmental devastation caused by the oil
industry in general and Shell in particular.  

<P>Greenpeace calls on Shell International's chairman, John
Jennings, to publicly state his unambiguous opposition to
environmental activists of any sort being targeted through unjust
and unconstitutional means, as has happened in this case.

<P>In the USA, a Greenpeace demonstration is currently underway at
the Shell headquarters in Washington DC (I Street). 

<P>"With profitablity comes responsibility and Shell should use
their undoubted influence on the Nigerian authorities to stop the
tragic deaths of Ken Saro Wiwa and the Ogoni.  Furthermore, Shell
should state that they will operate in Nigeria to the same
standards and requirements for their best practice world-wide. 
If they cannot do this then they should leave Nigeria," said
Horsman.

<H1>GREENPEACE OCTOBER 31ST PRESS RELEASE</H1>
<p><font size=+1>London--31 October 1995</font>--Shell Oil must share responsibility for
Nigerian author and environmentalist Ken Saro Wiwa's death
sentence, Greenpeace said today. 

<p>Saro Wiwa, 56, has received international awards for his work on
the Ogoni peoples' peaceful campaign to expose and oppose the
devastation caused by Shell's drilling in the Niger Delta.  His
sentence today comes at the end of a 17-month incarceration in
Nigerian military prisons, and a trial before a military tribunal
not recognised in the Nigerian legal system.

<p>"Ken Saro-Wiwa has received the death sentence today because he
and the Ogoni people have exposed the devastation wrought on
their land by Shell. If this bizarre sentence is carried out,
Shell shares responsibility for the death of Ken Saro Wiwa," said
Paul Horsman of Greenpeace International. 
 
<p>Yesterday, five Ogoni imprisoned with Ken received the death
sentence yesterday, and four more today.  There were 28 Ogoni
imprisoned and on trial with Ken Saro-Wiwa.  At least four have
died in prison this year. 

<p>More than 30 years of Shell's oil operations have resulted in
appalling environmental degradation in Nigeria.  The standards
Shell applies to its Nigerian operations would not be permitted
in Europe or North America.   

<p>Saro Wiwa's death sentence was given by a military tribunal
widely slated by human rights groups and lawyers.  In May last
year he was arrested and accused of inciting the murder of four
Ogoni elders.  The only two prosecution witnesses who said during
the trial that Saro Wiwa told his followers to carry out the
murders later swore affidavits alleging Shell had bribed them to
give evidence [1].  

<p>In August,  the defence legal team quit the trial, saying the
military tribunal was not an objective body to hear the case.
There is no appeal against the ruling,  which will be sent
straight to General Abacha, who will decide on the dates of the
death sentences.   

<p>"Due to Shell's oil operations in the Niger Delta, the Ogoni
people have lost their farmlands, fisheries and livelihood. 
Following demonstrations against Shell, the Ogoni have been
massacred, tortured and gagged by the Nigerian military. Shell's
appalling environmental double standards are to blame for the
plight of the Ogoni people and Ken Saro Wiwa's death sentence
today," said Horsman. 
 
<p>According to Shell's latest review, Nigeria remains the one of
the most important sources of Shell's equity oil production [2]. 
 
<p>Over the past week, military action against the Ogoni people has
been stepped up, with reports that over 2000 troops moved into
Ogoniland at the weekend, and are now carrying out arbitrary
arrests. 
 
<p>"With profitability comes responsibility; hence Greenpeace
demands that Shell, one of Nigeria's largest creditors, to appeal
to General Abacha against this barbaric sentence and save the
lives of Ken Saro Wiwa and the condemned Ogoni," said Horsman.
"If Shell allow Ken Saro Wiwa to die, the international community
will know who to blame."

<html><head><title>SHELL ADMITS IMPORTING GUNS FOR NIGERIAN POLICE.
 By Cameron Duodu</title></head>

<H2>SHELL ADMITS IMPORTING GUNS FOR NIGERIAN POLICE. </H2>
<p>OBSERVER    28.1.96.  by Cameron Duodu




<p>Shell, the multinational oil giant, has admitted importing
weapons into Nigeria to help arm the police.
The company revealed to the Observer that the weapons are to help
protect its oil installations. However, activists accuse Shell
of arming the death squads who have been brutally suppressing the
Ogoni people.
<p>The admission come in the wake of reports in Nigerian newspapers
that Shell place tenders in Nigeria for the importation of arms.
<p>Eric Nickson, a spokesman for Shell international, said: "Shell
has purchased sidearms handguns on behalf of the Nigerian
police force who guard Shell's facilities. But once imported, the
arms remain the property of the Nigerian police, who store, guard
and use them." He added: "The Nigerian police do not sufficient
funds to equip themselves... We purchase the weapons on their
behalf. But Shell does not have arms itself."
<p>Shell would not say where the arms were being imported from, nor
how many are involved. Mr Nickson said the practice is carried
out by a "wide range of companies in Nigeria, who employ the
police to guard their facilities."
<p>But a highly respected Chief of Defence Staff in Nigeria,
Lieutenant General Alani Akinrinade, said: "The Nigerian police
are well equipped and do not need anyone to import arms for
them."
<p>Pointing out that the Nigerian police have "their mobile force,
who are armed to the teeth", he added: "There is no excuse for
any one to have a private army in Nigeria. They don't need it."
<p>Shell's admission will confirm the worst fears of the Ogoni
people of South Eastern Nigeria, who have been accusing it of
acting in collusion with the Nigerian government's security
agencies. Ogoni people have killed and maimed while protesting
against the environmental devastation of Ogoni lands. Shell
pulled out of the Ogoni area in 1993.
<p>In 1990 the mobile police whose nickname in Nigeria is the Kill 
and Go Mob killed 15 people in the village of Umuechem, where
Shell installations were being attacked by villagers angry at the
pollution.
<p>Human rights abuses by Nigeria's military regime have meant that
limited sanctions, which include a ban on military hardware, were
strengthened after the execution of the playwright Ken Saro©Wiwa
and eight other activists on 10 November.
<p>Among those call for inquiries into Shell's importation  of arms
into Nigeria are the respected academic, Professor Claude Ake,
and Dr Owens Wiwa, brother of Ken Sar0 Wiwa. Professor Ake called
on the Nigerian government to institute an official inquiry.
In an address to the Cooperation and Development Committee of the
European Commission in Brussels, Dr Owens Wiwa asked the
commission for help in ending Shell's "illegal purchase of arms
into Nigeria."
<p>Professor Ake brought attention to a court case, pending before
a Lagos High Court in which Shell Nigeria is being sued by a
Nigerian arms importing company, Humanitiex Nigeria Limited for 
$1.2 million for "a breach of contract." over arms the company
was supposed to import for Shell in 1993. The case was reported
in Lagos's This Day last month.
<p>Mr Nickson said Shell had filed a defence in the Nigerian court,
stating that "no contract was drawn up with Humanitiex, in
respect of any arms, ammunition or communications equipment".

<H2>'Shell axes 'corrupt' Nigeria staff- Times- Insight Team- 17th December'</H2>



<p>SHELL the international oil  gaint, is planing a purge of  executives in Nigeria following the  discovery of a  'black hole of corruption"  involving the payment of millions  of dollars in bribes and kick backs   to tribal  chiefs community and  the military in the troubled Ogoni  region.
	<p>An Insight investigation by  uncovered serious allegations of  corruption against  Shell claim  including the claim that a senior  army officer, accused of ordering  the murder and torture of Ogoni dissidents, was on Shell's  payroll. 
	<p>Shell, the largest foreign oil  company in Nigeria  has repeatedly denied any involvement in  its politics The company was heavily criticised  for Its role  in the country after the execution  last month of Ken Saro Wiwa and  eight other prominent Ogoni  activists.
	<p>But documents from Shell the  military and government source  obtained by The Sunday Times  indicated aa close relationship  between local br anches of the otl  comp any and General Sani  Abacha 's  brutal military regime. 
	<p>The most damaging claim is that      Shell officials paid Lieutenant  Colonel Paul Okuntimo, who was  responsible for crushing civil  unrest in Ogoniland     and  opposition to Shell's presence.   Okuntimo  is accused of waging s campaign of murder,  rape and torture throughout  Ogoniland. In a memo memo to the  administrator   of Rivers State  Okuntimo urged "wasting sting  operations   coupled  with  psychological  tactics of displacement against Ogonis. He advised  "Shell operations still impossible  unless ruthless military operations  are undertaken for smooth  economic activities to  commence".
	<p>Interviewed by The Sunday  Times    in Nigeria  last  week, Okuntimo initially admitted  being paid by in while he was in ch  arge of crushing Ogoni protests  against   the company "Shell  contributed to the logistics  through fin ancial support To do  that, web needed resources and  Shell provided these," he added.  He later denied the comments
	<p>The evidence against him is  supported by   conversation    between Okuntimo and Nick  Ashton-Jones a british  environmentalist and Oronto  Douglas a Nigerian  journalist,  in June last year. Ashton-Jones   who had worked for Shell in  eastern Nigeria said the colonel,  then a major, felt badly let down  by Shell.
	<p>Ashton-Jones recalled "he said  he was doing a wonderful job for  the government and he was  disappointed tha t Shell had  stopped pa ying him He sa id that  everything he was doing was for  Shell " Douglas published his account of the meeting three
days later corroborating Ashton-Jones   views. 	<p>Ledum Mittee, the lawyer who  stood trial with Saro-Wiwa and was  the only defendant acquitted, built  up a close relationship with  Okuntimo during his detention. Mittee said "He admitted he was being  paid by Shell. He said he was angry  with Shell because  they were no  longer pa ying as much for the  upkeep of his boys. He felt they were  not grateful enough " Mittee explained that Shell provided vehicles for military  operations and rewarded Okuntimo  personally. 
	<p>Brian Anderson, managing  director of Shell Nigeria, who has pledged to clean up the company's  opera tions said of Okuntimo: "From what I hear of his recent past he is a  fairly brutal person. I'd like to know if  we were involved with somebody  like that so we could stamp it out "
	<p>A Shell report  on its Nigreian operations, written by  independent auditors, highlight  the role played by Steve Lawson-Jack, head of Shell's public and  governmental affairs in the eastern  region and the man cited by Mittee  and as  the link with Okuntimo.
<p> Lawson-Jack  , who has 
been on
leave for six weeks,is   held   "culpable"  by the auditors for his part in arranging  N1m  (œS0,0001 compensation    claim  against the company   for a bogus oil spill. Yesterday he denied any wrongdoing "I have no personal links with Okuntimo but my job sometimes involves meeting government personnel," he added.
	<p>Anderson said he was  considering Lawson-Jack's future.  He said 20 Shell employees could  be dismissed as a result of internal  investigations."It's Iike a black hole of corruption,  acting that like  gravitythat  is  pulling us down all the time " A  
European Shell executive who wanted to remain anonymous sa id "I would go so far   as to  say that   we spent more money on  bribes and corruption than on on  community development protects." 	<p>The picture that emerges from the  Insight investigation b of a company  that let whole sections of its  operations rampant. While Shell International cites a  figure of £125rn a  year spent on community its  by its Nigerian subsidiary   much of  this money ended up in the  pockets of Shell officials,  community leaders and military  officers.
<p>The role of Lawsonjack and his department is increasingly under scrutiny "Shell, through Steve  Lawson-Jack gave me every  opportunity to become  a small  millionaire said Saturday Kpakol,an  Ogoni community leader. Kpakol detailed how in 1990, as an  unemployed teacher, he set up a pressure group called Council for Concerned Indigents in order to try  to cut a deal with Shell.

	<p>"We had a series of meetings with Lawson-Jack detailing demands such asproviding water to our village, equipping our health centre and  providing us withscholarships. Then in  1992 we joined up ~with Mos op {the movement for the Survival of Ogoni People} and stopped some Shell operations"  he said "Lawson-Jack called me to come and gave me a contract form, saying why don't you forget about these protests and join us. He offeredto give me a contractfor N1Million to install waterpipes outside the village. He said it would only cost N500,000 and we could split the difference"

	<p>Anderson insisted that Shell had  not sought military or police  protection for its workers since 1990.

	<p>But Precious Omuku, head of  public relations for Shell in eastern  Nigeria, admitted the company had called for military protection in  Ogoniland in 1993 and approved a  request from one  of the  company'scontractors to seek the  protection of Okuntimo's men for  workers laying a pipeline.
<p>A memo from J. Udofia, then Shell general manager east, to the state governor, makes a request for 'the usual assistanc' in restoring order. Omuku admits that in Ogoniland this inevitably led to the involvement of the military. 

<p>A spokesman for Shell in London said:"Shell Nigeria has not authorised any financialsupport to the military. If there is any evidence that it has happened, we will look at it"

<H2>' 0il bringing untold damage to Niger delta'- By Geoffrey Lean Environment Correspondent </H2>

<p>OIL HAS brought little but misery to the people of the Niger delta, an authoritative new report reveals.

	<p>The report - which provides heavyweight backing for the protests of the executed writer and environmentalist Ken SaroWiwa -describes in devastating detail how oil production has ruined the area, while leaving the local people poorer and sicker even than other Nigerians.

	<p>It also explodes the oil companies' claim - much repeated by Shell in the row that has followed the killing of Saro-Wiwa and eight fellow Ogoni activists in November - that they have improved the lives of the people by investing in local cornmunities. It says the impact of these initiatives has been "minimal"

	<P>The report - by World Bank environment specialist David Moffat and Professor Olof Linden of Stockholm University says that even official statistics suggest that every year the delta is polluted by 2.3 billion cubic metres of oil from some 300 separate spills, almost one a day, but that the true Sure may be 10 times higher.  It confirms a report in the Independent on Sunday last month that gas flaring from oil production in the area emits some 35 million tons of carbon dioxide and 12 million tons of methane a year, making it the world's largest single contributor to global warming.

	<p>Shell, which produces more than half of Nigeria's oil, has countered condemnation of pollution by pointing out that the death has many other environmental problems, such as overpopulation and {and degradation. But the report published in Ambio, the magazine of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences adds that many of these have been made worse by oil production.

	<p>It says that population growth, swelled by large scale immigration as a result of oil development, is so rapid that food production will have to double in just 20 years if the people ate to remain even as poorly fed as they are today. Yet the industry is helping to destroy the natural resources on which agriculture depends.

	<p>Building canals and roads, largely to service the industry, has precipitated some of the most extensive environmental degradation in the region", the report says. Oil company and government roads block streams and flood plains, creating stagnant ponds of water, killing forests and flooding fields They also give loggers better access to the area's fast-diminishing forests. 

	<p>The report adds that income in the area is below the national average, while health is substantially worse" than in the rest of south-east Nigeria. Tests have found 85 per cent of drinking water samples polluted by sewage, and largely as a result water-related diseases account for four-fifths of all the illness.

	<p>Although oil provides more than 80 per cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange the report says nearly three~quarters of the people of the Delta live in ruralSaro  communities characterised by a lack of development, stagnant agricultural productivity negligible opportunities in urban areas, rapid population growth and tenuous property rights".

	<P>It ascribes the social unrest that led to the execution of Ken Saro Wiwa to 'resentment of the marginalisation of the local communities in contrast to the value of the oil resources".
<p><li> The Royal Geographical Society has voted to dump Shell as one of its sponsors because of its activities in Nigeria At its annual conference on Friday, members  of the 160-year-old society voted by 157 to 10 to remove -Shell as one of its four corporate patrons because of disquiet over the company's environmental and political record.

<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff" link="#ff0000" alink="#ff0000" vlink="#00ff00"><H2>Shell 'paid Nigerian military'-By Geoffrey Lean
- Environment 
Correspondent</H2>

<p>"RUTHLESS  military operations"were proposed specifically to help Shell establish stability in its oil business in Nigeria, a confidential memorandum obtained by the Independent on Sunday reveals. It recommends "wasting vocal individuals" 
	<p>The internal state security memorandum, which is marked "restricted" 12 times, says that regular financial "inputs" from oil companies had been discussed. A British environmentalist said yesterday that the author of the document had told him that his men had been paid by Shell to protect installations.

	<p>Others confidential indicate that Shell asked for armed "assistance" against local demonstrators. And a leading Nigerian yesterday accused the company of "militarising commerce in his country".
<p>Shell admits asking for help
from armed police but strenuously denies paying the military. It says that there have been instances where the Nigerian authorities have "gone too far" and insists that it "does not wish to operate behind military shields".

	<P>But the disclosure of the documents will greatly increase the international row that has followed the execution of the writer and environmentalist Ken SaroWlwa and eight fellow Ogoni activists last month, and will step up pressure on the multinational company to leave- Nigeria. '

	<p>The memorandum, headed "Law and Order in Ogoni etc" and dated 12 May 1994, is to the Military Administrator of Rivers State from the Chairman of Internal Security, Major Paul Okuntimo. It notes: "Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken for smooth economic activities to commence." Under the heading "recommendations Major Ok untimo lists "wasting operations during MOSOP and other gatherings making constant military presence justifiable". (MOSOP IS the Movement for the Survival of  the Ogoni People, to which Ken Saro-Wiwa belonged.)
	<p>He goes on to recommend: "Wasting targets cutting across communities and leadership cadres especially vocal individuals and "wasting operations coupled with psychological tactics of displacement/wasting as noted above."  Under the heading "financial implications (estimates/funding the memorandum lists "pressure on oil companies for prompt regular inputs as discussed". Major  Okuntimo estimated that there would have lo be an "initial disbursement of 50 million naira as advanced allowances to officers and men, and for logistics to commence operations with immediate effect, as agreed".

	<p>Yesterday Nick Ashton-Jones, a British environmentalist, said that Major Okuntimo had told him and a Nigerian lawyer, Oronto Douglas, in June 1994 that he was carrying out his operations for Shell and that he was unhappy because the company had stopped paying his men. Mr Ashton-Jones, who says he was arrested by Okuntimo and beaten on his orders, said that the remark "had stuck in our minds because this was something that we had suspected".

	<p>He says that he has no real doubt that the company had been paying the major, but this
remark is the only evidence he has for it. 
	<p>Shell said yesterday that it was compelled by law to inform the authorities when there was a threat to oil installations and that : it only called in the police when its facilities or staff were at risk, It agreed there had been "instances where the response by the authorities has gone too far with tragic consequences", but added: "The level of response that a country's authorities carry out . . . has got to be a matter for those authorities." The company added: "We categorically refute that any form of input was ever provided to the military; neither would we do so if approached on such a matter."At the end of the day dialogue and cooperation and goodwill between people is the only way forward.

<h2>Shell signs 22 5 billion Nigerian contract- Daily Telegraph- 16th December 1995</h2>
<p>SHELL is to go ahead with a .;multi-million-pound gas project in Nigeria, defying international pressure to halt the
scheme in the wake of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa,  the political activist. Announcing the signing of the contract yesterday, Brian Anderson, managing direct itor of Shell Petroleum Company of Nigeria, said: "We recognise there have been calls for the project to be halted as a gesture of politi cal protest. We respect these views and understand the concerns they reflect. But we cannot accept that this would contribute to the good of Nigeria. Shell is  a 25-6 per cent shareholder in the œ2.5 billion lion construction contract for the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Project.

	<p>Mr Anderson said that the scheme would bring "great and measurable benefits" to Nigerians,  including the environmental benefit of a reduction in the need to "flare" gas.

	<p>Shell says that up to now there has been no other way to dispose of large volumes of the gas produced with the oil of the Delta region. The company says that the collapse of the project, which has taken almost 30 years to -devise, would have meant the collapse of inter-dependent contracts. About 6,000
jobs would be created locally during the construction phase and many more permanent jobs would be created to operate the plant dur ing its 30-year Life. 

	<p>The executions of Mr Saro-Wiwa and eight others last month was condemned by the international community and Shell came under pressure to withdraw from Nigeria. The company was involved in controversy earlier this year over the proposed deep
sea disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform in the north Atlantic. 

	<p>After a campaign by Greenpeace and other environmental groups, opposition from European governments and threats of consumer boycotts, Shell backed down.-PA
<p><font size=+2> Alec Russell in Johannesburg writes:</font> The African National Congress and its affiliates have called on South Africans to boycott Shell garages for two days next week to protest at the company's policy in Nigeria.

	<p>The South African- Nigerian Democratic Support Group, a mixture of political, religious and sports organisations said yesterday it had decided on the action to pressure Shell to push the Nigerian government for democratic reform. The ANC deputy-  secretary general Cheryl Carolus, said that the group would consider a protracted campaign if the boycott on Tuesday and Wednesday had no effect.

	<p>For Shell South Africa, this is a throwback to the Eighties, when anti-apartheid activists applied similar tactics to try to force the company to disinvest from the country. 

	<p>Shell produces half of Nigeria's daily Output œ 1-9 million barrels of oil, and ' critics of the ruling junta believe the Anglo-Dutch company could do more to encourage reform. 

	<p>The South African governmental is split on the call for a boycot. </body></html>

<H2>Shell facing new onslaught over Nigeria

By Paul Adams, Robert
Cosine, William Lewis and
Roger Matthews </H2>


<p>Royal Dutch Shell this weekend comes under renewed attack from pressure groups for its relationship with the Nigerian government. Documents to be released by The Body Shop, the UK cosmetics group which has been leading the campaign against the Anglo-Dutch oil group, are said to show links between the Nigerian government and Shell Nigerian executives.

	<p>Shell's role in Nigeria has been heavily criticised following the Nigerian government's execution of nine minority rights activists from the Ogoni tribe, including writer Mr Ken SaroWiwa. They had accused Shell of causing extensive environmental damage in the ogoni region, one of the main onshore oil producing areas in Nigeria . The Body Shop and other environmentalists and human rights groups have called for consumer boycotts of Shell for not using its position in Nigeria to put pressure on the government.

	<p>One document to be released tomorrow shows a Shell Nigeria manager writing in May 1993 to the governor of Rivers State, which includes Ogoni Land. "We humbly request the usual assistance of His Excellency to enable the project to proceed," wrote Mr J. Udofia in a letter dated May 4 1993. His letter followed heavy disruption to Shell operations in Ogoni Land, from which Shell has since withdrawn.

	<p>Mr Eric Nickson a Shell spokesman, said yesterday. The usual assistance means if there is an incident we are
obliged to notify the authori-  ties that there is a disruption in the supply of oil." He said. "Having done that, and it looked like there was going to be violence and crime, then we normally asked the governor to put the processes in place to stop that."

	<p>Asked if this meant military assistance, Mr Nickson replied: "It is not army."

	Other documents purport to show that Dr Owens wiwa I brother of Mr Saro-Wiwa, attempted to negotiate with Mr Brian Anderson, managing director of Shell's operations in Nigeria. Yesterday Mr Anderson said: "We did not negotiate. We were not in a position to negotiate his (Ken Saro-Wiwa's) release. We had no power to do so."

	<p>Shell and its partners in Nigeria's liquefied natural gas project yesterday announced that they had signed the main construction contract worth an estimated $3bn (1.0bn) with a consortium of Kellogg of the US, Technip of France, Snamprogetti of Italy and the JGC of Japan.

	<p>The LNG gas project is a joint venture between state owned Nigerian National. Petroleum Corporation, Shell Agip of Italy and Elf of France. Meanwhile, a broad South African coalition, headed by  the African National Congress, yesterday called for a two-day local boycott of Shell products in protest at the company's alleged failure to put pressure on the Nigerian regime.

	<P>The South African Nigerian Democracy Support Group,  which includes employers; organisations, unions,, churches and sports groups, said it would picket Shell outlets in South Africa.	</body></html>

Ken Saro-Wiwi<p>

You don't need to be an expert in African politics, economics or history to understand what has happened to Nigerian poet Ken Saro-Wiwa.  <p>
The essential truth is that a man has been hanged for peacefully protesting the destruction of his land and his people by multinational oil interests.<p>

Ken Saro-Wiwa's sentence has been imposed by a military dictatorship acting in collusion with Multinational Oil Companies.  Loved in Nigeria as a poet and playwright, his charismatic, non-violent leadership of the Ogoni has captured headlines around the world.<p>

The Ogoni are one of at least eight minority ethnic groups in the Niger Delta whose land sits over petrolem reserves coveted by Shell Oil.  Pursuit of these reserves has destroyed the Delta's ecosystem polluting land and water in this area which was once known as "the food basket of Nigeria".  Hundreds of Ogoni lives have been lost and villages destroyed.<p>


In May 1994, Nigeria's dictators, led by General Sani Abacha, framed Ken Saro-Wiwa for murder to silence his protests. <p>
They obviously felt death was the only way they could guarantee his silence.<p>

The Ogoni people have lost their spokesman and are now  in more danger than ever.<p>

It's right to feel rage, but don't mourn Ken Saro-Wiwa. <p>
Instead celebrate him in his own words Dance your anger and your joys.<p>

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>Greenpeace welcomes scientists' report on Brent Spar</H4>

         
<P>London--22 May 1996--Greenpeace today welcomed the report by
international scientists brought together by UK Energy Minister
Tim Eggar. The scientists rejected the "case by case" cornerstone
of the UK Government's policy on decommissioning oil and gas
installations, recommending that the Government take into account
the cumulative impacts of all disposals of waste at sea.

<P>The "Scientific Group on Decommissioning" was set up by UK Energy
Minister Mr Tim Eggar in November 1995.  The scientists were
asked to look into the environmental implications of deep sea
disposal of the Brent Spar oil installation, following
Greenpeace's successful campaign to stop Shell dumping it in the
North East Atlantic.

<P>Working under the auspices of the Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC) and chaired by Professor John Shepherd of
Southampton Oceanography Centre, the scientists concluded:-
<P>* The UK Government should not assess each installation purely
on a "case by case" basis. It should also take into account the
cumulative impacts of all disposals of waste at sea.

<UL>
<LI>

The decision making process before licensing the dumping of the
Brent Spar should have included factors such as the need to
conserve energy and resources by reducing, re-using and recycling
waste. Other factors such as public acceptability should also be
taken into account in future.  

<LI>Any problems with disposing of the Brent Spar on shore are no
more difficult than have already been overcome with other
installations.

</UL>

"This report clearly shows that scientific opinion does not back
Government policy," said Dr Helen Wallace of Greenpeace UK.
Energy Minister Mr Tim Eggar "should stop using science as an
excuse to ignore public concern about the environment. He must
announce that all installations will be brought on shore. Doing
so would not only benefit the environment but it could generate
long-term decommissioning contracts and jobs for UK Industry."

<P>Greenpeace said today's report gave a strong backing to the
decision made by the Oslo Paris Commission (1) last year to agree
a moratorium on the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore
installations.  The UK and Norwegian Governments have expressed
reservations to the moratorium.

<P>"Greenpeace believes that this group of scientists have given a
very strong message that the OSPAR moratorium should be turned
into a ban as soon as possible," said Wallace.

<P>NOTES TO EDITORS 

<P>[1] OSCOM Decision 95/1. This was by the Parties to the Oslo
Convention decided at a meeting in June 1995:  "to agree on a
moratorium on the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore
installations until the Oslo Commission or a Commission in its
succession has adopted a Decision on the disposal of offshore
installations with a view to banning the disposal of such      
installations at sea."

<P>[2] NERC report on decommissioning: the main findings
 
<P>The  Committee was set up by the Natural Environment  Research
Council  at the request of Mr T Eggar, the Energy Minister  at
the Department of Trade and Industry following the controversy
surrounding  the attempt to dispose of the Brent Spar  in  the
deep Atlantic in the Summer of 1995.
 <UL>



<LI>Both  cumulative and case by case impacts of the disposal 
     of   off-shore  oil  installations  should  be  assessed, 
     because continued disposals with small individual  impact 
     might  give rise, by small increments, to an unacceptably 
     large overall impact.
 
<LI>Some means should be sought to take public acceptability  
   into account in evaluating future  marine environmental     
impact assessments.
 
<LI>Nothing  in this report should be taken as promoting  the 
     deep sea disposal of decommissioned off-shore structures, 
     or of any other wastes.
 
<LI>Any  decision to proceed, or not to proceed, with dumping 
     oil  structures  or  other wastes in the  ocean  involves 
     social,  economic, ethical, and aesthetic  considerations 
     which  are  outside  the competence  of  the  group,  and 
     judgements  in  which  the technical  assessment  of  the 
     environmental  impact  is  only  one  factor,   and   not 
     necessarily the most important one.
 
<LI>From  an  engineering point of view the difficulties  and 
     hazards of onshore disposal are no more than have already 
     been  encountered  and successfully  overcome  for  other 
     installations.
 
<LI>Many  factors  should  influence a  decision  on  whether 
     disposal   of  off-shore  structures  as  waste   is   an 
     appropriate course of action. These should have  included 
     such  general  considerations as  the  need  to  conserve 
     energy and natural resources by reducing, re-using and re- 
     cycling potential waste whenever practicable.
 
<LI>The  disposal  site  chosen for the Brent  Spar  was  not 
     necessarily unsuitable, but it is unlikely that the  site 
     was  the  most suitable which could be found  within  the 
     criteria used.
 
<LI>The deep sea environment can be surprisingly biologically 
     rich,   but   our   level  of  certainty  regarding   the 
     environment, and hence our predictive ability with regard 
     to environmental impacts, is much lower (in the deep sea) 
     than for inshore areas on the continental shelf.
<LI> Natural and man-made analogues provide good parallels  to 
     many  aspects of the disposal of a structure such as  the 
     Brent  Spar but the local impact of shipwrecks has hardly 
     yet been studied, and considerably more work must be done 
     if the local impact is to be assessed in detail.
 
<LI>If deep sea disposal were to be considered, further study 
     in  depth  of the risks, hazards, engineering procedures, 
     and financial assessments will need to be made before  an 
     unequivocal conclusion for deep sea disposal  as  against 
     other viable disposal means, can be reached.
 
<LI>Much  of  the relevant documentation concerning the  deep 
     sea  disposal  of  the Brent Spar was confidential  until 
     very  recently.   This prevented assessment  by  a  wider 
     community of the case being made.

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>SHELL SYSTEMATICALLY POLLUTED AQUIFER IN TURKEY, LEAKED MEMOS REVEAL</H4>
 
<P>Istanbul, March 26, 1996 (GP) - The multinational oil company Shell has, over
a 25 year period, systematically polluted a huge underground reserve of
potential drinking water in an aquifer near the city of Diyarbakir in Southeast
Turkey where up to two million people live, Greenpeace revealed at a press
conference in Istanbul.

<P>Internal Shell documents leaked to Greenpeace and released today show that Shell
has pumped 487.5 million barrels of production water contaminated with crude
oil, solvents and other chemicals into the Midyat aquifer between 1973 and 1994.
(1)  
 
<P>The documents reveal that Shell knew it was polluting the aquifer, and allocated
money to reduce the problem.  However, Shell later stopped the work, clawed back
the money and sold the operation to the international operating company,
Perenco. 

<P>One of the internal memos leaked to Greenpeace, dated December 22 1995 states:
"It is unfortunate to see a change of priorities towards maximising cash before
divestment by sacrificing environmental targets" (2).

<P>Many of the Shell documents confirm that Shell managers knew that the injection
into the aquifer was against both European Union and Turkish environmental
regulations. (3)  Indeed the Turkish Government tried to order Shell to stop the
pollution. 

<P>Paul Horsman, Greenpeace International's Oil Campaigner, said in Istanbul: "The
double standards and the non-existent ethics of Shell are now clear to
everybody. Shell and Perenco are just keen to make money at the expense of the
environment and the people of Turkey. Shell would have never injected polluted
water into aquifers in Britain or The Netherlands."  
 
<P>After receiving all Shell documents, Greenpeace met with Shell representatives
in Istanbul last January. Greenpeace asked them questions relating to the
pollution of the aquifer. The Shell representatives denied that the oil content
in the water was high as revealed by their documents.

<P>The Shell documents reveal that an additional 172.3 million barrels of polluted
water will be injected into the aquifer by the end of 2001 (4).  In the "worst
case" the aquifer could be polluted up to 14-20 km away from the well by the
year 2006 and that by 2030-2060 it will be under the City of Diyarbakir with
aquifer contamination for 100-300 years.  The reported "likely" case is
pollution apparent at 2.5-5 km from a well and contamination at Diyarbakir after
840-1000 years. (5).

<h4>SHELL IN TURKEY - SUMMARY</h4>

<H5>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL, MARCH 1996 </H5>
 
<P>Greenpeace is in possession of a number of confidential internal
reports and memos, (see Annexes) written over a number of years
by employees of N. V. Turkse Shell oil company (Shell's company
operating in Turkey).  These demonstrate some of the
environmental and safety standards which Shell operate in that
country.  A specific case of systematic pollution is illustrated
as the documents reveal how Shell has been injecting huge amounts
of contaminated water into an aquifer in the Diyarbakir area in
eastern Turkey for over 20 years.  This is the Midyat aquifer
which is a potable water supply.
 
<P>The documents not only reveal that this practice has been
ongoing, but that Shell were aware that it is against European
regulations.  Furthermore, the documents show that it is mainly
relatively small cost savings which prevented Shell from stopping
the practice.  In some of the documents it is acknowledged that
there is a potential threat to the water supply of the city of
Diyabkir over future generations.  The solution to the problem
is to inject the produced water back into the Mardin Oil
reservoir, from which the water originally came and funding was
allocated to change the injection from the aquifer to the oil
reservoir, however, funding for this project was cancelled.  

<P><H5>THE POLLUTION OF MIDYAT AQUIFER</H5>
 
<P>Internal memos from 1986 and 1987 signed by the then General
Manager, C. E. Fay identify the problem and call for increasing
efforts to resolve it.  Subsequently, in 1991, the General
Directorate of Petroleum Affairs (GDPA) in Turkey wrote to Shell
and demanded that "In order to stop contamination in the Midyat
aquifer you are emphatically requested to ensure that henceforth
the necessary measures are urgently taken to have the disposal
waters injected into the Mardin Formation through the wells that
have ceased production, making sure that disposal waters are not
injected into the Midyat Formation, and to inform GDPA about the
matter."
 
<P>Above the Midyat aquifer is a geological gravel formation called
Selmo, through which the wells have to be drilled in order to
reach the aquifer.  (A diagramatic cross-section of the area is
in one of the reports.)  Other memos note that drilling muds have
been lost into this formation and that, because of corrosion of
the pipelines, it is possible that produced water has also
contaminated the Selmo.  This threatens the local rivers and
lakes; in particular a local reservoir called Devegecidi.  
The alternative to disposal into the Midyat aquifer, as noted in
the letter from the authorities, is to re-inject the produced
water into the Mardin oil field.  It is noted that only "a Mardin
disposal scheme ... will give a fully acceptable disposal method
satisfying International legislation".  Hence a Mardin injection
pilot test was being considered in 1989.  
 
<P>However injecting into the aquifer was ongoing in 1994, as a
letter from Turkse Shell to Shell International demonstrates. 
This letter also states that if "as a result of water disposal
into Midyat, the water supply of Diyarbakir is affected then the
water produced for domestic use from wells spread over a large
area is required to be treated or an alternative water supply has
to be found. In both cases the cost is expected to be high."   

<P>This letter shows that between 1973 and 1994, 487.5 million
barrels of production water has been injected into the Midyat
aquifer.  According to earlier memos the amount of oil lost into
the aquifer is between 15 and 35 barrels per day.  In 1994 it is
reported that the current situation is that 82.8% of the daily
produced water is injected into the Midyat aquifer.  In a worst
case scenario, by the year 2006 the polluted water will be 14-20
km away from the injected well and contaminate the aquifer under
the city of Diyarbakir for the next 100-300 years.  The "likely
case" is reported to be contamination after 800-1000 years.  

<P>A further report indicates that, not only has produced water been
injected into the aquifer, but the recommended method for dealing
with radioactive LSA scale (a scale which builds up inside
pipelines and wells) is to grind it up and inject it with the
disposal water.  In fact a valve replacement on one of the lines
showed a high build up of scale and the "radiological testing
indicated this scale to be highly radioactive".  While LSA scale
is described as 'naturally occurring', this is in the oil
reservoir and not in the aquifer.
 
<P>Solving the problem, ie injecting produced water into the Mardin
oil reservoir, is costed at between US$ 2.2 million, (five
converted wells over 1994-95) and US$ 15 million (7 converted
wells by the end of 1995 with a futher 8 planned by the end of
1997).  Shell settle for the cheaper option and in the minutes
of a meeting held in October 1994 the objective is stated as to
achieve "50% injection into the Mardin" oil reservoir by the end
of 1995.
 
<P>However, during 1995 Shell sold the operation to Perenco.  This
sale is completed by the end of the year, but a memo from a
meeting with Perenco representatives in Decmber 1995 states that
"the planned increase in the Mardin injection could not be
achieved ... due to cancellation of funds (US 1.2 million)
originally budgeted for the Mardin water injection projects. Thus
the end of 1995 target of 45% Mardin injection was not achieved
and remained at ca 25%. It is unfortunate to see a change of
priorities towards maximising cash before divestment by
sacrificing environmental targets."
 
<H5>SHELL'S GENERAL STANDARDS OF OPERATIONS IN TURKEY</H5>
 
<P>Two documents reveal the general standards of Shell's operations
in Turkey.  The first document, written in 1991, is a Technical
Safety Audit and highlights a number of environment and safety
issues.  It identifies the fact that since "the management
controls to ensure safety at the work site are not effective the
overall rating is unsatisfactory".  The report also states that
the "present standard of operation may be understandable, ... but
it is unacceptable in a Shell company. Operations which cannot
achieve the required minimum standard should be closed down or
disposed of."  Futhermore it is noted that if is not possible for
the company to "establish control of its operation" then it
"should reconsider whether it wishes to continue as the
operator".  
 
<P>Other issues raised in this report are:
 
   <P>  - a rapid increase in claims for pollution damage; 
 <br>    - a recommendation made in "a 1986 review of field
     measurement ... to provide test lines for the 60% of the  
     wells which cannot be tested except by using the Mobile   
     Test Unit (MTU), has been repeatedly postponed"; 
   <br>   - a commitment to safety and the environment is
     "subordinate to production" in the "middle of the
     organisation"; 
   <br>   - the atmospheric and health problems from a programme of 
     mixing crude with diesel fuel; 
   <br>   - an action to stop "disposal of production water into the 
     potable aquifer as soon as possible as recommended by 1989 
     environmental audit."
 
<P>The second document, written in June 1994 entitled: "Exploration
and Programme Support 1995", discusses some of the problems
highlighted in the technical audit of 1991. It notes that oil
spills reported in 1993 were 218, down from 290 in 1992, which
represents a total of 1,171 tonnes of oil spilt.  It states that
there are plans to reduce the total land payments (compensation
for aquisition and damage) from over US$ 1 million in 1993 to US$
0.5 million by 1997.  However, despite the concerns about
atmospheric pollution arising from the mix of crude and diesel
fuels, further moves to use this mix are planned.
 
<P>Furthermore, under the section discussing environment it is
stated that the Turkish authorities are demonstrating a growing
interest in environmental issues with the possibility of
"relatively stringent legislation being enacted, and a new draft
law introduced which will replace the existing law when
officially published".  This increased interest provides shell
with the following concerns: 
   <P>  - produced water injection, 
    <br> - land farming, 
    <br> - Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) studies, 
     <br>- oil spillages, 
    <br> - waste management, abandonment and clean up of oil
       contamination."
 
<P>In fact there are standards in Europe for most of these issues
and have been for years.  In other European countries, Shell
would have to operate at these standards.  However, a year after
the production of this report, Shell sold off the operations to
the international operating company, Perenco.
 
<H5>WHO IS PERENCO?</H5>
 
<P>Perenco plc is an international oil and gas operating company
formed by merging the two companies, Kelt Energy plc and Perenco
It is based in London and Paris with exploration and production
interests in the US, Britain, Colombia, Gabon and Cameroun.  
The main business strategy, has been to buy unprofitable
producing assets from majors and operate them at a profit after
paring staff and operating costs to a minimum.  They boast that
they operate with 50 per cent of the staff of a major and without
a substantial number of expatriates and "are not afraid to make
itself unpopular with other oil companies, contractors, or
government departments".

</title></head>



<body bgcolor="#ffffef"TEXT="#000000" LINK="#000090"  ALINK="#FF0000" VLINK="#400060><p><H1>	GREENPEACE SUCCESSES, 1995</H1>

<p>This year has seen environmental and peace issues take centre 
stage on the world's agenda.  Greenpeace's work has 
contributed to a number of important international successes 
including:

<p><font size=+1>NUCLEAR</font>

<p> France, the US, the UK, Russia and China commit to signing a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and to pursue other 
nuclear disarmament measures as the price for extending the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May.

<p>France, the US, the UK and recently Russia commit to a zero-
yield CTBT in July and August which is expected to be signed 
in 1996.

<p><font size=+1>OIL</font><a name=oil>

<p>The OSPAR Commission, 14 member states regulating marine 
pollution in the North East Atlantic, bans the dumping of 
obsolete offshore installations in June despite reservations 
from the UK and Norway.

<p>Shell agreed not to dispose of its obsolete oil platform, 
the <a href="../brent/brent.html">Brent Spar</a>

<p><font size=+1>LAND-BASED SOURCES OF MARINE POLLUTION (LBS)</font>

<p>The North Sea Ministerial Conference agrees that the 
discharge, emission and losses of hazardous substances in the 
North Sea must cease within one generation--25 years--in June.

<p> Over 100 countries meeting in Washington, DC under the 
auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) 
agree to adopt a legally binding instrument to ban the 
discharge, emission, manufacture, use and illegal trade of 
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) that may harm the 
environment and human health.  This treaty could be completed 
and up for ratification by the end of 1997.

<p><font size=+1>WASTE TRADE</font>

<p> After years of campaigning by Greenpeace to stop hazardous 
waste exports from industrialized to developing countries, the 
contracting parties to the Basel Convention decided in 
September to ban this practice.

<p>The Bamako Convention, an African waste trade treaty banning 
the import of hazardous waste to the continent, enters into 
force.  A similar treaty for the Pacific, the Waigani Treaty, 
is adopted.

<p><font size=+1>TOXIC CHEMICALS</font>

<p>The German-based company Hoechst voluntarily agrees to phase 
out toxic chloroparaffins in Germany in Brazil.

<p><font size=+1>CLIMATE</font>

<p>At a meeting in Berlin in April, more than 150 countries 
agree to negotiate a legally binding green house gas emissions 
reduction target for the period after 2000.

<p><font size=+1>OZONE</font>

<p> After a four day Greenpeace blockade at a Greek CFC plant, 
the Greek Ministry of the Environment announces that the 
company must reduce its production by 50% in 1995, eliminate 
all CFC production in 1996 and that Greece will phase out 
ozone-depleting HCFCs no later than the most progressive 
European countries.

<p><font size=+1>WHALING</font>

<p> The so-called science behind the Norwegian whaling programme 
was exposed as a sham at this year's International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) meeting when the country's whaling scientists 
made grave mistakes in their whale population estimates 
forcing Norway's whaling quota to be reduced and the IWC to 
ask the country to recall its whalers.
 
<p><font size=+1>OVER-FISHING</font>

<p>In August, the United Nations agreed to a precedent-setting 
global Fisheries Treaty.  The legally binding treaty will set 
new standards for fisheries conservation and, while more 
reforms are needed to solve the global fisheries crisis, is a 
significant step forward.

<p>Canada and the European Union reached a deal limiting the 
catch of falling Turbot wars in March/April off the 
Newfoundland coast after a violent clash between the Canadian 
navy and fishing vessel.  The North Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization (NAFO) deal was an improvement on the fishing 
free-for-all that ignited the fish war and could have meant 
disaster for the turbot stock as it did for cod stocks before 
it.

<p> Despite intense lobbying efforts to prevent it, the US law 
governing fisheries management, the Magnuson Act, was 
reauthorized while plans to establish a fishing quota system 
that would have helped corporations gain control of US fishery 
licenses was abandoned ensuring improved national fishery 
conservation. 


<p><font size=+1>FORESTS</font>

<p>The government of British Columbia agrees to implement 
significant changes to clearcut logging in the region in July 
after a science panel study confirms Greenpeace charges that 
such logging is destroying regional biodiversity.

<p> Following pressure from Greenpeace, the New York Times 
agrees in November to cancel all contracts with logging 
company MacMillian Bloedel, the largest logging company 
operating in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, because 
company continues to clearcut log in defiance of the science 
panel study mentioned above. 

<p>In August, two regions, Vienna City forests and Germany's 
Luebeck Public Forest agree to log only in compliance with 
Greenpeace's sustainable forestry principals and guidelines.

<p><font size=+1>BIODIVERSITY</font>


<p>The highest body of the European Patent Office (EPO), the
Enlarged Board of Appeal, decided in December that genetically 
engineered plants, seeds and their progeny cannot be patented 
under the European Patent Convention (EPC).  This act is 
expected to help to prevent the large-scale commercialization 
of genetically engineered life forms, prevent industry from 
claiming ownership over nature and protect natural 
biodiversity.

<P><H4>NEW OPINION POLL BACKS GREENPEACE STANCE ON OIL PLATFORM DUMPING.</H4>
 

 


<p>London--5 February 1996--Almost three quarters (74%) of the British public who
are aware of the Brent Spar controversy believe Greenpeace should continue its
campaign against the dumping of oil platforms, according to an Opinion Leader
Research  poll carried out for Greenpeace in the UK. Furthermore, 57%  believe
the Brent Spar should not have been dumped in the Atlantic (32% in favour). (1).
 
<p>57% also backed Greenpeace rather than Shell and the UK Government in stopping
the sinking of the Brent Spar.  A clear majority of the public (57%) had heard
of the controversy surrounding the Brent Spar; 41% had not. Only 17% believe
that Greenpeace should not continue to oppose further sinking of other oil
platforms at sea. 
 
<p>The 1,000 person national telephone poll was carried out between 26th and 27th 
January 1996.
 
<p>Chris Rose, Campaign Director of Greenpeace UK said "This polls shows that the
public knows its wrong to use the seas as an industrial dumping ground.  The 
public will never accept it if the Government allows the oil industry to treat
the seas as its rubbish dump. The sea should be for saving - not for dumping."
 
<p>A report commissioned by the oil industry itself (the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators' Association -- UKOOA) stated that the best environmental option for
decommissioned oil installations was to bring them on shore for recycling (2).
 
<p>Chris Rose said "The Government must listen to the public and expert advice to
the oil industry itself. Mr Eggar [UK Minister of Energy] must pledge no North
Sea installations should be dumped at sea."
 
<p>A report commissioned by Greenpeace - entitled "A Case Study of Onshore
Decommissioning Of North Sea Oil Strutures" - stated that over 95% of the Brent
Spar could be recycled, using existing technology.(3)

<TITLE>GREENPEACE APPLAUDS NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION ON ESSO RIG</H4>
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<a href="brent.html"><img align=right src="vict02t.gif" border=0></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>GREENPEACE APPLAUDS NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION ON ESSO RIG</h4>

Oslo--8 March 1996--Greenpeace today applauded the Norwegian Government's decision to reject oil company Esso's proposal to dump the 7000 tonne steel jacket of its Odin rig into the North Sea, and called on the Government to legislate against this type of sea dumping altogether. <P>

The proposal by Esso to dump the jacket of the Odin rig into the North Sea off Bergen was against the company's own environmental advice, which claimed that the steel could be recycled on land, creating 200 jobs for Norwegians, plus a substantial economic gain. <P>

"The Norwegian Government is acting very sensibly in favour of sustainable environmental practice," said Greenpeace Norway's Katrin Glatz Brubakk. "We now need to see the Government pass legislation ensuring that all oil and gas installations are decommissioned on land,"  said Brubakk. <P>

"There is also no reason why Norway and the UK Governments cannot join the vast majority of nations that have already signed onto the Oslo Paris Commission's ban on the dumping of all offshore installations at sea [1]," she said.   <P>

Had the dumping gone ahead, it would have set a precedent for the dumping of up to 416 installations in the North Sea's Norwegian and UK offshore oil sectors, said Brubakk. She noted that the onshore disposal of the Odin rig was the third such decision since Shell reversed its plan to dump its Brent Spar last year.  Elf's North East Frigg in Norway and the installations in the Emerald field off Scotland will both be brought ashore.  <P>

The environmental and economic gains of investing in such a policy would be far more beneficial than the current "case by case" policy adopted by both countries. <P>

Esso also proposed to leave a further 6000 tonnes of steel pipeline in situ on the sea floor.   The Norwegian Department of Trade and Industry has not yet decided on the future of the pipeline, giving a four year delay to that decision.  Greenpeace said that there was no reason why the pipeline should not be dismantled on land also when the Frigg field is decommissioned.<P>

The dumping of the Odin's steel structure would have been the equivalent of the Norwegian Government allowing Esso to dump 7,000 cars into the ocean, she said. <P>

Greenpeace International's Executive Director Thilo Bode yesterday sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, calling on her to recognise the environmental unsustainability of such a move.  Greenpeace Norway also placed an advertisement in Norwegian papers today urging the Government to reject Esso's application. <P>

Esso had proposed to turn the rig's structure into an "artificial reef", but this idea had been vigorously opposed by the Norwegian fishermen.  "This was an attempt by Esso to look green while turning the North Sea into a scrapyard," said Brubakk. <P>

Contact: Katrin Glatz Brubakk, Geir Wang Andersen ++47 22 205 101 <P>
or Cindy Baxter Greenpeace Communications ++44 171 833 0600<P>

[1] The Oslo Paris Commission last June adopted a ban on the dumping of offshore oil and gas installations in the North East Atlantic, "....due to the fact that the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore installations cannot be considered to be a sustainable practice which takes into account the precautionary approach..."<P>

Norway and the UK have both lodged objections to this ban, arguing that the installations should be looked at on a case by case basis. <P>

<P><H4>Background document on Odin</h4>


Esso has proposed that the jacket is toppled in situ and used as an artificial reef. The depth of the site is 103 meters, and is 178 kilometres off the coast - west of Bergen. No bottom dwelling fish, only pelagic (mainly cod). The  sea bed is only mud and sand. <P>
 <P>
The Odin platform is a gas installation with a steel jacket. It is fairly small  - 40 x 40 x 112 meters (jacket). On top the drilling equipment, living quarters. Esso propose to take the top ashore for reuse and recycling. The legs of  the jacket is proposed cut at 5 meters ( either with explosives or by mechanical cutting) and then tipped on its side. That leaves 63 meters of water above the  jacket. They do not want to clean the jacket before toppled, and will leave  paint and anodes on the construction and drilling mud beneath it (not very  much) They also want to leave all the pipelines. <P>
 <P>
A scientific institute in Stavanger, Norway says that it will be very  interesting to study the jacket as a reef, and they believe that it might  have a positive effect. They argue that it will protect fish from fishermen, and therefor be of benefit to the marine environment. This group will get 2,8 million dollars for research if Esso are allowed to topple in situ...   <P>

The political attitude towards this is in general very negative. Nobody really  believes that an artificial reef will have an effect in the North Sea - at that  depth, in an area where there are no natural reefs  and very far away from the coastline. <P>
 <P>
Politicians say that if Esso are allowed to dump, they will probably have to remove it and dump it in a deep fjord, not topple it in situ.   <P>
Esso proposes that they have responsibility of  the jacket, if toppled in situ,  for five years, while the research is going on. After that Norway has to take responsibility. This is a proposal the Government is not too happy about this proposal, so it is likely that they will ask Esso to take full responsibility or <P>
as them to dump on a deeper site instead or ... ask them to take it ashore.   <P>

Decision about what will happen to Odin, is taken by the Government today.  They will need a final approval from the Parliament, but due to the political  situation, it is very rear that a proposal from the Government is changed.   <P>



THE ODIN FIELD<P>
 <P>
The Odin field is placed 178 kilometres west off Bergen, and  has one   fully integrated steel installation, with living  quarters and drilling    equipment. The gas is transported  to the Frigg field for processing, and   from there to St. Fergus in Scotland. The field is 100% owned and   operated by Esso Norway. Total investments in the field since the   beginning of the production has been 4.4 million  UK pounds.   <P>
The field was closed down in August 1994, due to lack of further   gas reserves at the field. It had then been  pumping gas for ten years, at a   total amount of 27,7 billion  Sm3. The field was found in 1970, but   production did not start till October 1984. The platform was installed July   1983.  The weld is closed down, the pipeline is blocked in each end,   cleaned and filled with sea water. Nobody is living on the  platform, but   people from Esso is going out to the platform  once a month to look after   it. <P>
 <P>
Esso has made a environmental/economic study for the different   alternatives of what can be done with Odin. They are especially   emphasising that  toppling of the jacket  can have a positive impact as an   artificial reef at the field.  The platform consists of the separate parts, that  
can be handled in different ways. <P>

 
<pre>           Topside              Jacket          Pipeline   
        1. Recycle              Recycle         Recycle 
        2. Recycle              Recycle         Leave 
        3. Recycle              Dump            Leave 
->->->  4. Recycle              Toppling        Leave 
        5. Dump                 Toppling        Leave 
        6. Toppling             Toppling        Leave 
        7. Dump                 Dump            Leave 
 
* Recycle or reused 
->->-> The option Esso asks for allowance to do - ie. topple jacket in situ   
</pre>
It is however clear that Esso will take the topside ashore regardless of   what the Parliament decides. This because they hope that it will be   possible to reuse this part of the  platform. If that is not possible, they will  <P>
recycle it. All  loose equipment will also be removed, in a hope to reuse   it.  <P>
 <P>
Esso has looked into the environmental benefits of recycling in stead of   producing new steel and other  metals, but also how polluting transport of   the different  parts would be. By recycling in stead of producing new metals,  you save between 85 and 95% of use of energy and water and pollution to air,  land and water. <P>
 <P>
They also look into how much they could earn by selling the metals for recycling. <P>
Total  costs for the different alternatives will however look like this:   <P>
Alt. 1. 37,7 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 2. 26,6 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 3. 27,7 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 4. 19,7 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 5. 20,0 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 6. 21,3 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 7. 28,0 million pounds <BR>
<BR>
 
 
So bringing everything ashore will cost about 13 million pound more than  toppling. 7 million to bring the jacket ashore, but to leave the pipeline.  (NB - Numbers have changed since they gave this figure to the  government - estimated costs of removing the jacket now - 3 to 4 million  pound, i.e. half the cost!) <P>
 <P>
Esso will only have to pay part of the costs of decommissioning the   platform.  Norway will pay a certain percentage of the total costs. How   high the percentage will be, depends on how much tax Esso has paid to   Norway during their operational period. This is somewhere between 60   and 70 %. In addition to that Esso can ask for economical help from the   Parliament. There is no fixed rule for how much this can be, but in the   case of Nord Oest Frigg, Norway paid 60 % of the costs (including the   percentage of the tax)  <P>
 <P>
Employment effects of the alternatives <P>

 
Alt.1. 640 people employed for one year <BR>
Alt.2. 560 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.3. 560 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.4. 450 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.5. 430 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.6. 470 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.7. 520 --------------"--------------- <BR>

 <P>
So 190 more jobs by taking everything ashore instead of toppling, like  Esso would like to do. <P>
 <P>
The report states that the best environmental option would be to recycle   all parts of the installation, but that alternative 3 and 4 is fully   environmental acceptable, since the jacket consists of only small amounts   of  toxic chemicals, and that the area in general is not very polluted.  Esso   also states that the fishing ground in the area is not  very commonly used,   and not used at all by Norwegian fishermen. Scottish fishermen are the only   once using the area.  <P>
 <P>
Esso's suggestion of what to do with Odin, is alternative four.(the   cheapest alternative) That includes that the topside is taken a shore for   reuse or recycling, the jacked is toppled in situ and the pipeline is left   where it is. Esso claims that this is the best alternative, since they remove    and recycle the most polluting parts, and that the jacket will be perfect as   an artificial reef. Esso has also offered a scientific institute in Bergen/ Stavanger  1,7 million  pounds to research on the effects of such a reef.    <P>
Esso has send this suggestion to the Department of Energy and Industry.   The suggestion has then been commented on by different parties. After  looking into all different suggestions, the Department send their suggestion to the Parliament who makes the final decision.  The decision in parliament  will probably be taken mid April/beginning of May. <P>
 <P>
When the decision is taken, Esso will give the assignment for   removal/toppling/dumping to a company who can deal with all parts of   the operation (this company might contact sub-operators, but Esso   doesn't care about that. The want the task done) Esso have however   asked for an offer from different companies for the removal operations for   all the options to make sure they are prepared  when the Parliament    decides what shall be done. Esso does not want to say how fast they will   start the operational process after the decision from Parliament, but it is   likely that they will start more or less immediately. <P>

 <P>
The total weight of the platform, including the pipeline,  is 29.011 tons.   The pipeline alone weights 15.082 tons, and is 26400 meters long (dia   20") <P>
 <P>
The Jacket consists of 7000 tons of structural steel, 30 tons of PVC, 133   tons of steel pipes and approx. 207 tons present in anodes(aluminium   anodes). The anodes consist of approx. 3% zinc, in total an amount of 6,2   tons.  The weight of metals like copper, chrome and nickel in the steel is 40   tons. <P>
 <P>
The pipelines consists 6000 tons of structural steel, and  have a   protection shell of asbestos ( 29 tons) and tear (16,6 tons). In addition   the pipeline has a shell of concrete(9000 tons) to heighten the weight. 567   aluminium anodes are still attached to the pipeline, and are estimated to   weight 53,5 tons (originally 100 tons)<P>

	<P><H4><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">1	SYNOPSIS</A></H4>

<P>	1.1.	The Brent Spar was installed in the North Sea Brent Field in 1976, to provide a storage and tanker off-loading system for the Brent platforms: The buoy is approximately 140 m in
height, cylindrical in shape and moored to the sea bed by six anchors. it is made up of large
oil storage tanks at the base, buoyancy tanks towards the middle and topsides containing
the offshore tanker loading equipment.

<P>	1.2.	The Spar reached the end of its useful working life in the late 80's and was taken out of commission in 1991, in preparation for abandonment. Various onshore and offshore
abandonment options have been examined by the operators, Shell (UK) Exploration and
Production. The preferred option is to tow the structure to an approved deep water disposal
site in the NE Atlantic and sink it. A summary of the selection process can be found in the
Best Practicable Environmental Option Assessment Report for the Brent Spar abandonment.

<P>      1.3.	This report describes the predicted fate of the Spar based on the characteristics and contents of the buoy, and current knowledge of the deep sea environment. The term used to describe
this type of prediction in the '1991 Oslo Commission Guidelines for the Disposal of Offshore
Installations at Sea' is an 'Impact Hypothesis'.

<P>	1.4.	The environmental impacts of three sinking scenarios have been considered. The most likely scenario is that the buoy will sink to the sea bed and remain intact after impact. This means that the residual contaminants contained within the structure will slowly leak into the
bottom waters arid sediments ('slow release' scenario). The alternative of major damage to
the storage tanks (and fast release of residual contaminants contained within the structure 
'fast release' scenario) on impact is considered less likely to occur. The third alternative of
tank damage (and release of some of the residual contaminants in the near surface
environment - 'surface release' scenario) is considered unlikely to occur. In all cases,
corrosion of the structure will slowly release metals into the water column.

<P>	1.5.	The potential environmental impacts of each sinking scenario are discussed and the Impact Hypothesis for the most likely scenario (i.e. 'slow release') is developed. For all three
scenarios the hull of the buoy will remain intact for several thousand years due to the slow
rates of corrosion. Eventually the structure will break up and become buried in the sediment
system. The potential environmental impacts from the physical presence of the structure will
be highly localised.

<P>	1.6.	In the 'slow release' scenario, elevated levels of hydrocarbon and heavy metal would be concentrated in the sediment close to the structure, although hydrocarbon may be detectable
up to c.500 m and biological effects up to 150 - 250 m from the structure. The effects of the
'rapid release' scenario, would follow a similar pattern although the area affected would be
expected to be larger (hydrocarbon may be detectable up to c.l000 m and biological effects
up to 500 m from the structure) but the effects would be over a much shorter duration. Given
the small numbers of organisms present in the deep ocean and low encounter rates with the
affected area, effects will be insignificant. In the third and least likely scenario (i.e. 'surface
release'), the overall effects on the benthos would be similar to those in the two scenarios.
The additional impacts of the surface release on pelagic organisms in the 'sinking zone'
would be insignificant.

<P>	1.7.	Conservative modelling of the long-term fate of the low specific activity scale. indicates that the estimated dose rates to individuals (human) would be several orders of magnitude
less than those regarded by the IAEA as de minimus for the purposes of regulatory control.
Similarly, dose rates to human populations would be well within those acceptable to IAEA.
The dose rates to deep sea organisms would be within the ranges encountered in nature and
effects on natural populations would not be expected.

<P><H4><A NAME="STRUCTURE">2. STRUCTURE OF DOCUMENT<A></H4>

<P>	2.1.	The selection of deep sea disposal as the preferred abandonment option for the Brent Spar as been described in the Best Practicable Environmental Option Assessment Report. The
present document develops and describes the Impact Hypothesis for the disposal of the buoy
at an authorised site in the North East Atlantic.

<P>	2.2.	The Brent Spar, and a summary of the inventory of materials associated with the structure, is described in Section 3. A synopsis of the proposed abandonment operation is provided in
Section 4 and the main features of the potential disposal sites in the NE Atlantic outlined in
Section 5.

<P>	2.3.	The fate of the structure from the time it is sunk to the time it eventually breaks up and becomes incorporated into the sediment system is discussed in Section 6. Three possible
scenarios for the fate of the structure during the initial sinking are considered.

<P>	2.4.	The fate and effects of the residual hydrocarbon and heavy metal contaminants contained within the structure are described in Section 7 and the long-term fate and effects of the
small amounts of Low Specific Activity Scale (LSA) considered in Section 8. More details on the mathematical models used in the long term predictions of LSA scale are included in an Annex.

<P>	2.5.	The conclusions are presented in the form of a short Impact Hypothesis in Section 9.




<P><H4><A NAME="SUMMARY">3. SUMMARY INFORMATION ON THE BRENT SPAR</A></H4>

<P>3.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY

<P>	3.1.1.	The Brent Field is located in Block	211/29 of
the UK Sector of the North Sea, some 190 km
ENE of Shetland. The Spar is located at
Latitude 61degø03' 14.7" N, Longitude 01degt40'04" E,
approximately 2.9 km from the Brent 'A'
platform and 1.9 km from Brent 'B' platform the
water depth in the field is some 140m.

[Figure omitted]

<P>3.1.2. The Brent Spar is a 29m diameter cylindrical buoy which floats vertically in the water with a draft of 109m and a height above water of 28m. It is moored to the sea bed by six anchors. It was constructed using techniques similar to those of ship building and the main structure consists of a thin outer skin of 20 mm plate steel, stiffened by ribs and bulkheads.

<P>3.1.3. The upper section consists of a helideck, crane, tanker mooring and loading boom, and accommodation for 30 people. In the middle of the structure are twelve buoyancy tanks. Below this, the main storage area is divided into six tanks which extend to the base of the buoy, and have a total capacity for c. 300,000 barrels of oil. At the base of the buoy, there is a sealed compartment containing the permanent ballast.

<P>3.1.4. The facility was used to store oil produced at the Brent 'A' platform and to act as a tanker loading facility for the Brent Oil Field. Installed in 1976, it was the sole route for the export of crude oil until the Brent System Pipeline was commissioned in 1978. Since 1978, the Spar has continued to be used as an alternative export route.

<P>3.1.5. The costs of maintaining the Spar increased substantially in the period 1987 to 1990. In 1991, a review concluded that the work necessary to refurbish the facility. and extend its operational life. would cost up to £90 million. The buoy would have to be taken out of commission for a 2 - 3 year period during the refurbishment. Given the age of the structure, the presence of a pipeline system for the export of crude oil and the substantial cost; of refurbishment, it was decided that the Brent Spar should cease operations. It was taken out of commission in September 1991 after l5 years service, in preparation for abandonment.

<P>3.2. INVENTORY OF MATERIALS 

<P>3.2.1. The total weight of the structure is 14,500t, made up of 6,700t of structural steel. 6,800t of permanent ballast and 1000t of equipment. The permanent ballast is solid and made up of haematite, embedded in concrete. Like steel, this material is considered to be inert.

<P>3.2.2. Of particular relevance to the eventual disposal of the structure are the materials (e.g. heavy metals. oils etc.) which might pose a threat to the environment. Inventory items have been classified in accordance with the "Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic 1992" (Oslo and Paris Commissions - OSPARREV). This Convention regulates substances and materials whose disposal at sea is controlled and are referred to as "regulated substances". Surveys carried out in 1991 identified a number of these substances aboard the Spar (AURIS, 1994; Metocean, 1993). These are dominated by three generic classes of 'regulated substances', notably the petrogenic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and low specific activity scale, although there are small quantities of other classes on the structure.


<P>3.2.3. Equipment throughout the structure contains small quantities of heavy metals (in metallic form) as an integral part of the materials of construction. The sacrificial anodes contain an estimated 28.7t of aluminium, 10.2t of zinc metal and minor quantities of cadmium (8 kg), lead (0.6kg), and mercury (0.lkg). Electric cables contain some 13.5t of copper and paint on the structure includes some 3.5t of zinc. Small quantities of lead (2.5kg) and of nickel (3.5kg) are contained in remaining batteries.

<P>3.2.4. Small quantities of other materials are also contained in some of the equipment. Although PCB-containing transformer fluids were replaced some years ago, traces of PCB (<20ml) may still remain in the two transformers. Synthetic materials and plastics are also located on the structure (e.g. in fittings in the accommodation/control room and cable insulation) but the exact quantities are not known (AURIS, 1994; Metocean, 1993).

<P>3.2.5.	The oil storage tanks contain some 48,000m3 of sea water together with an estimated 100t of oily sludge at the bottom. A 1991 analysis indicated that the oily sludge contains an
estimated 9.2t of oil and a number of heavy metals, including cadmium (5.8kg), chromium
(2.1 kg), copper (42.9kg), nickel (3.9kg), lead (8.9kg), zinc (87.4kg), arsenic (0.3kg), and
mercury (0.2kg). The remainder of the sludge is composed of a mixture of sand and scale.
The walls of the storage tanks are also coated with an estimated 41.3t of hydrocarbons, in the
form of thin layer of oil and wax.

<P>4.2.6 The sea water in the storage tanks has not been analysed in detail and it has been conservatively assumed that it will contain hydrocarbons (up to 40ppm) from the residual oil in the tanks together with zinc (up to 12ppm) and aluminium (up to 19ppm) from the internal anodes (AURIS, 1994). In 1991, the storage tanks were treated with 4,500 litres of glyoxal to remove hydrogen sulphide which had accumulated within them. Glyoxal reacts with hydrogen sulphide to form various thiols. It is believed that all the glyoxal reacted in this way and that all the reaction products were removed from the tank during the 1991 decommissioning operation (AURIS, 1994).

<P>3.2.8. Scale is commonly found in oil processing facilities throughout the world. In many areas scale may be contaminated by deposition of small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive salts from the oil reservoirs formation to form low specific activity (LSA) scale. The sludge and scale in the Brent Spar contain a number of naturally occurring radio nuclides, some of which have very short radioactive half-lives (seconds, minutes or hours) and others which are longer-lived (half-lives of years). These radio nuclides are all members of "chains", that is they are formed by the decay of radioactive parents and themselves decay into radioactive daughters (except for the last chain member which is stable). In order to estimate the radiological impact of sea disposal of the installation, it is necessary to know the quantities of radio nuclides present. particularly those with longer half-lives. The relevant radio nuclides and their half-lives are: radium-226, 1600 years; lead-210, 22.3 years; polonium-210, 138 days; radium-228, 5.75 years; thorium-228, 1.91 years.

<P>3.2.9. Measurements have been made of the concentrations of some radio nuclides in the sludge in the Brent Spar storage tanks. In the case of scale, radio nuclide concentrations can be derived from measurements made on material from the Brent Alpha and the Brent Bravo. The average activity of radium-226 and actinium-228 in the sludge is 4.5 and 3 Bq g-1. respectively. The average activity of radium-226 and actinium-228 in the hard scale is 17.6 and 15.2 Bq g-l, respectively. in the pipework. Conservatively. taking the total masS OFsludge on the Spar to be 100 tonnes and that of scale to be 30 tonnes, and assuming that all the radio nuclides present are in secular equilibrium, gives the following results for the quantities of the longer-lived radio nuclides in both sludge and scale (see Annex for further details).



	<UL>Radionuclide        Activity (GBq)

			Mean	Min	Maximum

	Radium-226	0.98	0.17	2.2

	Lead-210	0.98	0.17	2.2

	Polonium-210	0.98	0.17	2.2
	Radium-22a	0.76	0.12	2.0
	Thorium-228	0.76	0.12	2.0</UL>

<P>3.2.10. These quantities can be placed in perspective by comparing them to calculations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as part of its work to provide the categories of radioactive waste for the purposes of the London Dumping Convention (IAEA, 1986). The IAEA calculated the quantities of radio nuclides which could be disposed of in the deep ocean each year for 1000 years without giving rise to radiation doses exceeding the limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The quantities in the Brent Spar sludge and scale are less than one millionth of those calculated by the IAEA.

<P>3.2.11. For further perspective, a comparison can be made with levels of radio nuclides which are naturally present in sea water. Using ranges of sea water concentrations of radium-226, lead-210, polonium-210, radium-228 and thorium-228 (Pentreath, 1988; IAEA, 1988a), it can be shown that the total quantities of these radio nuclides in Brent Spar sludge and scale are of the order of one hundred millionth to one millionth of those in the water of the North East Atlantic.

Brent Spar Abandonment - Impact Hypothesis  15/12/94


	<P><H4><A NAME="ABBA">4.	SUMMARY OF PROPOSED ABANDONMENT OPERATIONS</A></H4>
	<P>4.1.	Thirteen possible methods of abandonment or re-use were initially put forward for
consideration, of which six were identified as viable options:

<UL>Horizontal Dismantling (and Onshore Disposal)
Vertical Dismantling (and Onshore Disposal)
In-Field Disposal
Deep Water Disposal
Refurbishment and Re-Use
Continued Maintenance</UL>

<P>	4.2.	Of these, horizontal dismantling and deep water disposal were considered in detail to determine the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO) for disposal. The BPEO
Assessment demonstrated that the preferable option would be to dispose of the Brent Spar at
an authorised deep water disposal site, on the grounds of reduced technical risk; the reduced
safety risk to the workforce; the insignificant environmental impact; and the total cost.

<P>	4.3.	Prior to deep sea disposal the Spar would be 're-entered', the topsides made safe and the state of the structure evaluated. To minimise the potential environmental impacts at the deep
water disposal site, a clean-up operation involving trained personnel would remove accessible hazardous materials for disposal onshore. This would include fuel oil, lubricants, household items. and where possible, heavy metals and synthetics.

<P>	4.4.	Explosives experts would then board the buoy and place the charges around the ballast tanks, which would eventually be used to sink Brent Spar. The number, weight, type and position of the charges installed would be sufficient to ensure that all air filled compartments flooded,
even if some charges failed to detonate.

<P>	4.5.	Two tugs accompanied by an attendant survey vessel would then tow the buoy to the selected deep sea disposal site, using two of the anchor chains as tow lines. The remaining chains
would be used as emergency tow lines. Three general areas have been identified by the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department (SOAFD) as potentially suitable for the
disposal of redundant offshore structures. These are located within U.K. waters and lie in
water depths in excess of 2000 m.



[Figure omitted]

<P>	4.6.	The tow would be conducted
using conventional maritime
practices. All routes from
the Brent Field to the
disposal sites pass to the
north of the Shetland
Islands and to the north
west of the Outer Hebrides.
Whichever site is selected,
the earlier stages of the
planned routes would
essentially be common. The
first part of the tow, to the
200 m contour, would be
subject to detailed survey.
to ensure that the buoy did
not encounter any
unexpected  obstructions.
The route for the latter stage of the tow would depend on the dump site selected: The precise routing would be determined by the requirements for adequate water depth, sufficient clearance from installations and the need for sufficient sea room for manoeuvre should bad weather or accident result in breaking of the-tow.


<P>	4.7.	Prior to sinking the buoy the exact and correct position would be confirmed. The tow vessels would then mechanically release the tow lines and stand off for the detonation of the
explosives by remote control. The charges would be detonated simultaneously, to open the
buoyancy tanks to the sea. This would result in rapid flooding of all the empty tanks which
would remove the remaining buoyancy and sink the structure.








<P><H4><A NAME="DISPOSAL">5. DISPOSAL ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>

<P>5.1. DISPOSAL SITE LOCATION

<P>5.1.1. The location of the three potential deep water disposal sites, identified by SOAFD, are:

	<UL>NAME			CO-ORDINATES

	North Feni Ridge		59deg07'N
				11deg10'W

	Rockall Trough		57deg05'N
				10deg45'W

	Maury Channel		58deg00'N
				22deg30'W</UL>

<P>	5.1.2.	A detailed survey was carried out in August - September 1994 by Shell Expro and SOAFD, to determine the suitability of the proposed disposal sites and, if possible, to identify the
optimum site for disposal of the Brent Spar. The survey also collected baseline data against which any future consequences of the disposal operations could be monitored.

<P>5.2. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

<P>	5.2.1.	The water in the North East Atlantic is continually moving in response to wind,
temperature, and salinity gradients. The flow of the currents set up are moderated and
directed by the physical presence of land masses, the contours of the sea bed and other
bodies of water. The scale of movement is massive and the water moves with immense
inertia. The inflow of water into an area is always counterbalanced by a corresponding
outflow and at one position, water at different depths may be moving in completely
different directions.

<P>5.2.2.  The circulation is influenced by the north easterly movement of warm, saline North Atlantic Drift on the surface, into the Norwegian Sea, and the outflow of dense, cold, water at depth from the Norwegian Basin to the south and west into the Iceland Basin and Rockall Trough.

<P>	5.2.3.	The continental shelf in the NE Atlantic slopes fairly gently down to a depth of c. 200m. At the seaward edge of this shelf, the downward gradient increases on the continental
slope. The base of the slope gives way to the continental rise which leads down to the
abyssal plain, c. 4km deep. The plain may be relatively featureless, with a slope of 1:1000.
In places it may be interrupted by sea mounts (extinct volcanoes), that do not reach the
surface of the water. These features correspond to the ecological zones illustrated.

<P>5.2.4. The surface waters are isolated from the deep water by the permanent thermocline below which the temperature falls relatively slowly with depth to below 4degC. The depth of the thermocline is generally in the region of 1000m. Above this zone, the water is well mixed and relatively homogeneous. Near the sea bed, there is a layer of homogeneous water, bounded at its upper limit by the Benthic Boundary Layer. This is formed due to the friction of the sea bed against the water and its thickness depends upon the topography of the sea bed but it is generally restricted from 10 - 100 metres above the sea bed (Richards, 1990).

<P>5.2.5. There is relatively sparse information on the bottom current flow in the NE Atlantic. Current velocities are generally lower than those found in surface waters and are typically < 10 cm/sec. For example. in the Rockall Trough, the mean current velocities were only 1 - 2 cm/sec (Metocean, 1993). The flow of cold water from the Norwegian Basin is not constant and is augmented by the semi-diurnal tidal influence, which can increase the current velocity up to 20 cm/sec. The currents are also subject to periodic reversals as the result of persistent mesoscale eddies, thrown off by strong surface flows, like the Gulf Stream. These are large scale phenomena (c. 50-200km) and may persist for two years or so. These eddies produce current velocities of up to 50 cm/sec, giving rise to 'benthic storms' in which vast quantities of sediment may be picked up and re-deposited (Hollister and McCave. 1984).

<P>5.2.6. The rates of sedimentation and the composition of the sediment depends upon the depth of the water. the proximity to land. the productivity of the overlying ocean and the latitude. Siliceous oozes are ubiquitous in the deeper parts of the ocean and are formed from deposition of diatoms. Radiolarian oozes are found in the tropics. and calciferous oozes are formed from foramaniferans in (relatively) shallow water. Within non-productive water masses (e.g. oligotrophic gyres), the main contributors to sedimentation are volcanic and wind blown desert dust which form the so-called 'red clays'. The rate of sedimentation varies between 0.1-0.2 cm per thousand years for the red clays. to 20cm per thousand years on the continental shelf .The mean sediment depth in the North Atlantic is 300-600m, with 1200m in the basins.

<P>5.2.7. Sediment can move downslope due to sediment slides and slumps. debris flows and turbidity currents. Slides and slumps may occur on slopes as low as 2 degrees and may involve large volumes of sediment. Debris flows, the slow movement of sediment downslope, occur on slopes of less than 0.5 degrees. Turbidity currents are high velocity density currents that carry sediment and water down the continental rise and out onto the abyssal plain. There Iis evidence that these phenomena account for the rapid movement of huge amounts of sediment over long distances (Nardin et al., 1979).

<P>5.3. LIVING RESOURCES

<P>5.3.1. Primary production takes place in the upper water of the ocean. In the North Atlantic the diatoms are the main primary producers and their production peaks twice a year, in the early and late summer (Mauchline, 1986). The small plants are grazed by zooplankton, composed predominantly of crustaceans (e.g. copepods and krill), whose numbers peak in the summer, slightly later than the primary producers. These in turn are preyed upon by carnivorous zooplankton, such as medusae, ctenophores, chaetognaths, gymnosomatous and pteropods. Both the herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton provide the major food source for fish.

<P>5.3.2. The abundance of fish depends upon the quantity of food available to them. In general, the deep ocean is not as productive as coastal and shallow waters of the Continental Shelf. Commercially exploited fish in the NE Atlantic include blue fin tuna, redfish, poutassou and various gadoids (ICES, 1992).

<P>5.3.3. At any deep water site, the 'ecosystem' overlying it may be divided into zones differentiated principally by depth. The deeper water fish, living below about 1500 m, are relatively isolated from those above and there is little vertical migration across this boundary. The numbers and density of the surface fish will be determined largely by the production in the near surface water, The deep water animals are, with certain exceptions, entirely dependent, both directly and indirectly, upon the downward flow of material derived from the surface water above (e.g. corpses, faecal pellets etc.).

<P>5.3.4. The fish species found at depth are different from those in shallower water and are adapted to life in the high pressure, dark deep sea environment. The biomass found in oceanic waters decreases with depth so that at 4 km there is only in the order of 1% of that found near the surface. However, within a 100 m or so of the ocean floor, the biomass of animals increases again (Wischner, 1980).

<P>5.3.5. The animals on or near the bottom may be mobile, fixed to the bottom or live in the sediment and many different groups are represented. The animals found may be artificially grouped by decreasing size into the megafauna (also known as epifauna), macrofauna, meiofauna and microfauna. The most conspicuous mobile animals of the megafauna are the fish which are dominated by-the macrourids (rat tails), then the brotulids, sickleheads, deep sea cod and benthopelagic eels. All tend to be general feeders, consuming the epifauna but not the infauna (Gordon, 1987). Also included in this group are the Porifera (e.g. glass sponges), Ceolenterata (e.g. sea firs, sea pens, sea fans and the soft, black and horny corals), Echinodermata (e.g. sea lilies and feather stars), Crustacea (e.g. giant amphipods and decapod crustaceans), together with various species of Annelida, Bryozoa, Brachiopodia and Ascidiacea.

<P>5.3.6. The macrofauna are dominated by the polychaetes (bristle worms), together with the crustaceans and molluscs. The meiofauna are made up of both multi-celled and single celled animals. Of the former, the Nematoda dominate followed by small benthic copepods and ostracods. Of the latter, the most diverse are the Foraminifera (of which there are 6000 known species) and the xenophytophores (giant protozoans). The smallest of all the animals are found in the most superficial layers of sediment and comprise of various flagellates. sporozoans, ciliated amoeba and yeast cells.

<P>5.3.7. The numbers of birds found over deep water are markedly lower that those found nearer shore. The species expected would be Leach's petrel, storm petrel, fulmar, kittiwake and puffin. The highest numbers of birds are found over the shelf break, on the margin between deep water and the edge of the continental shelf, and are generally found during the winter and the early spring.

Brent Spar Abandonment - Impact Hypothesis 15/12/94

<P>5.3.8. Although there are records of seals from far offshore areas, such as Rockall, the only mammals generally found far offshore are whales and dolphins. These animals tend to follow their food and undertake seasonal migrations to the rich feeding grounds in the Arctic and Antarctic waters and to specific breeding grounds in less extreme latitudes. Although widespread in the North Atlantic, they do frequent specific migratory routes. The most used one runs north/south offshore from the continental shelf (Metocean, 1993). The mammals that will use this are the Blue, Fin, North Atlantic Right, Sei, Sperm, Bottle-nosed, Pilot, Humpback and Killer whales.

<P>5.4. RESOURCE USE

<P>5.4.1. One of the main considerations during the selection of potential disposal sites was the use made of the area by other legitimate users of the sea. Potential resource uses in the area of the disposal sites are restricted to fishing, shipping, oil and gas exploration and production, deep sea mining, military activities and sub-sea cables (Metoceon, 1993).

<P>5.4.2. Most fishing activities in these water depths are confined to the upper c. 1000m, although equipment to extend this to c. 1500m is being developed (SOAFD - Personal Communication): Also, most frequently used shipping routes across the Atlantic do pass over the proposed disposal site areas.

<P>5.4.3. Oil and gas exploration and production activities are currently confined to the shallower continental shelf regions. As resources in these areas are depleted, activities will inevitably extend to prospects in deeper water. Sedimentary basins which might contain oil and gas underlie the two inner disposal sites. However, the area of the disposal sites will be small in comparison to the area of these basins and the potential for future conflict small.

<P>5.4.4. The only other mineral resource that has been seriously considered for exploitation is deep sea mining for manganese nodules. The distribution of manganese nodules is highly variable but the most extensive fields lie in the Pacific, and the potential for the North Atlantic appears to be very low. As yet no commercial mining operations have been started anywhere.

<P>5.4.5. No military exclusion zones are located in the disposal site areas. However, the Rockall disposal site is within an area used for submarine exercises.

<P>5.4.6. There are a number of existing and proposed sub-sea cables that cross the disposal site region. However, the location of the disposal sites have been selected to avoid these.

<P><H4><A NAME="FATE">6.	FATE AND EFFECTS OF THE STRUCTURE</A></H4>

<P>6.1. SINKING SCENARIOS

<P>6.1.1. The disposal operation has been designed to ensure that the buoy sinks in the vertical, without any tanks imploding or any debris breaking away. Engineering studies indicate that the structure should remain largely intact upon impact with sea bed, although some damage may occur at the base. The main effects of this would be on the permanent ballast compartment and possibly the lower part of the storage tanks. This would have no affect on the solid ballast (made up of haematite embedded in concrete) but could initiate the slow release of the contents of the storage tanks, immediately after impact. While this is the most likely scenario, there is always some uncertainty in an operation of this type.

<P>6.1.2. For the purposes of the Impact Hypothesis, three possible scenarios are considered as illustrated.

.

<UL>Scenario	Probability	Description 		Contaminant Release
		of		
		Occurring

	1	High	 Buoy sinks to sea bed and remains	Slow release of all 										CONTAMINANTS

	2	Medium	Buoy sinks to sea bed and tanks	Fast release of ballast water and

		Low	sinks				water and sludge contaminants in
							the near surface waters (within 100
							- 200m). As per scenario 2 once the
							buoy is on the sea bed</UL>

<P>	NOTE 1: Should some of the air filled compartments not be flooded as planned, a local rupture could  occur during descent. This would affect the air containing compartment but not the main storage tanks which should remain filled with sea water, throughout. This scenario relates to a hypothetical situation of partial release of the storage tank contents into surface waters. A worst case assumption of a 10% loss of the total tank contents (i.e. equates to over a 50% loss from one tank) has been taken for demonstrative purposes .

<P>6.2. IMPACT OF THE STRUCTURE ON THE SEA BED

<P>6.2.1. The buoy is likely to hit and penetrate the sea bed with the base and then topple on to its side. As the structure approaches the sea bed, the surge preceding it and the impact itself will displace sediments from the impact zone. The sediment cloud produced would drift with the near bottom current while the particles gradually settled back onto the sea bed again. The area affected by the initial impact and subsequent re-deposition of sediment is difficult to forecast accurately.

<P>6.2.2. The minimum area affected by impact would be equivalent to the area of the base of the buoy (approximately 700 m2). plus the area of the buoy when lying on its side (probably up to a maximum of 2,800 m2). Assuming that only the top 10 cm of sediment is displaced to the water column, then some 350 ml of sediment may be re-suspended during the initial impact. Given that most of this material is mud or clay, with settling velocities in the region of 0.002 m/s. current velocities of 0.1 m/s and a sediment cloud of up to 10 -20 m high, most of the material would be expected to resettle within 500 - 1000 m of the point of impact. Studies on disposal of dredged materials confirm that sea bed sediment clouds produced from dumping activities generally persist for short periods of time (Pequegnat, 1983).

<P>6.2.3. Sea bed animals living in the impact zone would be damaged or killed by physical burial or gross disruption of their habitat. Those immediately adjacent to the impact zone (i.e. within 1 -200 metres or so) may be smothered by the re-sedimenting particles. Outside this area, as the cloud spreads radially outwards and becomes more dispersed, any effects on benthic communities will decrease and are unlikely to be detectable beyond one to two hundred metres from the point of bottom contact.

<P>6.2.4. After the impact and resettlement of the sediment, re-colonisation of the newly deposited sediments and the new hard surfaces of the Brent Spar will take place from the surrounding communities. There is evidence to suggest that many deep sea sediment species may be able to survive burial (under 5-6 cm of sediment) and full recovery of the benthic communities can occur within 12 - 24 months (Kukert and Smith, 1992). Thus, the long term effects on the sediment communities from the sea bed disturbance would be negligible. The buoy like other deep sea wrecks, will provide a new surface for fixed animals to grow on, and these in turn will provide a habitat and source of food for mobile animals such as worms, shrimps, crabs and deep sea fish (AURIS, 1994).

.<P>6.3. LONG TERM FATE OF THE STRUCTURE ON THE SEA BED

<P>	6.3.1.	The bulk of the Brent Spar is composed of structural steel (approximately 7,600t) and a solid concrete and haematite ballast (6,800 t). The long term fate of the main hull of the buoy will be largely independent of the state in which the buoy arrives at the sea bed (e.g. whether the
tanks are ruptured), but will depend on the rate of corrosion of steel in the deep ocean. At
the time of disposal, the steel structure is protected by a sacrificial anode system which is
expected to be exhausted within 15 years. Studies have indicated that steel corrodes very
slowly in deep water and anticipated corrosion rates at 4degC would be in the region of 5mm in
1000 years (Metocean, 1993). Assuming a typical hull thickness of 20mm, the structure is
likely to remain largely intact for up to 4,000 years.

<P>6.3.2. Other metallic components of the structure (e.g. copper wire) will also slowly corrode. The concrete/haematite ballast and any wood and plastic within the structure will remain largely intact. Some degradation, leading to mechanical breakdown of these materials would be expected with long term 'weathering' of concrete, biodegradation of wood and leaching of plasticisers from plastics.

<P>6.3.3. Eventually, the hull and contents will collapse, and residual debris will be buried by sedimenting material. Sedimentation rates vary from 0.1-0.2 cm/1000 years in areas of low surface productivity to 20-30 cm/1000 years on the continental slope (Gage and Tyler, 1991). Assuming a sedimentation rate of around 20 cm/1000 years, once the structure has collapsed onto the sea bed, it will take several thousands of years to bury and become part of the deep sea sediment system.

<P>6.4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE STRUCTURE

<P>6.4.1. It is apparent that the structure will remain on the sea bed for several thousands of years before it eventually breaks up into debris and becomes incorporated into the sediment system. Apart from the colonisation of the structure by organisms and the formation of an 'artificial reef', the other potential effects from the physical presence of the structure will be possible impacts on other resource users. This possibility was considered during the site selection process, and the sites eventually chosen satisfied this criteria. The water depth is sufficient to preclude commercial fishing activities, and the proposed locations avoid main shipping routes, amenity areas, military activity, sub-sea cable routes, other disposal sites and prospective areas for oil, gas or minerals.



<P><H4><A NAME="ch4">7. FATE AND EFFECTS OF HYDROCARBONS AND HEAVY METALS</A></H4>

<P>7.1. BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF HYDROCARBONS AND HEAVY METALS

7.1.1. Hydrocarbons and metals are widespread in the oceans, arising from geological, biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The concentration ranges found in nature in sea water and marine sediments are illustrated. Harmful effects on marine organisms may occur if they are exposed to concentrations of metals or hydrocarbons higher than those found in their normal environment.

<P>Note: 1. Neff, Rabalais and Boesch 1987;2. Metocean 1993; 3. Neff and Anderson 1981; 4. Clark 1993.

<P>7.1.2. The intake of hydrocarbons is not essential to any organisms (except certain species of fungi
and bacteria) to sustain their metabolism, although they may be synthesised by some species for various functions (e.g. protective wax on leaves of higher plants, buoyancy in marine
invertebrates). Exposure to petrogenic hydrocarbons can result in a direct physical effect and/or acute or chronic toxic effects, depending upon the quantities encountered. Physical effects are typically seen after the bulk release of oil (cf. slicks occur at concentrations of > 15ppm in still water) when it coats the organism or its environment. The presence of this layer of oil may cause the loss of buoyancy and heat insulation of birds or marine mammals and asphyxiation in invertebrates, fish, birds and marine mammals. Specific components of crude oil can also produce toxic effects. The most potent in this respect are the aromatic and polycyclic aromatic compounds which can represent some 15-20% (by weight) of the oil (Neff and Anderson, 1981). The effects are species dependent; lethal concentrations to fish and marine invertebrates range from 1-500 ppm and sub-lethal concentrations occur at > 1ppb (Capuzzo and Kester, 1987).

<P>7.1.3. Certain metals are essential to the metabolic processes of living organisms. Metals, in particular the heavy metals (i.e. transitional metals + metalloids) can also exert toxic effects. Transition metals (e.g. iron, copper and: manganese) are essential in low concentrations but can be toxic at high concentrations. Metalloids (e.g. mercury, cadmium, chromium and lead) are generally not required for metabolic activity and can be toxic at low concentrations (Clark, 1993). Concentrations of heavy metals that are considered acceptable to protect the marine environment are defined in Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) introduced under the EEC Directive 76/464/EEC. EQS values for key heavy metals
(dissolved) in marine waters are Cadmium - 2.5 microg/l, Mercury - 0.3 microg/l, Lead - 15 microg/l. Chromium - 15 microg/l, Copper - 5 microg/l and Zinc - 40 microg/l (Metocean, 1993; AURIS 1994).

<P>7.1.4. Marine organisms exhibit a range of strategies for dealing with elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons and heavy metals. These vary inter- and intra-specifically depending on the specific metal or hydrocarbon encountered. Some species are capable of partial or complete metal or hydrocarbon regulation, while others resort to accumulation strategies or a  combination of both (Boehm, 1987; Clark, 1993; Capuzzo and Kester, 1987; Waldichuk,1985; Neff, 1979). Some species are able to change the rate of excretion to match the increase in uptake, for example zinc regulation in Palaemon elegans (Rainbow et al., 1990) and regulation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in fish, polychaetes and shrimps (Neff and Anderson, 1981; Capuzzo and Kester, 1987). Some marine organisms are able to concentrate contaminants in particular parts of their body. For example, high concentrations of zinc in the jaws of nereids and the jaws of Glycera, and copper accumulation in the gills of Melinna palmara (Clark, 1993). Bivalve molluscs tend to be poor regulators of metals and hydrocarbons and tend to accumulate them when exposed to elevated concentrations. However, when removed from the source of contamination these animals are often able to release the contaminants back to the environment (Neff and Anderson, 1981; Capuzzo and Kester, 1987; Clark, 1993).

<P>7.1.5. Fundamental to producing an adverse effect, the heavy metals and hydrocarbons must be in a form that is biologically available. In the case of metals, this is usually the dissolved ionic form. With hydrocarbons the dissolved or very finely dispersed fractions are generally considered to be 'available'. Metals and hydrocarbons in particulate form in the water column or sediments are seldom directly available to organisms (Boehm, 1987; Waldichuk, 1985). Small amounts may be released into the gut if the particles are ingested, although evidence from deposit feeders suggests that availability through this route is limited (Neff and Anderson, 1981; Waldichuk, 198S). Similarly, metals in their pure form are unavailable to organisms unless they corrode and their corrosion products are soluble in sea water.

<P>7.1.6. The association of heavy metals and hydrocarbons with particulate matter and sediments is well established. Apart from the lower molecular weight aromatic fraction, petrogenic hydrocarbons are generally hydrophobic and tend to associate with particulate material (Boehm, 1987; Mackay and McAuliffe 1988). The association of heavy metals is more complex and depends on factors such as pH, ionic strength and redox state (Salomons, 1992). Of particular importance are the effects of pH; at a low pH metals tend to go into solution and at a higher pH they tend to become associated with particulates. Thus in the open sea, metals will tend to be scavenged from the water by particulate matter.

<P>7.1.7. Metals and hydrocarbons associated with particles entering the sediments are generally considered to be fixed, or firmly bound, unless certain physical (e.g. sediment resuspension), biological (e.g. biodegradation, bioturbation) or anthropogenic (e.g. dumping, aggregate extraction) processes result in their mobilisation. Generally, the upper sediment layers are well mixed to a depth of c. 8 - 10 cm by bioturbation (Smith, 1992). Within this layer, the organics, including hydrocarbons will be subject to aerobic biodegradation. In deeper sediments, where the oxygen demand is greater than supply, a reducing environment exists and anaerobic decomposition of organic material occurs.

<P>7.1.8. The availability of heavy metals and hydrocarbons in sediments will be affected by reduction-oxidation (redox) processes. As oxygen levels decrease, biodegradation of hydrocarbons will effectively cease and unless the sediments are disturbed, they will remain associated with buried sediments. Similarly, most metals will be changed from their oxidised to reduced state (generally insoluble sulphides) and unless exposed to oxygen through some form of disturbance will remain fixed. Iron and manganese are the exception; the sulphides of these metals are more soluble than the oxides/hydroxides. Consequently, iron and manganese will be mobilised into the pore water and diffuse to the upper oxygenated layer where they will be re-deposited as oxides. If the whole sediment is anoxic, then these metals can diffuse and be re-mobilised into the water column. Although manganese and iron are not particularly toxic, their oxyhydroxides can scavenge metals such as copper, zinc and lead from the water. This, together with anaerobic formation of organo-metallic compounds such as tin, mercury and lead, provides a mechanism for making them biologically available (Waldichuk, 1985; Boehm, 1987; Salomons, 1992).

<P>7.2. SLOW RELEASE OF CONTAMINANTS INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>7.2.1. In this scenario, it is assumed that the buoy reaches the sea bed intact and sustains minor damage to one or more of the storage tanks upon impact. It is assumed that the release of contaminated water and sludge starts immediately from small breaches in the tanks and continues at a uniform rate over a period of c. 1000 years, as the remainder of the structure breaks-up. These assumptions are believed to represent a worst case for this scenario, as the predicted corrosion rates indicate that structure may take longer to break-up. It is also quite possible that the sludge may never be released and simply become incorporated into the mass of the disintegrating structure.

<P>7.2.2. Under these conditions, release rates of residual contaminants in the storage tanks would be approximately 0.298 mg/sec - hydrocarbon, 0.00136 mg/sec - copper and 0.00277 mg/sec zinc in the sludge and approximately 0.06 mg/sec - hydrocarbon, 0.028 mg/sec - aluminium and 0.018 mg/sec - zinc in the contaminated water. The other main source of residual contaminants on the structure are heavy metals contained as pure metals or alloys within the structure and equipment. These would be expected to slowly leach as the metals corroded. Of all the metals on the structure, the sacrificial anodes will corrode the fastest, with estimated release rates of 60 mg/sec - aluminium and 19 mg/sec - zinc (Metocean, 1993). Thus, the buoy would act as a very low level chronic point source of hydrocarbons and heavy metals.

<P>7.2.3. Once released to the environment, dissolved materials will be dispersed by the prevailing currents. A proportion of the particulate-bound materials will probably be picked up by the prevailing currents and dispersed; the remainder will settle to the sea bed sediments in the immediate vicinity of the point of release, although some could then be relocated as sea bed load.

<P>7.2.4. The dissolved metals will either associate with particulate material in the water column and enter the sediment system, or disperse to background concentrations in the water column. Estimates of near field dispersion of zinc and aluminium from the anodes indicated that background levels would occur within 100m of the structure (Metocean, 1993). Leakage rates of aluminium and zinc from the storage tanks and corrosion rates of other metallic components would be several orders of magnitude less than the anodes and a similar level of dilution would be expected much closer to the structure. Simple modelling of dispersion of dissolved of finely dispersed hydrocarbons, indicate that background concentrations will be reached within 100m of the structure. Thus, any effects would be limited to organisms on or immediately adjacent to the structure. Evidence from fouling studies on oil and gas installations in the North Sea indicate no adverse effects to organisms living in the immediate vicinity and on sacrificial anodes (AURIS, 1994). This would indicate that any effects within the mixing zone (i.e. between the release point and reaching background concentrations) will be insignificant.

<P>7.2.5. Particulate material will settle to the sea bed at a rate proportional to its particle size and density and become incorporated into the sea bed sediments. The metals and hydrocarbons associated with the sludge would be expected to be tightly bound to the particles and not be immediately available to marine organisms. It is believed that the majority of the sludge is composed of silt and sand which would be expected to quickly settle to the sea bed, immediately adjacent to the point of release. With settling velocities between 0.01-0.07 m/s, current velocities of 10 cm/s and a release height of 15 m, the particulate material would initially be expected to impact the sea bed within 150 m of the release point. Assuming the particles settle with an even distribution within 150 m radius of the point source (i.e. an area of 70,695 m2), a sedimentation rate of 0.2 mm/y and no sediment mixing, re-suspension or degradation processes, the level of hydrocarbons in surface sediments within this localised area would increase by up to two orders of magnitude. With the exception of cadmium which may increase marginally, elevations of the heavy metals would be negligible above sediment background levels.

<P>7.2.6. Sediments contaminated with particulate bound material will be available for re-suspension, redistribution as sea bed load, biodegradation and burial as a result of bioturbation or sedimentation (Gage and Tyler, 1991, Gardener and Richardson.-1992; Smith, 1992; Boehm, 1987). The net effect of these processes would be to redistribute material into the upper layer of sediment and possibly move some of the contaminated material outside the primary deposition area. To provide an indication on the possible accumulation rates a simple box model approach has been used (e.g. Walsh, 1992). Assuming all the material remains in the primary deposition zone (i.e. is uniformly distributed within a 150 m radius of the structure), and that there are no losses, only dilution through bioturbation in the upper 10 cm, this would result in a gradual accumulation of sediment hydrocarbons at a rate of some 20-30% of the background per year, until the source of contamination was exhausted. In reality, most of the particulate-bound materials will be concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the point source and decrease in concentration away from the structure and it is unlikely that elevated sediment hydrocarbons would be detectable much beyond 500m of the structure. Detectable effects on benthic communities have been observed at increases in sediment concentrations of 10 - 60 mg/kg, (Davies and Kingston, 1992). Thus, in this scenario, biological effects would be expected within the immediate vicinity of the structure, probably within 150 - 250 m. These would probably be manifested by a gradual reduction in species diversity and appearance of more opportunist species.

<P>7.2.7. It should be noted that these are conservative assumptions as factors such as re-suspension, biodegradation and burial as a result of sedimentation have been excluded. Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon fraction will occur under aerobic conditions. Data suggests that biodegradation of petrogenic hydrocarbons in sediments is a long term process, occurring on a time scale of years (Rartha and Atlas, 1987). For example, data from oil based cuttings piles in the North Sea, suggest degradation rates in surface sediments of some 25% in 18 months (Mair et al., 1987). Re-suspension may also be an important mechanism for redistributing surface sediments, particularly during periods of 'benthic storms'. It has been suggested that this process can re-mobilise some 10 - 60 % of the biogenic component of the sediment (Walsh, 1992). Eventually, materials entering the sediments will become buried. Typically it has been estimated that some 5% of the biogenic material entering sediments is buried (Walsh, 1992). Each of these processes would serve to further disperse or dilute contaminants, and in the case of hydrocarbons, degrade the small quantities of contaminants present. Taking full account of the likely mode of release of materials contained within the structure, and the factors referred to above, it is unlikely that particulate-bound materials will have any significant impact on the marine sediments outwith the immediate vicinity of the abandoned structure.

<P>7.2.8. The residual hydrocarbon waxes lining the storage tanks would be expected to be fairly inert and resilient to any form of degradation in the anaerobic environment of the storage tanks. Once the structure started to disintegrate through corrosion (several thousand years), then aerobic biodegradation of any residual wax may occur. More likely, the wax will disintegrate with the structure and eventually become incorporated into the sediment system.

<P>7.3. RAPID RELEASE OF CONTAMINANTS INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>7.3.1. In this scenario, it assumes that the storage tanks rupture as the buoy hits the sea bed, releasing the water and sludge over a period of c. 24 hours. Apart from the effects of the rapid release of contaminated water and sludge, the environmental impacts will be the same as those described in the slow release scenario (see Section 7.3). Again, this assumption is believed to represent a worst case for this scenario, as it is highly unlikely that such a rapid release would occur. 




<P>	7.3.2.	The contaminated water will have equilibrated at the temperature of the North Sea bottom waters, which would be around c. 7degC during the summer. Thus, the release of this water at
the sea bed, with temperatures of c. 4degC, will result in a plume that moves with the ambient
current and is also slightly buoyant. The plume will pass through the sediment cloud raised
by the impact of the structure with the sea bed and mix with the ambient sea water. Mixing
with higher pH bottom water will encourage heavy metals in solution to adsorb onto particulate material in the water column. Any remaining soluble hydrocarbons and heavy metals will disperse as the plume slowly moves laterally and vertically. Given the small density differential between the plume and ambient water, the plume would not be expected to rise more than a few tens of metres from the sea bed, but simple dispersion modelling indicates that it could move several hundreds of metres laterally before completely dispersing.
	
<P>7.3.3.	As the plume moves and disperses, it will inevitably encounter, or be encountered, by
bathypelagic fish inhabiting the area. Given the low densities of species living at these
depths (c. 1 per 2,000 m2 ) and the observation that fish appear to be able to avoid areas of
contamination, encounter rates with the plume will be low and of a short duration. Thus,
toxicity thresholds are unlikely to be exceeded and the consequent effects will be negligible.

<P>7 3.4. The sludge would drift with the current and quickly settle to the sea bed. Over the relatively
short period of release, it is conservatively assumed that the current will flow from a single
quadrant at c. 10 cm/sec. As before, the sludge would initially be expected to settle within
some 150 m of the structure, some of it mixing with the sinking sediment cloud displaced as
the structure hit the sea bed. Thus, the sludge would initially cover an area of approximately
17,500 m2, equivalent to loads of some 532 g/m2 - hydrocarbon, 2.43 g/m2  of copper, 0.33
g/m2 of cadmium, 0.51 g/m2 - of lead and 4.95 g/m2 - of zinc being deposited on the
sediments, within the 24 hour release period. Because of the rapid rate of release, it would
be expected that a significant proportion of the contaminated particulate material would be
re-suspended and moved further afield with the sediment load.

<P>7.3.5.	In many ways, this scenario would be similar to a small one-off discharge of oil based mud
and cuttings at an exploration well site and the effects on the benthic communities would be
expected to be similar (e.g. Davies et al., 1984; Boehm, 1987; Yunker et al., 1990). High
levels of hydrocarbons (up-to three orders of magnitude above background) and to a much
lesser extent some of the heavy metals would be found within the primary deposition area,
with concentrations decreasing away from the structure. Measurable levels of hydrocarbons
may be detectable in the sediment up to 1000 m or so from the structure. Biological effects
on sediment organisms would be expected to be more localised, with few observable effects
beyond c.500 m or so. Immediately adjacent to the structure, the benthic fauna would be
highly disrupted by both smothering (from the sludge and sediment displaced during impact
of the structure on the sea bed) and any residual toxicity of the contaminants. Beyond the
contaminated zone, which may extend c.150 - 250 m beyond the structure, the benthic
communities may show reduced diversity, due both to residual contamination and to physical
disruption of the sediments during impact of the structure. Beyond c. 500m, effects are
likely to be undetectable and benthic community diversity similar to background.

<P>7.3.6. Immediately after complete release of the contents of the tanks and deposition of the particulates on the sediments, the recovery process will start. Field studies indicate that affected areas in shallow coastal waters recovered within 3 months, whereas little recovery was apparent at a deeper water site within the same time frame (Yunker er al., 1990). At deeper water sites in the North Sea, there is evidence of the start of recovery in the surface sediments within a period of 18 months of ceasing drilling activities (Mair et al., 1987). It has been suggested that metabolic processes and recovery in the deep sea are slower than rates encountered on the continental shelf (e.g. Grassle and Morse-Porteus, 1987). However, more recent studies suggest that this might be an artefact of the methodology and the rates significantly higher than originally thought (Kukert and Smith, 1992). In comparison with continental shelf regions, the deep sea environment is stable, and apart from the occasional 'benthic storms', has few physical mechanisms to enhance dispersion or degradation of sediment contaminants.

<P>7.4. RELEASE TO NEAR SURFACE WATERS

<P>7.4.1. In this scenario, it assumes that one of the cracks in the damaged storage tanks opens shortly after the buoy leaves the sea surface (i.e. within 100-200m), releasing some 10% of the total water and sludge. Apart from the partial release of contaminated water and sludge near the surface, the environmental impacts once the structure arrives at the sea bed will be similar to one of the two scenarios outlined previously, and subject to the same probabilities of occurrence as specified in Section 6.

<P>7.4.2.In this scenario, the buoy will be sinking vertically through the surface waters, creating an area, of highly turbulent flow around and behind the structure. Thus, any material ejected during descent will be vigorously dispersed vertically over a distance of a few hundred metres. Once in the water column, the relatively high current velocities found in the surface waters of the region (cf. in surface waters currents can be in excess of 75 cm/sec at the surface - Metocean, 1993) would be expected to rapidly disperse and dilute the soluble contaminants to background levels. The sludge would move with the currents and sink to the sea bed. Given the depth of water and typical sinking velocities of silt and sand, the particulates would be dispersed over a distance of several kilometres and effectively diluted to background levels.

<P>7.4.3. Given the relatively small quantities of dissolved material that are considered likely to be released into the water column, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion of released materials, it is unlikely that elevated concentrations of contaminants would persist in the water column for more than a few minutes in the case of heavy metals, and a few hours in the case of the hydrocarbons. The vigorous mixing caused by the movement of the buoy would be expected to disperse any free oil into the water column in a similar way to dispersion and weathering of an oil slick (e.g. Mackay and McAuliffe, 1988). Thus, a surface sheen would not be expected. Potential exposures of pelagic organisms to elevated levels of heavy metals and hydrocarbons will therefore be low and the predicted impacts to such organisms would be negligible (AURIS, 1994).

<P>7.5. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HYDROCARBON AND HEAVY METAL RELEASES

<P>7.5.1. The deep ocean has long been considered for disposal of various wastes on the basis that it represents a vast area of unused resource (Angel, 1992; Pequegnat, 1983). Over 50% of the world's surface is located below the 3000 m depth contour. Apart from sub-sea cables, military activities, research, 'experimental mining' and limited dumping, the deep ocean is not utilised by man; currently commercial fishing operations do not extend to depths beyond about 1000 m, although experimental system are being developed to work to 1500 m depths.

<P>7.5.2, In the first two scenarios (i.e. slow release and rapid release) highly localised effects on the environment are predicted. In the slow release scenario, elevated levels of hydrocarbon and heavy metals would be concentrated in the sediment close to the structure, although hydrocarbon may be detectable up to c.500 m and biological effects up to 150 - 250 m from the structure. The effects of the rapid release scenario, would follow a similar pattern although the area affected would be expected to be larger (hydrocarbon may be detectable up to c.l000 m and biological effects up to 500 m from the structure) but the effects would be over a much shorter duration. Given the small numbers of organisms present in the deep ocean and low encounter rates with the affected area, effects will be insignificant. Evidence from sites contaminated with oil based mud cuttings on the continental shelf suggests that there are indications of fish tainting (i.e. food chain effects) from fish caught close to sites where extensive drilling operations had occurred but not at sites with low levels of contamination (Davies and Kingston, 1992). Extrapolating these findings to the deep sea environment, this would suggest that food chain effects at the disposal site will not occur.

<P>	7.5.3.	Below about 1500 m, the ocean is relatively isolated from the productive surface waters. The turnover time of water in the deep Atlantic is around 250 years. Primary production occurs in the surface waters and its downward flux provides the only source of food for the deep
ocean. Apart from occasional movements of some species (e.g. deep sea squid) across 'the
1500 m contour', the deep ocean remains relatively isolated from surface waters. Thus,
transfer of contamination from the deep sea system to the shallow water systems is not
considered viable.

<P>7.5.4. In the third scenario, involving partial release of contaminants close to the surface, additional effects would be observed in the water column. The relatively small quantities of material released, the vigorous initial mixing and good dispersion characteristics of the surface waters of the NE Atlantic would quickly reduce contaminant levels to background. No significant effects would be predicted for pelagic organisms within the 'sinking zone'.










<P><h4><A NAME="SCALE">8  FATE AND EFFECTS OF LOW SPECIFIC ACTIVITY SCALE</A></H4>

<P>8.1. APPROACH TO ASSESSMENT OF RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT

<P>8.1.1. When released into the ocean, radio nuclides are subject to the same physical, chemical and biological dispersion, re-concentration and removal processes as stable isotopes of their corresponding elements; the only difference is that the concentrations of radio nuclides will in general decrease with time as a result of their radioactivity. Physical dispersion in the ocean waters occurs through current movements and mixing processes. In the ocean interior radio nuclides interact with organic and inorganic particulates which are moving down through the water column to the ocean floor. Some of these particulates wholly or partially dissolve during their descent, especially at depths below the carbonate saturation depth. releasing radio nuclides adsorbed on them back into the water column. Other particulates dissolve mainly at the ocean floor. At the floor, processes of bioturbation, diffusion in bed sediments, and burial in bed sediments, both return radio nuclides to the water column and remove them to the deeper sediments, which act as a permanent "sink". The degree to which particulate scavenging in the water column and interactions with bed sediments affect radio nuclide concentrations in ocean waters depends on the chemical properties of the relevant element. For example, thorium interacts strongly with particulates and bed sediments, radium much less strongly. In general, scavenging is more important at the ocean edges (i.e. in shelf seas and coastal waters) than in the open ocean, because particulate concentrations are higher closer to land.

<P>8.1.2. Naturally occurring radio nuclides such as those in the Brent Spar sludge and scale are present in the oceans as a result of input from rivers, the atmosphere, and radioactive decay of their parent radio nuclides in the water column and in bed sediments. Cycling of natural radio nuclides in the ocean is used to study oceanographic processes and hence much is known about their behaviour (see for example, Guary et al., (eds) 1988; GESAMP, 1983; IAEA, 1988a; NEA, 1988; NEA, 1989 and references cited therein).

<P>8.1.3. The most obvious way in which radio nuclides released into the ocean can cause radiation doses to humans is through consumption of seafood, particularly fish, molluscs, crustacea, and to a lesser extent seaweed. These organisms re-concentrate most radio nuclides: for example, the concentration of radium in fish (Bq per tonne) will be about 500 times the concentration in sea water (Bq per cubic metre). Other possible human exposure pathways include consumption of sea salt, consumption of desalinated water, inhalation of sea spray and suspended beach sediments, and external irradiation through boating, swimming and spending time on beaches.

<P>8.1.4. It is assumed for radiological protection purposes that any radiation dose, however small, carries risks to human health, the risks of most concern being the induction of fatal cancer in the individual who receives the dose, and the induction of serious genetic defects in the individual's children. To assess radiological impact on humans it is therefore necessary to estimate potential doses, however small, rather than simply to show that doses will be below some "safe" level. Because radio nuclides released into the ocean disperse over long time scales and large volumes before reaching humans, dose estimates are made using mathematical models.

<P>8.1.5. The disposal site for the Brent Spar has not yet been chosen, although investigations of potential sites are in progress. Furthermore, the quantities of radio nuclides in sludge and scale in the Brent Spar are relatively small (see Section 3.2). Thus, rather than carrying out detailed mathematical modelling, the approach used in this impact hypothesis is to use the results of internationally established models to scope potential doses. Details of the models and the ways in which their results have been used are given in the Annex. The estimated doses to human individuals for each scenario are given in Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5 and
for populations in Section 8.6 below. Potential radiation effects on deep sea organisms are discussed in Section 8.7.


<P>8.2. SLOW RELEASES OF RADIO NUCLIDES INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>8.2.1. Two estimates have been made of the radiation doses which might be received by individuals in the scenario where the Brent Spar reaches the ocean floor intact and radio nuclides are released slowly into the ocean as the structure corrodes. One estimate is based on modelling for the 1985 review by the Nuclear Energy Agency of OECD of the continued suitability of the dumping site for radioactive wastes in the North East Atlantic (NEA, 1985). The other estimate is based on IAEA calculations for a generic ocean basin (IAEA, 1986). Details of the assumptions used in the two instances are given in the Annex.

<P>	8.2.2.	Use of the NEA modelling results leads to an estimated maximum annual dose of 
per year to an individual who consumes above-average amounts of seafood. This dose is
predicted to arise 500 years after disposal of the Brent Spar, and to be due to the
consumption of fish and crustacea caught in the Antarctic Ocean. The radio nuclides
contributing to the dose are radium-226 and its daughter products lead-210 and polonium
210. Doses from radium-228 and thorium-228 are predicted to be zero because they will
decay before reaching waters where seafoods are harvested. The time and place of occurrence of the maximum annual dose are determined by the major features of water movement in the Atlantic and its neighbouring oceans. The NEA modelling is based on the view that deep water moves along isopycnal surfaces which, in the case of the Atlantic, outcrop at the poles. In this model the highest concentrations of radio nuclides in surface waters as a result of releases into bottom waters will occur in the Antarctic and Arctic Oceans. Concentrations tend to be higher in the Antarctic because they are made up of contributions from radio nuclides moving north, then west and south, from locations in the deep waters of the North East Atlantic, as well as contributions from radio nuclides moving directly south.

<P>8.2.3. Use of the IAEA modelling results leads to an estimated maximum individual dose of 3 x10 -13
Sv per year to a seafood consumer, again from radium-226 and its daughter products. Doses from radium-228 and thorium-228 are estimated to be zero unless it is assumed that fish living in very deep ocean waters are caught and consumed, in which case the dose is estimated to be 1x 10 -14 Sv per year.

<P>8.3. RAPID RELEASES OF RADIO NUCLIDES INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>8.3.1. No specific estimates have been made of the doses which might be received if a fraction of the total activity present in the Brent Spar was released rapidly into bottom waters, as a result of damage to the structure caused by its impact on the ocean bed. Examination of the features of the models used by NEA and IAEA. shows that they would predict doses of the same order as those given in Section 8.2 for a rapid release, because in both cases doses depend more on rates and patterns of dispersion in the ocean than on rates of release into the ocean, provided the latter are rapid.

<P>8.4. RELEASE TO NEAR-SURFACE WATERS

<P>8.4.1. Dose estimates for a scenario in which some implosion occurs during the descent of the Brent Spar to the ocean bed have been made using an approach based on a model developed for a European Community project to evaluate the radiological impact of radioactivity in northern European marine waters (the MARINA project-CEC, 1990). Details of the calculational approach are given in the Annex. Assuming that 10% of the activity in sludge and scale is released during descent, and in the extreme case, that all of this activity reaches coastal waters to the west of Scotland, the maximum dose to a seafood consumer is estimated so be 9x10-9 Sv per yR

<P>8.5. COMPARISONS WITH DOSE LIMIT AND EXEMPTION LEVEL

<P>8.5.1. The significance of the doses estimated above needs to be judged in two ways: first to determine whether they are below the level which is regarded as intolerable, and second to determine whether they are potentially acceptable. The dose limit recommended by ICRP for members of the public is 1 mSv per year (10 -3 Sv per year) (ICRP, 1991). This limit is for all practices which can lead to radiation exposure of the public, except for medical procedures, and represents the level above which doses would be regarded as intolerable. The doses estimated above for the release to bottom waters scenario (Section 8.2) are less than one billionth of the ICRP limit, and the dose estimated for the release to near-surface waters scenario (Section 8.4) is less than one hundred thousandth of the limit. It is therefore clear that any doses arising from the ocean disposal of the Brent Spar would not remotely approach the limits of tolerability recommended by ICRP.

<P>8.5.2. To judge the potential acceptability of the doses, the most relevant level is that given in an IAEA document on principles for exemption of radiation sources and practices from regulatory control (IAEA, 1988b). This document states that a radiation dose to an individual is likely to be regarded as trivial if it is of the order of 10 microSv per year (10 -5 Sv per year), and it is understood that IAEA will be using such a dose level in their work to define wastes which can be regarded as non-radioactive for the purposes of the London Dumping Convention. The doses estimated above for the release to bottom waters scenario (Section 8.2) are less than one ten millionth of the IAEA exemption level, while the dose for the release to near-surface waters scenario is less than one thousandth of the exemption level. It can therefore be concluded that doses to individual members of the public from disposal of the Brent Spar are well within the potentially acceptable range, and are well below the levels which have been suggested as de minimus for the purposes of regulatory control

<P>8.5.3. For further perspective, the estimated doses can be compared to those which could be received from radio nuclides naturally present in sea water. The annual dose from such radio nuclides to a person who consumes above average amounts of seafood could be 2 - 5 mSv per year (2-5 x 10-3 Sv per year)(Pentreath 1988 and Annex to this report), that is a factor of over 200,000 greater than the highest individual dose estimated from disposal of the Brent Spar.

<P>8.6. DOSES TO HUMAN POPULATIONS

<P>8.6.1. Within the framework of radiological protection, estimates of doses to human populations ("collective doses") are used in determining compliance with the requirements that practices causing radiation exposure should be justified, and that all exposures should be as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account (the ALARA or optimisation requirement) (ICRP, 1991). There are no limits on collective doses as there are for individual doses. However, the IAEA has suggested a level of collective dose to be used in determining whether practices might be exempted from regulatory control. This level is in terms of the collective dose which would be received by the whole exposed population, integrated over all time, from one year of carrying out the practice, and is 1man Sv (IAEA, 1988b).

<P>8.6.2. In the case of radio nuclide releases into the oceans the population to be considered in collective dose calculations is that of the world. Clearly it is not possible to calculate the dose to every person in the world, for every year after the release, and sum them to obtain the collective dose. The procedure is to calculate radio nuclide concentrations in seafoods in each part of the ocean, as a function of time, using mathematical models. Seafood catch data for each part of the ocean are then used to estimate the total amounts of radio nuclides in seafoods potentially available for human consumption, and it is assumed that all the edible parts of the seafoods are consumed. This procedure has been used in studies with the NEA model, and in the European Community MARINA project, and the results are employed here to make very rough, pessimistic estimates of the collective doses to the world population, integrated over all time, from disposal of the Brent Spar (see Annex for details)


<P>8.6.3. The estimated collective doses are 0.09 man Sv for release of all the activity in the Brent Spar to bottom waters, and 0.02 man Sv for release of 10% of the activity to near-surface waters. These values, which have been derived by methods which err on the side-of caution, are less than one tenth of the IAEA suggested exemption level of 1man Sv. They may also be placed in perspective by comparing them to the annual collective dose to the world population from natural radio nuclides in sea water of 300,000 man Sv (NEA, 1985). As with individual doses, it can be concluded that population doses from disposal of the Brent Spar are likely to be acceptable.

<P>8.7.		RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT ON DEEP SEA ORGANISMS

<P>8.7.1.		Organisms in the deep ocean are exposed to radiation from radio nuclides naturally present in sea water and sediments. The most straightforward way to assess potential radiation
effects on organisms from the disposal of the Brent Spar is to determine whether,
immediately around the structure, radio nuclide releases from sludge and scale will increase
background radiation levels significantly.

<P>8.7.2.		The IAEA has developed a methodology for the calculation of doses to deep sea organisms from radio nuclide releases into bottom waters (IAEA, 1988a). Using this methodology, it is estimated that the maximum dose rate to deep sea organisms in the case of a slow release of
radio nuclides from the Brent Spar would be about 3 nSv per hour (3 x 10 - 9 Sv per hour - see
Annex). Natural background dose rates to these organisms are in the range 10 nSv per hour
(10 -8 Sv per hour) to 5,000 nSv per hour (5x 10-6 Sv per hour) (NEA, 1985; IAEA 1988a). It
can therefore be-concluded that in this instance it is highly unlikely that there will be
radiation effects on deep sea organisms at the individual or species population level. More
rapid releases would lead to dose rates higher than 3 nSv per hour (3x10-9 Sv per hour), but
these would persist for shorter times and would be within the background range. Thus in
these cases too, it is very unlikely that there will be effects on natural fauna.

<P>8.8.		ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF LSA SCALE RELEASES
<P>8.8.1.		The results from studies using internationally established mathematical models have been used to estimate the radiation doses which could be received by human individuals and
populations from radio nuclides released from the Brent Spar.

<P>8.8.2.		The estimated doses to individuals are several orders of magnitude less than a level of dose defined by the IAEA as a basis for exemption of sources and practices from regulatory
control. The estimated collective (population) doses are also well within an IAEA exemption
level. These dose estimates are approximate but have been derived by methods which err
generally on the side of caution. They are based on calculated average activity levels in
sludge and scale; use of calculated maximum activity levels would not lead to doses
significantly above those estimated.

<P>8.8.3.		It has also been shown that disposal of the Brent Spar is very unlikely to lead to radiation effects on deep sea organisms at either the individual species or the population levEL

<P><H4><A NAME="CON">9. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY IMPACT HYPOTHESIS</A></H4>
<P>	9.1. The impacts of three sinking scenarios have been considered for the Brent Spar. The most likely scenario is that the buoy will sink to the sea bed and remain largely intact after
impact. This would be followed by a slow release of the residual contaminants from the
storage tanks to the deep ocean waters and sediments. The alternative of major damage to
the storage tanks (and fast release of contaminants) on impact is considered less likely to
occur. The third alternative of tank damage (and release of contaminants in the near surface
environment) is considered unlikely to occur. The potential environmental impacts from
each of these scenarios, is an extremely localised effect which, when considered in the
context of the size of the ocean, will be of negligible significance.

<P>      9.2.	The Impact Hypothesis for the most likely scenario is summarised in the following
paragraphs. The buoy will sink vertically, due to the weight of the ballast in its base and hit
the sea bed base first. The buoy would be expected to penetrate the surface layers of
sediment (the extent depending on the precise characteristics of sea bed at the disposal site)
and topple onto its side. The surge preceding impact, and the impact itself will displace
surface sediments from the impact zone into the water column. The sediment cloud
generated would move with the bottom currents and be re-deposited on the sea bed within
500 - 1000 m of the impact zone. Burial of the sea bed communities will be inevitable in the
immediate area of impact. Smothering from the sediment cloud will also occur within 100 -  
200 m of the impact zone. Beyond this area effects would be small.

<P>	9.3.	After impact and resettlement of the sediment, re-colonisation of the disturbed sediments and new hard surfaces of the buoy itself will start from the surrounding communities. Recent evidence on recovery of disturbed sediments in the deep sea suggest that this process will
take place relatively quickly, over a 12 - 24 month period.

<P>	9.4.	The steel structure of the hull and other metallic components will also start to corrode at an estimated rate of some 5 mm/1000 years. This means that the structure is likely to remain largely intact for some 4,000 years. The concrete ballast, and any wood or plastic would
remain largely intact although some degradation and mechanical breakdown may occur
within these long time scales. Eventually, the structure would collapse onto the sediment
surface and any residual debris eventually become buried under the slowly depositing
sediments in 5 - 10,000 years. 

<P>	9.5.	The relatively small quantities of hydrocarbons and heavy metals remaining on the structure will slowly leach into the water column from the storage tanks and the remainder of the
structure as it corrodes. Dissolved metals or hydrocarbons will disperse to background levels
within c. 100 m of the structure. Contaminated particulate material from the storage tanks
will initially be deposited within c. 150 m of the structure and enter the sediment system.
Disregarding any processes which would subsequently disperse or degrade sediment
contaminants, conservative estimates indicate that hydrocarbon and to a much lesser extent
the heavy metal concentrations would be expected to slowly increase in the sediments immediately adjacent to the structure. It is unlikely that elevated sediment hydrocarbons
would be detectable much beyond 500m of the structure. Detectable effects on benthic
communities would be expected within the immediate vicinity of the structure, probably
within 150 - 250 m. These would probably be manifested by a gradual reduction in species
diversity and appearance of more opportunist species.

<P>	9.6.	LSA scale is composed predominantly of barium sulphate, with smaller quantities of calcium and barium carbonates. In the deep ocean, some dissolution of the calcium salts would be
expected. Thus, some of the naturally occurring radioactive elements may also go into solution, whilst the others would be expected to remain in the particulate phase. Conservative modelling of the long-term fate of the radioactive materials in the scale, indicate that the estimated dose rates to individuals (human) would be several orders of magnitude less than those regarded by the IAEA as de minimus for the purposes of regulatory control. Similarly, dose rates to human populations would be well within those acceptable to IAEA. The dose rates to deep sea organisms would be within the ranges encountered in nature and effects on natural populations would not be expected.

<P>A.1. RADIO NUCLIDE CONTENT OF SLUDGE AND SCALE

<P>A.l.l. Most measurements of the radioactive content of sludge and scale have been to determine concentrations of the two radio nuclides which are of most concern in an operational context, namely radium-226 and actinium-228. For sludge in the Brent Spar storage tanks the measurements give an average radium-226 concentration of 4.5 Bq g-1, with a range of 1.2 to 8.0 Bq g -1, and an average actinium-228 concentration of 3.0 Bq g-l, with a range of 0.8 to 5.2 Bq g -1. Estimates of activities in hard scale in the Brent Spar have been made from records of on-shore disposals of scale from Brent Alpha and Brent Bravo. These give an average radium-226 concentration of 17.6 Bq g -l, with a range of 1.7 to 46.6 Bq g-1, and an average actinium-228 concentration of 15.2 Bq g -1, with a range of 1.3 to 50.8 Bq g -1.

<P>A.1.2. For the radiological impact estimates it is necessary to know the concentrations of the long-lived radio nuclides, namely radium-226 and its daughter products lead-210 and polonium-210, and radium-228 (parent of actinium-228) and thorium-228 (daughter of actinium-228). Activities of lead-210, polonium-210, radium-228 and thorium-228 in sludge and scale are not measured routinely. However, there are results of gamma counting measurements available for lead-210, polonium-210 and thorium-228 in Brent Alpha scale/sludge. These results indicate that an assumption that radio nuclides are in secular equilibrium (i.e. that the activities of parent and daughter radio nuclides are equal) would be conservative. Hence, for the impact assessment it is assumed that concentrations of lead-210 and polonium-210 are equal to those of radium-226, and that concentrations of radium-228 and thorium-228 are equal to those of actinium-228. This assumption, together with assumed quantities of 100 tonnes sludge and 30 tonnes scale, leads to the estimates of activities in Brent Spar materials given in Section 3.2 of the main text.

<P>A.2. MODELLING TO ESTIMATE THE RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT ON HUMANS OF RADIO NUCLIDE RELEASES INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>A.2.1 Throughout the calculations, the activities in sludge and scale are considered together and it is assumed that radio nuclides are released from the Brent Spar into the ocean in soluble form, rather than as particulates which settle to the ocean floor. This assumption is pessimistic, particularly for hard scale.

<P>A.2.2 For estimation of individual and collective doses from disposal of the Brent Spar use is made of the results of modelling studies for the disposal site for radioactive waste in the North East Atlantic (NEA 1985, Smith et al 1987). These studies employed a model for radio nuclide movement in the ocean which was developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) in the UK. Since the model was developed for the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) review of the continued suitability of the North East Atlantic site, it is referred to here as the NEA model.

<P>A.2.3 The model is of the compartment type and is one of the sorts of model recommended for use in GESAMP Report 19 (GESAMP, 1983). It consists of a model to predict rates and patterns of dispersion of radio nuclides by physical processes (advection and diffusion) and, overlaid on this, a model to represent radio nuclide interactions with particulates in the water column and with bed sediments (NEA, 1985). Apart from those representing waters immediately above the disposal site, the compartments in the model are defined to correspond with isopycnal surfaces (surfaces of constant density) in the oceans. This approach is used because water movement in the ocean is thought to occur primarily along, rather than across, these surfaces. There are 92 compartments in the model, of which 68 represent the Atlantic and 24 represent the Pacific. Antarctic, Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea The compartment structure of the model is shown in Figure Al; Figures A2 and A3 show the flow fields in the Atlantic which are represented through exchanges between compartments in the model. These exchanges were calculated from a general understanding of the oceanographic features of the Atlantic and knowledge of the existing distributions of conservative tracers (salinity and temperature). The structure of the model compartments around the disposal site is shown in Figure A4.


<P>A.2.4 The sediment interaction part of the model is based on the work described in GESAMP Report 19. The model includes scavenging of radio nuclides by particles in the ocean interior, and bioturbation, diffusion and burial in sediments at the ocean boundaries (see Figure A5). The basic assumptions made in the model and its main features are as follows:

<UL>* particulates within the water column can be represented as two types: small (less than 50 micro m) and large (greater than 50 micro m); 

* all particulates contain a 20% insoluble fraction;

* the concentration ratio between activity on particulates and dissolved radio nuclides is assumed to be constant (the equilibrium approximation, which enables distribution coefficients, Kd values, to be used in modelling);

* small particles dissolve linearly with depth below the carbonate saturation depth, large particles dissolve on the ocean bed; 

* interior scavenging is parameterized using settling velocities and particle concentrations.</UL>

<P>	A.2.6 Interactions with bottom sediments are modelled by adding compartments to each of the bottom compartments of the dispersion model. These represent the sediment-water interface, the bioturbated zone, the sediment where mixing is due to pore water diffusion, and the
deeper sediment which acts as a permanent sink for radio nuclides (see Figure A5). Interactions with suspended sediments in the ocean interior are modelled by including extra transfer coefficients between compartments of the dispersion model.

<P>		A.2.7 The model for radio nuclide movement provides estimates of radio nuclide concentrations In	sea water in each region of the world's oceans, as a function of time after the start of release of radio nuclides into the oceans. Radiation doses to individuals are then calculated by
considering those whose habits are such that they could incur higher doses than members of
the population as a whole, via potential exposure pathways arising from disposal. Such
groups are known as 'critical groups', not because they are at any particular risk but in the
sense that so long as they are properly protected, the population as a whole will be
safeguarded automatically. The exposure pathways considered in the NEA studies (and in
IAEA work, see Section A.3) cover internal irradiation via ingestion and inhalation of radio
nuclides, and external irradiation, and include both "actual" pathways (i.e. ones which could
exist now) and "hypothetical" pathways (i.e. ones which might exist in future). The exposure
pathways considered are as follows:

<P>	Actual pathways
		
<UL>* Ingestion: consumption of surface water fish, mid-depth water fish, crustacea, molluscs,
seaweed, salt, desalinated water.

* Inhalation: breathing in marine aerosols (sea spray) and suspended airborne sediments (on
beaches).

* External irradiation: during boating. swimming, spending time on beaches, and (through
participation in deep sea mining of ferromanganese nodules.</UL>    


<P>	Hypothetical pathways

<P>* Consumption of plankton, consumption of deep water fish.

<P>* For collective (population} doses only "actual" seafood consumption pathways are considered. Details of the parameter values used in the dose calculations are given in NEA (1985).

<P>* The doses which could be received by individuals following disposal of the Brent Spar (see Section 8.2 - 8.4 of the main text) are derived by straightforward scaling of results given in NEA 1985 for disposal of radium-226. These results indicate a peak dose from radium-226 and its daughter products, summed over actual seafood consumption pathways, of 8.3 x 10-11 Sv per year per TBq of radium-226 disposed. The peak dose is predicted to arise 500 years after disposal, from seafoods caught in the Antarctic Ocean. It should be noted that this method of estimating the doses from disposal of the Brent Spar implicitly assumes that radio nuclides associated with the Spar initially will be released slowly over periods of the order of 1000 years. It also assumes that peak doses are not dependent on the location of the disposal site within the North East Atlantic. The first of these assumptions is not unreasonable. The second could lead to underestimation of Brent Spar doses, but it should be borne in mind that other aspects of the IAEA model are conservative, particularly the implied assumption that individuals actually eat substantial quantities of seafood caught in the Antarctic Ocean. In the Brent Spar dose calculations, no allowance is made for reductions in dose per unit intake factors for radio nuclides as a result of the 1990 recommendations of ICRP (ICRP, 1991; Phipps et al., 1991)

<P>* The collective dose which could be received following disposal of the Brent Spar is derived using results given in Smith et al 1987 for sea dumping of unit activity of uranium-238. Only radium-226 is considered for the Brent Spar and it is assumed that consumption of fish is the dominant population exposure pathway. The collective dose incurred up to 104 years after dumping of uranium-238 is used, to make allowance for the difference in half-lives of radium-226 (1600 years) and uranium-238 (4.5 109 years). The calculations give two estimates of the collective dose to the world population, integrated over all time, from disposal of the Brent Spar: 0.09 man Sv and 5 x 10 -5 man Sv. Only the higher value is used in the main text (Section 8.6).

<P>USE OF IAEA MODELLING RESULTS

<P>A second estimate of the individual doses which could be incurred from slow releases of radio nuclides from the Brent Spar into deep ocean waters is made using the results of IAEA modelling (IAEA, 1984; IAEA, 1986). These models were developed by the IAEA in support of the London Dumping Convention and are described in Appendices VI and VII of GESAMP Report 19 (GESAMP, 1983) and deal with radio nuclide movement in a notional ocean basin.

<P>The Appendix VII model is three-dimensional and is based on the assumption that physical dispersion in the ocean occurs only by diffusion. The model was developed primarily to predict the extent of the region of elevated contaminant concentrations around a source and will underestimate the degree of dispersion by physical processes unless sufficiently large eddy diffusion coefficients are chosen. The model includes interior scavenging (i.e. removal of radio nuclides from the water column by adsorption on to falling particulates) and boundary scavenging (i.e. burial by accumulating sediments, diffusion in sediment pore water and mixing within the bioturbated layer). Analytical solutions to the equations are available for the steady state situation (GESAMP, 1983; IAEA, 1984) and it is these which were used in the IAEA calculations (IAEA, 1986).

<P>A.3.3 The Appendix VI model is one dimensional and is an equilibrium version of the more complex model described in Appendix IX of GESAMP Report 19. As well as diffusion. boundary scavenging and interior scavenging, it includes up welling of water and a corresponding downward movement. This feature means that the model is able to reproduCE fluxes of substances which are recycled between the surface and the deep ocean, and hence that the model is particularly useful for estimating concentrations of long-lived radio nuclides which are not very strongly adsorbed on particulates or bottom sediments. Despite its one-dimensional nature, the model provides adequate estimates of laterally averaged concentrations. As with the Appendix VII model, analytical solutions are available for the steady state situation (GESAMP, 1983; IAEA, 1984).

<P>A.3.4 The IAEA used the Appendix VI and Appendix VII models to calculate the rates of release of radio nuclides into the ocean which, if continued for 1000 years, would lead to peak doses to individuals equal to the ICRP limit of  1 mSv per year (10 -3 Sv per year)(lAEA, 1986). The exposure pathways considered in these "release rate limit" calculations are the same as those in the NEA modelling (see Section A.2 above), as are the values of the parameters for these pathways. The sediment/water distribution coefficients (Kd values) and concentration factors for biological materials used in the IAEA calculations (IAEA, 1985) are, for almost all radio nuclides, the same as those in the NEA modelling (NEA, 1985). The release rate limits for each radio nuclide given by the IAEA are the lower of the values calculated with the Appendix VI and Appendix VII models.

<P>A.3.5 For the five radio nuclides of interest in the Brent Spar situation the IAEA release rate limits are:

<UL>	Radium-226	3 3 x 10 3 TBq y-1

	Lead-210	2.7 x 10 6 TBq y-1

	Polonium-210	1 3 x 10 8 TBq y-1

	Radium-228	6.4 x 10 4 TBq y-1

	Thorium-228	2.6 x 10 8 TBq y-1</UL>

<P>A.3.6 Assuming that the radio nuclides in Brent Spar sludge and scale are released at a uniform rate over a period of 1000 years, and scaling the release rate limits by the quantities of each radio nuclide in the Brent Spar, produces the dose estimates given in Sections 8.2 - 8.4 and 8.6 of the main text. The radio nuclide which gives rise to the highest dose is radium-226, for which the release rate limit is based on the Appendix VI model and is largely determined by the dose incurred from consumption of fish caught at a depth of 1500m. Since the Appendix VI model is one-dimensional and does not include movement of water (and hence radio nuclides) from one ocean basin to another it is not surprising that the Brent Spar dose derived from the IAEA release rate limits (3 x 10 -13 Sv y-1) is higher than that derived from NEA modelling (8 x 10 -14 Sv y -1). The volume and depth of the North East Atlantic are somewhat smaller than those of the notional ocean basin considered in the IAEA calculations (the volume and depth of the North East Atlantic are 5 x 10 16 m3 and 3.5 km respectively, while those of the IAEA notional ocean basin are 1 x 10 l7 m3 and 4 km). No allowance is made for these differences in deriving the Brent Spar doses because the factor involved (less than 2) is outweighed by the pessimism of the implicit assumption that fish caught at a depth of 1500m in the Antarctic are consumed in substantial quantities.

<P>A.4. MODELLING TO ESTIMATE THE RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT ON HUMANS OF RADIO NUCLIDE RELEASES INTO NEAR-SURFACE WATERS

<P>A.4.1 For the scenario in which some implosion is assumed to occur during the descent of the Brent Spar to the ocean floor, the approach used to estimate doses is based on parameter values in, and results from, a model developed for the Commission of the European Communities MARINA project (CEC, 1990: Charles et al., 1989). This model, known as MARIN1, is designed to estimate doses from liquid effluents discharged into north European waters from nuclear installations on land. The model is of the compartment type and its structure is shown in Figures A6 and A7.

<P>A.4.2 To estimate individual doses it is assumed that 10% of the activity in Brent Spar sludge and scale is instantaneously released into near-surface waters above its disposal site, and that this activity moves rapidly into the area of sea represented by the "Scottish Waters" compartment in the MARIN1 model (see Figure A7). Peak concentrations in sea water where seafoods are caught are calculated by assuming that radio nuclides arc dispersed throughout Scottish Waters, without any removal by particulate scavenging or radioactive decay. It is then assumed that these peak concentrations persist for at least one year, and doses to persons consuming seafoods caught in Scottish Waters are calculated using the same parameter values as in the NEA and IAEA modelling (Section A.2).The Scottish Waters compartment of the MARINl model is relatively small and shallow (volume 1.3 x 10 13 m3, depth 110m) and current flows through it are such that the assumption that peak radio nuclide concentrations persist for a year is pessimistic (see exchange rates given in Figure A7). The total calculated individual dose of 9 x 10 -19 Sv y -l (see Sections 8.2 - 8.4 and 8.6) arises mainly from polonium-210 (7.5 x 10 -9 Sv y- l ) and lead-210 (1.3 x 10 -9 Sv y-l ),

<P>A.4.3 To estimate collective doses for the Brent Spar scenario, use is made of MARIN1 collective dose results for unit discharge of uranium-238 from a land based site on the west coast of the British mainland (Charles et al., 1989), ratios of the collective doses from unit discharge of radium-226 and uranium-238 derived from Klos et al., 1989, and ratios of collective doses to the European and world populations given in Smith et al., 1987. From Charles et al, the collective dose to the European population, integrated over all time, from discharge of lBq of uranium-238 from Springfields is 1.9 x10-13 man Sv. From Smith et al., for unit discharge of uranium-238 into UK coastal waters about 73% of the total collective dose will be incurred by the European population and about 27% by the rest of the world population. From Klos et al., collective doses per unit discharge of radium-226 and uranium-238 are in the ratio of 890:1. Simple multiplication gives a collective dose of 0.02 man Sv to the world population for the Brent Spar scenario in which 9.3 x 10 7 Bq radium-226 is released.

<P>A.5. MODELLING TO ESTIMATE RADIATION DOSES TO DEEP SEA ORGANISMS

<P>A.5.1 As part of their work for the London Dumping Convention, the IAEA developed a methodology for the calculation of doses to deep sea organisms from releases of radio nuclides into bottom waters (IAEA, 1988). In this methodology the GESAMP Appendix VII and Appendix VI models (see Section A.3) are used to calculate radio nuclide concentrations in bottom waters and sediments, and simple dosimetric models are then used to obtain the dose rates to various types of marine organisms.

<P>A.5.2 From Table A-III in IAEA (1988), the maximum dose rates to deep sea organisms per unit concentration of the Brent Spar radio nuclides in sea water are as follows.


	<UL>	Radionuclide	Dose rate (micro Sv h-1/Bq m-3)

		Radium-226	0.6 

		Lead-210	3.0

		Polonium-210	0.3	

		Radium-228	0.005

		Thorium-228	5.0</UL>



<P>A.5.3 Using the GESAMP Appendix VII model with the assumption that radio nuclides are released at a uniform rate over a period of 1000 years, and taking the "radius of the source" to be 70m (about half the height of the Brent Spar), the concentrations of these radio nuclides in bottom waters close to the Brent Spar are 4.3 x 10 -4 Bq m for radium-226, lead-210 and polonium-210, and 3.5 x 10 -4 Bq m-3 for radium-228 and thorium-228. Hence the maximum dose rate to deep sea organisms from all five radio nuclides is 3 nSv h-1. (3 x 10 -9 Sv per hour)

<P>A.6. NATURAL BACKGROUND DOSES FROM RADIO NUCLIDES IN THE OCEAN

<P>A.6.1 From IAEA (1988) natural background concentrations in sea water of the five radio nuclides of concern in the Brent Spar calculations are as follows (units are Bq m - 3):

<UL>	Radium-226	1.3 - 3.1

	Lead-210	0.4 - 5.0
.

	Polonium-210	0.19 - 3.7

.
	Radium-228	0.04 - 3.7

	Thorium-228	0.007 - 0.12</UL>

<P>A.6.2 Based on these concentrations and using the same parameter values as in the NEA and IAEA modelling (see Sections A.2 and A.3), the dose to a person who consumes above average quantities of seafood is calculated to be 0.3 - 5 mSv y-1 (0.3 - 5.0 x 10 -3 Sv per year). Most of this dose arises from polonium-210. The estimated dose of 2 mSv y-1 (2 x 10 -3 Sv per year) given in Pentreath (1988) lies within this range.

<P>A.6.3 The collective dose to the world population from natural radio nuclides in the ocean, based on average radio nuclide concentrations and seafood catch data for the early 1980s, is estimated to be 3 x 10 5 man Sv per year (NEA, 1985).

<P>A.6.4 Table IX of IAEA 1988 gives the range of natural background dose rates to deep sea organisms as 10 nSv h-l to 5 microSv h-l (l0-8 to 5 x 10 -6 Sv per hour).

<P>1.1. The Brent Spar was commissioned in 1976. It is a
cylindrical buoy, moored to the sea bed by six anchors and is
made up of oil storage tanks at the bottom, buoyancy tanks toward
the middle and a topside containing the offshore tanker loading
equipment. A full description is provided in Section 3 - 'Summary
of Information on the Brent Spar'.      

 <P>     1.2. The costs of maintaining the Spar increased
substantially in the period 1987 to 1990. In 1991, a review
concluded that the work necessary to refurbish the facility to
extend its operational life could cost over œ90 million. The buoy
would have to be out of  commission for a 2 - 3 year period
during the refurbishment. Given the age of the structure, the
presence of a pipeline system for the export of crude oil and the
substantial cost of refurbishment, it was decided that the Brent
Spar should cease operations. It was taken out of commission in
September 1991 after 15 years service.  

<P>     1.3. The Brent Spar is presently classified as a "not
normally manned installation" and, following decommissioning, a
letter of limitation to its Certificate of Fitness prevents its
use as a storage or tanker loading facility. This certificate
expires in 1995 and if it is to be renewed, refurbishment would
be required before that date. The operators, Shell UK Exploration
& Production (Shell Expro) have recognised that the Spar is now
obsolete and wish to abandon the structure, in accordance with
all regulatory requirements. 

<P>      1.4. Thirteen possible methods of abandoning or re-using
the buoy were initially put forward for consideration, of which
six were identified as viable options:  

  <UL>   ! Horizontal Dismantling (and Onshore Disposal) 

     ! Vertical Dismantling (and Onshore Disposal) 

     ! In-Field Disposal 

     ! Deep Water Disposal 

     ! Refurbishment and Re-Use 

     ! Continued Maintenance 

     Of these, horizontal dismantling and deep water disposal
were considered in detail. </UL>

  <P>    1.5. This document describes the assessment undertaken to
determine the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO) for
the abandonment and disposal of the Brent Spar. The details of
the BPEO assessment are described in Section 2 - 'Structure of
the BPEO Assessment'. It includes consideration of technical
feasibility, risks to health and safety of the workforce,
environmental impacts, public acceptability and costs.      

 <P>     1.6. The BPEO Assessment demonstrates that the most
appropriate action is to dispose   of the Brent Spar at an
authorised deep water disposal site, as it is the option of least 
     technical risk, minimises exposure of the workforce to
accidents, will have small but insignificant impacts on the
environment and is economically the most attractive.   

 <P> <H4><A NAME="STRUCTURE">   2. STRUCTURE OF THE BPEO ASSESSMENT </A></H4>

<P>      2.1. The document provides a detailed assessment of the
feasible disposal options of the Brent Spar, together with a
statement setting out reasons which have led to the conclusion
that deep sea disposal is the Best Practicable Environmental
Option.   

 <P>     2.2. This assessment is supported by a full set of
engineering, safety and environmental study documentation,
referenced in Section 12.

 <P>    2.3. A short summary of the Brent Spar is presented in
Section 3 describing the facility, its location, history and
current status, and a brief overview of the UK legal framework. 

 <P>     2.4. Following an examination of all the feasible options,
six were selected for further study and appraisal. These six were
screened and a summary of the findings provided in Section 4. 

 <P>     2.5. The screening process described in Section 4
established that only two options presented realistic solutions.
These are described in detail in Section 5 and the remainder of
the report is given over to comparing and assessing the relative
merits of these. The following aspects were looked at in detail:

<P>Engineering Complexity (Section 6) - The difficulty of carrying
out the engineering procedures considering the range of tasks to
be performed, the locations in which they might be carried out
and the type of vessels required; 

<P>Risk to Health & Safety of Workforce (Section 7) - The likelihood
of serious injury and fatality in each option, based on an
assessment of the tasks and the number of man hours dedicated to
each task; 

<P>Environmental Impact (Section 8) - The range of impacts on the
environment and resource users as a result of carrying out the
option, including an assessment of the consequences of possible
accidents; 

<P>Cost (Section 9) - The estimated gross cost of the short-listed
options. 

<P>Consultation Process (Section 10) - Discussion of the process
used to ascertain acceptability to the authorities and other
interested parties; 

<P>     2.6 Section 11 provides the final logic for selection of the
Best Practicable Environmental Option. 


     

 <P><H4> <A NAME="SUMMARY">3. SUMMARY INFORMATION ON THE BRENT SPAR <A></H4>

<P>     3.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY 

 <P>    3.1.1. The Brent Spar is a 29m diameter cylindrical buoy
which floats vertically in the water with a draft of lO9m and a
height above water of 28m. It was constructed using techniques
similar to those of ship building and consists of a thin outer
skin of 20 mm plate steel, stiffened by ribs and bulkheads. 

     [FIGURE OMITTED]

<P>     3.1.2. The total weight of the structure is 14,500t made up
of 6,700t of structural steel, 6,800t of permanent haematite
ballast and lOOOt of equipment. 

<P>     3.1.3. The upper section consists of a helideck, crane,
tanker mooring/loading boom and accommodation for 30 people. 

 <P>    3.1.4. The top of the lower section is made up of twelve
buoyancy tanks. Below this, the main storage area is divided into
six tanks which extend to the base of the buoy. The total storage
capacity is 300,000 barrels of oil. At the base of the buoy there
is a sealed compartment containing the permanent ballast. which
is composed of haematite embedded in concrete. 

 <P>    3.1.5. During operations, the buoy was used to store oil
from Brent 'A', and also acted as a tanker loading facility for
the whole Brent Field. It was the sole route for the export of
crude oil until the Brent System Pipeline was commissioned in
1978. After this, it continued to be used as an alternative to
the pipeline system. 

 <P>    3.1.6. The Brent Spar is held on location by a six leg
catenary mooring system. Each mooring line is made up of a 285m
length of 4" chain, one end of which is attached to the buoy and
the other to 800m of 3.5" wire length, connected directly to the
anchor block. 

[FIGURE OMITTED]

 <P>    3.1.7. The manifold, located on the sea bed directly below
the Spar. is now isolated and will remain in place after removal
of the Spar. It acts as a junction in the pipeline between Brent
'A' and 'B' platforms. It will operate as a fully maintained sub-
sea facility. 

[FIGURE OMITTED]

  

 <P>    3.2 LOCATION, HISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS
     
 <P>    3.2.1. The Brent Spar was constructed in a horizontal
position and was installed in the Brent Field in 1976. The Brent
Field is located in UK Block 211/29 in the North Sea, some 190
km ENE of Shetland. The Spar is located at Latitude 
61 deg 03'14.7" N, Longitude 01 deg 40'04" E, approximately 2.9
km from the Brent 'A' platform and 1.9 km from Brent 'B'
platform. The water depth at the Spar location is 140m.     

 <P>    3.2.2. During a nine day operation in a Norwegian fjord, the
Spar was upended by the gradual ballasting of the storage tanks.
Despite the care taken during this operation, subsequent analysis
has indicated that the buoy was overstressed to some extent by
the pressures it experienced . 

[FIGURE OMITTED]

<P>  3.2.3. In January 1977, two of the main storage tanks
were ruptured by the accidental build up of differential
pressures, which were in excess of design limits, between the
inside and outside of the tanks. The subsequent repairs were
conducted only to maintain structural integrity of the buoy not
to make the tanks water tight.  The tanks were not used again for
oil storage and remained filled with sea water. 

 <P>     3.2.4. ln 1978, the Brent System Pipeline to Sullom Voe
Terminal was commissioned and became the main export route for
the Brent crude. After this, the Spar continued to be used only
as an alternative export.     

<P>      3.2.5. Between 1987 and 1990, the maintenance costs of the
facility increased substantially. In 1991, a review of the
refurbishment requirements concluded repair costs of over œ90
million were necessary to extend the buoy's life and the facility
would be out of commission for two to three years. Given the age
of the structure, the cost of refurbishment and the presence of
the Brent System Pipeline, it was concluded that the facility
should be withdrawn from service.  

 <P>     3.2.6. The Brent Spar was taken out of commission in
October 1991, during which time the undamaged storage tanks were
emptied of crude oil and filled with sea water. The process
pipework was flushed through with sea water and the storage tank
oil/water interface emulsion and slops were pumped into the final
shuttle tanker. All buoyancy tanks were emptied and all valves,
watertight hatches and doors were shut to prevent flooding. Items
of loose equipment, including fire fighting equipment, life
saving appliances and spares were removed. In November 1991, the
manifold was isolated and the flexible risers were removed. 

 <P>    3.2.7. The Spar is presently classified as a "not normally
manned installation" and a letter of limitation to its
Certificate of Fitness prevents its use as a storage or tanker
loading facility. This certificate expires in 1995 and, if it is
to be renewed, a detailed structural integrity survey and
refurbishment programme would be required before this deadline. 

     Page 6


<P>     3.3. INVENTORY OF MATERIALS 

<P>     3.3.1. The bulk of the structure is composed of structural
steel (approximately 7,700t) and haematite embedded in concrete
(some 6,800t). Inventory items have been classified in accordance
with the ' Convention for the Protection of the Marine
Environment of the North East Atlantic 1992" (Oslo and Paris
Commissions - OSPARREV). This Convention regulates substances and
materials whose disposal at sea is controlled and are referred
to as "Regulated Substances".

     [FIGURE OMITTED]

<P>      3.3.2. Equipment throughout the structure contains small
quantities of heavy metals (in metallic form) as an integral part
of the materials of construction. The sacrificial anodes contain
an estimated 28.7t of aluminium, 10.2t of zinc metal and minor
quantities of cadmium (8 kg), lead (0.6kg) and mercury (0.1kg).
Electric cables contain some 13.5t of copper and paint on the
structure includes some 3.5t of zinc. Small quantities of lead
(2.5kg) and of nickel (3.5kg) are contained in remaining
batteries. Small quantities of other materials are also contained
in some of the equipment. Traces of PCB (<20ml) may still remain
in the two transformers, although PCB-containing transformer
fluids were replaced some years ago. Synthetic materials and
plastics are also located on the structure (eg. in fittings in
the accommodation/control room and cable insulation) but the
exact quantities are not known (AURIS,1994,1; Metocean 1993, 7,
8&9).

<P>      3.3.3. The oil storage tanks contain some 48,000m3 of sea
water together with an estimated  100t of oily sludge at the
bottom. A 1991 analysis indicated that the oily sludge contains
an estimated 9.2t of oil and a number of heavy metals, including
cadmium (5.8kg), chromium (2.1kg) copper (42.9kg), nickel
(3.9kg), lead (8.9kg), zinc (87.4kg), arsenic (0.3kg), and 
mercury (0.2kg). The remainder of the sludge is composed of a
mixture of sand and scale. The walls of the storage tanks are
also coated with an estimated 41.3t of hydrocarbons, in the form
of thin layer of oil and wax. The sea water has not been analysed
in detail and it has been conservatively assumed that it will
contain hydrocarbons (up to 40ppm) from the residual oil in the
tanks, together with zinc (up to 12ppm) and aluminium (up to
19ppm) from the internal anodes (AURIS, 1994,1) 

<P>     3.3.4. Scale is commonly found in oil processing facilities
throughout the world. In many areas scale may be contaminated by
small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive salts from the
oil reservoir formation to form low specific activity (LSA)
scale. LSA scale is present  in the sludge (with average activity of radium-226 and
actinium-228 of 4.5 and 3 Bq g-1, respectively) in the storage
tanks and as hard scale (with average activity of radium-226 and
actinium-228 of 17.6 and 15.2 Bq g-1, respectively) in the
internals of the pipework. Conservatively, taking the total mass
of sludge to be 1OOt and the hard scale to be 30t, the total mean
activity of the LSA scale is 11.96 GBq (AURIS, 1994,1; ICI
Tracerco, 1993,5&6). 

   

     


 <P>    3.4. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 

 <P>    3.4.1. The abandonment of the Brent Spar will comply with
all United Kingdom legislation. The following diagram summarises
the regulatory framework relating to the abandonment of
structures on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf. 

     [diagram omitted]

  

 <P><H4><A NAME="OPTION SCREENING">4. OPTION SCREENING<A></H4>     

 <P>    4.1. INTRODUCTION
     

<P>     Thirteen options for abandoning or re-using the structure
were considered in the preliminary study (McDermott, 1993, 10).
These have been screened to identify those most suitable for
detailed study. Four abandonment and two re-use options remained
after this process and these are examined in this section. The
table below briefly summarises the six options considered and the
reason for their selection.
<P>OPTION 1

     Horizontal Dismantling   

<P>Remove the topsides and transport ashore for mechanical breaking
and disposal. Deballast the remaining hull to the horizontal by
emptying storage tanks and tow to a suitable inshore site for
transfer to a transport barge. Transport the hull to a suitable
onshore for decontamination, mechanical breaking and disposal


  <P>   Provides a feasible method albeit complex to bring the buoy
ashore for mechanical breaking and disposal without depth
restrictions at the landing site (Reverse of installation)

<P>OPTION 2

Vertical Dismantling
     

<P>Tow the Spar intact and in the vertical to altered deep water
site. Partially decontaminate and dismantle the structure by
cutting horizontally into sections. Transport each section to
shore for total decontamination, mechanical breaking and disposal

<P>Provides a feasible way to bring the buoy ashore for mechanical
breakage and disposal but with depth restrictions at vertical
dismantling site (Reverse of construction)


<P>OPTION 3

<P>In-Field Disposal

<P>Sink the Spar intact at or near its present position in the Brent
Field
     <P>
Simplest abandonment option
     

<P>OPTION 4

<P>Deep Water Disposal

<P>Tow the Spar intact to an authorised deep ocean disposal site and
sink it

<P>Logical alternative to Option 3
     

<P>OPTION 5

<P>Refurbish and Re-Use

<P>Carry out refurbishment of the Spar to make it fully operational
at an alternative site

<P>Alternative to abandonment if a suitable use or buyer could be
found


<P>OPTION 6

<P>Continued Maintenance
     
<P>Carry out the minimum of maintenance and repair to keep the buoy
in its existing condition at its present site
     
<P>Possible option to delay abandonment and combine it with
other field abandonment programmes


 <P>    4.2. ASSESSMENT OF OPTIONS
     

 <P>    4.2.1. INTRODUCTION
     

  <P>   Each option was assessed against the criteria specified in
Paragraph 2.5. The findings of the screening study are summarised
in the text below: 

    
     

<P>    4.2.2. OPTION 1 - HORIZONTAL DISMANTLlNG
     

 <P>    This option involves removal of the topsides, repair of the
damaged tanks, rotation of the buoy to the horizontal, transfer
to a cargo barge, transport to shore and onshore dismantling
(AURIS, 1994, 1&2; McDermott 1993, 10&11). 

     

<P>     CRITERIA: Engineering complexity
     
<P>FINDINGS: 

<P>involves extremely complex operations to upend the structure and
transport it ashore but provides a feasible method of bringing
the buoy ashore for breaking and disposal
     

<P>the most critical operation is upending the buoy to the
horizontal to reduce the draft sufficiently to permit it to be
towed to a suitable breaking and disposal location in the UK
     

<P>the complexity of operations provides high potential for
unplanned events (eg. accidental flooding of tank(s) during
upending/horizontal tow resulting in aborting the operation or
sinking of the structure) 

     
<P>CRITERIA: Safety and Risk
FINDINGS:
     
<P>significant exposure of the workforce to hazardous operations 

there would be occupational exposures to hazardous materials
during decontaminating and breaking the buoy under controlled
onshore conditions; these would be less than the same operations
in Option 2 


 <P>    CRITERIA: Environment and Resource Use

FINDINGS:
<P>

<P> <H4><A NAME="OPTIONS">5. DESCRIPTION OFSHORT-LISTED OPTIONS </A></H4>

 <P>    5.1. DESCRIPTION OF HORIZONTAL DISMANTLING OPERATIONS 

 <P>    5.1.1. -The onshore dismantling option would involve a
number of sequential and concurrent operations encompassing a
wide range of technical activities and operating environments
(AURIS, 1994, 1&2; McDermott, 1993, 11). 

 <P>    5.1.2. The most critical stage of this option would be the
rotation of the buoy in the water to a horizontal position. This
procedure is called "reverse upending" and would be accomplished
by the controlled removal of water (deballasting) from the oil
storage tanks. This operation has to be carried out offshore, in
water of sufficient depth to accommodate the draft of the buoy
(i.e. 102 m after topsides removal). 


     [FIGURE OMITTED]    

<P>     5.1.3. The first step in the disposal process would be to
carry out detailed internal and external surveys of Brent Spar
to determine its present structural condition. Temporary systems
such as power, lighting, life support (ventilation), fire
fighting and safety equipment would have to be installed to
permit personnel to work inside the buoy safely. 

<P>     5.1.4. After disconnecting the internal pipework, bulkheads
and decks across the cutline, the outer structure would be cut
using automated equipment and 1570t topsides lifted onto a cargo
barge using a heavy lift vessel. 

 <P>    5.1.5. The two damaged storage tanks would be repaired by
divers using welded patches to make them leak-tight. The reverse
upending control system consisting of valves, pumps, pressure
transducers and pipework would be fitted to the storage tanks.
Two of the six anchor lines would be removed completely. The
remaining four would be retained to form tow line attachments and
emergency lines. 

<P>     5.1.6. The buoy would be towed to a reverse upending site,
located some 80 km north-west of the present site, to ensure the
operation was carried out well away from existing installation
and pipelines. The tow would take approximately one day. 

<P>     5.1.7 At the upending site, the buoy would be stationed in
a pre-installed mooring system, together with a heavy lift
vessel, work barge and tanker. Once all connections to floating
hoses were made, the contaminated water would be pumped from the
storage tanks across to the tanker via the barge, thus
deballasting the buoy. An inert gas mixture of nitrogen and
carbon dioxide would replace the water in tanks. The sequence and
rates of deballasting would be controlled to minimise
differential pressures on the emptying tanks, and as far as
possible to orientate the damaged tanks out of the water. The
pumping equipment would need to be disconnected prior to the tow,
and it would therefore not be possible to remove any water that
subsequently leaked into the tanks. 

<P>     5.1.8. The buoy would then be towed in its horizontal
attitude to a sheltered site, such as Scapa Flow, for loading
onto a submersible cargo vessel. This operation is necessary to
reduce the draught sufficiently to enable the structure to be
towed to a suitable dockside and to provide a stable and
horizontal platform for dismantling of the hull prior to transfer
ashore (see Paragraph 5.1.11). 



 <P>    [FIGURE OMITTED]    

<P>     5.1.9. On arrival at the loading site, the buoy would again
be stationed in a pre-installed mooring system. Two 2000t
capacity shearlegs would be used to raise the base of the buoy,
reducing the draught at the deepest point to allow the semi-
submersible cargo vessel to manoeuvre beneath it. The semi-
submersible vessel would then deballast, lifting the buoy clear
of the water. A sheltered site would be required for this
operation because the lifting operations would be very weather
sensitive. 

     [FIGURE OMITTED]

<P>5.1.10. The buoy would be transported on the semi-submersible
cargo vessel to the final breaking and disposal site on the UK
mainland. Access holes would be cut in the sides of the tanks to
allow personnel to enter. The inside of the tanks would then be
cleaned by high pressure water jetting, and the resulting
effluent collected and filtered. The filtration unit would remove
solids for authorised disposal, leaving an oily water mixture for
further treatment and eventual disposal. 

 <P>    5 1.11. Transfer of the buoy ashore would be complicated
because of the uneven weight distribution, caused by the
haematite ballast at its base. The buoy would have to be cut into
two sections, with the upper section being removed first. 

  
exposing the lower regions of the storage tanks. The ballast
would be excavated and removed before transfer of the lower hull
section to shore. 

<P>     5.1.12. Mechanical breaking of the structure would be
conducted according to strict operational procedures. Components
which had been in contact with crude oil when the facility was
operational would be assumed to contain scale, contaminated with
naturally occurring radioactive materials. These would be
decontaminated and the scale disposed of in accordance with
current regulations. Once the scale had been removed, the main
hull sections would be mechanically cut into manageable pieces
and offered for sale as scrap steel. All internal and external
anodes would be removed separately. All material, including
inert, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes would require disposal
via an acceptable route complying with all relevant legislation. 

<P>     5.2. DESCRIPTION OF DEEP SEA DISPOSAL OPERATIONS 

<P>     5.2.1. Deep water disposal could be carried out with or
without the topsides in place and the advantages and
disadvantages of these options have been assessed. It has been
concluded that removing the topsides would increase the risks to
the workforce, but would not result in any significant reduction
in environmental impact. Therefore it is not planned to remove
the topsides for the deep water disposal of Brent Spar (AURIS,
1994, 1&2; Global, 1993, 4). 

 <P>    5.2.2. The deep water disposal option would involve less
complex engineering works and less offshore activity than the
onshore dismantling option. 

<P>     5.2.3. The Spar would be 're-entered', the topsides made
safe and the state of the structure evaluated. In order to
minimise the environmental impact of deep sea disposal, as much
of the potentially hazardous materials as possible will be
removed consistent with safety. feasibility and cost (Metocean,
1993,7). This would involve draining down remaining equipment
(eg. lubricating oil, fuel oil etc.,), removing loose equipment
and some of the fittings and transporting recovered materials
ashore for disposal at an authorised site . 

<P>     5.2.4. Explosives experts, would then board the buoy and
place the charges, eventually used to sink the Spar. Sufficient
charges would be placed to ensure that when they were detonated,
all the buoyancy tanks would be opened to the sea, even if some
of them failed to detonate. Flooding of these tanks would be
sufficient to sink the buoy. 

 <P>    5.2.5 Two tugs accompanied by an attendant survey vessel
would then tow the buoy to the selected deep sea disposal site.
Two of the anchor chains would be used to tow Brent Spar out to
the deep sea dump site. The remaining chains would be used as
emergency tow lines. 

  <P>   5.2.6. Three general areas have been identified by the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department (SOAFD) as
potentially suitable for disposal of redundant offshore
structures. as follows: 

    <ul> * Maury Channel 

     * North Feni Ridge 

     * Rockall Trough </ul>

   <P>  These sites are located within U.K. waters and lie in water
depths in excess of 2000m. A detailed survey has been undertaken
by Shell Expro and SOAFD to confirm the 'suitability' of the
potential disposal sites and to provide baseline environmental
data for future monitoring programmes. 

  
     

 <P>     5.2.7. Towing would be conducted using conventional
maritime practices. All routes from the Brent Field to
potential dump sites pass to the north of the Shetland Islands
and to the north and west of the Outer Hebrides. Whichever
site is selected, the earlier stages of the planned routes would 
essentially be common. The routes will be determined by the
      requirement for adequate water depth, sufficient clearance
from installations and the need     for sufficient sea room for
manoeuvre should bad weather or accident result in breaking of
      the tow. The first part of the tow, from the present
location to the 200m contour, would be   subject to detailed
survey, to ensure that the buoy did not encounter any unexpected
      obstructions. The route for the latter stage of the tow
would depend on the disposal site   selected. The tow is planned
to take between 15 - 25 days, depending on the weather      
conditions and final location.
     

      [FIGURE OMITTED]

  <P>   5.2.8. When the Spar arrived at the disposal site, the
correct position would be confirmed and           the tow lines
mechanically released from the tugs. All vessels would then stand
off and the     explosives would be detonated simultaneously by
remote control.     

    

     
     

 <P> <H4><A NAME="ENGINEERING">6. ENGINEERING COMPLEXITY </A></H4>

 <P>    6.1. INTRODUCTION 

 <P>    6.1.1. Both options are significantly different in terms of
their engineering complexity and uncertainties inherent in their
execution, but both are considered technically feasible (AURIS,
1994, 1&2; Global, 1993, 4; McDermott 1993, 11). 

<P>     6.2 OPTION 1 - HORIZONTAL DISMANTLING 

<P>     6.2.1. The main objective of this operation is to transport
the Spar ashore for onshore breaking, to recycle the steel and
to properly dispose of any waste materials. Transportation
requires a reduction in the draught of the buoy, sufficient to
permit entry to a suitable port and transfer to an onshore quay.
To do this requires an intermediate stage of transfer to a semi-
submersible cargo vessel. This option involves nineteen principle
operations and is technically complex. 

     

     [FIGURE OMITTED]

<P>6.2.2. The operations, whilst they have been used in the offshore
oil and gas industry, involve technically demanding marine
engineering techniques. Although all stages are considered
technically feasible, the damage to the storage tanks would have
to be repaired underwater to ensure that they were water-tight
and could provide buoyancy during the upending operation. A
detailed survey will be required to examine the structure before
operations commence to confirm integrity. 

<P>6.2.3. The upending operation would have to take place in deep
water due to the draught of the buoy (currently 109m), which
would be reduced to 102m by removing the topsides. This operation
would be subject to offshore weather and sea conditions. The
original up-ending operation was subsequently demonstrated to
have caused local yielding of the submerged part of the
structure. It is believed that a similar condition would occur
during reverse up-ending, potentially leading to stability and
control problems, particularly if the yielding led to a breach
and accidental flooding of the storage chambers. This coupled
with the difficulties of assuring integrity of the field repairs
to the tanks introduces technical risks. To mitigate this, the
up-ending operation would need to be 

     

     
     carried out slowly (over a period of 5-10 days) which make
this a highly vulnerable to poor weather 

<P>      6.2.4. Following up-ending, the draught of the Spar would
be reduced from 102m to 15m, enabling it to be towed in a
horizontal aspect to a suitable inshore location (e.g. Scapa
Flow) for      transfer to a semi-submersible cargo vessel. The
horizontal tow from the up-ending site to    a sheltered site
involves a technical risk, since pumping equipment installed to
facilitate the      reverse up-ending would have to be removed
prior to the tow. As a result of this, there      would be no
capability to remove any water that subsequently leaked into the
buoy. This     makes the Spar vulnerable to grounding or sinking
in the event of damage occurring during      the tow.
     

 <P>    6.2.5. The 15m draft of the Spar is too deep for direct
transfer onto a semi-submersible cargo vessel and would require
two sheerlegs to lift it into position. The lift is also
critically dependent upon weather and sea state, hence the
preference to complete the operation in a sheltered area such as
Scapa Flow. Once on the vessel, the Spar would be transported to
a suitable onshore site for decontamination and breaking on the
UK mainland. 


     
     

 <P>    6.3. OPTION 4 - DEEP WATER DISPOSAL
     

     [FIGURE OMITTED]

<P>6.3.1. This option involves towing the Spar to a licensed deep
water disposal site and sinking it. Seven principle engineering
and marine operations have been identified. In relative terms,
the option is considered technically simple and again, all
aspects of the operation are within normal offshore industry
practices. Proper disposal would require that the buoy does not
implode or break up during sinking. The preferred method would
be to use linear explosive devices to breach the ballast tanks
and allow flooding of all the buoyancy compartments of the Spar. 


<P>     6.3.2. Preparatory works would be required prior to the tow
to remove as much of the 'regulated materials' as is reasonably
practicable and to install explosive devices with dual fail-safe
detonation system. 

 <P>    6.3.3. The tow and sinking operation would be carried out
in the summer months. Its exact timing would be subject to the
availability of a good weather window. No repairs would be
required to the damaged tanks as the buoy has sufficient
intrinsic buoyancy for the tow. The buoy would be towed in the
vertical aspect from the Brent Field. Detailed route planning
would be conducted to ensure the requirement for adequate water
depth, sufficient clearance from installations and the need for
sufficient sea room to manoeuvre should bad weather or accident
result in loss of the tow. The first part of the tow, from the
Spar's present location to the 200m depth contour, would be
subject to a route survey, ahead of the tow. 



<P>     6.4. SUMMARY OF ENGINEERING COMPLEXITY 

 <P>    6.4.1. While both options are technically feasible, deep sea
disposal involves fewer operations (7 versus 19) and these are
less complex and involve less technical risk than those required
for horizontal dismantling. On this basis, the deep sea disposal
option is preferred. 


 <P><H4><A NAME="SAFETY"> 7 SAFETY AND RISK IMPLICATIONS</A></H4>
     
 <P>    7.1. INTRODUCTION 

 <P>    7.1.1. Both options have a common safety and risk element
regarding the initial entry and preparatory works aboard the
Spar. This involves providing safe access to the buoy and will
require ventilation of spaces, testing and monitoring of the
atmosphere and placement of temporary life support, safety and
fire systems. The safety and risk exposure during these works are
comparable to those experienced in normal offshore construction
activities. 

 <P>    7.2. OPTION 1 - HORIZONTAL DISMANTLING 

 <P>    7.2.1. The large number of activities required for this
option means that it is highly labour intensive and involves some
complex and potentially hazardous operations. The safety and risk
exposures are consequently high (AURIS, 1994,2). 

  <P>    7.2.2. Risk analysis indicates that the probabilities of
fatal injuries are between 0.030 - 0.088          for this
option. This is due, in part, to the hazardous nature of some of
the more complex    operations, but mainly to the high exposures
(large number of man hours) to the hazards of      the onshore
breaking operations.
     
<P>7.2.3. The onshore breaking and disposal of the structure
introduces significant potential for occupational health risks.
The workforce would be exposed in varying degrees to low specific
activity scales, asbestos, heavy metals etc., during the
breaking and subsequent disposal of waste. Strict controls would
be necessary to protect them from unnecessary exposures. 

 <P>    7.3. OPTION 4 - DEEP WATER DISPOSAL 

 <P>    7.3.1. This option involves a much smaller workforce and
relatively straight forward marine operations. Consequently the
exposures are low (AURIS, 1994,2). 

 <P>     7.3.2. Risk analysis indicates that the probabilities of
a fatal injury occurring are between 0.005 - 0.014 for this
option. This is due in part to the comparatively low hazard
potential of the     deep sea disposal operations, but is mainly
the result of the low exposures (low number of     man-hours)
involved.
     
 <P>    7.3.3. Occupational health risks will be minimal in this
option, as onshore dismantling is not required. 

  <P>   7.4. SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND RISK IMPLICATIONS 

 <P>    7.4.1. The complex and labour intensive requirements of
horizontal dismantling make the health and safety risks higher
for this option than deep sea disposal. On this basis, the deep
sea disposal option is preferred. 
 

  <P><H4><A NAME="WORK">8. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS</A> </H4>

 <P>    8.1. INTRODUCTION 

<P>     8.1.1. Each option has the potential to affect different
environments. Horizontal dismantling operations take place in the
North Sea, the shallow coastal environment, an estuarine
environment and the onshore dismantling and disposal locations.
Deep sea disposal operation takes place in the North Sea and the
NE Atlantic. 

<P>     8.1.2. Brent Spar contains small, residual quantities of
materials and substances which have the potential to cause impact
if released to the environment. Three groups of materials have
been subjected to particular consideration, these are heavy
metals and quantities of other regulated materials, petrogenic
hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials. 

<P>     8.2. OPTION 1 - HORIZONTAL DISMANTLING 

<P>     8.2.1. Successful execution of the horizontal, onshore
dismantling of the Spar would result in negligible impacts to the
marine environment of the North Sea (AURIS, 1994,1). 

<P>     8.2.2. Impacts to onshore, terrestrial environments
associated with dismantling the buoy and the removal of its
contents are considered mostly short lived and geographically
localised, similar to the everyday impacts that might be
experienced at any coastal, industrial facility. 

 <P>    8.2.3. Material retrieved from the buoy during onshore
dismantling would either be sold for scrap, recycled or disposed
of at authorised sites. These sites are properly designed,
constructed and managed for disposal of materials and no impacts
would be anticipated from these activities. 

  <P>   8.2.4. The complex operations involved create a potential
for unplanned events to occur, and subsequent impact to North Sea
or coastal environments through the accidental release of
materials, or at worst, premature loss of the structure. Impacts
from accidental releases would be confined to the immediate
vicinity of the structure. Depending on the location, premature
of loss of the structure could cause significant local impacts
on fishing, shipping and other users of the sea, particularly if
it occurred in a shallow water coastal area. 

<P>    8.3. OPTION 4- DEEP WATER DISPOSAL 

 <P>    8.3.1. Successful execution of the deep water disposal
option would result in small localised impacts at an authorised
dumping site in the NE Atlantic. It would have little or no risk
to the North Sea or coastal environments (AURIS, 1994,1
;Metocean, 1993,8&9). 

 <P>    8.3.2. Regulated materials contained within the topsides of
the Spar would be removed, as far as is reasonably practicable,
in order to minimise any potential for environmental impact.
These materials would be disposed of at authorised land-fill
sites and no impacts are envisaged from these activities. 

<P>     8.3.3. The deep ocean environment supports low densities of
animals and a small range of species, and is essentially isolated
from the surface and upper ocean. From the results of available
deep ocean survey data, the environmental impacts of deep water
disposal would be small and confined to a small area of the deep
sea bed at the NE Atlantic disposal site, and to that part of the
water column immediately adjacent to the sea bed. 

 <P>     8.3.4. Exploitation of resources of the deep ocean (> 1
,500m) is currently limited to laying of  submarine cables 
and military activities. The sites have been selected to avoid 
interactions with these interests. This option provides no potential for
interaction with other resource users at the present time or,
indeed, for the foreseeable future. 

 <P>    8.3.5. The potential for unplanned events exist during the
tow. There is less risk of premature sinking of the Spar as its
floatation in the vertical does not rely on integrity of the
storage tanks. As the majority of the towing route is in deep
water, away from the coast, the impact of premature sinking would
be less significant than a similar event occurring in shallow
coastal waters. 

<P>     8.4. SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

<P>    8.4.1. - The relatively small amount of contaminants on and
in the Brent Spar means that the impacts arising from their
discharge or release into any environment would be small and
localised. 

<P>     8.4.2. In the event of premature sinking of the Spar, the
physical presence of the structure on the sea bed would be of
greater significance to other users of the sea, in the shallow
North Sea or coastal environment than in the deep waters of the
North East Atlantic. Although the areas of the North Sea along
the tow routes would be exposed to this risk in both options,
only the horizontal dismantling option would expose the coastal
environment to risks of this nature . 

 <P>    8.4.3. Deep sea disposal will have a small localised impact
at the deep water disposal site but no effect on the coastal or
onshore environment. As planned, horizontal dismantling will have
negligible impacts on the marine environment, and any effects
onshore will be extremely localised. However, there is greater
potential for an unplanned event during horizontal
dismantling, and if this were to occur in shallow inshore waters
there could be a significant impact on other users of the sea.
The environmental impacts of each option are therefore evenly
balanced.

    <P> 9.4. SUMMARY OF COST CONSIDERATIONS
     

  <P>   9.4.1.- Horizontal dismantling represents a significantly
higher cost than deep water disposal. The more attractive option
economically is deep sea disposal. 


     

 <P> <H4><A NAME="CONSULTATION">10. CONSULTATION PROCESS</A></H4>
     

<P>    10.1. CONSULTATIONS
     

 <P>    10.1.1. Discussions on the proposed Abandonment Plan for the
Brent Spar were initiated between Shell Expro and the Department
of Trade and industry in 1992. Under the Petroleum Act 1987,
consultation on the Abandonment Plan is required with the
following organisations: 

     <ul>Government Bodies:
     

     Scottish National Heritage
     

     Joint Nature Conservancy Committee (Seabirds at
     Sea)
     

     Legitimate Users of the Sea:
     

     Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF)
     

     Orkney Fishermen's Association
     

     Firth of Forth Fishermen's Association
     

     Federation of Highlands and Islands Fishermen
     

     Western Isles Fishermen's Association
     

     British Telecom International</ul>
     

 <P>    10.1.2. During the first quarter of 1994, Shell Expro
notified these organisations of the proposed Abandonment Plan,
appraised them of the options considered, and their preferred
choice. Consultation meetings with the fishermens' organisations
have also been held through the Scottish Fishermen's Federation.
Detailed discussions have been held with the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department, Her Majesty's Industrial
Pollution Inspectorate and the Health and Safety Executive. Other
interested government bodies were also notified of the
Abandonment Plan, including the Ministry of Defence, Hydrographer
of the Navy, Crown Estates Commissioners for Scotland and the
Department of Transport. 

<P>     10.2. ACCEPTABILITY
     

  <P>    10.2.1. No objections have been raised to Shell Expro's
conclusion that deep sea disposal is the preferred option for
abandoning the Brent Spar. 
     

 <P><H4> <A NAME="SELECTION">11. OPTION SELECTION</A>

<P>     11.1. BEST PRACTICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL OPTION </H4>

 <P>    11.1.1. From a technical perspective the deep sea disposal
option is demonstrated to be simpler than the horizontal
dismantling option. The latter involves more complex engineering
and marine operations and higher risk of unplanned events and
technical uncertainties. 

 <P>    11.1.2. The safety and risk implications demonstrate that
the complex and labour intensive activities involved in
horizontal dismantling constitutes a higher safety and risk
exposure to the workforce, compared to deep sea disposal. 

 <P>    11.1.3. In either option, it can be demonstrated that there
is a small or negligible environmental impact. The operations
associated with the deep water disposal would have small
localised effects at the deep water site. The planned operations
associated with onshore dismantling and disposal would have
negligible impacts. 

 <P>    11.1.4. Although horizontal dismantling would lead to
negligible environmental effects, provided no-mishaps occur, the
more complicated activities involved lead to an increased
potential for unplanned events. The areas that might be affected
have higher sensitivity than those affected by deep sea disposal,
particularly in the event of premature loss of the buoy where the
physical presence of the wreck could present an obstruction to
shipping or fishing activities. 

 <P>    11.1.5. From a cost perspective the deep water option is
significantly less expensive compared with horizontal onshore
disposal. 

<P>     11.1.6. Consultations have been held with responsible
government departments and other interested parties. No
objections to the deep water disposal option have been raised. 

 <P>    11.2. CONCLUSION 

<P>     The Best Practicable Environmental Option assessment
significantly favours Deep Sea Disposal of the Brent Spar on the
basis that: 

 <P>    Alternative methods are technically complex
     
 <P>    It greatly reduces the risks to personnel engaged in the
abandonment    

<P>     It offers negligible environmental disadvantages and reduces
the risk to other assets and resources at sea and on the coast 

     
<P>   <b> It is the lowest cost option
     

     It is acceptable to the authorities and their consultees </b>
 <P>    The Deep Sea Disposal option has therefore been selected for
the abandonment of the Brent Spar Buoy in the 2nd and 3rd
quarters of 1995.

<P><H4>5. BALLAST PROCEDURE</H4>

<P><H4>5 .1.  INTRODUCTION</H4>



<P>In this chapter the ballast procedure is discussed,
whereby the amount of water ballast in the Spar is
adjusted to enable sectionalising of the Spar. The
ballast procedure, the damage to the Storage Tanks
C27 (T100) and C29 (T500) influences the sequence of
the ballast procedure. In the following paragraphs,
the damage (including the repair) is briefly
described, followed by the ballast procedure and
some ballast procedure details.



<P><H4>5 . 2 .   DAMAGE TO STORAGE TANKS</H4>


<P>The Storage Tanks C27 (T100) and C29 (T500) have
been damaged previously due to operational errors.
The damage is located between 4 and 32 meter from
the bottom of the Spar (see appendix 3).


<P>The damage was repaired later on by bolting straps
on and restoring the structural integrity.  In the
damaged area however three cracks and a large number
(some 73) of 150 mm diameter arm holes remain
present.  The damaged compartments are therefore
considered as leaking tanks, open to the sea.



<P>5.2.1     Water removal method damaged Storage Tanks


<P>The ballast water from the two damaged tanks is
removed by lifting the tanks above sealevel.  In
this way, ballast water will flow from the tanks 
into the sea.




 <P>               Smit Engineering BV



[Figure omitted]


<P>It is necessary to allow simultaneously inert gas to
 enter the top of the damaged tanks.
 The use of inert gas is envisaged to avoid
 explosions in case the tanks contains an oil layer
 on top of the ballast water.


<P>In the event this poses a problem the most obvious
alternative is to patch the holes prior to removing
the contents of the damaged storage tanks into the
watercarrier.



<P>5.2.2 Patching of damage


<P>Patching of the damage is feasible. Although
patching may well be carried out with saturation
divers, we have assumed in this study that only
airdiving is used.
For airdiving, the depth limit is 50 m.
The application of ROV's is not considered since
specific tools will need to be developed to patch
the holes and cracks.


<P>The holes can be patched by using prefabricated
steel patches (see drawing 91.3100-D-010).
The cracks can be patched with putty when they are
not too wide. Otherwise, wooden kegs with putty are
used.                        -




<P><H4>5.3.      GENERAL BALLASTING PROCEDURE</H4>



<P>The ballasting of the Brent Spar is carried out to
ensure proper lifting heights for the various
sections to be lifted off.  The actual ballasting
operation will take place in between the lifting
operations. An exception is made for the intermediate lift
during which the damage is patched.  In this case,
the deballasting is supported by two sheerlegs, in
order to reduce the draft to an acceptable level to
allow air divers to patch the damage, and to ensure
an upright position of the Spar.


<P>In this paragraph, an overview of the ballastlng
activities will be presented.  A detailed
description of these activities can be found in
appendix 4.  A detailed description of some of the
procedure details is given in section 6.4.


<P>Preparations prior to lift 1:
     For bringing the Spar to a draught of 113 m
     three Outer Ballast Tanks are to be filled for
     44%.  This is done by using gravity filling.
<P>Preparations prior to lift 2:
     First the water in the Outer Ballast Tanks is
     removed by mobile pumps.
     This is followed by deballasting of the Storage
     Tanks.  While two storage tanks are open to
     sea, from a Symmetry point of view, only three
     tanks lying in a star formation can be used for
     deballasting.  The other three tanks are kept
     at a level equal to sealevel.
     It is therefore the intention to deballast
     three intact Storage Tanks to 90% by using
     compressed inert gas.
<P> Preparations prior and during intermediate lift
     At this point the oil is skimmed from three
     intact Storage Tanks whereafter submersible
     pumps are lowered into the tanks.  This is
     followed by further deballasting.
     With only three of the six storage tanks used
     for deballasting, the relative water column on
     these three storage tanks increases.



               


<P>     The draught of the Spar is 82m, the
relative water column is 25 m.
At this point, it is suggested  to use the
available lifting capacity to reduce the
draught of the Spar to enable patching of the
damaged areas.


<P>By attaching the two sheerlegs to the damaged
tanks, tank C31 can also be deballasted, while
from the damaged tanks the ballast will flow
into the sea. The upright position is ensured
by the sheerlegs.
With this method it is feasible to reduce the
water column to 20 m, whereby both sheerlegs
are lifting 700 ton.  The reduced draft of the
Spar is 49 m.
<P>At this point it is feasible to patch the
damage with divers.  Bearing in mind that the
lowest point of the damage is 4 meters from the
bottom of the spar, the maximum diving depth
for patching is 45 meters.
<LI>- Preparations prior to lift 3:
<LI>     -After the patching the tanks are filled up to
     again to an average 65% prior to lifting off
     the 3rd section.  During this operation, the
     Spar is assisted by the sheerlegs to stay in an
     upright position. After the tanks are filled,
     the sheerlegs can be disconnected.
-<LI> Preparations prior to lift 4:
     All six Storage Tanks will be deballasted to
     30%.
-<LI> Preparations prior to lift 5:
     All six Storage Tanks will be deballasted until
     no water is left.
-<LI> Preparations prior to lift 6:
     No deballasting is required for the lift of the
     bottom section



<P><H4>5.4 PROCEDURE DETAILS</H4>

<P>In this paragraph some of the ballasting procedure
aspects are discussed in more detail.


<P>On request of Shell Expro, the equipment of the Spar
is not used and mobile and submersible pumps are
used instead.
In those cases where internal piping is used, this
is restricted to the piping previously used by Shell
Expro in normal operational conditions.
Prior to using the piping, it should be checked for
leakage and valves should be checked for proper
operation.


<P>According to Shell Expro, the Storage Tanks are
completely filled with seawater.  Prior to
decommissioning of the Spar all systems were flushed
to remove any oil.  For this study, it is assumed
that there is still a possibility of a top layer of
oil, floating on top of the waterballast in the
Storage Tanks.  This layer should be skimmed from
the Storage Tanks and collected in a special tank.
In order to reduce the risk of pollution, the rest
of the removed ballast water from the storage tanks
is collected in a water carrier.



<P>5.4.1.    Ballasting of Outer Ballast Tanks


The ballasting of the Outer Ballast Tanks in
preparation of lifting the topside can be done based
on gravity.  For a schematic overview of the
piping system see drawing 91.3100-D-004 Sheet 1.
The easiest way for ballasting is to use only tanks
C40, C42 and C44, since tanks C39 and C41, located-
above the damaged tanks, are blinded off .



<P>5.4.2 Deballasting of the Ballasting Tanks

Deballasting of the Outer Ballast Tanks after the
topside is removed, is carried out with mobile
pumps.  These pumps will be positioned in the Pump
Room on the M-deck.  The suction of these mobile
pumps will be connected to the Suction Manifold Ring
either to an available flange, or otherwise by means
of a hot-tap.  The pressure side will be mounted to
a blinded valve, directly connected to the Central
Shaft.  See drawing 9l.3100- D-004 Sheet 2.



<P>5.4.3 Deballasting of intact Storage Tanks with inert gas


Prior to skimming the Storage Tanks, the tanks have
to be entered in order to position the skimming
equipment.  The water level in these tanks is
therefore lowered to create a working space between
the water level and the top of tank.
Due to the fact that the internal equipment of the
Spar can not be used, it is not possible to operate
the Seawater Disposal System of the Spar.  It is
feasible to achieve a working space in the top of
the storage tanks by applying compressed inert gas
to force the ballast waters out via the existing
piping.     


<P>The inert gas hoses can be connected to three
different manifolds, on various levels (see drawing
91.3100-D-006).  The first choice is the Transfer
Manifold on the M-deck.  This one is favoured since
it is close to the top of the tanks.  The second
choice is the Pump Suction Manifold on the J-deck.
Finally also use can be made of the Filling Manifold
on the H-deck


<P>For the discharge of the water ballast, use is made
of the risers in the tanks, which are connected to
the Seawater Manifold.
From this manifold a connection to the water carrier
can be made at an elevation of 105 m. (J-deck),
which is 5 m. above sealevel.  The required pressure
in the system to remove the water ballast is between
3 and 4 bar.


<P>Prior to putting the system under pressure, valves
are to be mounted to the ventlines.  The overflow
lines and the line from the Sea Water Manifold
running to the Tanker have to be sealed-off.


<P>After closure of the water ballast discharge lines
the pressure in the tanks is released by opening the
valves mounted to the ventlines and the tanks can be
opened.  When the tanks are opened, and the top
layer of oil is removed, further deballasting of
these tanks can take place by using submersible
pumps.



<P>5.4.4 Entering the Storage Tanks


<P>The entrance to the main storage tanks can only be
obtained by means of a manhole or with a cold
cutting method such as water jet cutting or with a
diamond saw.
Obtaining entrance is in no way feasible through a
hot cutting method since the possible presence of an
oil layer floating on top of the water ballast could
set off an explosion.


<P>Prior to opening the tanks, the pressure has to be
released by venting and the water level and pressure
inside the tank should be checked.

<HEAD><H4>TOXICANT LEVELS IN BALLAST WATER FROM THE BRENT SPAR
INSTALLATION</H4></HEAD><BODY>

<li>From:  WMcMinn
<li>Date: 6 December 1993
<li>Division: DFR, EP2
Fisheries Laboratory
Burnham-on-Crouch
<li>Tel No: 0621 782658
<li>GTN: 3030ext248


<P>To: Dr J Campbell 

<li>    cc: Dr C Vivian
<li>         Dr P Matthiessen
<li>         Ms D Gore
<li>         Mrs L Massie, SOAFD, Aberdeen


<P>Dr O Branden from AURIS Environmental contacted us to request information on the
toxicity of Glyoxal and its products. He pointed out that 4.5 m-3 of Glyoxal had been
used to treat 50 000 m -3 of crude oil which had been heavily contaminated with H2S.
This chemical was used to scavenge the hydrogen sulphide, and so reacted with it to form
mono, di, tri and tetra THIOLS (mercaptans).                   


<P>A data search was then performed and data for Methyl and Ethyl Mercaptans was
recovered from the US EPA's AQUIRE [1] database.

<P>In general the data shows that as the size of the molecule increases so does the
Octanol/Water partitioning coefficient (this is a measure of the lipid solubility of a
chemical, anything with a log Pow of >3 with a molecular weight of <600 is liable to
bioaccumulate). From this data it is probable that any large (tri or tetra) thiols will be
liable to bioaccumulate. The retrieved toxicity data indicates that the toxicity of these
chemicals is generally greater than 100 mg/l for freshwater species so that they are only
moderately harmful, and should not pose any particular environmental hazard as long as
any water discharge is very dilute. It should be pointed out that mercaptans are known to
cause taint in fish and shellfish and this should be considered. The provided data indicates
that the maximum level of mercaptans present would be 900 mg/l. Of far greater concern
are the potential levels of heavy metals present in this water.

<P>The sacrificial anodes used to protect these tanks are made of Zinc, which is a PARCOM
black list substance. Levels of zinc in samples of the sludge from 2 of the 7 tanks filled
with this water were reported to be >100 mg/l. It is probable that there will be
considerable levels of Zinc in the water so that it will have to be treated as hazardous
waste (C Vivian pers. comm.). In addition there are very high levels of Copper present in
the sludge, levels reported were 285 mg/l and 1430 mg/l in two of the seven tanks. This
gives a mean level of 857.5 mg/L We recently performed a basic hazard assessment on
this metal and found that toxic effects could be observed at only 9 micro g/l (copy
attached [2]). Therefore a dilution factor of at least 100 000 would be required to reduce
the toxicity of the discharge  to an acceptable level.

<P><B>On the data we have been provided, the chemistry of this water is such that it has to be
considered very toxic to marine biota. It should therefore be treated as hazardous waste,
and discharge should be prohibited (C Vivian pers. cornm.). As the structure has not been
used for two years it is no longer covered by the Statutory Instrument (1985, No. 1699)
which excludes producing facilities from the provisions of FEPA. Shell will have to apply
for a dumping licence to dispose of any water or other wastes from the Brent Spar, and
very stringent controls should be applied.
</B>
<P>AURIS have been put in touch with the Orkney Water Test Centre to discuss treatment
options. this may be the ideal facility to use as it has a direct link to the Flotta Oil
terminal so that hydrocarbons can be removed from the water before it is transferred for
further treatment. It has been pointed out that other facilities may exist which are more or
equally suited to deal with this waste water.





<P>[1] It should be noted that the AQUIRE modelling system predictions should be treated
with some caution. It should reveal the general trend of chemical behaviour, but it is
based on assumptions  which do not apply to North Sea situations (eg temperature).

<P>[2] The hazard assessment is a simple draft format and should not be treated as definitive,
it has not been fully vetted.

<P ALIGN=CENTRE src><H4>Brent Spar - the scientific debate </H4></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>During the campaign to stop the dumping of the Brent Spar, it has
been claimed in some media reports that Greenpeace based its
activities on emotion and dogma to the exclusion of science. A
scientific debate has ensued, which has included some attacks on
our stance by scientists, including an Opinion piece in the
journal Nature. 
 
<P>Greenpeace is contacting scientists directly in order to make
available the information and arguments on which we based our
decision. We feel that it is important that the scientific debate
continues and that information is freely available to be
discussed. We are confident that our scientific arguments are
robust and invite you to contact us should you wish to discuss
our position further or obtain any of the information or copies
of documents that we hold. We took into account the available
scientific knowledge, our commitment to valuing the environment,
and our understanding of the political consequences of the
dumping of the Brent Spar before starting our campaign. 
 
<P>Our actions were based on the following facts: 
 
<LI>(i) There has been no formal inventory of the Brent Spar's
contents, so the environmental impacts could not possibly be
properly assessed. 
 
<LI>(ii) There is a lack of understanding of the deep sea
environment, and it is currently impossible to predict the
effects of the proposed dumping on deep sea ecosystems. 
 
<LI>(iii) The documents which supported Shell's licence application
are highly conjectural in nature. They contain numerous
unsubstantiated assumptions, minimal data and extrapolations from
unnamed studies. 
 
<LI>(iv) Dumping the Brent Spar would create a precedent for dumping
other contaminated structures in the sea and would undermine
current international agreements. The environmental effects of
further dumping would be cumulative. 
 
<LI>(v) Dismantling of the Brent Spar is technically feasible and
offshore engineering firms believe they can do it safely and
effectively. The necessary facilities are already routinely in
use and decommissioning of many other oil installations has
already been carried out elsewhere in the world. 
 
<LI>(vi) To protect the environment, the principle of minimising the
generation of wastes should be upheld and harmful materials
always recycled, treated or contained. 
 
<P><H4>1.  The inventory </H4>
 
<LI>The inventory of pollutants on the Brent Spar is based on very
limited empirical measurements by Shell, with no independent
investigations1. For example, the amount of sludge in the tanks
has been estimated, not measured, and only two samples of it have
been taken for measurements of hydrocarbon concentrations. The
samples gave widely differing results (values of 32,000 ppm and
344,000 ppm are quoted1). No sample of pipe scale has been taken,
and levels of radioactivity have merely been assumed by
comparison with another installation (Brent "A"). 
 
<P><H4>2. The deep ocean environment </H4>
  
<LI>Deep ocean ecosystems and physical processes are poorly
understood. The dispersal of pollutants in ocean sediments is
hard to predict and the toxicological responses of deep water
organisms are unknown. We are not aware of any information in the
literature concerning toxicity tests that have been carried out
using deep water organisms. Indeed it is difficult to see how
such information could be obtained given the extreme nature of
the environment in terms of its physical and chemical
characteristics.  
 
<P>There is therefore insufficient scientific knowledge to support
the assertion in Nature2 that the effect on deep-sea life would
be `minimal or beneficial'. The article by Nisbet and Fowler in
the same issue3 suggests that some deep sea organisms may benefit
from heavy metals. This, however, tells us nothing about how the
ecosystem as a whole will respond to a poorly known cocktail of
radioactive scale, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and a residual
amount of PCBs. Nisbet and Fowler hypothesise that a `carefully
chosen location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge' might be an
appropriate disposal site. Yet Shell did not propose disposal at
such a site, nor have any detailed studies been made of the
effects of the Brent Spa's contents at any site.  
 
<P><H4>3. Shell's documents </H4>
 
<LI>Shell have stated that the decision to dump the Brent Spar was
taken after at least 3 years of investigation. The culmination
of this work was presented in three documents which were provided
 
to the UK Government as their justification1,4,5. Other
scientific documents have not been made publicly available.  
 
<LI>The BPEO4, Impact Hypothesis5 and Auris report1 rely heavily on
the same, limited information. A copy of Shell's BPEO is
enclosed, the Impact Hypothesis is available on request.  
 
<P>The conclusions in Shell's documents rest on a number of
unsubstantiated assumptions and take no account of the
uncertainties in the inventory and the limited scientific
understanding of the deep sea environment. 
  
<P>One assumption in the Impact Hypothesis5, for example, is that
the most likely scenario is slow release of contaminants at the
sea-bed over a period of a thousand years. This assumption has
not been justified and contradicts a statement in the Auris
report1, which states "It is likely that some or all of the tanks
would be split, discharging their contents into the immediate
environment or permitting their dispersion into the surrounding
water" when the Brent Spar hit the sea bed.  
  
<P>It is further assumed5 that dispersed particulates will settle
"with an even distribution within a 150m radius of the point
source" and thus levels of heavy metals would be "negligible".
The effects of finely dispersed hydrocarbons are described as
"insignificant", based solely on a reference to unnamed fouling
studies in the North Sea5,1. These studies supposedly indicate
no adverse effects on organisms living in the vicinity - yet the
studies are not identified in any way, nor is any data given. 
It is simply not adequate to extrapolate the results of toxicity
studies carried out in shallow water environments to predict the
likely impacts in deep water. 
 
<P>Greenpeace considers that both the lack of reliable data and
inadequate knowledge of deep ocean systems must call into
question Shell's conclusions of 'negligible harm' following
dumping of the Spar. I enclose a copy of a memo6 from a
Government scientist to his colleagues in which it is stated that
the materials would be classified as hazardous waste.  This led
to the added hand written comment: "The bottom line is that the
waste cannot be dumped at sea.  The only option is to take ashore
and treat".  Although the Government have subsequently claimed
that this advice relates to shallow water environments, such an
interpretation is not obvious from the note itself. Furthermore,
if the materials are too toxic to dump in shallow water, it is
hard to see how dumping in deep water can then be justified,
given that far less is known about the deep water environment. 
 
<P><H4>4. The precedent </H4>
  
<P>During the latter half of last summer (1994) Greenpeace was made
aware of an internal review being carried out by the Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI) on options for decommissioning 
redundant offshore installations. It was clear that the Brent
Spar was likely to be the first of the installations which would
be proposed to be dumped at sea.  
   
<P>Under the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) guidelines,
all of the structures in the shallower southern part of the North
Sea must be brought ashore, but other options, including dumping
(in situ toppling) were being considered for installations in the
Central and Northern part of the North Sea.  In the UK sector
this would mean that between 50 and 60 installations could be
dealt with in this way. 
 
<P>The harm caused by the Brent Spar, if it was dumped, would be
added to if other oil installations were dumped later. But the
BPEO only operates on a case-by-case basis so ignores the
cumulative effects of dumping more than one installation. 
  
<P>If the dumping of the Brent Spar had been allowed not only would
the dumping of a further 50 to 60 installations been made easier,
but it may have been used as a precedent to allow the dumping of
other obsolete installations from the North Sea fields, and
possibly contaminated bulky items from other industries.   
  
<P>Greenpeace has always been concerned that the Brent Spar could
have been used as a dangerous precedent in other ways. The Brent
Spar contained materials which would be classified as low level
radioactive and hazardous wastes under domestic and international
legislation. The London Convention (formerly known as the London
Dumping Convention) has not established de minimis levels (also
known as exempt levels) for these substances. If the Brent Spar
dumping operation had been allowed to go ahead it would have
established a precedent for dumping a wide range of materials of
similar contamination levels, in items such as construction
materials contaminated with radioactivity, for example power
station containment buildings and other civil and military
engineering scrap. Such a precedent would have reversed the
current trend towards responsible disposal methods, as opposed
to dumping at sea. 
  
<P><H4>5. The onshore option </H4>
  
<P>Concerns have been raised that the Spar, which was weakened when
it was first moved into the horizontal position, will break up
during inshore operations and release harmful materials into the 
near shore environment. Shell have tended to portray this problem
as so serious that the safest thing to do is to dump the Spar at
sea. Yet they assumed that the tanks would remain intact on
hitting the sea bed when dumped, even though sinking the Spar
would involve detonating explosives. 
 
<P>Clearly, a detailed structural survey is required, something
Shell have not yet carried out. However, the offshore
construction industry regard onshore dismantling as perfectly
technically feasible. I enclose an article from the Sunday Times7
which makes it clear that firms are already claiming they can do
the work. I also enclose sections of a report by Smit Engineering
of Rotterdam8, commissioned by Shell in 1992, which clearly
outlines the engineering tasks and includes details of how the
Spar can be inspected and repaired if this proves necessary. 
   
<P>	In fact the operations required to decontaminate the Brent Spar
are in routine use by the offshore industry. Oily water and
sludge reception facilities are present at most ports dealing
with tankers and oil operations and radioactive scale is
routinely removed from pipes onshore as part of the maintenance
cycle. Once decontaminated, the reverse engineering operations
involved in dismantling the Spar pose no more risk to the
nearshore environment than a conventional surface vessel.  
  
<P>Furthermore, decommissioning is already carried out or planned
for other installations. In the North Sea, nine platforms have
already been removed and fifty are due to be decommissioned over
the next ten years. Of the 219 oil and gas platforms in the North
Sea, over 150 are due to be removed completely, for re-use or
on-shore disposal, according to Government and industry plans9.
In the Gulf of Mexico, Federal regulations require removal of
installations down to 5 metres below the mudline. Over 900
installations have been removed there so far. 
 
<P>To contribute to the DTI review referred to above, Greenpeace
commissioned its own report10. Our investigations found that
exaggerated costs of onshore dismantling were being provided to
the Government by the oil industry. Our consultants also
discovered that it was technically and economically feasible to
bring redundant installations onshore, and that this was the best
environmental option. In addition it would create new jobs in the
currently depressed offshore construction market.  
 
<P>It is feasible to deal with the Brent Spar on land although this
will not be easy, just as it was not easy to first design,
construct and operate offshore installations. It will cost Shell
more, just as it cost Shell more to place platforms on sea than
on land. The 'scientific' arguments for ocean dumping are being
used as a way of disguising Shell's primary aim to cut costs at
the expense of the environment.  
 
  
<P><H4>6. The principle </H4>
  
<P>Greenpeace believes in the fundamental principle that we should
no longer needlessly dump wastes into the environment (which ever
part) and that we must act responsibly to reduce waste and
recycle, treat or contain harmful materials. Opinions on the
Brent Spar depend not only on the scientific knowledge available
but also on how deeply we value our environment and what damage
and precedents we find unacceptable. Public concern about dumping
may conflict with the values of some scientists, but it does not
conflict with the available scientific knowledge. 
  
<P>We hope you have found this letter informative and that you feel
able to join us in celebrating an important step forward in
environmental protection - the decision not to dump the Brent
Spar.   
  
<P>On Thursday 29th June, the Oslo Commission announced a ban on the
dumping of oil installations at sea. Eleven Governments have
sponsored this decision - only the UK and Norway have tabled
reservations. We hope to persuade those Governments to change
their minds. 
  
<P>Please feel free to contact me, or my colleagues, if you have any
questions or require access to any more reports we have.

<p><H4>BRENT SPAR MEETING BETWEEN GREENPEACE AND SHELL</H4>

<P>London--8 September 1995--Shell UK are now studying 200 different
options for onshore disposal or re-use of the Brent Spar. 
Greenpeace welcomes this following a constructive meeting with
the Chairman of Shell UK on Wednesday. 

<P>Peter Melchett of Greenpeace said:-

<P>"Greenpeace reaffirms its absolute opposition to deep sea
disposal of the Brent Spar.  Greenpeace welcomes the fact that
Shell UK is now studying 200 options for onshore disposal or re-
use of the Brent Spar.  Greenpeace has always believed this is
the right solution for the Brent Spar."  

<P>The dumping of the Brent Spar would have created an unacceptable
precedent for dumping other contaminated structures in the sea. 

<P>Greenpeace has always believed in the fundamental principle that
we should no longer needlessly dump wastes into the environment
and that we must act responsibly to reduce waste, recycle non-
hazardous waste and treat or contain harmful materials. 

<P>In June 1995 the relevant international legal body (the Oslo and
Paris Commission - OSPAR - decided by 11 votes to 2 to ban the
dumping of oil installations in the North East Atlantic
(including the North Sea) (1). 

<P>FOR FURTHER DETAILS CALL ++44 171 354 5100 or ++44 171 359 4837 

<P>Notes

<P><font size=+1>1.</font>  The UK Government has objected to the decision which is not
therefore legally binding in the UK.  However, the UK Government
has opposed previous decisions of relevant intergovernmental
bodies on the dumping of waste in the North Sea and North East
Atlantic (radioactive waste, industrial waste and sewage sludge),
but in practice the UK Government and UK-based multinationals
like ICI have eventually abided by the decisions. 

<P><font size=+1>2.</font> The "Best Practicable Environmental Option" (BPEO) - referred
to in the Shell UK press release about the same meeting - is a
UK Government policy which Greenpeace believes in fundamentally
flawed and is not the same as the best environmental practice. 
However, Greenpeace recognises that if Shell UK seeks relicensing
for the disposal of the Brent Spar within the UK, it will have
to work within the legal framework of UK Government policy at the
time, which may still be "BPEO". 

<P><font size=+1>3.</font>  Thilo Bode of Greenpeace International has accepted Shell's
invitation to a further meeting in October.

<head><title>GREENPEACE WELCOMES NEW INVENTORY ON BRENT SPAR
 </title></head><body>
      <H4> GREENPEACE WELCOMES NEW INVENTORY ON BRENT SPAR
 </H4>
<P>London--18 October 1995--Greenpeace today welcomed the first
independent inventory of the contents of the Brent Spar, saying
it was a first and totally necessary step towards any reasonable
decision about which land-based decommissioning process should
be taken.  Greenpeace also welcomes Shell's very firm statement
today that it will not dump the Brent Spar at sea.
<p><b><a href="dnvtab.html">Click here</a> for table of contents of Brent Spar from DNV survey compared with Shell estimates.</b>
<P>"It is good that we now have credible results," said Geir Wang-
Andersen of Greenpeace International. "This shows that the
Greenpeace campaign and the Greenpeace position on
decommissioning of oil installations was and is right, because
it is totally unacceptable to dump this kind of waste into the
oceans."

<P>When Greenpeace began its campaign to stop the Brent Spar from
being dumped, the only information to hand was Shell's estimation
that it contained 100 tonnes of sludge containing various toxic
elements and 30 tonnes of low-level radioactive waste.  In the
absence of a full inventory Greenpeace, during our occupation,
attempted to find out what was on the Brent Spar.  The estimates
resulting from this sampling were in no way central to the
campaign and indeed, were later withdrawn by Greenpeace.

<P>If Greenpeace had not campaigned against the dumping of the Brent
Spar this installation would now be at the bottom of the ocean
and nobody would know what was really in it, nor the
environmental impact that could be occurring.  
 
<P>Greenpeace notes that there is now a ban on the dumping of oil
installations anywhere in the North East Atlantic and the North
Sea -- a legal ban adopted at the Oslo Paris Commission meeting
in June this year [1]. 
 
<P>"Today's information now means that the best method of
decommissioning the Brent Spar on land can be decided properly,
with all the facts before us, instead of the previous 'dump and
hope for the best' situation," said Wang-Anderson. 
 
<P>"Greenpeace's total opposition to the dumping of oil
installations remains firm. Nobody should use the oceans as a
dumpsite."
 
<P>Greenpeace welcomed Shell's decision to conduct a new study on
the disposal of Brent Spar, looking into more than 200 options
of landbased disposal. 
 
<P>For more information, please contact 
Cindy Baxter, Greenpeace Communications ++44 171 833 0600 


<p>Notes to Editors
 
<p>[1] The Oslo Paris Commission met in late June this year, and
agreed a total ban on the dumping of oil installations in the
North East Atlantic.  The UK and Norway have lodged reservations 
to this ban. This followed the North Sea Ministers meeting in
Esbjerg on 8/9 June where all countries bordering the North Sea,
except the UK and Norway, agreed to ban the dumping of oil
installations. 
 
<p>(2) A UN meeting in Washington next week, attended by governments
from around the world, will focus on the worrying issue of ocean
pollution, particularly toxic chemicals, from land based sources
-- a growing global concern and one which the oil industry ought
to take into account in its exploration.

<TITLE>SHELL /OIL EXPERTS CONTRADICT UKOOA POSITION ON DECOMMISSIONING
                  OF  OIL INSTALLATIONS</TITLE></HEAD>

<a href="brent.html"><img align=right src="vict02t.gif" border=0></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>OIL EXPERTS CONTRADICT UKOOA POSITION ON DECOMMISSIONING
                  OF  OIL INSTALLATIONS</H4>

<p>7th December 1995
 

 
<p>A report commissioned by the United Kingdom Offshore Operators'
Association states that the best environmental option for
decommissioned oil installations is to bring them on shore for
recycling.
 
<p>The report - entitled "An Assessment of the Environmental Impacts
of Decommissioning Options For Oil and Gas Structures in the UK
North Sea"- was  written by AURIS Environmental  and was
commissioned by UKOOA. After months of delay the report was
published last week.
 
<p>The report clearly states that the best option for the
environment is to bring structures onshore.  For the topsides of
structures (living and workers quarters) the report states
"...returning material to the shore for recycling and disposal
would be an attractive option. It removes potentially harmful
material from the sea, eliminates a source of debris, and derives
some benefit from the recycling of material and saving energy."
(page 10-24)
 
<p> For Steel jackets (the steel structures) the "total removal and
return to the shore for recycling is the best option". (page
10-24).
 
<p>For concrete gravity bases - of which there are only nine out of
150 in the UK sector - the report recommends leaving the base "in
situ".
 
<p>The report findings contradict UKOOA's insistance that
decommissioning of oil platforms should be done on a "case by
case" basis. Instead, the report supports the view that the
problem of decommissioning is best done from a "global North Sea
view".
 
<p>Sarah Burton of Greenpeace said "UKOOA have been sitting on this
report since June.  We now know why. This detailed report clearly
contradicts UKOOA views and supports Greenpeace's position that
on shore disposal of oil installation is best for the
environment".

<br>P.O. Box 3, Oban, Argyll, PA34 4AD</H4></head>
<body> 
 
 
<P> Dr Helen Wallace,
<br> Greenpeace,
<br> Canonbury Villas,
<br> London N1 2PN
                                       <P align=left> 28th July 1995
 
 
<P>Dear Dr Wallace,
 
 
<P><B>Brent Spar</B>
 
 
<P>Your letter of 5 July was addressed to Dr Bullock, lately acting
director of the Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory which is the
NERC-controlled part of the Laboratory, and whose research
programme shares the same building and facilities as that
operated by the grant-aided Scottish Association of Marine
Science, SAMS (formerly the Scottish Marine Biological
Association, SMBA). In view of our long-standing research
experience of ecosystems in the Rockall Trough area, your letter
was passed to Dr Gordon and myself (both of us are in SAMS) to
answer. 
 
<P>May we first thank you on behalf of SAMS for your letter and the
useful enclosures. We would also like to say that we welcome the
tone of the letter. This to our mind represents a considerable
advance on the emotive tone of previous statements from
Greenpeace on this subject as reported in the Press. We also much
welcome your aim of contacting scientists directly in order to
make available information and arguments on which Greenpeace
based their decision to mount the spectacularly successful
campaign to stop the dumping of Brent Spar. 
 
<P>We agree that the scientific debate should continue and that
information, both that available and that presently not in the
public domain (the "detailed" survey undertaken by Shell Expro
and SOAFD "to confirm the 'suitability' of the potential disposal
sites and to provide baseline data environmental data for future
monitoring programmes"), should be openly discussed. 
 
<P>We should like to express broad agreement with the "facts" listed
(i) to (vi) justifying Greenpeace's actions. We might add that
scientists at SAMS with by far the greatest experience of
deep-sea ecosystems in the Rockall Trough area (which of course
includes the North Feni Ridge - see p. 18 of <a href="Bpe-0.html">BPEO Assessment</a>)
were never consulted for information. (For your information we
enclose our abbreviated cvs together with a copy of the large
database of publications recorded largely by Dr John Mauchline,
just retired from SAMS, that are related to the biology of the
Rockall Trough authored by SAMS staff and others, very often in
collaboration with SAMS people). 
 
<P>We would also like to point out additional deficiencies in both
the 
Brent Spar Abandonment BPEO report that you copied to us, and the
<a href="bshyp.html">Brent Spar Abandonment Impact Hypothesis report</a> (both dated
December 1994) as known to us: 
 
<P><li>(a) The assertion in BPEO under 8.3.3 that "the deep ocean
environment supports ... a small range of species". 
 
<P>This is inconsistent with now widely reported data indicating
very high diversity associated with the benthic fauna of the deep
sea sediment. Indeed it is now becoming recognised that the
biodiversity of the smaller invertebrates inhabiting the deep
ocean sediments may rival that of the tropical rain forest (see
Gage & Tyler 1991, Deep-Sea Biology, Cambridge University Press;
Grassle, Maciolek & Blake 1990 in Woodwell (ed.) The Earth in
Transition: Patterns and Processes of Biotic Impoverishment.
Cambridge University Press, New York pp 384-359) 
 
<P>In addition to this, knowledge emerging since the last major
consideration of deep-sea dumping - that of high and medium-level
radioactive waste in the late 1970s/early 1980s has indicated
clearly that a whole range of biological rate processes ranging
from the respiration of microbial communities and individual
animals from fish to larger invertebrate 'megafauna', or the
measured or inferred growth rates of small deep-sea
invertebrates, may be much faster than previously supposed (see
Gage 1991: Biological rate processes in the deep sea. Reviews in
Aquatic Sciences 5: 49-100). Although not stated explicitly in
either of the Reports prepared for Shell Expro, any disposal
option based implicitly on characterization of the deep-sea as
a "low-activity ecosystem" clearly now is highly inappropriate. 
 
<P><li>(b) The statement under 8.3.4 that exploitation of the resources
of the deep ocean (>1,500 m) is limited to laying of submarine
cables and military activities fails to recognise the growth in
deep-water fishing in recent years. 
 
<P>While it is true to say that most of these fisheries take place
at depths down to about 1,200 m there are some targeted fisheries
which go deeper. There is little doubt that orange roughy has
been fished to at least 1,800 m to the west of the British Isles.
The presence of fish like the brotulid, Cataetyx laticeps, on
Lochinver fish market in May of this year is evidence of
continued fishing to 1,500 m or deeper. There is also plenty of
circumstantial evidence for deepwater fishing in international
waters west of the Hatton Bank (Maury Channel) and on the
seamounts of the Mid- Atlantic Ridge. Trawling at depths below
about 1,500 is restricted to vessels with large winches and the
economics of fishing at these depths favour the targeting of high
value species. Static gears such as longlines, bottom gill nets
and traps are much more likely to be used at greater depths where
the fish tend to have a well developed sense of smell and will
be attracted to bait. 
 
There is also a need to question the rather simplistic views on
deep-water fishes embodied in Section 5.3 of the Brent Spar
Abandonment Impact Hypothesis (December 1994). There is ample
evidence that the continental slope west of the British Isles
supports a high biomass and diversity of fish down to about 1,500
m. This biomass could never be supported by the benthic fauna and
studies by SAMS, over the years, have shown the importance of
benthopelagic and pelagic organisms in the diet of these fishes.
This implies a much more efficient transport of food from the
surface than that obtained from 'the downward flow of material
derived from the surface water above (e.g. corpses, faecal
pellets etc)'. The impingement of both the mesopelagic fauna on
the slope is a rich source of food replenished from the surface
by overlapping food-chains and diel vertical migration.     
 
<P>To state that the deeper water fish, living below about 1,500 m
are relatively isolated from those above and to imply some sort
of boundary at 1,500 m is very misleading. There are over 100
bottom living fish species between 500 and 4,000 m west of the
British Isles. Each species has a discrete depth range and in
some species it can be very large. For example, the most
exploited deep-water species west of Scotland is the roundnose
grenadier, Coryphaenoides rupestris. It is mostly exploited
between depths of 700 and 1000 m but its total depth range
extends from about 600 to 1800 m. The most abundant demersal
species west of the British Isles is the cut-throat eel,
Synaphobranchus kaupi, which has a depth range from 400 to 2,450
m. 
 
<P>We finally also question the justification for the three
potential sites. The "North Feni Ridge" site is actually a deep
hole, probably caused by current scouring, at the base of a
seamount, the Rosemary Bank. Seamounts are where some of the
targeted fisheries for species such as orange roughy occur. The
"Rockall Trough" site located south of the Anton Dohrn Seamount,
is very close to one of the main deep-water fishing areas. It is
also an area which has been the subject of investigation by SAMS
for many years. The Maury Channel site is the deepest of the
three, but still close to developing deep-water fisheries in
international waters. The arguments put forward in favour of the
dumping option in the Scotsman (Dr M.V. Angel) and in the recent
Nature editorial (vol. 375, p. 708) referred to abyssal sites.
Slope sites have different characteristics and should be treated
differently. 
 
<P><li>(c) The apparent uninformed consideration in the Brent Spar
Abandonment - Impact Hypothesis report of the effect of likely
mesoscale high-energy events ("benthic storms") at the benthic
boundary on the dispersal and transport of material into the
water column mesoscale processes. 
 
<P>Clearly such processes now need to be taken into consideration
in modelling the dispersal of toxic compounds in deep water. The
claim under 5.2.5. that mean (presumably near-bed) current
velocities were only 1 - 2 cm sec-1 is not particularly useful
in the present context where maximal velocities may be largely
determining potential dispersal. We do not have available to us
the Metocean (1993) report cited under 5.2.5. so we are not able
to assess the quality and appropriateness of the data on which
that report was based. But we would comment that any general
interpretation of relatively quiescent regime is at odds with the
results from numerous long-term current meter time series
undertaken by SAMS (then SMBA), the Institute for Oceanographic
Sciences (IOS) and by MAFF (Lowestoft) at various sites in the
Rockall Trough area. The picture of eddy kinetic energy (KE), the
low-frequency peaks derived from mesoscale eddies in the upper
water column, spun off strong surface flow or by storms, that
emerges from the analysis indicate a very dynamic regime (see
also how these values compare with those recorded elsewhere in
the worked ocean in the summary data from Dickson 1989 enclosed).
It is also curious in view of what we have heard informally of
the results from the SOAFD work for Shell Expro from their
near-bed current meter time series data covering the period from
the field work in 1994 to April 1995. Apparently preliminary
analysis of the data show sustained current peaks at the site
where Brent Spar was to be dumped well over 50 cm sec-1 -
indicative of severe benthic storms. 
 
<P>These comments are based on our own experience of the deep sea.
We would emphasize that our own position is that of scientists
interested in an objective understanding of the deepsea
environment. We are not expressing an opinion on the relative
merits of different options, but we are available for
consultation on the scientific issues concerned. 
 
<P>Yours sincerely,
 
 
<P>John D. Gage,

<FONT SIZE=+0 FACE="MS Serif"><p>The "Atoms for Peace" dream turned out to be a failure. None of its promises have 
been realised. In spite of the massive financial and scientific investments and 
prioritisation above all other energy sources, nuclear power did not solve the energy 
problem. It did not provide the world with an abundant supply of electricity that is  
"too cheap to meter". Ten years after the Chernobyl accident, it has become even 
clearer that nuclear power is an ultimate problem, rather than the ultimate solution. 

<p>Since the very beginning of its existance, Greenpeace campaigned to unveil the 
"Atoms for Peace" myth.  Now Greenpeace is helping to contribute to the realisation 
of a realistic, safe and sustainable alternative that will fulfil all the promises which the 
"Atoms for Peace" deal could not.  This "New Energy Deal" is the only way out of the 
dead end street of the nuclear era. 

<p>The nuclear era was the last phase of the era of the steam engine, in which the 
combustion of wood, coal, oil, gas or the fission of uranium were used to produce 
heat ...to boil water...to create steam ...to generate power. The new energy era 
ahead of us will rest on new materials, new processes and new ways of thinking 
about producing and using energy at home, in the office and in industry. 

<p>Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are the key concepts of the "New 
Energy Deal". The technologies to implement those concepts exist already - they do 
not have to be invented, they are ready -, they use new materials, lightweight metals, 
micro-computers, silicon film, arrays of semi-conductors and new electric filament; 
they run on wind, sunlight, ocean waves and organic gas. These energy sources are 
sutainable because they do not "run out" and they do not pass on a legacy of 
radioactive waste and climate change to future generations.

<p>In addition, many renewable energy applications such as wind power and solar 
thermal are already cheaper than conventional fuels, even though nuclear power and 
fossil fuels have an advantage that their price never reflects their full environmental 
and socio-economic costs. Many of these energy options can be designed, built and 
exploited locally. They have great advantages for national economies because they 
exploit indigenous labour and materials. Nuclear and fossil fuelled mega-power 
stations are the past, energy efficiency and renewables
have the future.

<p>The implementation of the "New Energy Deal" is not a technical or economical 
problem, it is just a question of political willingness.    Greenpeace is actively 
campaigning to convince policy makers of the technical feasability and economic 
viability of a "New Energy Deal" based on energy efficiency and renewables.

<FONT SIZE=+0 FACE="MS Serif">
<p>Russia is currently involved in extensive discussions on the future 
energy strategy for the country. The decline in industry over the 
past 7 years has created a decrease in electricity consumption of 
about 20%. This means that there is now a unique chance to get rid 
of dangerous nuclear power plants, replacing them with energy 
efficiency and renewable energy technology.
<p>There is massive potential for wind power technology in Russia. 
Preliminary studies have shown the following areas in Russia are 
suitable for wind power:
<p>Arhangelsk, Astrahan, Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Kamchatka, 
Leningrad, Magadan, Murmansk, Novosibirsk, Perm, Rostov, 
Sahalin, Tyumen; Dagestan, Kalmykiya, Karelia, Komi, Nenetskii 
autonomous district, Taimyrskii autonomous district, Hakasiya, 
Chukotka, Yakutiya, Yamalo-Nenetskii autonomous district.
<p>Small remote settlements, where the traditional fuel supply is 
expensive and unreliable, have the largest potential for 
economically profitable electricity production using wind 
energy.
<p>In September 1996 a Greenpeace team visited a farmers settlement 
which is not connected to the main electriciy grid. The closest 
power line is 5 km away. The farm is situated in the Gatchina 
District of the Leningrad Region. Although Leningrad region has 
a huge power producing sector and a large electricity network, 
the farmers, Nadezhda Turabova and her husband Veneamin Turabov, 
had to look for a autonomous source of energy. Up until 1996 
they were using car batteries to supply electricity to the farm, 
which had to be carried to the neighbours house once a week to 
be recharged.
<p>On January 25th 1996 they purchased a small windmill to produce 
electricity for their small-holding. It was purchased from a 
local company which is now producing windmills as part of a 
conversion programme to diversify away from Ministry of Defence 
work.
<p>The windmill is quite small with a power output of about 300 Wt. 
It weighs about 40 kilos including the control unit and it was 
installed by 2 people in less than 3 hours.
<p>The farmers are very happy with the windmill. It does not 
disturb them, they have the comfort of knowing that they have a 
reliable source of energy, and they do not have to worry about 
carrying heavy batteries to the neighbours for re-charging.

<P>One of the biggest problems facing the nuclear industry 
is what to do with the radioactive waste that is left 
over after operating a nuclear reactor.   
<P>After the fuel 
rods have finished their life inside a power station they 
become high level waste.   In some countries such as 
Sweden and the United States, the spent fuel rods are 
stored in the form which they come out of the reactor.  
In other countries like Britain, France and Japan, they 
are sent for reprocessing.   Reprocessing not only makes 
this high level waste more difficult to handle, it also 
creates much larger volumes of all types of waste. 

<P>The nuclear industry has had almost 50 years to find a 
solution to the nuclear waste problem and has failed to 
do so.  

<P><B>Given the global radioactive waste crisis, Greenpeace believes that no more nuclear waste should be produced 
anywhere in the world.

<B>Dismantling Nuclear Power Stations </B>

<p>Large quantities of nuclear waste are produced when a nuclear reactor is shutdown.  
This is because many of its component parts, including the fuel, have become 
radioactive.  They cannot simply be thrown away. The process of dealing with the power 
station at this point is called "decommissioning". Apart from removing the used fuel, 
however, there is not a clear agreement about what should happen next...

July 1945, the five nuclear weapons states, the United 
States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China have 
conducted over 2,000 tests.  Every test, costing up to 
$70 million each, helped to add new generations of 
weapons to arsenals of the nuclear states.

the entry-into-force list need to have ratified the 
treaty before the end of April 1998.

<B><P>‘Even if one disregards the fissile material from nuclear

<P>Throughout the nuclear age, the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons has depended on the spread of 'dual use' nuclear 
technologies and materials.  Despite the close 
relationship between civil nuclear technology and 
materials and nuclear weapons proliferation, the 
production of nuclear weapons usable plutonium will soon 
increase beyond the levels produced during the entire 
cold war.

<P><B>World Nuclear Arsenals 1996:</B>

<P>At the beginning of 1996, there were some 21,000 
operational nuclear weapons in the world. Divided among 
six countries, nearly 95 percent of the world's nuclear 
weapons are in the possession of the U.S. and Russia. 

<P>Half a decade after the ending of the Cold War, none of 
the nuclear powers display any willingness to give up 
their nuclear arsenals. Instead, all are consolidating 
their nuclear forces at lower levels, adjusting their 
nuclear strategies to new post-Cold War missions, and all 
continue to modernise their nuclear forces. 

<P><B>Greenpeace believes that all nuclear weapons production, 
modernisation and deployment should be halted 
immediately.  Greenpeace also believes that there must be 
an agreement on a timeline to achieve zero nuclear 
weapons.

<P>Nuclear waste is produced at every stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining 
to reactors to the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel.  Much of this nuclear waste will 
remain hazardous for thousands of years, leaving a poisonous legacy to future 
generations.  

<p>Dangerous radioactive isotopes such as caesium, strontium, iodine, krypton and 
plutonium are created when operating a nuclear reactor. Plutonium is particularly 
dangerous in that it can be used in nuclear weapons if it is separated from the irradiated 
nuclear fuel in a chemical treatment called reprocessing.

<B> ANTI-NUCLEAR REFERENDUM IN KRASNOYARSK REGION
 </B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>Moscow 10th December, 1996 - </B>         
 
<p>Today Greenpeace announced that the
Krasnoyarsk Regional Electoral Committee issued a certificate of
registration for an initiative group to prepare a referendum in
the region.  This referendum will decide the future of the RT-2
plant for spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, located in
Zheleznogorsk city (Krasnoyarsk region). The initiative group,
founded with the participation of Greenpeace activists, will
have to collect no less than 50 thousand signatures to initiate
the referendum.
 
<p>The construction of RT-2 started in 1984, but was stopped in
1990. It was designed for reprocessing spent fuel from VVER-1000
design nuclear reactors.  The plant is only 30 per cent
constructed. At present there is only a storage facility for
6000 tonnes of spent fuel (per uranium) being utilised.
Completion of the construction will require an additional 2-4
milliard dollars.
 
<p>Reprocessing is dirty and dangerous.  There are two major
reprocessing factories in western Europe, one at La Hague in
France and the second at Sellafield in the UK, and in the areas
surrounding these plants the rate of leukaemia among children
has been estimated to be between 2-10 times higher than the
national averages.
 
<p>A Feasibility Study by the State Ecological Expertise at the
RT-2 plant has shown that the project has not been thoroughly
developed. For instance, the main technological equipment is
planned to be constructed and subsequently revised.  Some of
radioactive waste - which contains tritium - is supposed to be
pumped down into the earth at the "Severnyj" area for 30 years.
The authors of the feasibility study have not dared to forecast
the consequences of such activity. These envisaged safety
measures will not prevent radioactive elements from entering the
environment.
 
<p>In case of the positive outcome at the referendum, MinAtom (the
Ministry of Atomic Energy) plans to complete construction of the
RT-2 construction would be finally buried.  Moreover, this could
be the first step to blocking future dangerous plans of MinAtom
for developing a new direction in nuclear power technology -
construction of reactors which use mixed uranium plutonium fuel.
 
<p><B>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

<P> Ivan Blokov,
Evgenij Usov: Greenpeace Russia: 251-90-73, 978-39-50, 
 
<p>Additional Information</B>
 
<p>MinAtom has made several attempts to resume construction at the
RT-2 plant, but failed so because of insufficient financing.
Therefore MinAtom was prepared to sign an agreement on taking
nuclear waste  from foreign nuclear power plants in order to
raise funds.
 
<p>Under pressure from MinAtom the President of the Russian
Federation signed a Decree (1995), permitting the import of
spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants for storage and so
called "reprocessing". Later the term "storage" was changed to
"temporary storage for future reprocessing", for the Decree to
be in accordance with the Law. A number of provisions in the
Decree contradicted the Nature Protection Law of the RF and
allowed this ecologically hazardous activity. Greenpeace filed

an action at the Supreme Court of Russia to cancel the
provisions which permit the import of spent fuel from foreign
reactors to the Krasnoyarsk Mill. In 1996 the Supreme Court
agreed to Greenpeace's claim.

 <p><B>Are we about to witness the beginning of the end of nuclear power in Russia?</B>
<p>On December 8th, the people of Kostroma  cast their votes in the first ever regional referendum on nuclear power in Russia.   This could be the start of a series of similar referendums around the country which will destroy 
     any future plans for this dangerous, polluting technology.

<p>When communities in western Europe have been asked about nuclear 
     power, many have said no to new reactors. National referenda have 
     stopped nuclear power programmes in Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and 
     Italy.  While in Asia, Japanese and Taiwanese residents have also 
     voted overwhelming against new reactors in regional referenda.
     Finally a Russian community is being given the opportunity to say no 
     to a reactor being built on it's doorstep.   On December 8th, the 
     people of Kostroma will cast their votes in the first ever regional 
     referendum on nuclear power in Russia.   This could be the start of a 
     series of similar referendums around the country which will destroy 
     any future plans for this dangerous, polluting technology.
     
     <p>Historically, the nuclear industry in Russia, and throughout the rest 
     of the world, has been shrouded in secrecy.  The global population 
     were expected to believe in the `atoms for peace' myth created at the 
     birth of nuclear power in the 1950's.   The technology, born out of 
     the nuclear weapons programmes of certain countries, was not to be 
     questioned. Even today military and civil nuclear programmes are 
     inseparable.  Viktor Mikhailov, once a developer of nuclear weapons 
     and a guardian of their secrets, is now head of the Russian Ministry 
     of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) with control over the country's entire 
     nuclear power and plutonium production complexes.
     
     <p>The nuclear industry has had almost 50 years to prove that nuclear 
     technology is safe, clean and cheap, but has failed to do so.  Instead 
     it has proven that the technology is dirty, dangerous and expensive, 
     and poses a very real threat to human life. As the true environmental, 
     health and economic costs of nuclear power have come to light there 
     has been a steady decline in the fortunes of the nuclear industry 
     around the world.  This decline started in the United States in the 
     1970's and resulted in the cancellation of over 120 nuclear power 
     plants!   It was followed by moratoriums on the expansion of nuclear 
     programmes and the cancellation of new reactor orders throughout 
     western Europe.   Today France is only western European country with 
     any reactors under construction.
     
     <p>Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are the key to future 
     sustainable development.  Renewable energy technology already exists - 
     it does not have to be invented - it is ready to use.    This 
     technology runs on natural resources which will not "run out", such as 
     wind, sunlight, ocean waves and organic gas.  It does not pollute the 
     environment and will not pass on a legacy of radioactive 
     contamination, nuclear waste and climate change to future generations.
     
    <p> In Russia the potential for energy saving measures to be adopted is 
     huge.  According to estimates developed by the Institute of Energy 
     Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, energy conservation 
     potential ranges as high as 40-45% of the country's present energy 
     consumption.  In addition to this, the `Innovation Investment 
     Programme for Energy Conservation in Russia' has highlighted the fact 
     that by implementing energy efficiency measures, up to 3 times the 
     current nuclear power output could be saved.
     
     <p>Nuclear power is the technology of the past, energy efficiency and 
     renewables have the future to look forward to.  The people of Kostroma 
     have helped to build a clean, bright future for their community by voting 
     no to a nuclear power plant.

<B>THE PEOPLE OF KOSTROMA REJECT NUCLEAR POWER IN FIRST EVER
REGIONAL REFERENDUM HELD IN RUSSIA</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>KOSTROMA, Dec 9th, 1996 - </B>

 
<p>Today in the Kostroma Region of
Russia, situated 400 km to the north-east of Moscow, history was
being made as the preliminary results of the first ever regional
referendum were announced.  The local population voted
overwhelmingly against the construction of a nuclear power plant.


 
<p>This referendum, permitted under the Russian Constitution
adopted in 1993, is now legally binding and the decision can

only be changed by a further referendum.
 
<p>"This clearly shows that when people are given a choice they
dont want to live with nuclear power". said Eduard Gismatullin
of Greenpeace Russia "The people of Kostroma dont want the
threat of a Chernobyl accident on their doorstep and they dont
want to live with radioactive contamination in their rivers and
lakes."  
<p>This first historic test case was organised by a local community
action group calling itself 'In The Name of Life'.  The group,
consisting mainly of Kostroma senior citizens, have won an
important battle against the Russian nuclear industry.  The
Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) have plans to construct new
reactors in other regions of Russia, and Greenpeace hopes that
this referendum will now be replicated in those regions to block
those plans. 
 
<p>"This could be the beginning of the end of nuclear power in
Russia.  If other communities follow the example of Kostroma
they can stop the construction of nuclear power plants in their
district."said Gismatullin.  "It is high time to leave this
outdated and dangerous technology in the past, and today's
result provides the hope that this will happen".
 
<p>In fact Russia does not need new nuclear plants with one of it's
greatest potential energy resources being the implementation of
energy efficiency measures. Although estimates vary, many
experts agree that there is massive cost-effective energy
efficiency potential in the country.  The Institute of Energy
Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences estimates the
potential for energy conservation in Russia at 40-45% of the
current level of consumption.
 
<p>The Kostroma referendum is following in the footsteps of others
held in western Europe and Asia where nuclear power has been
halted through through referenda.  In Sweden, Austria,
Switzerland and Italy nuclear power was rejected by national
referenda, while in Japan and Taiwan communities voted against
nuclear power in regional referenda.

<P>NOTES TO EDITOR
<BR>[1] 59% of the regional voting population took part in the
Referendum.  87% voted No (241,000 people), and 10% voted Yes
(29,000 people).</B>

<B>GREENPEACE WELCOMES PERMANENT CLOSURE OF UNIT 1 OF CHERNOBYL BUT CALLS FOR COMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE NUCLEAR POWER COMPLEX</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>KIEV, Nov 30, 1996 - </B>Greenpeace  welcomed the closure today of one of  
the three remaining units of the  infamous Chernobyl nuclear power  

complex, but called for the immediate  closure of other operating unit 
because  of the danger of another major nuclear  accident.
 
<p>"These reactors are the same basic  design as Chernobyl's unit 4 which  
produced the world's worst nuclear  accident, it is totally unacceptable to  
allow them to continue operating," said  Greenpeace Ukraine's 
spokesperson  Alexey Pasyuk said.
 

<p>Unit 1 was finally closed today,  implementing a decision of the   
Ukrainian government taken in Moscow at  the G7 meeting in April.  
The decomissioning of the plant is  being funded by the G7 through a  
Memorandum of Understanding with the  Ukrainian government.
 
<p>However Chernobyl unit 3 will continue  to operate until the year 2000. 
Both  units are RBMK reactors with the same  technical deficiency as 
Chernobyl unit  4 where the world's worst nuclear  accident took place in 
1986. (Ukraine  has agreed not restart Chernobyl's unit  2 which was 
shut down in 1991 after a  fire).
 
<p>Unit 3 has a joint wall with the  shelter over the ruined unit 4 and  
experts warn that no serious work can  be done to make the sarcophagus 
over  unit 4 safer before unit 3 is also  closed. 
 
<p>"Chernobyl Unit 3 produces only 1% of  Ukraine's energy, while about 
40% of  energy produced in Ukraine is lost  through inefficiency," 
Pasyuk said. 
 
<p>"For any product to be produced in  Ukraine it requires at least 3 times  
more energy than in Western Europe,"  Pasyuk said. "It is obvious energy  
efficiency, and not nuclear power  developments, is the answer to the  
Ukraine's energy needs both on safety  and economic grounds"
 
<p>The Ukrainian government plans to  complete two more Soviet designed   
reactors at Rovno and at Khmelnitsky.  Greenpeace is calling the 
Western  investment of approximately $1 billion  to be directed away 
from the nuclear  reactors towards energy efficiency and  alternative 
energy production projects. 

<br><B><p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

<p> Alexey  Pasyuk on 380-
44-244 3847 IN KIEV

step. <A HREF="holebg.html">Ozone depletion</A> had been recognized as the world's first truly global
environmental problem.  As such, the preservation of the ozone layer - and the
life on earth that depends on it-  would require the unprecedented cooperation
of nations for their common good.  Self interest, and self preservation were
redefined as synonymous with global interests, and nations of the world were
forced to see themselves more clearly than ever before as a common community.  
 Ten years later much progress has been made, but the final outcome is still
unclear.  In 1987 the largely toothless Vienna Convention became the Montreal
Protocol, which has served as the mechanism to encourage and enforce global
phaseout of ozone depleting substances.  Amended several times since 1987, the
Protocol has been widely hailed as the solution to the ozone crisis. On the
paper of the Montreal Protocol, the world is safe.

 In practice though, the ozone layer and the planet are still in grave danger.
The truth is that the Montreal Protocol, as it is currently constructed, will
not save the ozone layer.  The success of the Protocol depends, as this paper
shows, on a series of assumptions, or "IFS", that are questionable at best, and
demonstratably unrealistic at worst.

for the environment.  The transport sector is responsible for  22%  of the
world's greenhouse gas emissions,  and cars  contribute  80% of this. We
must reduce the ecological impact of the global car culture upon our
biosphere. Car manufacturers have until now failed to take even the first
step in the right direction - that is  the production of the most efficient
vehicle possible using existing technology.
</P>

<P>
Greenpeace has taken that first step by producing the SmILE, a modified
Renault Twingo, which is almost 50% more efficient than its conventional
counterpart and other cars of similar size.

environmental organization - is seemingly promoting a car technology,
called the SmILE Concept, in order to protect the environment.

<BR CLEAR=All>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>FORWARD IN CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS AS  SIGNS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BECOME EVIDENT</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>'One Small Step for the Global Climate, One Giant Leap for Mankind'</H3>


<P>
The Second Conference Of The Parties U.N.  Framework Convention On Climate
Change (FCCC) wrapped up in Geneva on July 19, 1996 as one hundred and
thirty four governments adopted a
Ministerial Declaration that committed themselves to the negotiation of
"legally binding" greenhouse gas targets aimed  at "substantial overall"
reductions for industrialized
countries by the end of 1997.  They also said that the continued increase
in greenhouse gas concentrations would lead to "dangerous" climate change.
</P>

<P>
Based on the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change
(IPCC SAR) the Ministers have found that "The continued rise of greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere will lead to dangerous interference
with the climate system, given the serious risk of an increase in
temperature and particularly the very high rate of  temperature change".
</P>

<P>
The IPCC is  the pre-eminent international UN body for assessing the
science and impacts of climate change.  Established in 1988 under both the
United Nationís World Meteorological Organization and the United Nationís
Environment Programme, the IPCC released its First Assessment Report in
1990.  The release of the 1990 assessment led to the negotiation and
signing of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992.
</P>

<P>
The IPCC SAR is the follow up assessment to IPCC s First Assessment report
published in 1990.   Over 2,500 climate change experts were involved in the
current assessment of IPCC. The IPCC Second Assessment Report strengthens
and extends its1990 warnings over the adverse consequences of climate
change.  The highlight of the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC is the
critical new conclusion that the signs of climate change are already
becoming evident, and that
"the balance of evidence suggests a discernable human influence on global
climate."
</P>

<P>
Despite the IPPCC's sombre warnings, not all governments are yet willing to
take the responsible measures. For example, aligning itself with the OPEC
countries Australia refused to agree to the paragraph in the declaration
that called for legally binding targets for substantial emission
reductions.  New Zealand placed an economic caveat on its acceptance of
this crucial paragraph.  Fourteen countries rejected the declaration in its
entirety:  Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates,
Syria, Qatar, Jordan, Nigeria, Oman, Bahrain, Yemen, Sudan and the Russia
Federation.
</P>

<P>
Japan failed to exercise real leadership at the meeting  which does not
bode well for its crucial role in Kyoto  next year.
</P>

<P>
 While Greenpeace views the Ministerial Declaration as an important
development in what has been  frustratingly slow negotiations, the
Declaration by itself is insufficient.
</P>

<P>
Specifically, it is disappointing that the Ministers failed to:
</P>


<UL>
<P>
<LI>specify a minimum emission reduction targets for CO2 of 20% by
2005.  the Alliance of Small Island States has called for a this in its
proposed Protocol.
</P>
<P>
<LI>call for urgent action by developed countries to meet their legal
commitments in the climate convention to return their emissions to 1990
levels by the year 2000
</P>
</UL>
<P>
Furthermore, Greenpeace is  concerned  that a statement proposed by the
European Union that global climate temperatures should not be allowed to
exceed 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels was not included. Even this
limit is too weak to prevent dangerous levels of sea-level rise for many
small islands and heavily populated coastal regions of the world.
</P>

<P>
As Ambassador Slade of Western Samoa told the Ministers  ultimately
returning CO2 to near current levels will be necessary to prevent dangerous
levels of sea-level rise.  This would correspond to a tempertature increase
of less  than 1 degree above pre-industrial levels.
</P>

<P>
The Ministerial Declaration adopted only very weak wording on the need for
industrialzed countries to take further action.  Most countries are failing
to meet their legally binding commitment to adopt policies and measure to
bring their emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
</P>

<P>
Greenpeace believes that countries that fail to take sufficient measures
are in breach of their legal obligations under the climate convention.
</P>

<P>
The Ministerial Declaration resulted from a  positive step forward by the
United States, which  after years of obstruction, called for legally
binding targets. The Ministerial Declaration's significance is that it
calls for  "legally binding" emission obligations for "significant overall"
emission reductions.  This  provides very strong  direction to the final
stage of the Berlin Mandate and lead up  to the Third Conference of the
Parties (COP-3) in Kyoto, Japan in 1997.
</P>

<P>
 The Ministerial Declaration came none too soon. The dangers  climate
change caused by human induced global warming were highlighted reports
Greenpeace released at the Geneva meeting:

	</P>
	
</UL>

<P>
The Ministerial Declaration is all the more significant as the powerful
lobby of  oil producing nations and the fossil fuel industry campaigned
vigorously to discredit the science of climate change, the IPPCC, and to
frustrate any action on reducing greenhouse gases.  In the report 'The
Scourge of the Skeptics - Industry Attacks on the IPCC Second Assessment
Report',   Greenpeace exposed the political agenda of the global fossil
fuel lobby and its financial sponsorship of  scientific skeptics of climate
change.
</P>

<P>
The positive step taken at COP-2 must now be translated into concrete
action on the part of the world's governments. World leaders, leading up to
the Third Conference of the Parties in 1997, will come under extreme
pressure from oil producing countries and the fossil fuel industry to
retreat from the Ministerial Declaration and to do little or nothing in
terms of legally binding controls on CO2 emissions.
</P>

<P>
Only  persistent demands for effective controls on greenhouse gas emissions
by the public will ensure that governments will not buckle under this
pressure. A failure on the part of governments to agree to  "legally
binding" emission obligations for "significant overall" emission reductions
at COP-3 in Kyoto, will have disastrous effects on present and future
generations. We must not allow that to happen.

<H2>The Conference</H2>

<P>Experts from around the world are converging in Canberra, Australia from
September 23 to 24 for a major event; The Greenpeace International and
Australian Medical Association Conference on  Climate Change and Human
Health in the Asia-Pacific. 
The health impacts of climate change are emerging as a significant
international issue. The conference will provide a peak forum for
scientists, policy makers, environmentalists and leaders in the health
sector to debate the implications of human-induced climate change for human
health and their relevance to the health sector. Guest Speakers include:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Professor Anthony McMichael</B> - 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Professor Paul Epstein</B> - 
Harvard Medical School</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Professor Alistair Woodward</B> - 
Wellington School of Medicine</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Dr. Charles Guest</B> - 
Australian National University</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Professor Peter Curson</B> - 
Climate Impacts Centre,
Macquarie University</P>

<H2>Convention Theme</H2>

<P>Climate change caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases is emerging as
one of the critical environmental issues of the 21st century. The human
health implications of current and projected changes in global climate is
however a relatively new field of enquiry. The United Nation's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently conducted the
first globally comprehensive assessment of climate change and human health
and concluded that climate change is likely to have wide-ranging and mostly adverse impacts on human health, with significant loss of life </P>

<P>The principal aim of the conference is to create discussion on the health
impacts of climate change and to improve understanding of the nature and
magnitude of the health impacts of climate change in the researchers, the
health sector, government, non-governmental organisations and the media.
The conference will pursue two main themes. Firstly, internationally and
regionally recognised experts will present the latest scientific findings on
the potential health impacts of climate change. Secondly, health sector
leaders, environmentalists, and climate change policy experts will discuss

<TITLE>Cimate Time Bomb - 1994 Update</TITLE>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="update94.gif" ALT="1994 Update">
</P>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

    <P>
Greenpeace has produced the first-ever catalogue of recent record climatic 
events around the world. It covers the period since the release of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) First Assessment report 
in 1990.  The <A HREF="index.html">Climate Time Bomb catalogue</A>, including this Update, records 
droughts, floods, record storms and other climate related extreme events 
from 1990 to early 1995.  
    <P>
Whilst no single extreme event, nor sequence of events, can  be attributed to 
the greenhouse effect, Greenpeace believes that the totality of the planet's 
climatic experience since 1990, indicates that the first footprint of climate 
change  as a result of the human-enhanced greenhouse effect is now 
becoming clear. We are not alone in this view. The respected Enquete 
Commission (the German Bundestag's  advisory body on climate change) 
stated in its 1992 report  that 'Our planet is already warming at an 
increasing rate. The first signs of climate change are already measurable and 
noticeable. Hence there is no reason any more to delay  urgently required 
actions.'
    <P>
On the scientific front, in 1994, the IPCC concluded that stabilisation of  
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations  can be  attained only with global 
human-induced emissions  that  eventually drop to substantially below 1990 
levels.  
    <P>
Further, it concluded that  'Perhaps the most important result ... is that 
stabilization of [CO2] emissions does not lead to stabilisation of CO2 
concentration; in fact, the calculations show that concentrations continue to 
increase slowly for at least several centuries.'
    <P>
The 1994 IPCC report also warned that a 'positive feedback' between rising 
temperature and CO2 levels is likely, with future greenhouse gas induced 
warming possibly triggering further, very large releases of CO2 and methane 
to the atmosphere: A clear correlation between atmospheric CO2 
concentration and global temperature (especially during warming periods) is 
evident from the Ice-core records.  
    <P>
The following are extracts of reports linking  warming trends, with melting 
ice, drought, floods and disease during 1994/95:
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Indian plague due to climate change?</B></I>
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8 SRC="../solar_rev/srboy.gif" ALT="Young Boy">
In November 1994, Professor Paul Epstein, of the Harvard School  of Public 
Health's working group on new disease wrote to  the New York Times 
associating the unusually hot, wet climatic conditions which prevailed at the 
time with the  outbreak of pneumonic plague in India in September.  Epstein  
pointed out that the Indian plague is part of a larger pattern of disease 
emergence and resurgence world-wide, which may be linked to climate 
change, and considers that  climate change may be liberating pests and 
pathogens from  ecological controls and predation.  'Rodents and insects 
carry no passports,' wrote Epstein.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Temperature rise suits malaria </B></I>
    <P>
The medical journal, the Lancet, reported in March that the temperature 
between 1961 and 1990 increased greatly, and in  the late 1980's, malaria 
became established in areas where it was previously absent or rare. 
Nationally, cases rose by  266 percent. Considerable mortality in previously 
unexposed populations is likely.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Global temperatures continue to rise</B></I>
    <P>
In 1994, recent figures show that, global temperature was the third or 
fourth highest  on record.  In Canada research showed that the permafrost  
has warmed appreciably, resulting in many areas now close to thawing point. 
In other areas, thawing has already  begun. Some researchers reported that 
during the last 26 years, the southern limit of the permafrost region has  
moved 120 km north.  
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Antarctic ice melts</B></I>
    <P>
    <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 SRC="../solar_rev/srpeng.gif" ALT="Adelie Penguin">
 Recent reports indicate a melting of sea ice around the Antarctic Peninsula, 
an observation which is suspected to be  the cause of the decline in Adelie 
penguins which rely on  the ice for shelter and survival. Almost every ice 
sheet on its coast is shrinking, as warmer summer temperatures melt the 
continents frozen wilderness. Warming of the Arctic permafrost is also 
pronounced.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Warming oceans kill coral</B></I>
    <P>
In the Pacific, high sea temperatures were linked with unprecedented mass 
coral bleaching.
    <P>
    <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8 SRC="../solar_rev/srcoral.gif" ALT="Bleached Coral">
Spanish and American researchers reported that the deep ocean, at a depth 
of 800-2500 metres, in the Atlantic Ocean  between Europe and the 
Caribbean warmed by a third of a degree in the last 35 years. The warming 
is  surprisingly deep, but is consistent with climate model projections, as well 
as observations from the Pacific and  Southern Oceans, and the 
Mediterranean Sea reported in 1993.  
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Glaciers retreat</B></I>
    <P>
In Switzerland, scientists claim that the retreat of glaciers gives a clear signal 
that the climate is changing. The retreat of mountain glaciers is striking all 
over the world. 
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Australia and New Zealand bake</B></I>
    <P>
1994 and 1995 saw widespread floods and droughts and associated forest or 
bush fires. During the Southern Hemisphere winter, New Zealand suffered 
the worst drought in living memory.
    <P>
In Australia, the fourth consecutive year of drought drastically affected 
production of wheat, canola, barley, cotton, oilseeds and sorghum, prompting 
dire warnings of huge economic losses.  'It's not an intermittent disaster. It's 
coming now quite regularly with climate change effects,' Prime Minister Paul 
Keating said of the droughts. 
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Fires and heatwaves across Europe</B></I>
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 SRC="../solar_rev/srtree.gif" ALT="Dead Tree">
The 1994 Northern Hemisphere summer saw a record heatwave right across 
Europe, the hottest and sunniest on record in most places from the 
Netherlands to Hungary and Poland. It caused widespread forest fires across 
Spain and the western US; rail tracks to bend in the Czech Republic; and algal 
blooms off the German Coast. The then German Environment Minister Klaus 
Toepfer blamed climate change. Japan suffered its hottest day in history.    
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../solar_rev/sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Europe hit by floods</B></I>
    <P>
For the second time in two years, in January 1995 Europe was  struck by a 
'hundred year' flood, resulting in the evacuation of 250,000 Dutch people 
and costing billions of  US dollars.  IPCC climate experts rejected claims that 
the  flood was caused by agricultural practices.  Instead, experts claim, it was 
caused by the unusually lengthy rainfall.  
   <P> 
Pier Vellinga from the IPCC said that though the floods  were not proof of 
climate change, they were consistent with  the projections of general 
circulation models (GCMs).

<P>
The greenhouse effect has been described, by the US Vice President Al Gore, as
the potentially most dangerous environmental problem facing mankind, with
consequences second only to nuclear war.
<P>
The greenhouse effect can be visualized as follows: Imagine that Earth has been
encircled by a giant glass sphere. The heat of the sun penetrates through the
glass. Some of the heat is absorbed by the Earth, and some of it is radiated back
towards space. The radiated heat reaches the glass sphere and is prevented from
dispersing any further.
<P>
Similarly, the earth is surrounded by a blanket of gases. This blanket traps
energy in the atmosphere, much the same way as glass traps heat inside a
greenhouse. This results in an accumulation of energy, and the overall warming of
the atmosphere. The 'greenhouse effect' is the popular expression for the above
process.
<P>
Global warming and climate change result from the greenhouse effect. The
consequences of global warming and climate change could well include:

2. WHAT WILL CLIMATE CHANGE LEAD TO? </A></B>
<P>
Climate models show that atmospheric temperatures will increase by between 1.5
and 4.5 C by the year 2100 if a "wait and see and do nothing" approach is
adopted. The global temperature increase since the last ice age (10,000 years
ago) has been about 5 C.
<P>
This may not sound like much, but such drastic temperature rise would be
unprecedented for modern civilization, both in terms of its intensity and its
rate of increase. It is projected to have drastic social, economic and ecological
implications of unpredictable dimensions:

<A NAME="Z3"><B><A NAME="q3">3. DOES THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT OCCUR NATURALLY?</A></B></A>
<P>
Yes, it does. The greenhouse effect is a natural process which made life on Earth
possible. Without naturally occurring greenhouse gases such as water vapour,
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, the Earth's surface temperature would
be 33 degrees Celsius cooler - a chilly -18 C rather than the tolerable 15 C.
<P>
However, since the beginning of industrialization, 200 years ago, concentrations
of these gases have increased substantially . It is estimated that the Earth's
average temperature has risen by 0.5 to 0.6 degrees C since 1880 because of
emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity.
<P>
The main sources of these emissions--particularly carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrous oxide --are the combustion of large amounts of fossil fuels in the energy
and transport sectors, deforestation and the use of intensive farming methods.
<P>
When we talk about the greenhouse effect we mean the ENHANCED effect which is
caused by the increase of greenhouse gases from human sources.

<B><A NAME="q4"> 4. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT, GLOBAL 
WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE?</A></B>
<P>
These terms are often used to describe the same problem, but actually relate to
cause and effect, or problem and consequence. The greenhouse effect is the cause
- and global warming and climate change are the consequences.
<P>
The greenhouse effect causes an accumulation of heat (or energy) in the Earth's
atmosphere. The global climate must then adjust to deal with that extra
accumulation of energy, and these adjustments result in global warming and
climate changes.
<P>
Global warming results from an increase in the temperature of the Earth's lower
atmosphere. Climate changes result from alterations to regional climatic events
such as rainfall patterns, evaporation and cloud formation.

<A NAME="Z1"><B><A NAME="q5">5. WHAT CAUSES THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT?</A></B></A>
<P>
The greenhouse effect is caused by gases in the atmosphere which have the ability
to absorb the sun's energy that is usually radiated back into space from Earth.
Energy from the sun comes into the earth as short-wave radiation; some is
absorbed and some is radiated back as long-wave radiation. The 'greenhouse gases'
allow the short-wave radiation to pass through to Earth but absorb the long-wave
radiation that is reflected back to space. These gases include naturally
occurring gases - primarily water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides
- as well as industrial chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
<P>
The problem is that human activities have increased the atmospheric concentration
of these gases well beyond their natural levels, and have introduced new
greenhouse gases, such as CFCs. This in turn is throwing the natural climatic
systems off balance.
<P>
One of the major greenhouse gases from human sources is carbon dioxide (CO2).
While CO2 is naturally occurring, its concentration in the atmosphere is rapidly
increasing because of the burning of the fossil fuels- oil, coal and gas.
<P>
Human activity is not only producing more CO2, but is also severely damaging the
ability of the earth to absorb carbon - via its carbon sinks - the forests and
oceanic plankton. Growing forests absorb CO2. Massive worldwide forest
destruction results in much fewer trees to soak up CO2, and releases the stored
CO2 from the trees into the atmosphere.
<P>
Similarly, the destruction of the ozone layer by human-made chemicals, such as
CFCs, is allowing increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation to reach the surface
of the earth. Increased levels of UV-B radiation could reduce the density of
plankton in the oceans. Since plankton are the primary carbon sink of the planet,
reduction in their density could result in less CO2 being absorbed from the
atmosphere.
<P>
Damage to the planet's carbon sinks, through deforestation and ozone layer
depletion, thus makes a direct contribution to the enhanced greenhouse effect.

<B><A NAME="q6">6.</A> <A NAME="Z4">HOW</A> <A NAME="Z5">CAN</A> <A NAME="Z6">RELATIVELY</A> LITTLE CO2 EMITTED BY HUMANS MAKE A DIFFERENCE ?
</B>
<P>
There is an important difference between the CO2 produced by nature and that
emitted by human activities. While nature produces about 30 times more CO2 than
human activity, the carbon emitted by nature is part of a finely balanced cycle.
The emissions by humans are over and above the natural balance, and consequently
result in a net increase in the concentrations of atmospheric CO2.
<P>
Since the industrial revolution about 850 billion tonnes of CO2 have been emitted
due to combustion of fossil fuels, oil, coal and natural gas. An additional 370
billion tonnes have been added through changes in land use and deforestation.
<P>
Every year humans emit around 25 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, which
equals approximately 48,000 tonnes every minute.
<P>
Some estimates show that a reservoir of 37, 000 billion tonnes of CO2 is buried
in the ground as oil, coal and gas. The largest portion of this CO2 reservoir is
in coal, and the second largest is in natural gas. This is a chilling reminder of
what is in store for the planet, should we decide to continue to burn fossil
fuels without any restrictions. Experts estimate that emission of 2,500 billion
tonnes of CO2 - a mere 7% of the existing stock of fossil fuels - will result in
a doubling of pre-industrial concentrations of CO2.

<B><A NAME="q7">7. HOW DO WE KNOW THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS A REALITY?</A></B>
<P>
We know that the greenhouse effect is really happening through a number of
sources:
<P>
<UL>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> First, the fact that some gases have the ability of trapping heat is based on
simple physics. No credible scientist questions this fact.
<P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif">  Second, measurements since the mid-fifties have shown that the levels of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are steadily increasing , and that these
increases correspond to industrial emissions of greenhouse gases.
<P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif">  Third, measurements of air trapped in 250, 000 year old ice cores show that: (a)
the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have varied in the past
and these variations have occurred concurrently with temperature changes; and (b)
greenhouse gases have been increasing since pre-industrial times.
<P>
</UL>
Concentrations of CO2 - the most important greenhouse gas emitted by human
activities - is now almost 30% higher than before the industrial revolution, when
the wide scale burning of fossil fuels started. It is estimated that during this
time global temperatures have increased between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees C . Most
experts hold the enhanced greenhouse effect as the most plausible explanation for
this temperature increase.

<P>
In 1988, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World
Meteorological Organization WMO established the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), consisting of more than 300 of the world's leading
experts, to investigate climate change.
<P>
The IPCC concluded, both in 1990 and in 1992, that a doubling of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere will lead to "serious consequences for the world's social,
economic and natural systems".
<P>
Among other things, the IPCC concluded that emissions of greenhouse gases from
human activities contributes to the natural greenhouse effect and will lead to an
additional warming of the atmosphere. The IPCC estimated that a doubling of CO2
would lead to a global warming of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C.

In most scientific circles the issue is no longer whether or not climate change
is a potentially serious problem, but rather, how the problem will develop, what
its effects will be, how these can be best detected, and what measures can be
taken to reduce the damage.
<P>
The media, at times, leaves the impression that scientists are still discussing
whether or not the climate is really changing as a result of emissions of
greenhouse gases. This is not the case. In actuality there is a broad agreement
on this issue among scientists and experts, as represented by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
<P>
No scientific material has ever been presented in scientific fora which
challenges the main conclusions of the IPCC, in spite of the fact that the IPCC
has an open process that invites critical views.

The <A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs208.html">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</A> stated in its 1990 report
that "the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect from
observations is not likely for a decade or more". However, recent events are
leading to an reassessment of that statement by many scientists. Increasing
number of scientists are declaring that the recently observed global warming
trend is not natural and is likely to be linked to the greenhouse effect.
<P>
There are many worrying indicators that something serious is happening:
<UL>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> <A HREF="ctb/risetemp.html">The nine hottest years on record</A> have all occurred since 1980, despite the 2-3

<B><A NAME="q11">11. HOW CAN WE PREDICT CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN WE CAN 'T EVEN PREDICT THE WEATHER ?</A></B>
<P>
It is important to understand the difference between climate and weather.
Climate, essentially means 'average weather'.
<P>
While the details of weather, in a particular region, are hard to predict from
week to week, weather patterns over years, that is the climate, are easier to
identify, understand and predict. The overall system - the climate - is
predictable, even though the details - the day to day weather - are much less
certain.
<P>
For example, while it may be nearly impossible to predict, two months in advance,
what the weather will be like on a given Saturday in Paris, if the month in
question is July, most climate models can correctly predict that it won't snow.

<A NAME="Z10"><B><A NAME="q12">12. WILL ALL THE IMPACTS OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT BE NEGATIVE? </A></B>
</A><P>
The effects of global warming and climate change will not impact the same way
upon every region in the world, or upon all species of life. For example, a
slight temperature increase in some of the colder parts of the world may create
less hostile conditions for human habitation and improve conditions for
agriculture. Similarly, changing rainfall patterns may favour some species over
others.
<P>
However, favourable consequences of the greenhouse effect for some regions or
species does not mitigate its overall negative global impacts. The social,
economic and ecological disruptions brought about by climatic changes worldwide
are projected to greatly outweigh regional benefits.
<P>
The impacts of global warming and climate change could become a source of
increased tension between nations and regions .
<P>
While the developed, industrialized world is responsible for 75% of all CO2
emissions, these impacts will most likely hit hardest upon the poorer,
underdeveloped parts of the world.
<P>
For example, as sea levels rise countries like Bangladesh and Micronesia will
suffer much more from the loss of valuable arable and populated lands, then
European or North American countries, even though in comparison, they will have
emitted only a tiny fraction of the greenhouse gases.
<P>
The effect of drowning coastlines could lead to hundreds of millions of climate
refugees. Where will these refugees go? How will they be cared for? Undoubtedly,
such a catastrophe will seriously exacerbate the already critical refugee problem
in the world.
<P>
A severe disruption of the world's food supplies through floods, droughts, crop
failures and diseases brought about by climate change would trigger famines, wars
and civil disorder in many countries.
<P>
Most human societies - especially subsistence agricultural societies - have
evolved over many centuries by adapting to their present climatic conditions.
Their agriculture, technologies, economies and culture are based on familiar
circumstances. These societies are likely to find climate change, on the scale
and speed predicted for the coming decades, to be very traumatic.
<P>
Similarly, many natural ecosystems will not be able to adjust fast enough to a
rapidly warming world. This could lead to sharp increases in the already alarming
rate of species extinction on the planet.

<A NAME="Z7"><B><A NAME="q13">13. WHAT MUST BE DONE TO REDUCE HUMAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT? </A></B>
</A><P>
The bottom line is that the emissions of greenhouse gases must be reduced. We
must develop industrial practices and means of transportation which are less
dependent on fossil fuels, and ultimately, manage completely without them.
<P>
Since the problem is global, the solutions must be international. The
international community took a first step in 1992 when the Framework Convention
on Climate Change was signed by 167 countries in Rio. The Framework Convention
morally committed industrialized countries to stabilizing their emissions of CO2
by the year 2000 at 1990 levels. However, since the 1990 levels of global CO2
emissions enhanced the greenhouse effect, the 1992 agreement is obviously
inadequate.
<P>
Unfortunately, few, if any, of the industrialized countries will even meet this
weak target. Consequently, the next step must be to make this commitment legally
binding, and to strengthen it through a CO2 Reduction Protocol aimed at meeting
the objectives of the Convention. The minimum goal must be a 20% reduction in CO2
emissions by 2005, based on 1990 levels.
<P>
The industrialized countries have the lion's share of the responsibility for
creating the problem and for finding the solutions. They have developed their
industrial base, and consequently, their higher standards of living, through the
use of vast amounts of fossil fuels. This has resulted in high concentrations of
CO2 in the atmosphere.
<P>
Furthermore, their per capita emissions of CO2 continues to be tens of times
larger than all of the developing countries.
<P>
For example, the United States, the largest single emitter, annually pumps into
the atmosphere approximately 20 tonnes of CO2 per person. With less then 5% of
the world's population, the United States is responsible for 25% of global CO2
emissions. In a comparison, the entire developing world, consisting of more than
100 countries and representing almost 80% of the world's population, is
responsible for approximately the same amount of CO2 emissions.

<A NAME="Z11"><B><A NAME="q14">14. CAN THE WORLD SURVIVE WITHOUT FOSSIL FUELS? WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES? </A></B>
</A><P>
It is becoming apparent that the world may not be able to survive with fossil
fuels. This means that we must develop renewable sources of energy which are
environmentally sustainable. Fortunately, we already posses the technology at
hand to provide clean and reliable sources of energy for meeting human needs.
<P>
Renewable systems include solar photo voltaic power systems, solar hot water
systems, wind turbines, bio-fuel plantations, hydroelectric systems and so on.
These energy sources are sustainable because they never 'run out'.
<P>
Most importantly, many renewable energy sources, such as wind power and solar
thermal, are already cheaper than conventional fuels-- even though the price of
fossil fuels and nuclear power does not reflect their full environmental and
economic costs.
<P>
Many of these renewable energy options can be designed, built, and exploited
locally and at less costs than conventional systems. They contribute
significantly to national economies because they exploit indigenous labour and
materials.
<P>
In rural areas, the most sophisticated solar arrays can provide sufficient
high-quality energy, at a cost lower than power from electricity grids. Solar
power could radically improve the living conditions of the world's poorest
people. Fortunately, the technology is spreading:
<P>
<UL>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> 200,000 solar photo voltaic systems have been installed around the world,
including 37,000 in Mexico, 20,000 in Kenya, 16,000 in Indonesia, 15,000 in
China, 4,500 in Sri Lanka, 4,000 in the Dominican Republic and 1,000 in Brazil.
<P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> In Kenya more rural households obtain their electricity from solar energy than
from the official policy of grid extension.
<P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN=MIDLE SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> In the Dominican Republic, Enersol, a US-based non-governmental organization,
has successfully trained local entrepreneurs to assemble, market, install and
service photo voltaic systems. The program began in 1985 with 6 systems, grew to
a 100 in 1987, more than 1,000 in 1989 and 4,500 in 1994. Since 1992, Enersol has
replicated their successful Dominican program in Honduras and Guatemala and
contributed to projects in Bolivia and Costa Rica. The Solar Electric Light Fund
(SELF) has taken the Enersol model and has established a number of successful
'solar seed' projects around the world.
</UL>
<P>
The European Commission's 'Power for the World Program' (a global photo voltaic
action plan) estimates that providing solar electricity to a billion people in
the developing world would cost $60 billion ($3 billion a year for 20 years).
This is only 3% of annual energy investments in developing countries and less
than 0.5% of current military expenditure.
<P>
Similar solar solutions are also available for industrial applications to supply
reliable grid connected electricity. In the United States, as part of a plan to
develop a 1,000 MW Solar Enterprise Zone in the Nevada desert, ENRON has
announced plans to build a 100 MW solar power station. Such a power station would
be the largest solar operation in the United States, producing enough power for a
city of 100,000 people.
<P>
The world needs a revolution in the use of renewable energy technologies.

<P>
The Greenpeace International Climate Campaign aims to: (a) <A HREF="ctb/intro.html">inform the public</A>
about the seriousness of climate change and global warming; (b) create the
political climate that will <A HREF="ctb/conclusion.html">compel governments to take immediate and effective

conserving energy to meet human needs.
<P>
Greenpeace maintains that: (a) only through public pressure will the politicians
be motivated to deal with this problem in a truly responsible manner; (b) since
the causes and the impacts of climate change are global, the <A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs201.html">solutions must also
be based on international agreements</A>. Consequently, the Greenpeace Climate
Campaign is both national and international.
<P>
The Greenpeace campaign aims to influence national governments to institute
domestic policies that substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to
support the development of environmentally sustainable options, such as renewable
energy generation. The campaign also intervenes in the international arena, for
example at the <A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs250.html">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</A>, to push the
world community towards deep cuts in global CO2 emissions.
<P>
Greenpeace demands that, at the minimum, CO2 reductions in industrialized
countries must be reduced by 20% of 1990 levels, by the year 2005 through a
legally binding <A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs202.html">CO2 Reduction Protocol</A>.
<P>
The Greenpeace Climate Campaign is <A HREF="climatefaq.html#q15">solutions oriented</A>. Greenpeace is working to
shift global energy dependence from environmentally dangerous sources of energy,
such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy, to ecologically sustainable solar energy.

<P>When governmental negotiators assemble in Berlin for the Climate
Summit on
March 28th they will be joined for the first time in four years of
talks by
lobbyists from the financial sector. Hitherto the business lobbyists
have only
been from the oil, coal, auto and chemical industries: the carbon club
as they
are known.

<P>Among the financial institutions represented for the first time will
be Swiss Re,
the world's second biggest reinsurer. Last year, one of Swiss Re's
reports
concluded that human intervention in the natural climatic system could
accelerate global climatic change to such an extent that society may no
longer be
able to adapt quickly enough. Swiss Re board member Rudolf Kellenberg
said in
October 1994 that we are not getting a climatic problem in future. We
have it
now... we need to act now, not later. There is no shortage of
practical
suggestions, especially with regard to a drastic reduction of
greenhouse gases.

<P>This pack highlights one of the most important solutions - power
from the sun. It
seems that the solar energy revolution, which many expected after the
second
oil-price shock, could now belatedly be set to take the stage.

<A NAME="report6"><H2>Climate Summit Fails To Combat Climate Change</H2>

<B>Berlin - 7 April 1995 - </B>Governments at the Climate Summit have failed
to take a major opportunity to cut CO2 emissions by 20% to tackle
climate change, Greenpeace said today, as three Greenpeace
activists ended a 12-day action on a smokestack in Germany.
<P>
The three climbers -- Dan (USA), Erhard and Gero (Germany)-
descended from their platform on the 193m smokestack of a brown
coal-fired power station owned by RWE in Frimmersdorf near Cologne
where they have lived for the past 13 days. 
<P>
In Berlin, the Climate Summit agreed what can only be termed a
"soft mandate" -- which failed to adopt specific reductions, using
words like "quantified limitation and reduction objectives" with
time-frames "such as 2005, 2010 and 2020".
<P>
"The planet needs more than a soft mandate to stop climate change,"
said Dan.
<P>
These definitions are weak.  There is no mention of the words
"targets and timetables" or specific percentage cuts of C02. The
Governments didn't take up the proposal offered by the "front line
states" -- the 36 small island states -- for a way out of climate
change.
They are only willing to include the AOSIS protocol "for
consideration in the process".
<P>
The AOSIS protocol, also known as the "Toronto Target", envisages
as a first step a 20 per cent reduction of CO2 emissions in the
industrialised nations by the year 2005, at 1990 levels. 
<P>
While the European Union in Berlin failed to cut a real deal for
the future of our climate, it did, together with developing
countries, manage to foil attempts by the US, Australia, Canada,
New Zealand and Japan to completely close the door on future CO2
cuts.
<P>
"In terms of combatting climate change, this is nowhere near what
is needed," said Bill Hare of Greenpeace International. "However,
the writing is clearly on the wall for the fossil fuel industry,
despite attempts to subvert the outcome of the two-week
negotiations."
<P>
Greenpeace throws a challenge to the governments of the
industrialized nations to use the next 18 months, the deadline for
the third Climate Summit, to negotiate the cuts in greenhouse gases
necessary to prevent an increase of climate change. 
<P>
"The Berlin summit means that we have lost two precious years on
this issue. Governments have until 1997 to put their rhetoric into
real action. Nobody here questioned the science; but the political
will was absent from these negotiations to listen to it."

<A NAME="report5"><H2>Greenpeace: Kohl Speech Full Of Rethoric And Promises -
US Still Blocking Political Breakthrough In Berlin</H2>

<B>Berlin - 5 April 1995 -</B> German Chancelor Helmut Kohl today at the
Climate Summit in Berlin gave a speech full of rethoric, while the
US continues to threaten the viability of this meeting being a
success, Greenpeace said today.
<P>
"The last chance for rescuing the Climate Summit from failure is
dependent on a political breakthrough, and needs a significant
improvement in the US delegation's attitude," said Bill Hare, of
Greenpeace International in Berlin.
<P>
There are two governments who have the biggest responsibility: the
US and Germany.  The US, at the behest of the fossil fuel industry
the largest producer of CO2, has blocked all mention of C02 reductions
with any real dates included.  And Germany, the Summit's host, must
lead the breakthrough to rescue the meeting while demonstrating at
home with clear action that it seriously backs a clean energy path
to the future.
<P>
Greenpeace called on governments meeting here to heed the very clear
message delivered by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl which, while
rhetorical, indeed stated that industrialised countries must reduce
their emissions of greenhouse gases.
<P>
"There are only two words which we can accept here at this meeting
and they are 'reduction targets'.  "Those reductions must be made by
industrialised countries, who are responsible for 75% of CO2
emissions," said Bill Hare.
<P>
"Kohl must state clearly what cuts need to be made and by when, and
not just support cuts and timetables in a general way. This does not
mean through the nuclear option, nor does it mean a joint
implementation process which allows emissions from industrialised
countries to continue to escalate. We are sick and tired of the
political rhetoric we've been hearing as governments do nothing but
try to get good public mileage out of being here," said Hare.   
<P>
"The future generations and especially the small island nations need
action now -- they cannot wait.  If Chancellor Kohl wants the Berlin
summit to be remembered as a success, strong decision he called for
this morning, his government must meet with the US to rescue this
meeting from political posturing and into a renewable energy future,
with a climate we can live in," said Hare. 
<P>
Meanwhile, three Greenpeace activists spent their tenth day on top
of the smokestack of the German utility RWE in Frimmersdorf near
Cologne. They will remain there until the end of the conference to
remaind delegates in Berlin of the clear need for a Protocol. Such
a protocol should, as a first step must cut CO2 by 20% by the year
2005, in comparison to 1990.

<A NAME="report4"><H2>German Utility Rwe Sues Greenpeace
Amid New Signs Of Climate Change</H2></A>
<H3>...but climbers say RWE should be sued for killing the climate</H3>
 
<B>Frimmersdorf/Berlin - 30 March 1995 - </B>As delegates at the Climate
Conference in Berlin fight over wording, German Utility RWE is suing
Greenpeace's three activists who are still on the company's C02
producing smokestack near Cologne, on grounds of disturbance of the
peace and security. 
  <P>
Meanwhile Greenpeace in Berlin released yet more evidence that
climate change may already be here -- a report showing that there has
been an increase in rain and flooding in Europe and the United States
which is entirely consistent with global warming - and we are likely
to get more of it if C02 emissions are not reduced. 
  <P>
"Not us but RWE should be sued - for its breach of the future
security of the global climate," said activist Dan R. from the USA.
"Given that my country has suffered terrible floods in the past two
years, and this new report says we will see more of them, we demand
that RWE starts talks with Greenpeace about its energy policy here
at the action site at Frimmersdorf."
 <P>
The climbers will stay on the 193m high smokestack of the brown coal
power plant until the end of the Climate Conference on April 7, to
draw attention to power stations worldwide as a major source of
climate killer carbon dioxide (CO2).
  <P>
Observations of records around the world show a general increase in
rainfall which is what climate models projected, says the report
<A HREF="../flood_report/index.html">"Climate Change and River Flooding"</A>, written for Greenpeace by
Professor Pier Vellinga of Amsterdam Free University.  The flooding
report, using existing climate data and computer modelling, finds
evidence that increases in rain and river flow, consistent with
global warming, have already occurred.
  <P>
Northern Europe is likely to experience a 10-20% increase in rainfall
during winter months by 2070.  Indeed, in Bavaria in southern
Germany, rainfall increased by 40% between 1960 and 1990. But while
Northern Europe can expect more floods, arid areas, such as Southern
Europe and North Africa, will probably experience a decrease in
rainfall, the report says. The amount of rainfall in Canada and the
USA has increased by 7.6% from 1891 to 1990 and one study from 14
stations in Germany showed that runoff from rainfall was 26% higher
after 1964 than before, it says.
 <P>
"The prospect of wetter winters and increased flood damage is already
sending ripples through the insurance industry.  The industrialised
world must agree to serious reductions in CO2 to avoid the financial
and human costs of increased flooding," said Bill Hare, head of
Greenpeace International's delegation in Berlin. "Yet the Climate
Summit is still not moving towards serious consideration of the
Alliance of Small Island States' Protocol which proposes
industrialised country C02 cuts of 20% by 2005. Here we see another
sign that climate change has already arrived," he said.

<A NAME="report3"><H2>Midnight Security Attempt To Get Climbers Off Smokestack Fails</H2></A>
<H3>Greenpeace climbers start third day on smokestack</H3>
 
<B>Frimmersdorf, West Germany - 29 March 1995 -</B> A midnight attempt by
Germany utility company RWE's security guards to remove three
Greenpeace activists off their smokestack failed last night. 
  <P>
The three climbers have been 130m up on the brown coal-fired
power station chimney at the Frimmersdorf site near Cologne since
early Monday morning despite snow, rain, hail and force 8 gales. 
At 0030 hrs local time private "cleanup commandos" cordoned off
and secured the area around the smokestack, and climbed it, in
an attempt to reach the platform holding the climbers but stopped
just 2 metres short. 
  <P>
For an hour the three Greenpeace climbers argued that if the RWE
guards came any closer the climbers would go further up the
smokestack and lock themselves to the fixed metal ladder where
the guards would have to remove them.  The discussion with RWE
was documented live by the three climbers and broadcasted. 
  <P>
Greenpeace later checked with local police who knew absolutely
nothing about the RWE security guard actions under the cover of
darkness. 
  <P>
"Just as RWE endangers people through their CO2 emissions, they
tonight endangered the lives of the three non-violent Greenpeace
climbers, who are simply here to remind the world and the
delegates at the Climate Summit of the source of the problem of
climate change," said American Dan R. from the chimney. 
  <P>
"We will carry on our protest against climate killer RWE.  Out
of the Frimmersdorf site alone 14 million tonnes of C02 are
pouring each year." 
  <P>
In the future, RWE plans to neglect the environment by opening
a new brown coal mine, Garzweiler II, and plans to invest
20billion DM (USD 13 billion) in the so-called "modernisation"
of its coal fired power plants.   Ironically it is trying to put
on a good public relations image at the Climate Summit with a
photovoltaic display, but its real money is still pouring into
C02 emissions.
 <P>
Greenpeace demands that the Climate Summit, as a first step,
agrees to developed country C02 cuts of 20% by 2005, as proposed
by the Alliance of Small Island States.

<A NAME="report2"><H2>Greenpeace Climbers Still On Smokestack:
Industrialised Nations Are Climate Killers</H2></A>
 
<B>Berlin - 28 March 1995 - </B>The three Greenpeace activists who spent
their first night up the smokestack of a 2000MW German coal fired
power station today called upon the 175 Governments gathered in
Berlin for the Climate Summit to stop talking, start action, cut
C02 and go solar.
 <P>
The climbers: Erhard S. and Gero L. from Germany and Dan R. from
the United States joined a Greenpeace press conference in
Berlin by satellite from 193m up the smokestack at Frimmersdorf
near Cologne. 
  <P>
"We are up here to bear witness to the source of climate change.
You know what the solutions are," they said to Governments.  "You
have the power to make the fossil fuels part of history and take
us into a solar future. We are staying here until the end of the
Summit - waiting for  you to save us from the climate
catastrophe."
  <P>
Dr Oliver Worm from Greenpeace Germany noted the opening remarks
by German environment minister Angela Merkel.  "According to Mrs
Merkel she is very concerned at the threat to the small island
states from climate change.  She appears to know about the
effects and says that there is no need to wait for further
scientific confirmation of climate change before governments take
action on real reductions. Therefore Germany along with all
developed countries must now cut their own C02 emissions by 20%
by 2005, as the AOSIS Protocol proposes. As the chair of the
Climate Summit, Mrs Merkel is responsible for ensuring that this
meeting adopts the protocol."
  <P>
"The German Government has promised much, done little and, if it
wants to take the role of leadership, must act now."
 <P>
 Recent months have seen the most substantive confirmation to date
that climate change has already begun.  The most alarming
evidence to date is the recent report of a 65 km (40 mile) long
crack in the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica -- according to
scientists probably the first time this has happened in 20,000
years and the result of a 2.5 deg C warming. 
 <P>

"What more evidence do these governments need before they will
face up to taking decisions to cut C02?" asked the activists on
the chimney. "Right now they are only arguing about the rules,
and most are going backwards."
 <P>
Greenpeace endorsed the proposal of a Protocol from the Alliance
of Small Island States (AOSIS), a group of low-lying island
states who stand to lose the most in the face of rising sea
levels.  
 <P>
Some governments' own commitments are the same as this proposal
--cutting C02 20% by 2005 -- some even better, yet there is still
no agreement to even start negotiating such an instrument.
 <P>
Greenpeace looks to the European Union to take a leadership role
in getting a protocol in place.  The EU Council of Environment
Ministers has actually drafted the elements for a negotiating
mandatefor such a protocol, to be agreed by the meeting.
Meanwhile other industrialised countries -- particularly the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, appear
determined to actively block its progress.
  <P>
"It is up to the developed world, which produces 75% of the
world's man-made C02 emissions, to make these cuts, and to help
developing countries make the switch to renewable forms of
energy, such as solar energy," said Kirsty Hamilton of Greenpeace
International.
  <P>
Greenpeace today produced the 1994/95 update of the "Climate Time
Bomb", a catalogue of the latest climatic events since 1990 which
are warnings of what is to come as greenhouse pollution
accelerates.
  <P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> Global temperatures in 1994 were the third warmest on record. 
 <P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> In the North Pacific, 80% of zooplankton, at the bottom of the
marine food chain, have been lost, and scientists point to the
warming of the oceans from climate change as the only possible
explanation.
  <P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif"> Temperatures in Antarctica have risen 2.5 deg C this century.

Scientists fear the crack in the ice shelf, and the huge iceberg
which is double the size of Berlin, is an early warning of much
larger changes to come in Antarctica which could increase
sea-level faster than previously estimated.

<A NAME="report1"><H2>Greenpeace Scales Chimney Of Coalfired C02 Factory</H2></A>
 
<B>Frimmersdorf, Western Germany - 27 March 1995 -</B> On the day before
the start of the Berlin Climate Summit 20 Greenpeace activists
climbed the 190m high chimney of one of Germany's most polluting
coalfired power stations, the RWE brown coal power plant in
Frimmersdorf, near Cologne, Germany.  
 <P>
At least three of the activists (two German, one American) plan
to stay on the chimney throughout the entire two weeks of the
Climate Summit, as a constant reminder to delegates gathered in
Berlin of the real source of the problem of climate change: C02.
  <P>
A total of 80 Greenpeace people are at the site. While stormy
conditions this morning prevent the hanging of a banner to send
a message to delegates: "Stop C02, Go Solar!", they expect to
this to go up later today.
  <P>
"While the climate diplomats from all over the world are talking
in Berlin, we are pointing to the source of most C02:  from the
chimneys of the coal, oil and gas-fired power plants of
industrialised countries," said Bill Hare of Greenpeace
International in Berlin. 
  <P>
The RWE chimney has been chosen by Greenpeace to represent all
the smokestacks of these global warming factories in the 
industrialised world which emit C02 and damage the climate.  The
industrialised countries are responsible for 75% of all C02
emissions worldwide. Coal is the largest source of C02 emissions,
and brown coal is the dirtiest of all.   
  <P>
We are now seeing the surest ever signs of climate change.  A 40
mile (65km) crack has appeared in the Larsen Ice Shelf in the
Antarctic, which scientists say has not happened for the past
20,000 years and is due to a warming of 2.5 degrees.  In the face
of this evidence, Greenpeace demands the delegates in Berlin to
adopt a Protocol which will commit these countries to cut C02 20%
by 2005 at 1990 emission levels.
  <P>
On the RWE site are 14 old brown-coal powered generators with a
total production capacity of 12 billion kilowatt hours a yr. 
This 2000MW site alone pours 14 million tonnes of C02 into the
atmosphere every year.  The total annual emissions from RWE
stations around Germany amounts to more than 120 million tonnes
of C02.  
  <P>
This German electricity utility plans to open a new brown coal
mine, Garzweiler II, and plans to invest 20billion DM (USD 13
billion) in the so-called "modernisation" of its coal fired power
plants.  
  <P>
"RWE, like many of its counterparts around the world, is making
the wrong investment and the German government is allowing it to
do so.  This money should be going directly into energy
efficiency and alternative technologies such as solar or wind

<B>Berlin, April 1 - April 3</B>
 <P>
The weekend here in Berlin saw protests by various groups at the
Starship, on both Saturday and Sunday. Lively people, speeches,
children, bicycles: Berlin was full of colour.  Inside the
starship, closed meetings  with heavy negotiations continued,
completely oblivious to the real world.  Even the
environmentalists were beginning to suffer from a lack of
reality, but were rescued by the arrival at the starship of the
Greenpeace Germany "Greenteams" demonstration, which we happily
left a meeting to go outside and take part in.
  <P>
About 1000 young people arrived outside the starship.  They
carried a banner which read "we are the future".  On a stage in
a car park between the starship and a motorway, they voiced their
protest against the Climate Summit negotiators' inaction.  A rap
band, theatre group and drummers performed, the power for the amp
provided by solar power.  
  <P>
The protestors talked directly with our climbers still on the
chimney -- now up there for six days.   The only delegation,
apart from the environmental groups, which came out to see the
protest were the Danish, who have one of the strongest positions
within the northern countries at this meeting. 
  <P>
As we left and headed back into the starship, we were reminded
of the young people we are representing at the meeting.  It is
so easy to get drawn into the language and text of such a
meeting, and many of us thought how good it would be if the kids
outside were allowed past the security cordon and into the secret
meetings, to jolt governments back into some sense of
understanding of why the climate convention is being negotiated
in the first place: to secure a future for our children.
  <P>
Sunday as we arrived again at the starship, the roads around the
centre were closed to cars:  instead 70,000 cyclists occupied the
fastlanes of the motorways. We still wonder if anybody inside the
meeting had any idea of what was going on outside: it seems
doubtful. 
  <P>
Monday and the pressure is mounting:  the delegates, who have had
a week to argue about the text of the convention realise that
their ministers will arrive in just two days expecting to be able
to discuss a substantive proposal, but that proposal isn't there. 
  <P>
WWF hold a press conference and distribute T-shirts to the
delegations with the slogan SAVING THE CLIMATE: THAT'S MY JOB. 
Ironically, the governments who are trying to get this job done
don't accept the offer, preferring to wait until they have
finished done something.  But the governments blocking progress,
but don't want to be blamed, are jumping for the T-shirts.  It'll
take more than wearing a politically sound slogan to achieve real
change here, and the garments are withheld from the Australians,
US, Japanese, Canadians and their cohorts.  We are considering
getting another set printed for this lot: CHANGING THE CLIMATE,
THAT'S MY JOB would be more appropriate at this stage.
  <P>
The rest of the environmental groups hold a press conference,
slamming the United States' isolation and blocking of progress
at the Summit.  The Climate Action Network accuses the US of
being isolated in a triangle, along with the fossil fuel industry
and the oil producing countries such as Iran.
  <P>
An article in today's Der Spiegel refers to the fossil fuel
lobbyists like Don Pearlman of the "Climate Council", an innocent
sounding group, but who is exposed for his company's links to the
BCCI, and heavy influence on OPEC countries in both the Climate
Convention and meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. The delegates from most governments, along with
environmentalists, are happy that finally this lobbyist and his
interests have been properly exposed to the public. 
 <P>
Meanwhile down in Frimmersdorf the chimney sitters are still
there.  In the Netherlands climbers go up the biggest chimney in
the country, and paint CUT C02 in enormous letters on the side
of it.  Some are arrested, but released, and we set up phone
calls between them and Dan, Erhard and Gero in Frimmersdorf.

<B>Berlin, March 30</B>
 <P>
When the enormous, concrete conference centre where the Climate
Summit is being held was built, Berliners aptly named it the
"Starship Enterprise."  I'm still working on a detailed Star Trek
analogy, but this meeting certainly appears to be not of this
planet.  There is very little talk of the real impacts of climate
change, of its effect on people, ecosystems nor of those who are
likely to suffer the most. We're still trying to work out who
Captain Kirk is, but there is a clear correlation between a
business lobby group the Global Climate Coalition and Star Trek
baddies the Romulans. 
  <P>
The Global Climate Coalition's membership list reads like a
"Who's Who" in the world of transnational fossil fuel dependent
companies. Its membership comprises Exxon, Union Carbide,
Chevron, British Petroleum, Shell Oil, Du Pont Co, and the Dow
Chemical Company, as well as industry lobby organisations such
as the American Mining Congress; American Petroleum Institute;
Association of International Automobile Manufacturers; Chemical
Manufacturers Association; National Coal Association, Process Gas
Consumers Group, and the US Chamber of Commerce. See the <A HREF="http://www.igc.apc.org/climate/Eco.html">ECO</A>
updates for more detail on this "non profit" organisation and its
fellow fossil fuel friends the Climate Council. 
  <P>
The only group focussing on the real issues here is the Alliance
of Small Island States (AOSIS).  A speech this week by the
Ambassador of Samoa and Vice Chairman of AOSIS his excellency T
Neroni Slade described AOSIS as the "front line" nations.  
  <P>
    "We are being hit first and hardest in the forces of climate
change which we had no role in unleashing.  Already our people
are suffering physically, emotionally and economically from the
forces of climate change," he told the meeting. 
  <P>
     "We would emphasise that our Draft Protocol addresses a risk
faced not just by AOSIS countries, but by all of humanity. 
Climatic extremes known to characterise climate change are
visibel not just in small island states but everywhere on earth."
  <P>
     "Early action by the international community will spare us
and our children a later forced choice between two unacceptable
but related evils -- a ruined economy or a ruined climate," he
said. 
  <P>
Meanwhile the sun came out today in Frimmersdorf where our three
activists spent the fourth day 130m up on the smokestack of the
brown coal fired power plant.  We beamed them in by satellite to
our press conference, again to remind delegates of the real
source of the problem.  The latest impacts of climate change were
outlined at the press conference in a <A HREF="flood_report/index.html">report on flooding</A>, which
shows that increases of rainfall in northwest Europe have risen
considerably in recent decades [see <A HREF="berlin.html#report4">today's press release</A>].
  <P>
But even though the sun was out, the activists had an unexpected
blow. They have a solar panel set up to charge the batteries of
their mobile telephones, in order to be able to keep voicing
their message to the outside world. But the sunshine hasn't
reached the panel -- it has been blocked out by the C02-filled
smoke from the chimney next door.

<A NAME="diary2"><H2>Diary Entry: Day Two of the Climate Summit</H2></A>

<B>Berlin, 29 March</B>
 <P>
Day two of the Climate Summit and the enormous conference centre
in Berlin seems completely separated from the real world.  From
where the Greenpeace office is, we have no windows; cannot even
see the weather. But the reality comes again from our action team
in Frimmersdorf, where the three brave activists sit on the
smokestack, after having suffered a long night dealing with the
German power company RWE's security police.
  <P>
This evening I talked with with Dan, the American from Seattle
who has come all the way from the US to sit on this chimney
because of his conviction that something has to be done about the
climate.  The RWE security commandos stormed the chimney in the
middle of the night last night, without informing even the local
police, obviously hoping to catch the Greenpeace team off-guard.
No such luck.  The guards try to prise open the trapdoors in the
Greenpeace team's platform from underneath, but don't get far. 
The subsequent hour-long discussion involves the two German
activists, Erhard S. and Gero L. arguing with the guards.  The
Greenpeacers say if the guard insist on coming to get them, then
they will climb up the rungs to the top of the 193m chimney and
will lock themselves to the rungs.  If the guards want them off,
then they'll have to cut them off.  
  <P>
The Greenpeace determination to stay on the chimney to highlight
the source of climate change proves too much for the guards, who
eventually leave.  Dan then finds out the details of the
discussion which was held entirely in German which he doesn't
speak.  
  <P>
The day in the life of a chimney sitter is extremely busy.
Banners go up and get taken down because of the wind; and they
spend long hours talking to the increasing number of press around
the world.
  <P>
<B>From Dan in Frimmersdorf, 130m up on the smokestack: </B>
  <P>
<I>"From where I'm sitting, I can see for 40 miles [65 km] up the
valley.  Just across from me is a hill which used to be a brown
coal mine where trees are now planted. Up the valley, for as far
as the eye can see, is nothing but more brown coal mines and
power plants.  In amongst them are little villages where people
have to live in all this pollution.  We've had nothing but strong
winds for the past three days -- and we're all thinking that this
wind could be harnessed to produce energy instead of these global
warming factories.  We are imagining how beautiful the valley
would look if the power plants were windmills.
 <P>
Late today RWE announced that they are using legal measures to
try to get us down.  They're saying that we're breaching the
peace and security.  I can't believe that our sitting here is
breaching the peace more than the mess produced by this power
station.  RWE should be the one sued for threatening the security
of the future of our climate and the world as we know it.
 <P>
Tomorrow the wind will drop, and we expect the sun to make an
appearance.    I hear that at the conference centre in Berlin,
RWE has a photovoltaic exhibition. I don't see any evidence of
RWE using the sun as an energy source here.  The company is
planning to open yet another brown coal mine, Garzweiler II, and
will invest 20billion DM (USD 13 billion) in the so-called
"modernisation" of its coal fired power plants.  Its investment
in renewable energy is microscopic and the German government,
like other governments around the developed world, is allowing
it to happen." </I>

<B>Tuesday 28 March</B>
  <P>
It is snowing in Berlin today. We are told it is unusually late
to have snow at this time of the year.  We wonder if this is yet
another harbinger of climate change, but obviously cannot confirm
it.

  <P>
We think of the three Greenpeace activists, Erhard S. and Gero
L. from Germany and Dan R. from the United States, on the chimney
in Frimmersdorf, spending their second night 193m up on a tiny
platform on the smokestack of one of the dirtiest coal-fired
power stations in Germany.  The activists are there for the next
two weeks, to remind the Climate Summit of the source of the
climate change problem, fossil fuel power stations from around
the world.
  <P>
Ironically, German electricity utility RWE, which owns the site
on which the climbers sit, has a photovoltaic (renewable)
technology exhibition at the conference centre.  But the same
company pours 120 million tonnes of C02 into the atmosphere every
year and plans to open a new brown coal mine, Garzweiler II, and
plans to invest 20billion DM (USD 13 billion) in the so-called
"modernisation" of its coal fired power plants.  There is no
major solar investment of anything like this scale. 
  <P>
The first day of the Climate Summit started with a speech by the
German host and President of the Meeting, German Environment
Minister Mrs Angela Merkel.  Mrs Merkel stated that she was very
concerned at the threat to the small island states (Alliance of
Small Island States: AOSIS) from climate change.  AOSIS has the
most urgent plea to the negotiators of any of the countries at
the meeting:  if they don't act to cut C02, sea level rise as a
result of global warming will literally see the end of their
nations as they disappear under the seas. 
  <P>
Mrs Merkel stated that she knows about the effects  of climate
change, and says that there is no need to wait for further
scientific confirmation before governments act on real reductions
in C02.  But Germany, along with all developed countries must now
cut their own C02 emissions by 20% by 2005, as AOSIS has proposed
in their Protocol (see Climate press pack). As the chair of the
Climate Summit, Mrs Merkel is responsible for ensuring that this
meeting adopts the AOSIS proposal. 
  <P>
"The German Government has promised much, done little and, if it
wants to take the role of leadership, must act now,"  Greenpeace
campaigner Oliver Worm told a press conference. 
  <P>
Today's opening saw many speeches -- which talked of the "need
for reductions" of C02. The United Nations Environment Programme,
the World Meteorological Organisation, the chair of the meeting
Mr Estrada from Argentina all clearly stated that nobody was
arguing with the scientific consensus on climate change.  
  <P>
This opened the door for justification for strong steps to be
taken by all nations, especially the industrialised countries.
However, because of the timing of the meeting, where the draft
text needs to be with translators by next Monday in time for
consideration by Ministers, and with the weekend in the middle,
there are only three working days of real discussion. As Kirsty
Hamilton, a Greenpeace campaigner put it, "there is going to have
to be a rapid change in gear from what could be described as 
'progressive rhetoric' to 'progressive action' ".
  <P>
A thorny issue at the meeting will be the rules of procedure of
the convention.  In the face of 40 mile cracks in the Antarctic 
"rules of procedure"  as a real discussion point sound rather
incongruous.  But the meeting is stuck in this mire.  It must
decide how the adoption of any Protocol (as suggested by AOSIS)
must be done -- either by consensus or by a majority vote (see
press pack on the Protocol).  
  <P>
There is still no certainty that the OPEC countries will not do
a "hatchet job" on the rules and insist on consensus if they're
not getting their way. Indeed, with oil in the family, the OPECs'
main interest is in blocking the entire meeting, especially if
they're not getting a strong message from the developed world
(their clients) that their behaviour is unacceptable.  And indeed
it is not.  The developed countries' inaction is allowing the
OPECs to step in to block the meeting.  And those developed
countries could stop the OPECs blocking their way if they really
want to. 
  <P>
In all of this, it is very important to note that European Union
countries are the key to the entire climate summit.  Germany as
president of Summit and the EU as a whole must be strong in
supporting AOSIS's proposal for a way out.  If you are from one
of these countries, send a fax to your government now insisting
that the EU must take a leadership role and can offer some hope
in the proceedings by leading support for the small island
states' protocol. 
  <P>
Or if you live in one of the "JUSCANZ" group countries: Japan,
the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, along with
Switzerland, Iceland, Mexico and Norway we ask you to send an
equally strong message that your country is obstructing the whole
meeting. It is critical that these countries make real
commitments and demonstrate their support for AOSIS and agree to
specific commitments from industrialised countries. 
  <P>
The JUSCANZ group is taking a position that any further action
by industrialised countries should be linked with developing
countries also making commitments on cutting C02. Greenpeace sees
this as simply evading responsibilities.  The industrialised
countries are responsible for 75% of man-made C02 emissions
worldwide and simply have no excuse for arguing that they must
wait for the developing world.
  <P>
The best words of this meeting so far comes from our activists
sitting on the source of the problem who today said to
Governments, through a live satellite linkup to Berlin: "We are
up here to bear witness to the source of climate change. You know
what the solutions are. You have the power to make the fossil
fuels part of history and take us into a solar future. We are
staying here until the end of the Summit -- waiting for  you to
save us from the climate catastrophe."
  <P>
In response to a question from a journalist about the comfort of
the three climbers in their stay on the chimney in freezing
weather for the next two weeks Dan said:  "We will be fine here
for two weeks, but what I'm worried about is having to live on
a planet when climate change is really with us, either boiling
hot from droughts or freezing from record cold temperatures."
 <P>
As we left the this evening at 2100 hrs, the "carbon clock"
outside the Greenpeace office,  counting the amount of C02 issued
from power stations worldwide since the meeting began at 1000 hrs
local time this morning, reaches 8 million tonnes.
  <P>
GO SOLAR!!

<h2>The Destruction of the Ancient Forests</h2>
<P>
Canada is home to some of the largest remaining areas of
intact old growth forests in the world. 
Unfortunately, already
over 50% of these great forests have been destroyed or
degraded.

<BR clear=all>
In British Columbia, the province where over 50% of
the logging occurs, over half of the forest that has been destroyed has been logged since 1970.

<img vspace=5 hspace=5  src="../pics/for65s.jpg" width=175 height=116 border=0></a>
</center>

<BR clear=all>
This is possibly because
of increased mechanization in the forest industry and the
reliance on a logging practice called 
<B><a href="clearcas.html">clearcutting </a></B> Across Canada over 90% of the logging is clearcut
logging.   Although much of the land is replanted, Canada's complex ancient forest ecosystems are being replaced with even aged tree farms.  This practice of converting natural forests to tree farms is devastating for wildlife and threatens biodiversity.

<P>Russia has more forests than any other country
on the planet. In total Russia's forests cover
over one thousand million hectares, or 22% of
the world's forest cover, an area larger than
the continental USA. 

<P>Most of these forests are conifers (larch, spruce and pine),
<a href="../pics/for86.gif">
<img  vspace=7 hspace=7 align=left lowsrc="../thumbs/for86t.gif" src="../pics/for86s.gif" width=120 height=175 border=0></a>
called "taiga" in Russian, with birch as the major
hardwood species. 

<P>The Soviet central command economy
 has worked to rapidly industrialise the forest
sector, and many forests have been decimated by
clearcutting and clearing for agriculture.

<P>However, ecological considerations in forest management
have been part of forest planning in Russia
throughout this century, and have a tradition
that dates back to the 18th century.

<P>Recently however, a law was passed which has weakened the
forest legislation, and allows clearcuts of up
to ten hectares in the least fragile of the
protected forests, but demands proof that any
cutting in these forests will increase the
ecological and protective functions of the
forest. Exploiting these loopholes is becoming
a dangerous practice of logging companies,both foreign and domestic, in Russia. 

<P>Foreign investment and export of
wood products is the major factor forcing the
regrowth of the logging industry.

<P>ENSO WILL CEASE TIMBER CUTTING IN KARELIAN OLD GROWTH FORESTS
 
<P>The Finnish paper
group Enso has announced that it will agree on a one year moratorium for
timber cutting and timber sales in or from Karelian or Murmansk old growth
forests. The moratorium will be effective January 1, 1997 and applies to 2
million hectares of forest  identified by Greenpeace as old growth.
<P>With this announcement Enso has responded to the demands of environmental organisations to
end destructive timber cutting methods in nothern old growth forests.
<P>Greenpeace has recently raised public awareness of Enso`s clear
cutting practices with actions in Finland, Karelia und Luebeck/Germany. 
Greenpeace welcomes the moratorium as a first step into the right direction. 
<P>On
principle, however, Enso should refrain from cutting old growth altogether und
should introduce the concept of ecological forest use for all its timber
production.

<tr><td width=50% valign=top>
For over ten years, Greenpeace and other environmental groups have fought to end hazardous chlorine use in the pulp and paper industry. The success or failure of a dozen years of protests, lobbying and research now boils down to President Clinton making a simple choice about new EPA regulations. Any day, Clinton will either choose to allow the pulp and paper industry to continue their use of harmful chlorine and chlorine dioxide bleaching, or move the industry towards safe, chlorine-free technologies.
<p>
The next days and weeks are critical. Sources within the White House tell Greenpeace that President Clinton is wavering under the lobbying pressure exerted by the multi-billion dollar pulp and paper industry. This could be the first environmental decision of his new Administration. Will Clinton back down on his pledged commitment to protect human health and the environment? Your letters, faxes, emails and phone calls today can make the difference. 
<p>
The pulp and paper industry has claimed for years that chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper is safe. But this is pulp fiction. In fact, the pulp and paper industry's chlorine bleaching is one of the largest contributors to water pollution. Millions of gallons of toxic chemicals, called organochlorines, are discharged into freshwater streams and rivers each day. 
<p>
Many of these organochlorines, such as<br>
dioxin, cause cancer or genetic damage to<br>
humans and wildlife. These chemicals<br> 
persist and accumulate in the environment;<br> 
we all have measurable amounts of these<br>
toxic compounds in our bodies. 
</td><td width=50% valign=top>	
Fortunately, alternative bleaching methods<br>
exist and are widely available. Oxygen<br>
methods of bleaching, for example, are safe<br> 
and release no harmful organochlorines.<br>
They are used by paper mills around the world.
<p>
The pulp and paper industry is lobbying for<br>
permission to replace chlorine with<br>
chlorine dioxide. However, even if all U.S.<br>
mills switched to chlorine dioxide bleaching,<br>
over 47 million pounds of organochlorines<br>
would still be released by mills annually. 
<p>
Chlorine dioxide poses accident and health<br> 
and safety risks. It is highly explosive at<br>
even low concentrations. Train accidents<br> 
involving the transport of poisonous chlorine<br>
gas have resulted in injuries, deaths and<br>
the evacuation of entire communities. Nobody<br>
has ever had to be evacuated from a<br>
community because of an oxygen cloud!
<p>
Let President Clinton and the EPA know<br>
that you care more about fact than fiction.<br>
Write and let them know that you favor<br>
clean paper-making technologies that protect<br>
our planet, ourselves and the health of<br>
future generations.

<li> Pulp and paper mills are the largest source of dioxin in water pollution. Dioxin is one of the most toxic chemicals known to science.</li>
<li> According to the EPA, more than 95% of people tested in the U.S. already have dioxin in their body tissue. 90% of this dioxin comes from our food supply, such as dioxin-contaminated fish.</li>
<li> EPA scientists have concluded that background levels of dioxin found in Americans today may be responsible for serious health effects.</li>
<li> Low income, Native American and African American communities downstream from pulp and paper mills carry the bulk of the toxic burden produced by the pulp and paper industry - a clear case of environmental injustice.</li>
<li> The way to zero dioxin pollution is to use totally chlorine-free (TCF) processes. The first step to TCF is oxygen bleaching, instead of chlorine and chlorine dioxide bleaching.</li>

<p><b>GREENPEACE STOPS FIRST TRANSGENIC CORN IMPORT AUTHORISED BY EUROPEAN
COMMISSION

<p> AMSTERDAM,  DECEMBER 19TH 1996 </b>

<p>Less than 24 hours after the European
Commission approved genetically engineered maize, Greenpeace today
stopped the unloading of a cargo of genetically manipulated corn and
soya arriving in France.


<p>At 1400 hours, activists from the Netherlands, France, the United
Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Canada and the USA occupied the vessel and
chained themselves to loading cranes at Saint-Nazaire in Western
France.

<p>The ship, the "Magda P," set sail from New Orleans and has been
circling off shore waiting to unload its hazardous cargo for
approximately one week.

<p>"Our aim is to highlight this vessel's dangerous cargo of genetically
engineered corn and soya," said Greenpeace campaigner Michelle
Sheather.

<p>The corn has been engineered by Swiss multi-national Ciba-Geigy to be
tolerant to a week-killer and to produce toxins to kill a common

insect pest. 

<p>Thirteen European countries objected to the maize being brought into
Europe. They are worried about  environmental and health risks. In
spite of this,  the maize was approved by the European Commission
yesterday for cultivation and sale in Europe. The UK Government's
scientific advisers continued last night to support their original
objections to the corn's approval. 

<p>About one hundred thousand tons of corn had already arrived illegally
in European ports without approval and the USA has threatened a trade
war if it was not allowed in.

<p>There is a danger that the new corn will increase antibiotic
resistance in dangerous bacteria and could also increase pesticide
resistance in insects.

<p>The first imports of genetically engineered soy  have caused
widespread protest across Europe in recent weeks.  Greenpeace has
undertaken over 30 actions around the world on the introduction of the
GE soy crop into the world market.  In France, a Greenpeace campaign
against  these crops  has already been signed by  20,000 people in one
month.   

<p>"Without taking into account the wishes of European citizens, and
without learning the lessons from mad cow disease - which experts once
tried to convince us was safe - the European Commission has given in
to the lobbyists for the agrochemical  giants who are the only
beneficiaries of this dangerous experiment with nature", said
Greenpeace campaigner Arnaud Apoteker in Saint-Nazaire 

<p>"Approval of the maize actually conflicts with the European Council's
own directive which demands that all measures are taken to avoid
adverse effects to human health and the environment.

<p>This Directive (90/220/EEC) also acknowledges that "living organisms
... released into the environment...as commercial products, may
reproduce in the environment and cross national frontiers thereby
affecting other Member States;" and that "... the effects of such
releases on the environment may be irreversible".

<p>"Immediate action must be taken by European countries to protect the
integrity of their environment and the health of their population by
banning genetically manipulated maize," said Greenpeace campaigner
Michelle Sheather.

<p><b>EU COMMISSION OPENS FLOODGATES TO GENETIC HAZARD<p>BRUSSELS,  DECEMBER 18TH 1996 </b>




<p> Greenpeace has strongly criticised the
European Commission's failure to protect Europe's environment and
citizens' rights when it approved today the authorisation of Ciba
Geigy's genetech maize.

<p>For the first time genetically engineered crops can be legally grown,
imported  and used in food in Europe.

<p> "To release a crop which may increase antibiotic resistance in
 dangerous bacteria and could increase  pesticide resistance in
 insects is one of the most irresponsible decisions the Commission has
 taken," said  Louise Gale of Greenpeace's European Unit. "The known

 risks to the environment and to human health have apparently been
 swept aside by the Commission."

<p>"Once more the Commission has given in to pressure from the genetic
engineering industry and the USA. And, once more the Commission has
ignored its duties to protect the environment and  the public's
health".

<p>Greenpeace calls on members states to take control of this dangerous
situation in Europe and to take matters into their own hands.

<p>"We recommend that Member States use their EU legal rights to ban the
imports and use of this genetech corn and to take the European
Commission to the European Court of Justice for violating Directive
90/220."

<p>"Europe is opening the floodgates to widespread environmental and
health hazards. We will take action to ensure that the food and animal
industry reject genetically manipulated products," said international
campaigner Michelle Sheather.

<p>Although the Commission's scientific committees have concluded that
the corn is safe, this has not been the opinion of 13 member states
who oposed approval of the corn last June, after advice from their own
scientific advisers.  Greenpeace has pointed out that the Commission's
scientific committees did not predict the disastrous situation arising
from BSE when animal carcasses were allowed to be used as animal feed.

<p>Although not approved, at least  hundred thousand tonnes of US corn --
some of it genetically engineered and therefore illegal -- has arrived
and continues to arrive in Europe, including the Netherlands, Belgium,
Finland, Italy, Portugal and the UK.

<p><b>GREENPEACE NAMES SHIPS BRINGING ILLEGAL CORN TO EUROPE<p>BRUSSELS,  DECEMBER 17TH 1996 </b>


<p>Greenpeace today reveals the names of
ships that have entered Europe in the last two months which it
believes contain illegal genetically engineered corn, and condemns the
lack of preventative action by EU member states.

"It is scandalous that foodstuff still under consideration for
possible environmental or health effects is being allowed into Europe
due to lax controls by EU member states," said Louise Gale,  from
Greenpeace's EU Unit.

<p>According to a leaked letter from the European Commission itself,
thousands of tonnes of maize have been entering European ports every
week since the new corn was harvested in October. The Commission even
wrote to member states alerting them to these illegal imports. But
only one EU country --Belgium -- has taken steps to provisionally
impound all US corn shipments for testing. 

<p>"Greenpeace calls on all EU member states to follow Belgium's lead and
take positive action to prevent illegal corn entering their countries
until the Commission anounces a total ban," said Louise Gale.

<p>Tomorrow (Wednesday) the Commission takes a crucial decision on Ciba
Geigy's corn , the second genetically engineered crop to be used in
human food in Europe. Soya, used in 60 per cent of all processed
foods, was approved earlier this year. Greenpeace has been actively
campaigning against its use. 

<p>"If the corn is approved tomorrow the floodgates will have been
opened. No one will be able to avoid genetically engineered food as
two of our staple crops become manipulated by multinational genetech
companies. The Commission will be failing in its duty to protect
Europe from the dangers of genetically engineered crops."

<p>The manipulated corn contains three new genes: one which makes it
resistant to a herbicide, one which kills insects and a "marker" gene
which confers resistance to the antibiotic Ampicillin, used  against a
wide range of disease causing bacteria in animals and humans. 

<p>Permission to import and grow this corn was not granted by the
Commisison after 13 member states opposed it on environmental and
health grounds. The UK expressed concern about the dangers of
antibiotic resistance developing as a result of the new corn being
eaten by humans and animals.


<p>"This product should have been banned in June, but instead the
Commission delayed their decision and referred it to three scientific
committees to examine evidence largely put forward by the
multinational agrochemical company Ciba Geigy who produce the corn,"
said  Greenpeace spokesperson Michelle Sheather. 

<p>"Advice from the Commission's scientific committees did not predict
the disastrous situation arising from BSE when animal carcasses were
allowed to be used as animal feed. Let's hope the Commissioners will
bear this in mind when they make their decission tomorrow. Greenpeace
calls on the Commission to reject permission for Ciba Geigy's
genetically engineered corn outright."



<p><B>Notes to editors</B>

<p>1. Ships coming to Europe containing US corn (approximately 0.6 per
cent genetically engineered this year) since October include: the
Marit Maersk and Mayview Maersk to Felixstowe in the UK; the
Inspiration and the Cape May to Bremerhaven in Germany; the Innovation
to Rotterdam in the Netherlands; and the George L to Ravenna in Italy.

<p><b>GENE-TECH SOYA SHIPMENT BLOCKED BY GREENPEACE IS FINALLY IMPOUNDED BY SWISS AUTHORITIES
<p>BRUSSELS,  DECEMBER 12TH 1996 </b>

<p>The shipment of genetically engineered
soya meal blocked by  Greenpeace earlier today has been seized by the
Swiss Prosecutor, who announced that all further shipments will also
be impounded unless they are eventually approved.

<p>Meanwhile in Belgium, the Agriculture Ministry sent a memo to the
customs administration proposing that they "provisionally impound all
cargoes of US corn (new harvest) which arrive in Antwerp.  This
holding of the cargo will be in effect until we (the Agriculture
Ministry authorities) have determined if genetically modified
organisms are present."

<p>"It seems that at least some European governments are now willing to
take steps to protect their countries from genetically modified
organisms," said Louise Gale from Greenpeace,"Greenpeace welcomes
these steps and hopes that other member states will now oppose all
further attempts to import, grow or sell genetically altered crops in
Europe".

<p>Earlier today Greenpeace activists boarded the ship MS "Desire" near
Basel to prevent unloading of the illegal cargo of soya meal. The
imports of genetically engineered crops are in fact not approved by
Swiss legislation.<br><br>

<p><b>GREENPEACE BLOCKS UNAUTHORISED CARGOES OF GENETICALLY ALTERED CROPS  <p>BRUSSELS,  DECEMBER 12TH 1996 </b>

<p>Today Greenpeace activists in Hamburg stopped the departure of a train carrying an unauthorised cargo of
genetically altered crops, in this case corn destined for animal feed.
The corn is part of a 33,000 tonnes stock from the US which arrived in
Hambourg and is destined for Czech Republic. This country has no
legislation to protect itself from the import of modified crops, which
has not been authorised by the European Union yet. 

<p>Meanwhile Greenpeace protests against genetic engineered soya
continue. Since 7h00 this morning the organisation has been blocking a
shipment of soya  near Basel (Switzerland). The protest has been
supported by the Swiss farmers coalition and the Consumers Association
who are also opposed to the illegal import of  genetically engineered
crops. Last night in Aarhus (Denmark), the organisation had already
protested against the first shipment of genetically altered soya beans
to arrive in Scandinavia.

<p>Next week the European Commission is due to decide whether to
authorise the growth and marketing of the genetically modified corn in
Europe, as well as its importation. " The European Commission must
respect the concerns of consumers and European governments on the
health and safety of these products, and reject them outright." said
Louise Gale from Greenpeace.

<p>The corn, manufactured by Ciba Geigy, contains three different
"unnatural" genes, one of which makes it resistant to an important
antibiotic, ampicillin.  A second introduced gene gives resistance
against a weed killer, Basta, and a third modification, a bacteria
gene, produces a toxin against certain insects.  

<p>"Ciba Geigy's genetic engineered corn plays a high risk game with the
environment as well as animal and human health," says Louise Gale. 
"Ampicillin might soon lose its effectiveness against certain harmful
bacteria if these bacteria take up the ampicillin resistance. 
Ciba-Geigy's open willingness to increase this resistance is
scandalous". 

<p>For more than a year Greenpeace has been fighting against the approval
of this corn by the European Union (EU).  In June the majority of
member states registered their opposition to this genetically
engineered crop with the Commission.  Recently the European Commission
alerted the member states that genetically engineered US corn is
illegally imported into the European Union.  "What is banned in the EU
should certainly not be allowed to enter Czech Republic," says Hana
Pernicova, Greenpeace Czech Republic.  "The Czech Republic has no law
controlling the import and use of genetically engineered crops.  The
United States is taking advantage of this weakness to dump this
altered product on us."  

<p>Greenpeace calls on the European Union to take their responsibilities
seriously and to finally ban the import, growth and sale of
genetically altered crops.<br>

<p><b>GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS FIRED AT WITH RUBBER BULLETS AND HELD IN
JAIL 
<p>BRUSSELS,  DECEMBER 2ND 1996 </b>

 
<P>As the European Environment ministers 
prepare to discuss an intervention by Luxembourg on the mounting
public concern about gene soya - the battle over the import of
genetically altered food turned violent today with Spanish
police firing  rubber bullets at Greenpeace protesters.
 
<P>A group of 18 Greenpeace activists,  protesting the unloading of 
genetically altered soya beans from the Polish cargo ship
Uniwersytet Jaiellonski at Barcelona harbour,  were fired on at
least 10 times by police on board the cargo vessel and a police
launch. Three  Greenpeace activists received minor injuries from
rubber bullets.
 
<P>A total of 14 activists from Spain, France, Germany and the UK
were arrested by  Spanish police at around 10 pm last night
after preventing the ship,  carrying a load of gene soya from
international grain company Cargill, from unloading for several
hours. The  activists were still in police custody early this
evening. Spanish police have the power to detain them for 72
hours without charge.
 
<P>"Spain and other European countries should not be providing a
police  escort for the controversial gene soya. EU countries
should implement their rights to prevent the soya being imported
into their territory," Greenpeace European Unit spokesperson
Louise Gale said. 
 
<P>"It is highly appropriate for the EU Commission to commit  on 
December 9 and 10 to review its decision of April 1996 to allow
the gene soya into the European market.  Environmental and
health cooncerns have not been adequately assessed by the
Commission and until this is done consumers should not have gene
soya products forced on them." 
 
<p>The Spanish action was the seventh in a series of  actions
(Hamburg,  Antwerp, Ghent, New Orelans, Amsterdam, New Orleans,
Liverpool and Barcelona) during the last three weeks against
soya imports into Europe and exports from the United States.  
 
<p>"The need for a police  escort of the soya shipment  shows the
extent of public opposition to genetically altered food. Such
measures are unprecedented against a non-violent demonstration
by the environmental organisation Greenpeace." <br>

<p><b>ACTIVISTS BLOCK HARBOUR LOCK TO PREVENT FIRST DIRECT  SHIPMENT OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SOYA BEANS ENTERING UK
        
<p>LIVERPOOL DOCKS,  NOVEMBER 28TH 1996</B>

<p>Greenpeace activists are preventing the Polish registered ship  Orleta 
Lwowskie from bringing 56,000 tonnes of  soya beans into the UK at 
Liverpool Docks. The shipment contains a mixture of natural and genetically engineered soya beans. This is the first direct shipment of these controversial soya beans into the UK.
          
<p>Activists in inflatable boats tailed the ship, protesting its progress towards the dockside. Once at the dock, the activists locked themselves to the lock gates and ladders, preventing the ship from docking.
    
<p>A large banner reading "Floodgate to genetic pollution" was hung across the 73,000 tonne, 228 meter long ship's path. In a simultaneous action further inside the dockyard, Greenpeace activists scaled the two unloading cranes at the  wharf - the shipment's destination - and disabled them by hanging a second banner from their loading arms.
        
<p>The shipment of genetically engineered soya beans is destined for processing at the Cargill's grain plant, for use in the UK market.  
          
<p>The shipment comes from near New Orleans, exit point for much of the United States' huge soya crop.  This year an estimated 2% of the crop has been genetically engineered by the chemical giant Monsanto to make it resistant to the company's Round Up herbicide.
          
<p>The Round Up Ready soya bean, as the genetically modified bean is called, has been the cause of growing concern and controversy in the UK.  Soya is an ingredient in up to 60% of the processed food eaten in Britain (bread, margarines, chocolate etc). Because these beans are mixed with natural beans before they leave the US, food manufacturers - such as Unilever -  in the UK, claim they cannot avoid using them. 
          
<p>However, Unilever in Germany has given its customers assurances that 
it will not use genetically engineered soya.   Consumers concerned about genetically engineered food will not know which foods to avoid buying as the products will not be labelled. They will effectively be denied a choice.  
       
<p>Simon Reddy of Greenpeace said, "This dockside represents the floodgates for genetic pollution.  Cargill wanted to bring it in  without telling anyone and then mix it in our food without giving people any choice. It's underhand, devious and wrong. The public does not benefit from this genetic engineering. We can't risk 
releasing it into the environment."<br>

<p> 
This fall, U.S. farmers will harvest the first crop of genetically engineered soybeans. The soybeans have been genetically altered by chemical giant Monsanto and contain gene sequences from bacteria and viruses.  Monsanto's Roundup Ready Soybeans (RRS) represent a crucial step in a massive genetic experiment in which humans beings and the environment are the guinea pigs.  Although this year less than 2% of US soybeans will be Roundup Ready, the plan is to mix them with traditional soybeans and introduce them into many of the hundreds of products which contain soybeans.
<p> 
Under Monsanto's plan consumers would <b>not</b> have the right to choose whether or not they want to buy or eat genetically altered food.     
<p> 
There is only one benefit of RRS: is can survive exposure to glyphosate (trade name "Roundup"). Against this single benefit weigh the risks of genetic "pollution," allergies, and rising
dependence on herbicides. Genetic engineering is a vast experiment with unknown risks. 
<p> 
Consumers simply do not want it in their food.  Dozens of companies in Europe are demanding soybeans that have not been genetically engineered. Europe is one of the largest markets for U.S.soybeans. 
<p> 
For the sake of Monsanto's profits, the U.S. soybean farmer risks losing
important markets.

<blockquote>
<B>Dr Mae-Wan Ho
Biology Department, Open University, U.K.
November 1996
</B>

<p>Agricultural biotechnology, genetically modifying crops for 
characteristics such as herbicide, pest, and disease resistance, for improved
nutritional value and shelf-life, is being sold as a solution
 to world hunger. Also promised for the future are drought, and frost 
resistance, nitrogen fixation [3] and increased yield [4].
	
<p>Within the past two years, these new foods have found their way to 
supermarkets in the United States and Europe, despite opposition from
consumers, environmental groups and other non-government organ
izations, on grounds that the new technology has not been properly 
assessed for risks to human and animal health, nor hazards to biodiversity
and the environment. So far, the list of products include
s milk from cows given genetically engineered bovine growth hormone 
(BST) to boost milk yield [5], genetically modified tomatoes with delayed
softening, and most recently, Monsanto's soybean, modifie
d to be resistant to its top-selling chemical herbicide, glyphosate 
(trade name, Roundup), which is marketed world-wide, without labelling, and
mixed in with unmodified soybean crops. Soybean is an i
ngredient in many processed foods, including formula for babies 
allergic to milk products.

<p>Monsanto's success in forcing food retailers and governments to 
accept genetically modified soybeans without labelling makes clear to
consumers that the commercial imperative takes precedence over an
y concerns regarding actual or potential hazards from genetically 
modified foods.

<p>Agricultural biotechnology is big business, and science has been 
absorbed into industry to an unprecedented extent. Practically all
established molecular geneticists have some industrial ties [6], th
us limiting what they can research on, particularly with regard to 
safety. The transnational companies have invested heavily, and are hoping for
huge returns. Some estimates have predicted a stlg9 billi
on market in the UK alone by the year 2000 [7]. 
	
<p>The mission to feed the world has the irresistible ring of a noble 
obligation. The same goes for improving the nutritional value of foods.
Despite the lowest prices on record, more than 800 million p
eople still go hungry [2], and 82 countries - half of them in Africa 
- neither grow enough food, nor can afford to import it. Infant mortality
rates - a sensitive indicator of nutritional stress - ha
ve been experiencing an upturn in recent years, reversing a long-term 
historical trend. Large numbers of children suffer from malnutrition in
developing countries. In India alone, 85% of children und
er five are below the normal, acceptable state of nutrition [8].
	
<p>In view of the current crisis in food production, and the support for 
agricultural biotechnology as a solution to the crisis expressed by the World

<p>Bank Report [2] and by Chapter 16 of Agenda 21 of t
he United Nations' Earth Summit, it is all the more important to 
examine the major claims and promises of the technology as well as the
uncertainties and hazards which are not adequately taken into
ccount in
existing practices and regulations.


<p>The questions is: Can genetically modified foods feed the world or 
improve nutrition?

<p>Agricultural biotechnology under the terms of The Convention on 
Biological 
Diversity  
	
<p>Under-nutrition and malnutrition, everywhere in the developing as 
well as the developed world, stem from poverty, as admitted in the World Bank
Report [2]. In the Third World, poverty was created in 
large measure, by centuries of colonial and post-colonial economic 
exploitation under the "free-trade" imperative, and exacerbated by the
introduction of the intensive, high input industrial agricult
ure of the "Green Revolution" since the 1970s [9]. The concentration 
on growing crops for export has benefited the corporate plant breeders and
the elite of the Third World at the expense of ordinary
 people. In 1973, thirty-six of the nations most seriously affected 

by hunger and malnutrition exported food to the US - a pattern that continues
to the present day [10]. 
	
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity, developed at the Earth Summit 
is intended to conserve biological diversity in an equitable way.  Since the

major genetic diversity is centred in the poorer, le
ss developed countries of the world and this is the material genetic 
engineering wishes to use, the Convention will play an important role in
determining the socio-economic effects of the technology.
   However, the Convention on Biological Diversity has done nothing 
to stem the drain of natural resources of the South to the North. On the
contrary, the very basis of sustainability and long-term f
ood security of the South is now under threat as the result of 
agricultural biotechnology promoted under the Convention [11]. 
	
The Convention on Biological Diversity, signed in June 1992 at the 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, is
hailed as "the culmination of two decades of arduous in
ternational efforts in which the conservation of biological diversity 
is being recognized as a common concern of humankind, and considered an
integral part of the development process" [12]. It would 
"reconcile the need for conservation with the concerns for 
development based on justice and equity." 
	
<p>Instead, pilfering of biological diversity has intensified as 
agricultural biotechnology drives "gene-hunters" to prospect for commercially

lucrative genetic resources in the South, in the new regime
 of intellectual property rights that allows the patenting of living 
organisms and their genes. Large proportions of the biological diversity of
the South are already held in gene banks as ex situ co
llections, and the North is insisting that such ex situ collections 
should be excluded from the Convention, with the result that they will be
freely available for exploitation by Northern biotech int
erests. 

<p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Southern countries 
not only lose massive genetic resources to the North, but also their
knowledge and experience of the plants which have accumulated
 for past millennia. This valuable knowledge is nevertheless excluded 
from protection as intellectual property rights. The intellectual property
rights of corporate gene manipulators, on the other ha
nd, will restrict the use of indigenous varieties that were 
previously freely cultivated and sold. Thus, seeds protected by patent can no
longer be saved by farmers for replanting without annual roya
lties being paid to the company.

<p>Another factor already adversely affecting agricultural biodiversity 
in Europe is the Seed Trade Act, which makes it illegal to grow and sell
non-certified seeds produced by organic varieties from in
digenous varieties, certification being biased towards the commercial 
varieties currently used in agricultural biotechnology [13]. Far from
providing cheaper food for all, agricultural biotechnology 
will further undermine the livelihoods of small organic farmers all 
over the world, resulting in increased loss of indigenous agricultural
biodiversity.

<p><B>
Biological diversity, food security and nutrition</B>
	
<p>Biological diversity and food security are intimately linked. 
Communities everywhere have derived livelihoods from natural diversity in
wild and domesticated forms.  Diversity is the basis of ecologi
cal stability [14,15]. Recent studies show that diverse ecological 
communities are more resilient to drought and other environmental
disturbances which cause the population of individual species to f
luctuate widely from year to year [16]. Species within an ecological 
community are interconnected in an intricate web of mutualistic as well as
competitive interactions, of checks and balances that c
ontribute to the survival of the whole. This has important 
implications for in situ conservation, particularly at a time when an
estimated 50,000 species will go extinct every year over the next deca
des [17].
	
<p>The same principles of diversity and stability operate in traditional 

agriculture [18]. Throughout the tropics, traditional agroforestry systems
commonly contain well over 100 annual and perennial pl
ant species per field. A profusion of varieties and land races are 
cultivated which are adapted to different local environmental conditions and
possess a range of natural resistances to diseases and 
pests. Spatial diversity through mixed cropping is augmented by 
temporal diversity in crop rotation, ensuring the recycling of nutrients that
maintain soil fertility. These practices have effectively
 prevented major outbreaks of diseases and pests and buffered food 
production from environmental exigencies.
	
<p>The diversity of agricultural produce is also the basis of a balanced 
nutrition. Nutrition not only depends on the right balance of protein,
carbohydrates and fats, but also on a combination of vitam
ins, essential metabolites, cofactors, inorganic ions and trace 
metals, which only a varied diet can provide. A major cause of malnutrition
world-wide is the substitution of the traditionally varied 
diet for one based on monoculture crops. The transfer of an exotic 
gene into a monoculture crop can do little to make up for the dietary
deficiencies of those suffering from monoculture malnutrition.
 The nutritional value of beans, or a combination of rice and beans, 
will always be greater than that of the transgenic rice with a bean gene.
	

<p>Monocultures destroy biodiversity and food security, transgenic crops 
will be 
worse  
	
It is now indisputable that monoculture crops introduced since the 
"Green Revolution" have adversely affected biodiversity and food security all
over the world.  According to an FAO report, by the ye
ar 2000, the world will have lost 95% of the genetic diversity 
utilized in agriculture at the beginning of this century [19]. Monoculture
crops are genetically uniform, and therefore notoriously pron
e to disease and pest outbreaks. The corn belt of the United States 
was last devastated by corn blight in 1970-1971, and in 1975, Indonesian
farmers lost half a million acres of rice to leaf hoppers.
 Genetic modification for disease or pest resistance will not solve 
the problem, as intensive agriculture itself creates the conditions for new
pathogens to arise [20]. In 1977, a variety of rice, IR
-36, created to be resistant to 8 major diseases and pests including 
bacterial blight and tungro, was nevertheless attacked by two new viruses

called 'ragged stunt' and 'wilted stunt'. Thus, not only
 do new varieties have to be substituted every three years, they 
require heavy input of pesticides to keep pests at bay.
	
<p>The high inputs of fertilizers, water, pesticides and heavy 
mechanization required by monoculture crops have had devastating
environmental effects [8, 20]. Between 1981 and  1991, the world's agricul

tural base has fallen by some 7 percent, primarily due to 
environmental degradation and water shortages. One-third of the world's
croplands suffers from soil erosion, which could reduce agricultural 
production by a quarter between 1975 and the year 2000. In India, 
800,000 square kilometres are affected, with many areas turning into scrub or
desert.  Deforestation has resulted in 8.6 million hect
ares of degraded land in Indonesia, which is unable to sustain even 
subsistence agriculture. Throughout the tropics, vast areas are vulnerable to
flooding. Of the world's irrigated land, one-fifth - 
40 million hectares - suffers from waterlogging or salination. The 
resultant pressures on agricultural land led to further marginalization of
small farmers, swelling the ranks of the dispossessed and
 hungry, while indigenous natural and agricultural biodiversity are 
eliminated at accelerated rates. 
	
<p>Transgenic crops are created from the same high-input monoculture 

varieties of the green revolution, and are likely to make things worse. The
greatest proportion of transgenic crop plants are now eng
ineered to be resistant to herbicide, with companies engineering 
resistance to their own herbicide to increase sales of herbicides with seeds
[21]. The immediate hazard from herbicide resistant crops
 is the spread of transgenes to wild relatives bycross-hybridization, 
creating super-weeds. Herbicide-resistant transgenic oilseed rape, released
in Europe, can hybridise with several wild-relatives 
and produce fertile seed [22, 23].
	
<p>There are yet other problems. Herbicide resistant transgenic crops 
make it possible to apply powerful herbicides killing many species, directly
onto crops. This is so for Monsanto's Roundup, lethal t
o most herbaceous plants. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has 
identified 74 endangered plant species threatened by the use of glyphosate
[24]. It reduces nitrogen-fixing activity of soils and is tox
ic to many species of mycorrhizal fungi which are vital for nutrient 
recycling in the soil. Formulations of glyphosate are the third most
commonly-reported cause of pesticide illness among agricultur
al workers. The use of this highly toxic to plants, 
non-discriminating herbicide threatens to lead to large scale elimination of
indigenous species and cultivated varieties, damaging soil fertility a
nd human health besides. Herbicide resistant transgenic crops may 
also become weeds in the form of "volunteer plants" germinated from seeds
after the harvest, so that other herbicides will have to be
 applied in order to eliminate them, with yet further impact on 
indigenous biodiversity.
	

<p>The best strategy to guarantee food security is to conserve and 
develop existing agricultural biological diversity 
	

<p>In order to counteract the crisis of environmental destruction, loss 
of agricultural land and indigenous biodiversity created by decades of
intensive farming, there has been a global move towards hol
istic, organic farming methods that revive traditional practices.  
For example, in Latin America, a number of non-government organizations
joined forces to form the Latin American Consortium on Agroe
cology and Development, and are promoting agroecological techniques 
which are sensitive to the complexities of local farming methods.  Programmes
introducing soil conservation practices and organic f
ertilization methods tripled or quadrupled yields within a year [18]. 
Successive studies have highlighted the productivity and sustainability of
traditional peasant farming in the Third World [2, 25]
 as well as in the North, according to a report published by the US 
National Academy of Sciences [26].
	
<p>Many, if not all Southern countries, still possess the indigenous 
genetic resources - requiring no further genetic modification - that can
guarantee a sustainable food supply. As Kothari writes [27],
   " Over centuries of agricultural practice, traditional societies 
have developed an incredible variety of crops and livestock. Some 200-250
flowering plants species have been domesticated, and gene
tic diversity amongst each of these is astonishing: in India alone, 
for instance, farmers have grown over 50,000 varieties of rice Oryza sativa.

<p>In a single village of north-east India, 70 varieties 
are being grown... farmers (especially women) repeatedly used and 
enhanced some varieties which were resistant to disease and drought and
flood, some which tasted nice, some which were coloured and u
seful for ritual purposes and some which were highly productive."
	
<p>In Brazil, hundreds of rural communities in the Northeast are 
responding to the current crisis in food production by organizing Communal
Seed Banks to recover traditional indigenous varieties and to 
promote sustainable agricultural development, with little or no 
government support [28].
	
<p>It is significant that the World Bank is planning sharp changes in 
policy to concentrate its efforts on small farmers in developing countries
[2]. It seems obvious that in order to guarantee long-ter
m food security and feed the world, we can do no better than take the 
aim of the Convention on Biological Diversity to heart, i.e., help to
conserve and sustain existing indigenous agricultural diver
sity world-wide, and to develop this diversity as the basis of a 
secure and nutritious food base for all. 

<p>Thus, there is no need for genetically modified crops. On the 
contrary, they will undermine food security and biodiversity. Under the
monopoly of transnational genetic manipulators' intellectual prop
erty rights, the livelihoods of small farmers will be further 
compromised, both by seed royalties and by restrictive practices of seed
certification. At the same time, the use of toxic non-discrimina
ting herbicides with herbicide resistant transgenic crops, will 
result in  irretrievable losses of indigenous agricultural and natural
biological diversity. 


<p>Current practice of gene biotechnology is misguided by wilful 
ignorance of genetics, in particular, of the new genetics

<p>There are, in addition, problems and hazards inherent to the practice 
of the technology itself, which makes the regulation of the technology, by a
legally binding international Biosafety Protocol und
er the Convention of Biodiversity, a matter of urgency.

<p>In a publication which aims to "provide consumers with clear and 
comprehensible information about products of the new [bio]technology" [1], we
are told that, "Research scientists can now precisely id
entify the individual gene that governs a desired trait, extract it, 
copy it and insert the copy into another organism. That organism (and its
offspring) will then have the desired trait.."(p.5).
	 
<p>This gives the impression that one gene controls one character trait, 
and transferring the gene results in the transfer of the corresponding trait
to the genetically modified organism, which can then
 pass it on indefinitely to future generations. It presents the 
process of genetic modification as a precise and simple operation. 	
	
<p>The above account - so typical of that found in publications 
promoting "public understanding" - is based on simplistic assumptions of
genetics that both classical geneticists and plant breeders have 
rejected for many years, and have been thoroughly invalidated by all 
the research findings since genetic engineering - currently referred to as
"genetic modification" - began 20 years ago. Unfortunat
ely, most molecular geneticists, apart from being absorbed into 

<p>industry, also lack training in classical genetics, and suffer from a severe
molecular myopia that prevents them from appreciating the 
implications and broader perspective of the findings in their own 
discipline. Consequently, the current practice of biotechnology is
(mis)guided and promoted to the public on the basis of an old, dis
credited paradigm, and therein lies the real danger.
	
<p>The contrasts between the assumptions of the old paradigm with the 
findings of new molecular genetics within the past 20 years are given below.
<pre>
	  The Old Genetics			  The New Genetics

1. Genes determine characters in		Genes function in a complex
   a linear, uni-directional and			non-linear network -

3. Genes and genomes cannot change		Genes and genomes can change

   breeding within the species,			so that any gene in any species

   isolated 'gene pool'				being transferred to any other
						species

</pre>	
<p>The relevant findings have been extensively reviewed beginning more 
than 10 years ago [29-35]. They show that genes function in an extremely
complex, interconnected network, so that ultimately, the e
xpression of each gene depends on that of every other. That is why an 
organism will tend to change in non-linear, unpredictable ways, even when a
single gene is introduced. (The effect is rather like
 ripples propagating from a pebble thrown into a pond, except that 
the pond is much more viscous and elastic than water.) Because there are tens
of thousands of genes in the genome, with several vari
ants of every gene, each individual will be unique, possessing its 
own combination of genes. In successive generations, individuals with yet
other combinations of genes will be created. The expressio
n of a given gene will differ from individual to individual simply 
because the genetic background consisting of all the other genes 
is different.
	
<p>The findings of molecular genetics also reveal that the genome itself 
is dynamic and fluid, and is engaged in constant feedback interactions with
the cellular and ecological environment. These intera
ctions normally serve to stabilize the genome, as well as gene 
expression. However, there are many processes that can destabilize genomes -
move genes around, mutate or delete genes, amplify copies o
f genes, or change genes wholesale - all of which keep genomes in a 
state of flux in evolutionary time [29]. Genes are even found to have jumped
horizontally between species that do not interbreed. U
nder certain conditions, disturbances can propagate through the 
physiological system to give repeatable alterations in the genome, which are
inherited in subsequent generations [31,32].  Some of thes
e changes are so specific that they are referred to as "directed 
mutations" or "adaptive mutations" [36].  Conversely, as demonstrated in
current transgenic experiments, introducing a single exotic g
ene into an organism can impact on the ecological environment. A 
common soil bacterium Klebsiella planticola, engineered to produce ethanol
from crop waste, was found to drastically inhibit the growt
h of wheat seedlings through  toxic effects on the mycorrhiza [37]. 
	
<p>The logical conclusion from all of the findings is that heredity - 
the stable reproduction of the same characteristics in organisms year after
year - cannot be due to the unchangeable nature of DNA, 
for DNA is inherently dynamic and fluid. Instead, it is due to the 
complex network of mutual, feed-back interrelationships connecting the
ecological environment to the physiology of the organism and 
to its genes. The new genetics completely invalidates the old 
reductionist paradigm. It re-affirms the ecological wisdom of indigenous
peoples all over the world, who have practised sustainable agric
ulture on the understanding that the biological nature of each 
organism or species is inextricably linked to its environment, and depends
ultimately on the entire ecosystem consisting of all other or
ganisms [40].
	
<p>The damages from intensive agricultural practices have indeed come 
about because they are based on the old reductionist paradigm, as Vandana Shiva
has argued so convincingly [41].
For the same reason
, agricultural biotechnology will bring new problems and hazards. 
Before one can appreciate them, it is necessary to understand what "genetic
modification" entails.

<p><B>What is "genetic modification"?</B>

<p>Books promoting "public understanding" of biotechnology (e.g. ref.1) 
usually begin by saying that there is no difference between crops bred by
traditional methods and those made by genetic modificati
on, except that the latter is much faster and more precise. These 
claims are false. "Genetic modification", or more specifically, "transgenic

technology" is a set of techniques for manipulating, or e
ngineering the genetic material, DNA, enabling molecular geneticists 
to cut and join, mutate, copy and multiply genes, and most importantly,
transfer genes between species. A major vehicle for geneti
c manipulation is artificially constructed, parasitic genetic 
elements, or vectors, used to multiply copies of genes, and to carry and
smuggle genes into cells which would normally exclude them. Once
 inside the cells, these vectors slot themselves into the host's 
genome, to genetically transform the cells to make transgenic organisms. The
integration of the vector DNA, as indeed any foreign DNA 
into the host-cell genome is a very imprecise, random process, known 
to cause many genetic disturbances with harmful or lethal effects [42], and
this is borne out by the low success rate of creating 
desired transgenic organisms. Typically, a large number of cells or 
embryos have to be infected with the vector, or in some cases, injected
directly with the foreign genes, just to obtain a few organ
isms that successfully express the transgene(s).
	
<p>In order to help recover transformed cells, it is necessary to 
incorporate selectable "marker genes" into the vectors for gene transfer, or
into the DNA introduced into cells directly. The most commo
nly used markers are antibiotic resistance genes, which enable 
transformed cells to be selected in the presence of high concentrations of

antibiotics. 
	
<p>Vectors used in transgenic technology are usually a mosaic 
recombination of natural genetic parasites from different sources, including
viruses causing cancers and other diseases in animals and plant
s, with their pathogenic functions "crippled" [43]. The vector most 
widely used in plant genetic manipulation is derived from a tumour-inducing
plasmid carried by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaci
ens. In animals, vectors are constructed from retroviruses causing 
cancers and other diseases. Thus, a vector currently used in fish has a
framework from the Moloney murine leukaemic virus, which cau
ses leukaemia in mice, but can infect all mammalian cells. It also 
has bits from the Rous Sarcoma virus, causing sarcomas in chickens, and from
the vesicular stomatitis virus causing oral lesions in 
cattle, horses, pigs and humans [44]. 


<p>The following summarizes why genetic modification differs radically 
from conventional breeding.




<p><B>Differences Between Genetic Modification and Conventional Breeding</B>

<p>1. Genetic modification use laboratory techniques to recombine 
genetic material, and to transfer genes between species that often have very
little probability of exchanging genes otherwise.

<p>2. While conventional breeding shuffle different forms (alleles) of 
the same genes between closely related species, genetic modification enables
completely new (exotic) genes to be introduced, with u
npredictable effects on the physiology and biochemistry of the 

resulting transgenic organism.

<p>3. Gene multiplication, and a high proportion of gene transfers are 
mediated by vectors which have the following undesirable characteristics.
	

<p>They are derived from disease-causing viruses, plasmids and mobile 
genetic elements - genetic parasites that have the ability to invade cells
and insert themselves into the cell's genome, causing gen
etic damage and unpredictable physiological and biochemical effects.
	
<p>Many carry genes for antibiotic resistance, which will speed up the 
evolution of antibiotic resistance among pathogens, thus exacerbating a major
public health problem.
They are designed to cross species barriers to shuttle genes between 
species. Their wide host range means that they can infect many species, and
in the process pick up genes from viruses of all the s
pecies to create new pathogens.
	
<p>They are increasingly designed to overcome cellular mechanisms which 
exclude or inactivate foreign DNA, and are hence more and more efficient in
breaking down the integrity of species.

	
<p>These characteristics of genetic modification are the sources of new 
problems and hazards.



<p><B>Hazards from genetic modification - due to the interconnected genetic 
network</B>

<p>Because no gene ever functions in isolation, there will almost always 
be unexpected and unintended "side-effects"  from the gene or genes
transferred into an organism.
	 
<p>One major concern over transgenic foods is their potential to be 
allergenic, which has become a concrete issue since a transgenic soybean
containing a brazil-nut gene was found to be allergenic [45].
 Recent studies suggest that allergenicity in plants is connected to 
proteins involved in defence against pests and diseases. Thus, transgenic
plants engineered for resistance to diseases and pests m
ay have a higher allergenic potential than the unmodified plants [23, 
46].
	
<p>Another instructive case is a transgenic yeast engineered for 
increased rate of fermentation with multiple copies of one of its own genes,
which resulted in the accumulation of the metabolite, methyl
glyoxal, at toxic, mutagenic levels [47]. This should serve as a 
warning against applying the "familiarity principle" in risk assessment. We
simply do not have sufficient understanding of the princip
les of physiological regulation to enable us to categorize, a priori, 
those genetic modifications that will pose a risk and those that do not. It
is a strong argument in favour of the case by case ap
proach.

<p><b>GREENPEACE TARGETS "HERRING DERBY" IN ENGLISH CHANNEL
</b></p>
<b><p>AMSTERDAM DECEMBER 11TH 1996</b> 

<p>The Greenpeace ship 'MV Sirius' today
started to prevent herring trawlers from fishing in the English
Channel near the French town of Dieppe. Greenpeace activists used
inflatables to atttach themselves with ropes to the stern of the
fishing vessel Helen Mary, preventing it from hauling its nets while
other activists attached a banner to the Helen Mary, reading "save our
seas". 

<p>The ongoing actions are directed against mostly Dutch and German
freezer trawlers, fishing primarily  for fish eggs, which are exported
to Japan as a New Year's celebration delicacy. 

<p>The actions take place at the so-called 'Herring Derby' in December
when shoals of herring are forced to run the gauntlet of powerful
modern fishing vessels as the fish pass from the North Sea to the
English Channel to spawn. 

<p>"Greenpeace is demanding an immediate end to the herring-roe fishery,
" said Greenpeace campaigner Just van den Broek, on  board of the
Sirius, adding that "the practice of specifically targetting the eggs
of a seriously depleted fish stock is absurd". The North Sea herring
stock this year reached a historical low of 500.000 tons. 

<p>In July 1996, the EU took an emergency action which meant a cut-back
in herring fisheries of 50%. According to Greenpeace however this was
insufficient, since it would only lead to a restoration to the Minimum
Biologically Acceptable level of 800.000 ton. Below this level the
chance of stock collapse increases dramatically. 

<p>The current situation is comparable to the 1970s which saw a dramatic
collapse in this fishing industry resulting in a total ban on herring
catch for six years. In the 1980's the policy aimed at a stock of 2.2
million. However, the stock only grew to 1.3 million tons in 1989
because of the failure of the European fisheries policy.

<p>"North Sea fish stocks are being over fished. Greenpeace will do
everything in it's power to protect the North Sea ecosystem and
prevent the continued deterioration of these fish stocks. Stopping the
short sighted fishing on spawning stocks is part of this effort." said
van den Broek.  

<p>Note to  Editors: The Helen Mary was subsidised by the EU and the
German Government Note, approximately 12 million DM. The vessel can
freeze 280 tonnes of fish a day, and can store some 4,000 tonnes on
board.<br><br>

<p><b>GREENPEACE WELCOMES WORLD HERITAGE NOMINATION FOR BAIKAL AND KAMCHATKA

<p>DECEMBER 6TH AMSTERDAM:</b>

<p> Greenpeace today welcomed the news that the World Heritage Committee has officially added Lake Baikal and the Volcanoes of Kamchatka to the World Heritage List.  Greenpeace Russia
worked closely with the Federal and regional Governments in Russia to prepare the two World Heritage Nominations which will protect an area of more than 12 million hectares in Russia.

<p>"Today is a great day for nature conservation in Russia", said Sergei Tsyplenkov, from Greenpeace Russia. "Lake Baikal is the largest fresh water lake in the world, and the Kamchatka volcanoes and surrounding forests are one of the most stunning landscapes in Russia.  We are
delighted that these two sites have now been placed on the World Heritage List." 

<p>Greenpeace Russia has worked on the establishment of World Heritage Sites in Russia since 1994.  One year ago, the 3.2 million hectare Komi Virgin Forests in the Ural Mountains were placed on the World Heritage List; the culmination of a campaign by Greenpeace to stop
logging and mining in the area.

<p>Lake Baikal, in central Siberia, is over 700 kilometres long and up to one and a half kilometres deep. It contains fifteen per cent of the fresh water on the planet; as much water as all the Great Lakes
combined. The Lake Baikal World Heritage Site includes a belt of forest adjacent to the Lake . 

<p>The total area of the nomination is 8.8 million hectares, about the size of Austria, making it one of the world's largest World Heritage sites. Lake Baikal is home to a unique species of fresh water seal, as well as numerous fish and mammal species. "The World Heritage Listing strongly supports Greenpeace's effort to close a pulp mill which still pumps toxic effluent into the Lake", said Tsyplenkov. 

<p>Kamchatka is a peninsula in the Russian North Pacific. The World Heritage Site includes active volcanoes, geysers, bubbling mud cauldrons and lava streams, set in pristine forests and fast flowing
salmon streams.  Several new National Parks were created  in the last year so that the Kamchatka World Heritage Site would contain more of the region's outstanding features. The protected area measures 3.3 million hectares and will help to protect Kamtschatka from devastating mining plans, that have been proposed for the region.

<p>Greenpeace will continue its work to establish further World Heritage Sites, and has been contracted by the Russian Federal Government to prepare nominations for: the Karelia forests - a belt of old-growth forests extending down the border between Russia and Finland, the Altai Mountains - a pristine, high mountain region in Western Siberia and the Sikhote Alin Mountains - home to the Siberian Tiger, and many other rare and threatened plants and animals in the Russian Far East.

<p>"Russia has some of the most outstanding and well preserved forests and wildlands in the northern hemisphere. Many of its protected areas are of world importance," said Patrick Anderson, forest campaigner from Greenpeace International. "Greenpeace welcomes the chance to
cooperate with the peoples of Russia and their governments in this important conservation work."

<p><b>RGI TRAWLER AMERICAN MONARCH SAILS FOR SOUTHERN PACIFIC WATERS</b></p>
<b><p>SANTIAGO/ CHILE,  DECEMBER 3RD 1996</b> 

<p>With habitual secrecy and a lack of public information, the super factory vessel, "American
Monarch", sailed yesterday from Tomrefjord, Norway, heading towards Panama. The vessel departed, with a Norwegian crew which includes 20 Chilean members, without obtaining governmental permission to operate in the southern fisheries of Chile and with an increasing opposition by Chilean citizens.

<p>The transnational company, RGI/American Seafood Co., has been searching for alternative fishing grounds for the "American Monarch" after the governmental rejection issued by the Undersecretary of Fisheries in Chile. After another rejection from the Malvinas/Falkland administration, in  November, the
executives of the RGI/ASFC, have attempted to start negociations to operate temporarily in Peruvian waters. During the last weeks RGI, has tried to send the "American Monarch" the southern waters of Chile to do " fishing research".

<p>It is very likely that the "American Monarch" will endevor to operate during the next 6 months, over exploiting Peruvian fisheries or in the international waters of the southern cone of Latin America, while waiting for the judicial resolution of the transnational's appeal before Chilean courts.

<p>"The Peruvian government could have imported a large environmental and social problem, that Chilean and Norwegian societies have fought hard to prevent. This clearly shows us, the real lack of responsability and commitment of American Seafoods in the area of conservation of marine
resources. In the end, this transnational is going to operate in which ever country does not have strong regulations and environmental controls, to prevent the impact of the most modern factory trawler on the planet", said David Stenerud, from the Fisheries Campaign of Greenpeace International.

<p>"This secretive action on the part of American Seafood, says much more than their formal statements; it indicates that all of the aprehentions of the Chilean fishermen and citizens are correct, and should be taken into consideration by the judges trying the appeal of the "American Monarch". They must reject the American seafoods appeal in order to defend the fishery resources of Chile, Aysan and Magellan regions, all of which are common property of the nation," said Juan Carlos Cardenas, from  the fisheries campaign of Greenpeace Chile.

<p><b>GREENPEACE MV SIRIUS TOWED AWAY AND CAPTAIN ARRESTED FOR BLOCKADING
GENETICALLY CONTAMINATED SOYA  SHIPMENT

<p>AMSTERDAM, NOVEMBER 23RD 1996</b>
<P>The captain of the Greenpeace ship MV
Sirius was arrested today, and the ship towed away by Dutch police
after activists from the environmental organisation started a protest
against the import of genetically contaminated soybeans by the US
grain company Cargill. 

<P>The Sirius action against the bulk carrier Pawnee started around 12h00
when Greenpeace activists in inflatables painted the slogan " No X

soya " on the ship as it steamed along the canal leading to Amsterdam.
At about 15h30, the Sirius occupied the berth of the Pawnee, thus
preventing her from unloading. Soon afterward, the Amsterdam
Harbourmaster issued a temporary sailing prohibition for the 100
metres waters around the berth and Greenpeace campaigners entered a
dialogue with the Cargill company. 

<P>At 18h30, Albert Kuiken - the captain of the Sirius -  was arrested by
the Dutch police because he refused to move the ship until Cargill
agreed to take steps towards the separation of genetically engineered
soybeans. At 19h00 approximately, more police boarded the ship and

tugboats towed her 200 metres outside the 100 metres "exclusion zone"
where she was released. 

<P>On 14th of November the European Parliament called on member
governments to segregate genetically engineered soya. "Cargill has
already ignored the wishes of European consumers, retailers and
environmental groups to have the genetically engineered soya
separated" said Isabel McCrea from Greenpeace International. " We want
and we will keep the option of the freedom to demonstrate against this
lack of consideration for the consumers' will and for the
environment." 

<P>These events occurred only 24 hours after the Sirius was freed from a
9 day long seizure in Antwerp, after being issued with a court order
to pay around $US 25,000 for lost earnings, when Greenpeace delayed
the unloading of a shipment of genetically contaminated soya from the
Malaysian vessel Bunga Saga Empa on 10th November.



<P>"This kind of heavy-handed response will not deter Greenpeace from its
campaign against genetic engineering, which will be continuing over
the coming weeks and months" said McCrea.

<P>The captain of the Sirius was released on Saturday late evening
without charges.<br>

<p><b>GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS RELEASED FROM JAIL 

<p>NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANNA, NOVEMBER 20TH 1996</b>
<p>Five
Greenpeace activists arrested yesterday at the Cargill grain
terminal for protesting the companies export of genetically
engineered soybeans were released today.  The activists (Peter
Bradley, Anibal Rivera, Monica Rhode, David DeRosa, Tanya
Whitford) have been charged with criminal trespass and were
held over night at St. John the Baptist Parish and were
released with $3,000 bond. 

<p>In the past week Greenpeace has escalated its campaign against
the new genetically engineered soybean created by chemical
giant Monsanto and exported by grain companies Cargill, ADM
and others.

<p>Last week in Louisiana, Greenpeace and representatives from
the National Family Farm Coalition and National Family Farm
Defenders came together to protest at a Monsanto facility on
the Mississippi river and jointly demanded that Monsanto take
the genetically altered soybeans off the market.  Also last
week, Greenpeace activists blockaded the Acher Daniels Midland
(ADM) grain facility in Destrehan, Louisiana and called for
the grain facility to ensure separation of the genetically
altered soybeans from natural soybeans.  On Friday, ADM
lawyers served Greenpeace with notice of a court injunction
and a restraining order that would prohibit any further
protests at ADM facilities.    

<p>On Thursday the European Parliament voted to call for the
segregation of the genetically engineered soybeans from the
normal soybeans.  Cargill has refused to separate the soybeans
sparking protests in Europe and the United States.  
Greenpeace believes genetically engineered organisms pose a
serious risk to the environment, human health and the future
of the U.S. farm economy.  Greenpeace vowed today to continue
its  international campaign against genetically engineered
soybeans

<p><b>GREENPEACE STOPS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SOYBEAN 
DESTINED FOR EUROPE ON MISSISSIPPI RIVER




<p>MISSISSIPPI RIVER, LOUISIANNA, NOVEMBER 19TH 1996</b>
<p>Today , the
Greenpeace ship 'MV Greenpeace' sailed up the Mississippi River to
confront food industry giant Cargill at their grain facility in
Laplace , 60 miles outside of New Orleans.  Activists in inflatable
boats identified a ship being loaded with  Monsanto's genetically
engineered soybeans and "branded" the ship with bright yellow
posters tha t read 'X - Genetic Experiment'.  Meanwhile six other
activists climbed onto the grain facility, preventing the loading of
the genetically engineered soybeans.

<p>"Consumers are refusing to buy genetically altered soybeans because
of the risks to their health and the environment.  By refusing to
keep separate the genetically altered soybeans, companies like Ca
rgill are putting U.S. markets at risk," said Greenpeace
International spokesperson Michelle Sheather onboard the MV
Greenpeace.

<p>Soybeans are the United States' second largest agricultural export,
with approximately 40% of the crop exported to Europe.  Over one
hundred European retailers, food manufacturers, and food processor s
have refused to accept Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans
due to concerns of health hazards and environmental safety. 
Monsanto is the chemical company responsible for the creation of the
g enetically altered soybean.  Cargill is one the main companies
responsible for the export of the genetically engineered soybeans.

<p>Last week in Louisiana, Greenpeace and representatives from the
National Family Farm Coalition and National Family Farm Defenders
came together to protest at a Monsanto facility on the Mississippi
ri ver and jointly demanded that Monsanto take the genetically
altered soybeans off the market.  Also last week, Greenpeace

activists blockaded the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) grain facility
in Destreh an, Louisiana and called for the grain facility to ensure
separation of the genetically altered soybeans from natural
soybeans.  On Friday, ADM lawyers served Greenpeace with notice of a
court injunc tion and a restraining order that would prohibit any
further protests at ADM facilities.

<p>Last week in Europe, Greenpeace blockaded shipments of soybeans
being imported by Cargill as they arrived into Antwerp and Ghent in
Belgium. The protests were both ended following court injunctions f
ining Greenpeace 30 000 dollar for every hour that the protests
continued. Over the weekend Greenpeace activists painted 'No X-soya'
on both sides of another Cargill vessel, just before she entered B
elgium waters.  The Greenpeace ship the Sirius has been impounded in
Belgium since last Thursday.

<p>Greenpeace has complied with all of the court orders but said its
campaign would continue. Greenpeace believes genetically engineered
organisms pose a serious risk to the environment, human health an d
the future health of the U.S farm economy.

<p><b>US GRAIN GIANT ATTEMPTS TO GAG GREENPEACE EUROPEAN SOYA
PROTEST   




<p>ANTWERP, NOVEMBER 15TH 1996</b>
<p>Only 24 hours after the
European Parliament called on member governments to segregate
and label genetically engineered soya, Greenpeace has been
prevented from taking action to protest against the next
shipment of genetically contaminated soya into Belgium.
 
<p>The US grain distributor and processor Cargill has obtained a
preventative injunction from the Belgian courts prohibiting
Greenpeace from getting within one kilometre of the ship
Stanislaw Kulczynski due to arrive into Antwerp this weekend.
Fines of one million Belgian francs per hour will be imposed
if Greenpeace breaks the injunction.
 
<p>"So much for free speech," said Greenpeace campaigner Isabelle
Meister. "Cargill has already ignored the wishes of European
consumers, retailers and environmental groups and now even the
European Parliament. We thought we at least had the option of
the freedom to demonstrate but incredibly the Belgian courts
have joined forces with a US multinational to prevent
legitimate public protest. We hope this action will be
condemned by the European Union."  
<p>Last weekend Cargill obtained a court order against Greenpeace
when activists held up a shipment of soya on board a Polish
registered bulk carrier coming from the USA. This injunction
stipulated fines of one million Belgian francs per hour if the
protest had continued.
 
<p>Greenpeace reluctantly called off its action but held up a
second delivery of soya the following day being delivered into
Gent by the Bunga Saga Empa. The Malaysian owners also
obtained a court order to halt the action and the Greenpeace
ship the MV Sirius has been impounded in Antwerp docks.   
Greenpeace has launched an international campaign to halt the
release of genetically engineered organisms into the
environment. Protests have taken place throughout Europe and
the United States. This week the MV Greenpeace is on the
Mississippi outside New Orleans. Yesterday 17 Greenpeace
activists were arrested when they chained themselves to barges
and an unloading facility at another major US soya
distributor, ADM.

<p><b>GREENPEACE HALTS OPERATIONS AT ADM GRAIN TERMINAL


<p>NEW ORLEANS, LA, NOVEMBER 14TH, 1996</b>
<p>Today Greenpeace occupied the ADM grain
terminal located 60 miles outside of New Orleans.  Activists wearing blue
coveralls with "Genetic Experiment"  written on them and white hard hats,
climbed into and attached themselves onto the 200 foot soybean barges that were
being prepared for export.  These actions caused grain operators to stop all
unloading operations.  Additional activists dressed in white uniforms and
wearing protective face mask and goggles chained themselves to the front
entryway of the grain facility. Today's action marks day four of  the week-long
Greenpeace protest against the release of  genetically engineered soybeans into
the marketplace. 
 
<p>Monsanto's genetically altered "Roundup Ready" soybeans are currently being
exported to Europe and are set to hit the market for the first time this year.
A large fraction of the U.S. soybean output is exported to Europe, and 90% of
those exports go through the port of New Orleans.  The beans are engineered to
tolerate Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.  Environmentalists, farmers and
consumers are concerned about the potential environmental impact of the release
of genetically modified organisms and the subsequent threat to human health.
 
<p>"These grain companies must be stopped from contaminating the environment and
the food we eat with these genetic experiments," said Greenpeace spokesperson
Beth Fitzgerald.
 
<p>Soybeans are the United States' second largest agricultural export, with over
40% of the total crop exported to Europe last year.  Over one hundred European
retailers, food manufacturers, and food processors have already refused to
accept Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans due to concerns of health
hazards and environmental safety. While they account for only 2% of this years
crop,  Roundup Ready soybeans are planned to be mixed with normal soybeans
before export, therefore contaminating the entire supply.  Loss of this $6
billion market, due to Monsanto's contamination of these beans by mixing, would
cripple the American farm economy.
 
<p>"It is an outrage that this experiment is being forced on consumers around the
world without their knowledge or consent. These contaminated soybeans must be
taken off the market." said Greenpeace international genetic engineering
campaigner Michelle Sheather,  who was chained onto one of the soybean barges.
 
<p>Greenpeace believes that genetically engineered organisms should not be
released into the environment.  They are artificial life forms and their
behavior is unpredictable once planted.  They are able to reproduce and may
mutate to create new organisms which could do irreversible damage to the
environment.  Greenpeace demands that Monsanto's genetically engineered
soybeans be immediately taken off the market.

<p><b>GREENPEACE PROTESTERS ARRESTED WHILE OCCUPYING GRAIN TERMINAL  
<p>DESTREHEN, LOUISIANA, NOVEMBER 14TH 1996 </b>
<p>Seventeen
Greenpeace activists were arrested today as they occupied the
Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) grain terminal located 60 miles
outside of New Orleans.  Eight activists wearing blue
coveralls with "Genetic Experiment"  written on them and white
hard hats, climbed into and attached themselves onto the 200
foot soybean barges that were being prepared for export. 
These actions caused grain operators to stop all unloading
operations for  over  three hours.  Another nine activists
dressed in white uniforms and wearing protective face masks
and goggles chained themselves to the front entryway of the
grain facility. Today's action marks day four of  the week-
long Greenpeace protest against the release of  genetically
engineered soybeans into the marketplace. 
 
<p>Prior to arrest, the activists were informed by police that,
if they did not disengage themselves voluntarily, pepper spray
would be used and all participants in the protest would be
arrested. 
 
<p>Today the European Parliament adopted with overwhelming
majority a resolution to call on US soybean producers and all
other producers of genetically modified foodstuffs to
segregate those organisms from conventional ones.  Monsanto's
genetically altered "Roundup Ready" soybeans are currently
being exported to Europe and are set to hit the market for the
first time this year.  "These grain companies must be stopped
from contaminating the environment and the food we eat with
these genetic experiments," said Greenpeace spokesperson Beth
Fitzgerald.
 
<p>Soybeans are the United States' second largest agricultural
export, with over 40% of the total crop exported to Europe
last year.  Over one hundred European retailers, food
manufacturers, and food processors have already refused to
accept Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans due to
concerns of health hazards and environmental safety. While
they account for only 2% of this years crop,  Roundup Ready
soybeans are planned to be mixed with normal soybeans before
export, thereby contaminating the entire supply.  Loss of this
$6 billion market, due to Monsanto's contamination of these
beans by mixing, would cripple the American farm economy.
 
<p>"It is an outrage that this experiment is being forced on
consumers around the world without their knowledge or consent.
These contaminated soybeans must be taken off the market."
said Greenpeace International Genetic Engineering campaigner
Michelle Sheather,  who was chained onto one of the soybean
barges.  
 
<p>Greenpeace believes that genetically engineered organisms
should not be released into the environment.  They are
artificial life forms and their behaviour is unpredictable
once planted.  They are able to reproduce and may mutate to
create new organisms which could do irreversible damage to the
environment.  Greenpeace demands that Monsanto's genetically
engineered soybeans be immediately taken off the market.<br>

<p><b>GREENPEACE HALTS  SOYA EXPORT OPERATION IN USA
<p>NEW ORLEANS, NOVEMBER 14TH 1996 </b>
<p>Greenpeace's campaign
against genetic engineering crossed the Atlantic today as
activists stopped the unloading of genetically contaminated
soya at a facility just outside New Orleans, the US's main
soya export terminal.
 
<p>About 15 activists  --  wearing overalls with "Genetic
Experiment" written on them -- chained themselves to barges
and unloading facilities at the ADM grain terminal just
outside New Orleans. This is the first crop of the genetically
engineered soya and ADM has refused to segregate it from
normal soya.  
 
<p>"These grain companies must be stopped from contaminating the
environment and the food we eat with these genetic
experiments," said Greenpeace campaigner Beth Fitzgerald.
 
<p>Soya beans are the United States' second largest agricultural
export, with over 40 per cent of the total crop exported going
to Europe. Opposition to Monsanto's genetically engineered
soya bean amongst European retailers, food manufacturers and
food processors is growing. Some have already refused to
accept the soya due to concerns about health hazards and
environmental safety.  
 
<p>As the US protest got underway the European parliament in
Strasbourg was about to vote on a resolution calling for the
segregation and labelling of the genetically engineered soya.
This would be a direct challenge to the decision already taken
by the European Commission to allow the soya into Europe
without labelling.
 
<p>Only yesterday the Commission delayed an expected announcement
on the approval of another genetically engineered crop -- Ciba
Geigy's corn.  
 
<p>Meanwhile the Greenpeace ship the MV Sirius was impounded in
Antwerp, Belgium after being issued with a court order to pay
around $US18,000 for lost earnings when Greenpeace delayed the
unloading of a shipment of genetically contaminated soya from
the Malaysian vessel Bunga Saga Empa on Sunday.

<p><b>RGI TRAWLER AMERICAN MONARCH TURNED AWAY BY PUBLIC PRESSURE 
</b></p><p><B>Greenpeace and Chilean coastal communities celebrate protection of
Southern fish stocks

<p>AMSTERDAM / SANTIAGO DE CHILE, NOVEMBER 14TH, 1996 </B>

<P>In an about-face,
Resource Group International (RGI) has confirmed that it will not send
its supertrawler American Monarch to Chile's already overexploited and
poorly managed fishing grounds as planned. 

<P>The company's U-turn follows a long campaign by Greenpeace and
represents a huge victory for the Chilean people who had voiced their
strong opposition to the ship's entry into Chilean waters. Almost 100

metres long with state-of-the-art fish finding technology, the US$ 65

million American Monarch is capable of fishing and processing more
fish each day than any other vessel in the world. 

<P>"RGI's retreat is one step forward for protecting the region's marine
biodiversity from overfishing," said Greenpeace campaigner Juan Carlos
Cardenas on board the Rainbow Warrior. "It sends a strong signal to
richer countries to stop looking to the South to find the fishing
grounds that are already overexploited in their own seas and oceans". 

<P>Public outrage from many different sectors within Chile resulted in
the Chilean Government's rejection of the American Monarch's licence
to fish. The company's appeal against the license rejection has so far
been unsuccessful and is in the hands of the Chilean courts. 

<P>Over the past months, Chilean coastal communities and local
small-scale fishermen have rallied around the Greenpeace flagship
Rainbow Warrior to oppose RGI's plans. Only three weeks ago,
Greenpeace protested at the baptism of the American Monarch in Norway,
while the Rainbow warrior prepared for the arrival of the American
Monarch in Chilean waters.

<P>Greenpeace demands that RGI now releases any new plans for the
American Monarch and urges prospective countries to follow the Chilean
example. "The American Monarchs of the world belong to history", said
Greenpeace campaigner David Stenerud from the Rainbow Warrior. "Any
region or country approached by RGI for permission to fish in their
waters should look long and hard at why Chile said NO,"

<br><br><hr><br>
<B>Note to Editors:
<P>
The Rainbow Warrior will celebrate together with coastal fishermen and
all the Chilean organisations and individuals who made this victory
possible on Saturday in Valparaiso. Please contact Greenpeace Chile on
++56 2 777 95 70 for more details.</B>

<p><b>GREENPEACE QUARANTINES CONTAMINATED SOYBEAN SHIPMENTS

<p>NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, NOVEMBER 13TH, 1996 </b>

<p>Today the
international environmental group Greenpeace escalated its
campaign against Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans by
launching a full investigation of five grain terminals along
the Mississippi River.  Greenpeace activists, wearing white
inspection suits and protection masks examined the barges and
labelled the sides with signs that read " X - Genetic
Experiment" and "Biohazard Monsanto Soybeans."      
 
<p>"By allowing these mutant soybeans to contaminate U.S.
exports, these grain companies are spreading an environmental
hazard and putting consumers at risk," said Tzeporah Berman
from onboard the MV Greenpeace.
 
<p>Soybeans are the United States' second largest agricultural
export, with approximately 40% of the crop exported to Europe. 
Over one hundred European retailers, food manufactures, and
food processors, have refused to accept Monsanto's genetically
engineered soybeans due to concerns of health hazards and
environmental safety.
 
<p>Amounting to less than 2% of this soybean crop, Roundup Ready
soybeans are planned to be mixed with normal soybeans before
export, therefore contaminating the entire supply.  Loss of
this 6 billion dollar market,  due to the mixing of these
beans,  will devastate the American farm economy.
 
<p>This week Greenpeace activist in Switzerland, hung a banner on
the headquarters of Nestle, calling for the company to ensure
that their products were free of contaminated soybeans.  In
Germany, 40 activist were arrested yesterday for protesting at
a soybean oil mill, owned by U.S. grain company, Archer
Daniels Midland (ADM).
 
<p>Michelle Sheather, Greenpeace International spokesperson
concluded, "Greenpeace will continue to protest around the
world to stop the release of alien species into the natural
environment."

<p><b>NO FORCE FEEDING WITH GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD BY NESTLE



<p>VEVEY SWITZERLAND, NOVEMBER 11TH 1996</b>
<p>This morning Greenpeace
activists climbed onto the roof of Nestle's international headquarter
in Vevey (Switzerland) and

roped down the building enrolling a banner. With the banner-hanging
and with loudspeaker messages in different European languages
Greenpeace protested against the force feeding of the consumers with
genetically engineered (GE) soya. After heavy protests all over
Europe during the last few weeks almost all the main foodproducers
gave in to the growing consumer-pressure: Kraft

Jakobs-Suchard guarantees their European customers GE-free
soya-products, and even Unilever is already giving such guarantees in
some European countries. With its stubborn position in favour of
genetically engineered foods Nestle stands alone and in absolute
contrast to the consumer's demand.

<p>This morning Greenpeace activists enrolled a huge banner on the front
of the Nestle-headquarter in Vevey (Switzerland) saying &lt;Gene Food:
Force Fed by Nestle&gt; and showing a GE-coockoo egg in Nestle's
bird's-nest (Nestle-logo). Greenpeace calls on the international food
producer to resign the use of the genetically engineered soya. The
series of protests against the scandalous intimidation of consumers to
be force-fed with genetically engineered soya against their will is
growing rapidly all over Europe. Soya and its components - like the
bonding agent lecithin - are found in about 30'000 foodstuffs (60 % of
all food-products). Claiming that a seperation of GE-beans from
conventional beans is impossible American and European multinational
companies tried to confront the European consumers with a "fait
accompli". Today the US-group Monsanto who produced the GE-soya, and
the Nestle-group stand alone with the convenient lie of the inevitable
import of the GE-soy beans.

<p>Not only is the seperation of the Monsanto-soya possible, it is even
explicitly demanded by Monsanto. Many US-farmers have signed contracts
with Monsanto saying that the company will buy back the beans as seeds
for the next crop. Already two weeks ago Greenpeace published a list
with more than 40 American and Canadian traders which offer GE-free
soya. Greenpeace demands Nestle to use this offer and respect the
consumer's wish for GE-free food. 

<p>While the responsible Swiss federal bureau ( for human health) still
has not decided on the admission of the GE-soybean, the next
genetically engineered plant is threatening to soon be found on Swiss
dinner-tables: The Swiss multinational company Ciba has made an
application to import its genetically engineered corn. In the Euroean
Union the decision will officially be made this week. Greenpeace is in
posession of EU-internal documents which show that the admission is
already decided upon allthough the scientific comission that was
called upon  because of the resistance of 14 of the 15 members still
has not given its final verdict.

<p><b>FOOD INDUSTRY STIFLES GENETIC ENGINEERING DEBATE WITH SECOND
COURT ORDER AGAINST GREENPEACE ACTIONS 


<p>GENT, BELGIUM NOVEMBER 10TH, 1996 </b>

<p>Greenpeace's second
major action within 48 hours to try to prevent contaminated
soya beans getting into European food has again been thwarted
by a court order.
 
<p>Vamo Mills, 55 per cent owned by oil and margarine
manufacturer Van Demoortele, and Gent Grain Terminal obtained
an injunction forcing Greenpeace to halt its blockade of the
latest delivery of genetically engineered soya from the United
States. Greenpeace ship the MV Sirius had been occupying the
berth of the bulk carrier Bunga Saga Empat in Gent, Belgium,
for about five hours, in order to prevent it unloading its
cargo.
 
<p>The court order stipulated that Greenpeace would be fined one
million Belgian francs per person for every hour that the
protest continued. It was presented to Greenpeace around
midday and required Greenpeace to leave immediately.
 
<p>"We hope the public will recognise these moves as yet another
attempt by the food giants to withhold information about what
is going into our food and to stifle debate about the whole
issue of genetically engineered organisms," said Greenpeace
campaigner Isabel McCrea.
 
<p>"The food industry has decided to force genetically engineered
food down our throats. They are not even prepared to discuss
the issue. When Greenpeace tries to draw the public's
attention to what is happening they bring in lawyers and court
actions."
 
<p>On Thursday, Greenpeace held up the unloading of a shipment of
genetically contaminated soya beans being imported by the
grain company Cargill as it arrived into Antwerp, Belgium. The
action ended after 24 hours following a similar court action
from Cargill. Greenpeace complied with the court order but
said its campaign would continue. Greenpeace believes
genetically engineered organisms pose a serious risk to
biodiversity and should not be released into the environment.

Mills, 55 per cent owned by oil and margarine manufacturer Van
Demoortele.

<p>Some 25 activists from 12 countries using inflatable boats intend to
chain themselves to the anchor chain of the Sirius thus preventing
port authorities from moving the Greenpeace vessel.

<p>Greenpeace is calling on Vamo Mills to segregate genetically
engineered soya from the natural beans and to refuse to accept further
shipments of genetically altered beans.

<p>The US shipment is believed to contain Monsanto's Roundup Ready soya
beans which have been genetically manipulated to be resistant to the
weedkiller Roundup produced by the US agrochemical mulitnational.

<p>Soya beans are currently used in 60 per cent of proccessed food in
supermarkets.

<p>"The public is being used as guinea pigs by companies like Monsanto
which are forcing them to accept genetically manipulated products in
their food without their knowledge or consent," said Greenpeace
campaigner Martin Besieux. 

<p>"Millers likes Vamo and processign companies like Unilever should
acknowledge the public concern and demand segregation."

<p>On Thursday Greenpeace held up the unloading of a shipment of
genetically altered soya beans imported by grain company Cargill
arriving into Antwerp in Belgium. The action ended after 24 hours when
Cargill was granted a court order threatening one million Belgian
franc fines per hour if the blockade continued. Greenpeace complied
with the court order but said its campaign.

<p>Greenpeace believes that genetically engineered organisms shold not be
released into the environment. They are alien life forms and once
planted their behaviour is unpredictable. The may be able to reproduce
and mutate creating organisms which could do irreversible damage to
the environment.

<p><b>CARGILL COURT INJUNCTION STOPS GREENPEACE 
BLOCKADE OF GENETECH SOYA 


<p>ANTWERP, NOVEMBER 8TH 1996</b>
<p>A court injunction has ended a  24 hour 
Greenpeace blockade of one of the first
shipments from the United States believed to contain genetically
engineered soya beans..

<p>The order stipulated that Greenpeace would be fined 1,000,000 Belgian
francs for every hour that the protest continued and set a 1 km
exclusion zone around the ship. Greenpeace hung a banner on the
Cargill unloading facility stating  Genetic experiment - don t buy it
, before the ship came within 1 km of the dock.

<p>Cargill obtained the court order and it was delivered by a court
official to the Greenpeace boat, Sirius, at 16.32 pm . It required
Greenpeace to withdraw, within in one hour,  all activists and boats
from the lock where 

the Polish bulk carrier Ziemia Zamojska had been held since 5.30 pm
Thursday. Activists chained an inflatable boat to the rudder of the
vessel.

<p> Just like consumers Greenpeace had no choice but to end its blockade
 of 
this shipment,  said Greenpeace campaigner Isabelle McCrea.

<p> These heavy handed tactics of Cargill are typical of the approach by
 the 
multinational companies which are forcing  genetically engineered food
onto consumers without their knowledge or their consent,  said McCrea.
Greenpeace is calling on U.S grain giant Cargill to keep their
 genetically engineered soya beans separate from natural soya beans.

<p>McCrea said  obviously Greenpeace  could not  afford  such a large
potential fine and  reluctantly called off its action.  But this is
not the end of Greenpeace s campaign against  genetically engineered
organisms,  she said.

<p>McCrea said the action had been successful in warning the public about
what is to happen to their food with the introduction of genetically
engineered organisms.   We will be continuing to highlight the risks
to the environment and to human health in the coming weeks and months,
 she said. .

<p><b>GREENPEACE BLOCKS SHIPMENT OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SOYA, DAY 2


<p>ANTWERP, NOVEMBER 8TH 1996</b>
<p>Greenpeace has now held-up, for more than
15 hours, one of the first US shipments of genetically contaminated
soya  beans to Europe at Antwerp harbour in Belgium. 

<p>Greenpeace activists have held the Polish registered bulk carrier,
Ziemia Zamojsk by chaining an inflatable boat to the rudder of the
vessel. It left Cleveland, Ohio on October 8 and was due to unload at
the wharf of US  grain multinational, Cargill at 5.00 pm yesterday
Greenpeace has demanded Cargill segregate its supplies of genetically
altered soya and refuse further shipments. The company has not yet
indicated a willingness to comply.

<p>Earlier Cargill, in a faxed letter to Greenpeace on November 4,  said
"we confirm there are soya beans on this vessel (Ziemia
Zamojska)....we are not able to confirm or deny the presence of
Roundup Ready soybeans because these beans are not separated from
traditional soybeans at harvest". Such beans have been genetically
altered to be resistant to US multinational Monsanto's commercial weed
killer Roundup. 

<p>The US grain multinational Cargill, which is importing the soya beans,
has been in contact with the ship. In a letter deliver to the Sirius
at 10 pm Cargill stated. "We note that Greenpeace activists are
currently impeding the legal progress of the Ziemia Zamojska into our
Antwerp dock. This action is dangerous and should be halted
immediately."

<p>"European supermarkets, food manufacturers, consumer and environmental
groups have made it clear that they don't want their food contaminated
with genetically engineered soya," said Greenpeace campaigner Isabelle
McCrea, referring to the growing list of organisations opposed to
mixing the soya beans . "We want to stop food being contaminated by
genetically altered soya beans"

<p>Soya beans are used in an estimated 60 per cent of processed
supermarket food products, including bread, chocolate, cakes,
margarine, ice-cream and pasta. 

<p>Greenpeace has already identified enough natural soya beans for the
European market from the US and Canada.( Roundup ready soya beans
comprise only two per cent of this year's US harvest). Greenpeace also
dismissed industry claims that segregation was impractical. "Certified
segregation is already occurring and to claim that this can't be done
is simply an attempt by a few big companies to force their product on
consumers." Greenpeace is calling on major food processing companies
such as Unilever International to refuse to use the genetically
altered soya beans. 

<p>On Tuesday night Greenpeace protested against the arrival of a US
shipment of soya beans, believed to contain genetically altered beans,
 when it arrived in Hamburg Germany.

<p><b>NEW MONSTER FACTORY TRAWLER SET TO PLUNDER CHILE'S FISH
</b></p><p>Greenpeace protests at baptism in Norway - Rainbow Warrior
awaits trawler in Chile 

<p>OSLO/AMSTERDAM, OCTOBER 26TH, 1996 
           
<p>  Greenpeace today
protested against the launch of the massive supertrawler
American Monarch at Langsten shipyard in Tomrefjord, Norway.
As high-speed inflatables with sirens rushed into the fjord,
activists displayed a giant banner with the words "American
Monster - Plunderer of the Seas"on the dry dock. 
 
<p>The ship, registered for the American Seafood Company and
owned by Norwegian based Resource Group International (RGI) is
destined to fish in already overexploited waters off the
Chilean coast. Almost 100 metres long with state-of-the-art
fish finding technology, the US$ 56 million American Monarch
is capable of fishing and processing more fish each day than
any other vessel in the world. 
 
 
<p>RGI's intention to fish southern blue whiting and hoki
(Patagonian grenadier) from Chile's waters has already
prompted major protests by local smaller scale fishermen and
coastal communities supported by Greenpeace Chile. Very little
if any of the American Monarch's catch will reach Chilean
dinner tables. Most of the catch will be sold as surimi on the
lucrative Japanese market or as fish meal in northern
countries.
 
<p>Public outrage has resulted in the Chilean Government's
rejection of the American Monarch's licence to fish. While
there has been no official statement on RGI's appeal against
that decision, information obtained by Greenpeace Chile
suggests that the government will in fact grant the license.
Greenpeace believes the government intends to wait until after
local elections held there this weekend, before announcing
its' u-turn.
 
<p>Greenpeace announced at the baptism today that its flagship
Rainbow Warrior is in Chile to lead local fishermen and
coastal communities in peaceful protest should the American
Monarch enter the depleted Chilean fishing grounds. "This
vessel is a monster capable of putting the last nail in the
coffin for Chile's southern fisheries," said Greenpeace
campaigner Harald Saevareid.  "With seventy per cent of world
fish stocks either exploited or depleted, nations with long
distance fleets increasingly exploit southern ocean
fishstocks, usually at huge expense of the marine environment
and the local people. The American Monarchs of the world
belong to history."
 
<p>Of the 3.5 million fishing vessels on the world's oceans, only
38,000 are classed as "large scale".  This one per cent of the
fleet account for over half of the total capacity of the
global fleet, as measured by gross registered tonnes.

<p><b>GREENPEACE FINDS NON-GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SOYA FOR EUROPEAN
RETAILERS


<p>AMSTERDAM, OCTOBER 25th 1996</b>

<P>Greenpeace today publishes
evidence to show that -- contrary to food industry claims --
genetically engineered soya is being separated from normal
soya and publishes a list of suppliers who provide non-
genetically engineered beans.
 
<P>In spite of what food manufacturers are being told -- that
genetically engineered soya can't be separated from the normal
bean during the harvest -- Greenpeace has evidence that this
is not true.
 
<P>Not only is it possible to separate the beans but the
producers, Monsanto, have actually insisted that they be
separated. They have even made farmers sign contracts saying
that they will separate the beans in order to buy them back as
seed for next year's planting.
 
<P>"This finally dispels the myth that it is not possible to
separate," said Greenpeace campaigner Michelle Sheather. "We
want the food manufacturers to come clean on this one and
insist on a clean stream of soya . They certainly can no
longer use the excuse that it is not possible to separate."
Unilever Germany anounced yesterday that they will be
demanding separation of soya supplies.
 
<P>Greenpeace also publishes a list of US suppliers who can
ensure non
 
genetically engineered beans, and points to the ever
increasing number of food retailers in Europe who are opposing
genetically engineered foodstuffs.
 
<P>"Now that Greenpeace has done the work for them we challenge
food manufacturers such as Unilever, Danone and Nestle to
contact these suppliers and others and order normal beans from
them," added Ms Sheather.
 
<P>Only one to two per cent of the US soyabean production
contains genetically engineered beans. Europe imports about
9.7 million metric tons.
 
<P>Greenpeace welcomes the news that more and more retailers are
opposing genetically engineered food. Earlier this week
Sweden's food retailers --including the two biggest, ICA and
KF -- joined the long list of European food retailers and
consumer associations who are demanding separation and
labelling.
 
<P>Greenpeace believes that genetically engineered crops pose
uncalculable risks to the environment and should not be grown.

<P><B>Notes to Editors</B>
 
<P><B>1. Separation of Monsanto's Roundup Ready Soybean</B>
 

 <P><B>Extract from Greenpeace interview with Dave Reiff owner of the
Reiff Elevator seed company in Iowa, USA, October 1996.</B>
 
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> The contractual agreement that Monsanto has with

farmers growing RRS this year is to keep the RRS segregated
from the conventional soya beans and use the RRS as seed for
future crops. Is that correct?
 
<P><B>Dave Reiff: </B>That's true. To the extent of my knowledge that's
absolutely the control they wanted. Because of their seed
business that's how they're intending to multiply the
availability to other farmers. About maybe half the people
that wanted them this year got them. The seed is very short
supply...to me there's every chance that they would not be
used in market channels...
 
<P><B>Interviewer: </B>So Monsanto doesn't want these beans mingled
with...
 
<P><B>Dave Reiff: </B>Well, that's our experience and our understanding
and they were very tight to get and you had to actually sign
agreement under their rules so I think that's an accurate
statement.

Columbia.
 
<p>At the final session of the World Conservation Congress in
Montreal, delegates representing governments and environmental
organizations from all over the world,  expressed serious
concern about the ecological danger of fish farming.  The
resolution calls on nations to protect sensitive coastal
ecosystems and wetlands, defend the interest of coast fishers
and  limit the spread of diseases in farmed fish.  Of specific
importance to environmentalists concerned about the use of
non-native Atlantic salmon in  BC fish farms, the Congress
endorsed wording which "recognizes the grave dangers posed by
the introduction of  non-native species" and urges all states
to "ensure that ecological damage resulting from the
introduction of non-native species is prevented."
 
<p>"We're delighted that the global community has sent such a
clear signal to governments such as Glen Clark's, who are in
charge of regulating the aquaculture industry," said 
Greenpeace Fisheries campaigner Catherine Stewart who attended
the Congress meetings in Montreal.  "Greenpeace will now work
to ensure the BC provincial government applies the
resolution's principles when it makes its final decisions
about aquaculture policy next year."
 
<p>The Congress also endorsed a resolution calling for Clayoquot
Sound to be designated as a United Nations International
Biosphere Reserve.  The designation will rank Clayoquot Sound

as one of the world's most important biological legacies. It
will  hopefully lead to protection of the area's  pristine
rainforests and encourage a sustainable local economy.  In
preparation for the official application to the United
Nations, negotiations are currently commencing between all
major stakeholders in Clayoquot Sound:  provincial and federal
governments, First Nations, environmentalists, MacMillan
Bloedel and others.  The participants are working on the
development of a land use proposal that  will be submitted to
the United Nations in March of 1997.  
 
<p>"We're very hopeful and excited that this process will bring
about the long awaited solution to the ongoing controversy
over Clayoquot's fragile rainforests," said Karen Mahon.

<p><b>WORKING GROUP ESTABLISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE KARELIAN OLD

<p>ENSO announces a one year moratorium for controversial forest
areas in Karelia and Murmansk
</b></p>

<P><B>HELSINKI OCTOBER 22ND 1996 </B>
<p>After months of sometimes very
difficult discussions, a national Karelian working group will be
formed by 31 January 1997 at the latest for the purpose of
preserving the ecologically important old growth forests and
primeval forests as well as to introduce sustainable forestry.

<p>This is the result of an initiative of the Finnish paper and
forestry group ENSO Oy, the Karelian and Finnish ministries for
the environment .....

<p>.....the members of the Karelian working group may only be
nationals of Karelia. The groups which have an interest and will
participate in this are the state, the wood processing
industries, the population affected as well as the environmental
protection groups.

<p>The working group should set up a list of criteria within one
year. According to this list is will be possible to classify
Karelia's important natural forests. Stock will then be taken of
the forest areas which should be preserved. The current network
of conservation areas should thus be extended on this basis. 

<p>The intention is that the provisional plan will be adopted
jointly at a conference organised by ENSO at the end of 1997.  

<p>In order to support the activity of the working group ....ENSO
will organise a moratorium for all regions in Karelia and
Murmansk which have so far been regarded by WWF and Greenpeace
as being worthy of protection. The moratorium is valid for one
year and affects a region of almost two million hectares. Since
September 15, 1996, ENSO has no longer been renewing its import
contracts for the forest regions in question. The last contracts
will expire in December 1996. An independent assessment group
will ensure that the moratorium is upheld. ENSO is currently in
negotiation with various institutes.

<p><b>US ON THE BRINK OF LOSING EUROPEAN MARKETS FOR SOYBEANS
</b>
<p>Greenpeace releases new statements from European consumers

<p><b>ST. LOUIS, MO., OCTOBER 18TH, 1996</b>

<p>At the Society of Environmental Journalist's
Conference in Missouri today Greenpeace released recent statements from
European consumers who do not want to purchase genetically engineered soybeans.
The statements reveal that concern is growing amongst major food retailers and
producers regarding the potential human health risks and the environmental
hazards of genetic engineering.
 
<p>"For the sake of Monsanto's Roundup sales, farmers are risking not only food
safety but their export markets," said genetic engineering expert Isabelle
Meister, of Greenpeace International. "Consumers in Europe do not want to buy
genetically manipulated foods."
 
<p>Several European countries, food companies and consumer organizations have

expressed opposition to the engineered soybean (list available).  Europe buys
about 25%of the U.S. soybean production. Tuesday, Norway's Daglivarhandelns
Environmental and Packaging Forum, which includes almost all Norwegian food
retailers and wholesalers, wrote to the U.S. Embassy that: "We refuse to sell
products containing soya from the U.S. unless the U.S. distinguishes clearly
between traditional soya beans and the beans that have been genetically
manipulated." 
 
<p>In a related development, Safeway, the third largest food retailer in the UK
noted in a letter to Greenpeace UK that, "We are working with suppliers of
Safeway brand products containing soybean or soya derivatives to identify other
sources of conventional soybean and explore the possibilities of reformulating
some products to utilise alternatives to soya."
 
<p>Greenpeace activists in Germany, Sweden, Austria, and England also conducted
protests this week against Unilever, Europe's largest food company, which has
yet to exclude Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans from its product
lines.  Last
week, U.S. Greenpeace activists "quarantined" a field in Central Iowa to block
harvesting of Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans.
 
<p>"Monsanto is conducting a giant experiment with nature and with our food," said
Greenpeace campaigner Paul Clarke. "The environmental consequences could be
devastating."
 
<p>Monsanto's genetically altered "Roundup Ready" soybeans are set to hit the
market for the first time later this year. The beans are engineered to tolerate

Monsanto's Roundup pesticide. Environmentalists and consumers are concerned
about the potential of genetically engineered soybeans to cause allergies in
humans and "genetic pollution" of natural plants.  While Roundup Ready accounts
for only 2% of this year's soybean crop, Monsanto's plan to mix them with
conventional soybeans threatens to contaminate the entire harvest. Soybean oil
and protein is
contained in some 60% of all processed foods.

<p><b>"OLD GROWTH FOREST DESTRUCTION HAS A NAME - ENSO"<br>
GREENPEACE ACTION IN LUEBECK HARBOUR AGAINST FREIGHTER WITH ENSO PAPER
</b></p>

<P><B>LUEBECK, OCTOBER 17TH, 1996
</B>
  
<p>Since early this morning, Greenpeace activists have
been protesting in Luebeck harbour against the destruction of the last
remaining old growth forests by ENSO, a Finnish company. They are hindering the
unloading of the freighter "Oihonna" whose cargo is paper from Finland destined
for German markets. A large banner with the slogan "OLD GROWTH FOREST
DESTRUCTION HAS A NAME - ENSO" has been hung across the stern of the freighter
on ropes.  There are more than 3,000 tonnes of paper products from ENSO on
board . In August, Greenpeace protested against ENSO during two actions in
Russia and Finland after Greenpeace research revealed that ENSO had pulped wood
from Russian primary forests to paper. 
 
<p>"ENSO has reacted to our protests by stalling and lying to its customers and
the public. The time is long overdue for ENSO to stop destroying Russian and
Finnish old growth forests and it must declare this intention publicly", said
Thomas Henningsen, forest campaigner at Greenpeace Germany, who is accompanying
the action in an inflatable. The northern old growth forests in the area
between Finland and Russia (Karelia) deserve special protection because they
have not been used commercially until now and they contain untouched wildlife
reserves. The Karelian forests, along with similar areas in Poland and in the
Urals, belong to the last three remaining large old growth forests in Europe. 
 
<p>The Finnish giant ENSO has subsidiaries in 40 countries, making it one of the
largest paper and pulp producers in the world. ENSO has five production areas:
lumber and pulp, food and beverage cartoning, graphic paper and cartons,
printing paper (newspapers and magazines) and specialty papers.   ENSO is the
world's largest importer of Russian round wood, especially from Karelia.
Britain and Germany are by far the largest buyers of ENSO products. About 20
percent of ENSO products are sold in Germany alone.
 
<p>"As long as ENSO is logging old growth, no one will be sure if there isnt a
piece of destroyed old growth forest in their magazine, biscuit wrapper, copy
paper, telephone directory or paperback book," said Thomas Henningsen.
Greenpeace demands that customers of ENSO become aware of their responsibility
and persuade ENSO to stop logging primary and old growth forests. In addition,
ENSO should implement the concept of ecological forest use.

<p><b>GREENPEACE CALLS ON UNILEVER TO REJECT GENETIC PRODUCTS ON WORLD FOOD
DAY</b>
<p><b>AMSTERDAM, OCTOBER 16TH, 1996</b>

<p>Greenpeace today welcomed the news that
more supermarkets and food wholesalers-- including Switzerland's two
biggest food retailers --  have joined the protest against foods
containing genetically engineered soya from the United States.
Greenpeace is now calling on food giant Unilever to do the same.

<p>Supermarket and wholesale organisations in Austria, Switzerland,
Sweden and Norway* have this week confirmed that they will not be
stocking products containing genetically engineered soya unless the
genetically engineered soya is separated and labelled. They join a
number of others in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands
who have refused the product or called for labelling.

<p>Today -- World Food Day -- Greenpeace offices in Europe are organizing
protests at Unilever's headquarters in the UK and Germany and at their
Swedish head office. Unilever is a major user of soya which is found
in about 60 per cent of all processed foods, from bread to chocolate.

<p>"What we are seeing is just the beginning of retailers and consumers
saying no," said Greenpeace campaigner Michelle Sheather. "Food
processors thought they could slip this in to our food without telling
us -- but this is a huge experiment with food and nature and people
don't want it."

<p> "Unilever has told Greenpeace that its policy is to ensure
 transparency and labelling but it has done neither. They and others
 like them such as Nestle and Danone have the power to act on behalf
 of their consumers and demand supplies of soya free from genetic
 engineering. We want to know why they are not doing this." 

<p>Only one to two per cent of this year's crop is genetically
engineered. The industry claims that it is impossible to separate the
bean but Greenpeace has already identified suppliers of normal soya.

<p>Greenpeace will also be carrying out an action in the USA where the
soya is currently being harvested. The soya is produced and marketed
by the American multinational Monsanto.*  

<p>In addition to health fears, Greenpeace is concerned about the effects
on the environment of the release of genetically engineered crops.
"This will be the first time genetically engineered ingredients have
appeared in wide range of everyday supermarket products," said Ms
Sheather, "and if the food multinationals have their way millions of
tons of engineered crops will be grown in the environment". 

<p>"In order to find lasting solutions to world food problems we need to
work with sustainable agricultural processes which do not pose threats
to the environment and human and animal health. Genetic engineering,
like the so called `green revolution' is just another short-term
dangerous attempt to provide a quick fix. It does not address the real

problems of world famine."

<p>In a related development, the European Union is still deliberating
about whether to approve Ciba Geigy's corn, which some countries have
objected to.The corn confers resistance to an antibiotic and there is
concern that this resistance could be transferred to bacteria, which
would then become resistant to treatment.

<BR><BR><HR><BR>
<p>NOTES TO EDITORS
<p>1. Monsanto has created a transgentic plant (Roundup Ready Soybean) by
adding genetic material from a virus and a bacterium to normal soya.
This provides no benefit to the consumer but simply makes the plant
resistant to the Roundup weedkiller, also produced by Monsanto.

<p>2. Meinl, one of Austria's leading supermarket chains, will anounce
today that it will not use genetcially engineered soya in its
products; Switzerland's two biggest food retailers, Migros and Coop
Schweiz, called publicly for the soyabeans to be marketed seperately
and labelled; DMF (Daglivarhandelns Enviromental and Packing Forum),
which includes almost all Norwegian food retailers and wholesalers has
anounced it will refuse to buy soya products unless the USA separates
the genetically engineered soya; the Federation of Swedish Food
Industry, which represents the country's main foodsuppliers, has said
it will not be using genetically engineered soya and has called for
its separation and labelling.

<p><b>GREENPEACE QUARANTINES GENETICALLY ALTERED "X-FIELD"</b>

<p><b>ATLANTIC, IOWA, THURSDAY OCTOBER 10TH, 1996</b>

<p>Greenpeace today blocked harvesting and "quarantined" a field of
genetically engineered soybeans --  shortly to be on their way into
European food -- to protest against genetically engineered food and to
highlight the environmental dangers of such technology.

<p>Borrowing a theme from television's "The X-files" Greenpeace activists
used a bright pink non-toxic milk-based spray paint to spray an entire


soyabean field in Iowa in the USA and mark a huge "X" (30 metres by 15
metres) which could be seen from the air.

<p>"Strange things  are happening to America's crop fields -- they're
turning into America's X-fields, said Greenpeace Campaigner Beth
Fitzgerald from the site of the genetic invasion.

<p>Despite protests from European consumer groups, food manufacturers,
retailers and even farmers themselves, the genetically engineered soya
is now being harvested and mixed with normal soya ready for export to
Europe. Soya is used in about 60 per cent of processed foods, from
bread and cakes to chocolate and margarine.

<p>The "Roundup Ready Soybean" developed by the US firm Monsanto -- also
responsible for their production of Agent Orange used in Vietnam --
has been genetically engineered to be resistant to Monsanto's own
"Roundup" herbicide. The soybean contains genes from a virus and a
bacteria.

<p>In addition to the potential dangers of cross breeding with weeds and
subsequent disruption to the environment, Greenpeace believes the use
of genetically engineered crops in food could pose threats to human
and animal health.

<p>"European governments have the right under EU law to refuse imports of
the soybean if they believe they could constitute a risk to human
health or the environment," said Louise Gale of Greenpeace's European
Unit. "We think they should be using that right on both counts."

<p>In a separate action, activists from Greenpeace Germany dressed as
laboratory rabbits today also protested outside the headquarters of

the food giant Unilever, calling on them to use their consumer power
to demand non-genetically engineered soya.

<P><B>Queen Charlotte Sound, 1st October 1996</B>
 
<p>New figures
obtained from the Department of Fisheries show that with the
season still underway,  British Columbia's trawl fishery has
already dumped over 12 million pounds of dead and dying fish
overboard.
 
<p>The numbers of discarded fish, gathered for the first time
from observers aboard the trawling fleet, include: 
<ul>
<li>4,143,721 pounds of turbot (arrowtooth flounder) 
<li>2,390,100 pounds of dogfish 
<li>and almost a million pounds of high-value halibut.
</ul>
 
<p>The total to date of 12,981,559 pounds of fish represents 100
separate species including sole, perch, pacific cod, rockfish,
salmon, herring, sturgeon and even steelhead trout.
 
<p>Discarded fish or "by-catch" include any that are the wrong
sex, wrong size, wrong species or for which there is no
commercial market. This is the first year the Fisheries
Department has placed observers on trawlers to monitor the
destruction.
 
<p>"This is appalling waste, especially at time when so many fish
species are in trouble,"  said Greenpeace Fisheries Campaigner
Catherine Stewart  aboard the MV Greenpeace, which is
currently investigating trawlers' activities as they drag
massive nets along the seabed.  "Greenpeace is here to
confront this environmental destruction head on."
 
<p>Many of the species being caught by the draggers could be
fished more selectively, using traps, pots or hooks and lines.
 
<p>Also included in the dumped trawl waste are 41 non-fish
species including harbour seals, California sea lions, rare
Steller sea lions, 68,710 pounds of starfish, 93,805 pounds of
crab and 28,250 pounds of assorted sponges, corals, anemones,
urchins, squid, octopus and prawns.
 
<p>The draggers, owned by B.C.Packers, Ocean Fisheries and
others, cause significant damage to the ocean floor, tearing
up coral and bottom life. Huge steel doors that hold the net

open and heavy chains tear into the ocean bed, dredging up the
bottom and crushing bottom life. Greenpeace is demanding a
phase-out of bottom dragging and a conversion to more
sustainable, selective fishing methods.

<p><b>GREENPEACE SUPPORTS EARTHROOTS' CALL FOR TEMAGAMI PROTECTION
</b></p>




<P><B>TORONTO,  SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1996
</B>
  
<p>The Ontario government
should  immediately halt all logging and mining in the region of
old growth white and red pine at Temagami, the environmental
group Greenpeace said today.
 
<p>Temagami represents 1/3 of all the old growth red and white
pine left in North America; less than 1 per cent of Ontario's
original pine forest remains intact.  The Owain Lake old growth
white pine stand, where logging started this week,  is the third
largest remaining example in North America . 
 
<p>"International concern over the fate of Temagami's old growth
forests is building,"  said Greenpeace Biodiversity Campaigner
Tzeporah Berman at a press conference held today at Queen's
Park.  "If the Harris government wants to repeat the mistakes
the
Harcourt government made  in Clayoquot Sound and drag Ontario's
name through the mud, he's on the right track."
 
<p>Statements of support for protection of Temagami were also
issued at the press conference by several other leading
environmental organizations as well as several prominent
Canadians including lawyer Clayton Ruby, Svend Robinson, and
authors June Callwood, M.T. Kelly, and Jane Urquhart.
 
<p>In addition to ecological problems created by logging old growth
pines, Greenpeace also expressed concern that logging  will
damage the area's long term economic viability.  The Temagami 
and Latchford Economic Development Corporation  compared the
employment potential of logging with the potential of ecotourism 
and found their will be nearly 90 times more jobs created by a
strong tourism industry than if the area's old growth forest was
logged.
 
<p>The short term economic benefits of logging the remaining old
growth, especially for Temagami's immediate vicinity, will also
be small.  "The decision to log these old growth pines will not
create new jobs for the area " said Berman.  "The Harris
government is suffering from economic, as well as ecological,
short-sightedness."
 
<p> Instead of logging  old-growth forests, Greenpeace believes the
Ontario government should concentrate on creating more value-
added forest jobs that bring long term economic health to
northern Ontario.   Between 1990 and 1994, the total volume of
forest harvest climbed 22  per cent while the number of people
employed by the forest industry fell by 17 percent.
 
<p>A recent poll sponsored by Earthroots found that 92 per cent of
decided Ontarians and 85 per cent of decided Northern Ontarians
want to preserve all of Temagami's old growth pine.
 
<p>"From Clayoquot Sound to Temagami, Canadians understand the
importance of protecting our old-growth forests," said Berman. 
"It's time for governments like Mike Harris' to listen, before
it's too late."

<p><b>  GOVERNMENT ADVISORS CALL FOR INDUSTRIAL FISHING BAN ON WEE BANKIE
</b></p>

<p>LONDON, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20th  1996
     
           
     <P>The Government's advisors, the Joint Nature Conservation Council 
     (JNCC), has recommended that industrial fishing for sandeels on the 
     Wee Bankie and surrounding areas off the Scottish East Coast be 
     banned. 
     
     <P>In a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) 
     the JNCC said, "We are concerned about the effects of industrial 
     fishing on important wildlife concentrations reliant on sandeels.  We 
     therefore suggest that sandeel fisheries be restricted in the area 
     which our work indicates that there is likely to be the largest 
     overlap in occurrence of fisheries and seabird/cetacean usage - the 
     Wee Bankie, Marr Bank and Scalp Bank".
     
    <P> The JNCC recommendation goes on to suggest a possible wording which 
     prohibits fishing in a specified geographical area.
     
    <P> If the UK Government heeds this advice it will call on the European 
     Commission (EC) to adopt this policy and make it legally binding.  The 
     next fisheries meeting of the EC at which this could occur is in 
     October.
     
     <P>Although only made publicly available this week, the recommendation 
     was sent to MAFF on August 19th.  As yet MAFF has not indicated its 
     intentions.
     
     <P>Greenpeace scientific advisor Dr Malcolm MacGarvin said, "It is vital 
     that the Government heeds its own advisors and protect such sensitive 
     areas as the Wee Bankie. It can no longer ignore the calls for 
     political action."
     
     <P>The effects of unregulated industrial fishing in the Wee Bankie area 
     were highlighted earlier this year when Greenpeace began a campaign of 
     action against the industrial fishing fleet.
     
     <P>At a recent meeting of fisheries experts in Norway, a Danish fisheries 
     scientist, Dr Henrik Gislason, accepted there was a case for 
     protecting sandeel stocks on a precautionary basis. Malcolm MacGarvin 
     said, "the scientist acknowledged that there is a case for general 
     limitations on North Sea sandeel fisheries and for banning industrial 
     fishing in areas such as the Wee Bankie. One more reason why the 
     Government should now act."

<P><B>GREENPEACE DEMANDS BAN IN MIDST OF TRAWLER FLEET


<P>BERING SEA,  SEPTEMBER 10TH, 1996  </B>

 <p>Over a dozen Greenpeace
activists in four inflatable boats have brought the call for a
ban on factory trawlers into the midst of the Bering Sea
factory trawler fleet.
 
<p>Last month Greenpeace launched a campaign to ban factory
trawlers from U.S. fisheries. Yesterday, 15 activists from the
MV Greenpeace began an on-going direct action among the
factory trawlers by driving small, inflatable boats in front
of the moving factory trawler Ocean Rover (owned by American
Seafoods).
 
<p>"We're here to end the pillaging of our oceans by factory
trawlers,"  said Greenpeace's Dave Batker aboard the MV
Greenpeace.  "These trawlers pass through an ocean ecosystem
and tear out the heart of the food web." Greenpeace's action
begins days before the U.S. Senate is due to debate on the
Magnuson fishery Conservation and Management Act, the nation's
primary fisheries law North Pacific marine mammals and birds,
which depend on the fish caught by factory trawlers, are
declining drastically.  The Steller sea lion is being
considered for endangered species status in the areas where
factory trawlers have fished most heavily ends

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>MACMILLAN BLOEDEL INJUNCTION PLACES PRIVATE INTERESTS ABOVE THOSE
OF THE PUBLIC, GREENPEACE SAYS
 </b></p>

<P>
<B>Vancouver, BC. September 3rd, 1996</B>


<P>A decision by the
Supreme Court of B.C. supporting logging giant MacMillan Bloedel
is a clear sign that the courts are acting to protect private
business interests rather than the interests of the public,
Greenpeace said today.
 
<P>MacMillan Bloedel sought an injunction prohibiting Greenpeace,
two individuals, John and Jane Doe and Persons Unknown from
protesting two of the world's largest log barges after two
actions against the Haida Brave in August. The Haida Brave and
its sister ship the Haida Monarch each visit coastal communities
two or three times a week and, when they leave, they leave
carrying the equivalent of 400 logging trucks loaded with
rainforest wood.
 
<P>Greenpeace blockaded the Haida Brave on August 1 and again on
August 8 to highlight the overcutting of the old-growth
rainforest and the fact that half of the Canadian rainforest has
already disappeared. MacMillan Bloedel is the largest logging
company operating in the rainforest and controls approximately 1-
million hectares of public rainforest land.
 
<P>"The old-growth rainforest is on land belonging to the public and
yet is being decimated by private corporations such as MacMillan
Bloedel," said Tamara Stark of Greenpeace Canada. "It's a sad day
for Canadians when the financial interests of a private
corporation are placed above those of the public in general."
 
<P>On August 8 Greenpeace voluntarily suspended the blockade of the
Haida Brave but, despite this, MacMillan Bloedel has been able to
use the courts to prevent the potential of future protests.  
"In this case, MacMillan Bloedel is using the courts to quell not
just public dissent but even the possibility of public dissent -
a fundamental principle of a democratic society," Stark said. "So
long as the rainforest remains under siege, we will remain
committed to stopping this destruction."
 
<P>Since its inception in Vancouver in 1971, Greenpeace has been
committed to the principles of non-violent civil disobedience to
stop environmental degradation.

<p><b>GREENPEACE PROTESTS TOXIC DISCHARGE AT THE BAIKAL PULP AND PAPER MILL</b></p>

 



<P>
<B>Amsterdam / Irkutsk (Siberia). Wednesday August 28th, 1996 -</B>


<P>Greenpeace activists from

Russia, Germany, Denmark, Holland and Great Britain started a protest
action today at the Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill on the shores of Lake
Baikal. The mill has caused enormous damage to Baikal during the
thirty years of its existence, discharging vast amounts of  toxic
effluent into the worlds biggest freshwater reservoir. 

<P>The activists climbed two 80 metres chimneys and displayed a banner
saying " SAVE BAIKAL". According to Greenpeace research considerable
changes in the ecosystem of the Southern basin of Baikal can already
be found.

<P>Day by day more than 210,000 cubic metres of sewage, the equivalent of
more than 1.3 million barrels, are directed into the lake. " The
discharge has to be stopped immediately before the biggest freshwater
reservoir is converted into the largest sewer" said Ivan Blokov,
spokesperson for Greenpeace Russia. A lake area of roughly 250 square
kilometres has already been contaminated and dioxin and
organochlorines have been found among the pollutants.

<P>Lake Baikal situated in the south of Siberia close to the
Russian-Mongolian border is not only the biggest but the deepest
freshwater lake of the world. It stretches for 636 kilometres with its
width varying from 19 to 80 kilometres and is more than a mile deep
(1620 metres). 

<P>It contains 20 per cent of the worlds freshwater and is habitat to
more than 2,000 plant and animal species, 1500 of which are endemic to
the area. Greenpeace, together with UNESCO, is therefore pushing for
Baikal to be listed as a World Heritage Site. "But if we do not stop
the ongoing pollution before the turn of the century, the uniqueness
of this fragile ecosystem may well be destroyed", said Blokov.

TV. Further enquiries please contact Anke Scheib at Greenpeace

<p><b> GREENPEACE'S CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT CLAYOQUOT SOUND WILL
CONTINUE---
                      DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING

</b></p>



<P>
<B>OTTAWA, CANADA Thursday, 22 August, 1996 -- </B>
  



<P>Greenpeace will
continue its campaign to protect  Clayoquot Sound's pristine
valleys, despite a decision issued by the Supreme Court of Canada
today which puts the "property rights" of logging companies ahead
of individual rights to protest destructive environmental
practices.

 <P>The decision pertains to an injunction obtained by MacMillan
Bloedel four years ago that resulted in jail terms and fines for
over 1,000 people who tried to stop MacMillan Bloedel from
clearcutting the rainforests of Clayoquot Sound  by blocking
logging roads.*
 
<P>"This decision tells Canadians that the interests of large
logging companies come first,that the forest belongs to them,
not the citizens of British Columbia or the citizens of Canada. 
This decision stands is sharp contrast to the belief held by most
Canadians that the forests  do belong to them and that all
citizens  have the right and responsibility to protest
destructive forest practices,"  said Greenpeace Canada campaign
director Steve Shallhorn who was at the court when the decision
was handed down.

<P>Despite the Supreme Court ruling Greenpeace intends to continue
its campaign to protect Clayoquot Sound and the rest of British
Columbia's temperate rainforest, the largest example of  a
fragile ecosystem that has been wiped  out in many other parts of
the world.  

<P> "Greenpeace's commitment to protect the Clayoquot's rainforest
remains as strong as ever, " said Forest Campaigner Karen Mahon, 
Greenpeace Canada forests campaigner. "We will fight in the
forests, we will fight in the marketplace, we will fight in the
boardroom but we will not stand by and let MacMillan Bloedel
destroy the last of the temperate rainforests."
 
<P>It has been three years since the summer of 1993, when over
10,000 people came to Clayoquot Sound to protest the destructive
logging of the old-growth temperate rainforests. Since then
initiatives have been adopted, such as recommendations made by a
blue-ribbon Scientific Panel.   Although the rate of cut has 
slowed down, clearcutting continues and MacMillan Bloedel's most
recent plans indicate that they plan on logging the few remaining
intact valleys and islands within the next 5 years.  

<P>Earlier this summer, protests resumed in Clayoquot Sound, when
MacMillan Bloedel began clearcutting in the pristine valley of
the Bulson. The Bulson is one of 11 pristine areas that remain on
Vancouver Island, of an original 170.: six of these are in
Clayoquot Sound and continue to be threatened by MacMillan
Bloedel, despite overwhelming international support for their
protection.
               
<P>"Worldwide, people are becoming increasingly aware Canada's
temperate rainforest are endangered. If the current rate of
logging continues virtually all the remaining valleys will be
roaded or logged within the next 10 years," said Tamara Stark of
Greenpeace Canada. "Greenpeace will continue to campaign
nationally and internationally to ensure that Clayoquot Sound and
the remaining intact valleys along the coast of British Columbia
are protected."

<P>Tamara Stark or Karen Mahon in Vancouver 604-253-7701  </B> 

<br>
<p><B>NOTE TO EDITORS: The injunction named specific individuals, but
also applied generically to "John and Jane Doe and Persons
Unknown". This form of broad injunction has been ruled illegal in
three other Canadian provinces, and in the highest courts in the
United States, England and Australia. In these jurisdictions,
this injunction has been determined to be overly broad, violating
the public's right to civil protest.

<p><b>GREENPEACE ATTACKS RESPONSE BY ENSO TO KARELIAN OLD GROWTH
CRISIS

</b></p>



<P>
<B>Eno, Finland, Thursday, 22nd August, 1996</B>

<P><B>Greenpeace today totally rejected Enso's response </B>to dealing
with the disputed area of old growth forest in Karelia. At a
press conference today in Helsinki Greenpeace produced
conclusive evidence that an area in Karelia where Enso was
buying wood from is classified as old growth forest.
 
<P>Enso have already promised in a letter to BBC Enterprises Ltd
in the UK on 24/1/1996 that "Enso does not buy wood from old
growth forests.."  However a Greenpeace investigation has
clearly shown that Enso has been breaking its promise by
continuing to buy old growth wood from Karelia.   
 
<P>It is outrageous that Enso's only response in a press release
they issued today on this matter is to say that "in order to
clarify the situation Enso proposes that environmental
organisations, the specialists in the working group on old
growth forests by the Ministry for the environments, the
Karelian authorities and Enso audit the area together." 
 
<P>"Greenpeace is not prepared to have discussions about an area
in Karelia which has been clearly shown to be old growth
forest and is already partly logged. However if Enso is
serious about discussions with Greenpeace then it must
immediately stop all logging activities in this area and in
other old growth forest areas in Karelia and be prepared to
discuss our other demands. Otherwise Greenpeace will have no
option but to continue its campaign against Enso especially in
the consumer countries, "  said Tim Birch, Greenpeace
International Forest Campaign Coordinator.
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling on Enso to make available all maps that
detail Enso's logging activities in Karelia. This information
needs to be urgently assessed to ensure that Enso is not
logging in any other areas of old growth Karelian forest.

<p><b>ACTIVISTS BLOCK ENSO'S PULP MILL IN PROTEST AGAINST DESTRUCTION
OF RUSSIAN OLD GROWTH FORESTS
</b></p>

<P><B>Greenpeace steps up its campaign to protect old growth forests:</B> 



<P>
<B>Eno, Finland, Thursday, 22nd August, 1996</B>

 
 
<P>Today more than 20
activists from Finland, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Austria,
Britain and Germany blocked the entrance of the Enocell pulp
mill, which is part of the Enso Group. 
 
<P>The activists blocked the main entrance of the mill with a
container stopping the trucks which bring wood from Russia. They
also displayed banners in English, Finnish and German reading
"Enso Stop Destroying Old Growth Forests".
 
<P>"Despite its promise to its consumers and the public Enso
continues to use wood from old growth forest from Karelia and it
continues to deny it. Enso needs to stop hiding the truth about
its destructive activities to the public and its customers. It
must take immediate action to stop using wood from old growth
forest", said Matti Ikonen from Greenpeace.
 
<P>The Enocell pulp mill, in Uimaharju, only 60 kilometres from the
Russian border, is one of the largest pulp mill's in Europe and
is mainly dependent on Russian wood. A recent Greenpeace
investigation documented that the Enocell mill is processing
wood from one of the last remaining areas of old growth forest
in Europe, Karelia in Russia.
 
<P>This was the second action this week by Greenpeace in its
campaign to protect old growth forest in Karelia. On Tuesday
Greenpeace activists successfully stopped two logging harvesters
in Karelia which were cutting old growth forest for Enso's
 
Enocell mill. 
 
<P>At an international press conference in Helsinki later today
Greenpeace will be presenting the documentation which proves the
link between Enso and the destruction of the Karelian old growth
forest. Greenpeace campaigners from Finland, Germany, Russia and
Greenpeace International explain the international importance of
the Karelian forest and the role of producers and consumers in
other countries in protecting it.
 
<P>The press conference will be held today at 10:00 am (8:00 GMT)
at restaurant Kaksi Kanaa, Kanavakatu 3, Helsinki, Finland.

<p><b>GREENPEACE BLOCKS LOGGING OF RUSSIAN OLD GROWTH FOREST 
</b></p>

<P><B>The Finnish giant paper company Enso breaks its promise and
continues to use timber from old growth forests </B> 



<P>
<B>Karelia. Tuesday August 20th, 1996 -</B>
 
<P>Today, 20 Greenpeace activists
from Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Germany
took direct action in Karelian forests near Kostamus,
Russia, to stop the ongoing destruction in one of the last
remaining European old growth forests.   
 
<P>"Enso has broken their promise not to use timber from old
growth forests. This is chop-and-run style logging, and they
are taking all the profits with them across the border to
Finland," said Sergey Tsyplenkov of Greenpeace Russia. 
 
<P>The activists chained themselves to the harvesters blocking
further logging and displayed banners in English and Russian
reading "Stop Enso Destroying Russian Forests". Enso Group
is a Finland-based multinatinal corporation, and is one of
the world's largest paper producers.  
  
<P>"We have come to defend the remaining old growth forests of
Karelia. Enso is contributing to the destruction of one of
the last remaining old growth areas in Europe," said
Tsyplenkov.
  
<P>Greenpeace has repeatedly demanded an immediate halt to
logging in old growth forests in Europe, an end to
clearcutting and the adoption of ecologically responsible
forest use.
   
<P>Many residents of Karelia and neighbouring areas are bitter
about the loss of the forests and the lack of substantial
compensation. Most of the profit from logging is being made
 
by value-added production in Finland and Western Europe.
 
<P>Old growth forests and their wildlife have disappeared
throughout most of Europe. In Sweden and Finland, for
example, only less than 5 per cent of the old growth forest
remains. Despite its extreme importance for conserving
biodiversity in Northern Europe, the Green Belt, as this
strip of untouched forests along the Russian-Finnish border
is known, lacks a comprehensive conservation plan. The
Karelian forest is a vital habitat for brown bear, wolf,
Karelian deer and beaver.

NOTES:
 
<P>p1. In a letter to BBC Enterprises Ltd in UK, 24th
January 1996, Enso said: " Enso does not buy wood from the
oldgrowth forests, natural conservation areas or areas
planned to be natural conservation areas." 
 
 <UL>
<LI>In European Russia there are two significant belts
of oldgrowth: the Komi Republic forests along the Ural
Mountains, which have been recognised internationally, and
the Green Belt along the Finnish-Russian border. According
to Russian environmentalists, only 10-15% of Karelia's
oldgrowth forests still stand. 

 
 
<LI>p3. Half of all Russian raw timber exports go to
Finland. Enso Group is the largest importer of Russian raw
timber. In 1995 Finnish importers purchased 8.9 million
cubic metres of raw timber, Enso responsible for almost half
of this, mostly from the Northwest of Russia.

<P><B> GREENPEACE DIVERS CHAIN PROPELLERS OF FACTORY TRAWLERS  

<p> Fleet Impounded to Protect North
Pacific
<P>SEATTLE, FRIDAY, AUGUST 16TH, 1996</B>
  


 
<P> Greenpeace divers today chained the propellers of
several factory trawlers docked at Pier 91 in Seattle to prevent the boats
from leaving for fishing grounds off Alaska. Swimming activists also chained
themselves to the factory trawlers while draping banners comparing factory
trawlers to strip mining and clear cutting.

<P>"Factory trawlers are starving the North Pacific to death," said Greenpeace
campaigner Fred Munson. "Marine mammals and seabirds - the 'canaries in the
coal mine' - depend on these fish to survive."   The protest comes one day
after Greenpeace launched its latest campaign with the release of its report,
"Sinking Fast", which calls for a ban on factory trawlers in U.S. waters.  

<P>Joining Greenpeace in Friday's protest are Alaskan fishermen Don Hall, Matt
Donohoe and Mako Haggerty, as well as Seattle fishermen Erling Skaar, Bruce
Watson, Jonathan Manski.
 
<P>In the last 30 years,  factory trawlers devastated the fisheries of the Grand
Banks off of Newfoundland and Georges Bank off of New England.  The U.S.
Congress responded by passing the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act of 1976, which forced the foreign factory trawler fleet out of American
waters.  Unfortunately, this directly encouraged the development of the
current U.S. factory trawler fleet.
 
<P>A "pirate radio" station -- "KELP" at 102.9 FM in Seattle -- is broadcasting
from an unknown location reports about Greenpeace's action and factory trawler
abuses. This broadcast can be heard in most parts of the city of Seattle.

<P><B>GREENPEACE LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO BAN FACTORY TRAWLERS
<p>Report Details Destruction to Fisheries, Marine Environments  
<P>SEATTLE, THURSDAY, AUGUST 15TH, 1996</B>



<p>With commercial fisheries around the U.S. in
crisis, Greenpeace today launched a campaign to ban the U.S. fleet of "factory
trawlers" -- the massive, industrial-scale fishing vessels capable of catching
500,000 pounds of fish per tow -- that are devastating marine environments
around the world.  Greenpeace is releasing a report,  Sinking Fast,  Thursday
in Seattle, Washington, detailing the environmental damage caused by factory
trawlers. The new campaign follows Greenpeace's successful effort to ban drift
net fishing on the high seas.  

<p><B>(NOTE: The official launch, and report release, are taking place Thursday at
11 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, at a news conference at Myrtle Edwards Park in
Seattle.)</B>

<p>Modern factory trawlers have transformed fishing into an ocean-going
strip-mining industry.  Factory trawlers use nets with openings two miles in
circumference, into which a dozen 747 jumbo jets could easily fit.  The
trawlers' huge nets catch an enormous amount of incidental species (bycatch). 
In 1994, factory trawlers threw overboard, dead, more than half a billion
pounds of fish because they were the wrong sex, size or species.  The U.S.
industry is dominated by multinational corporations, including Arkansas-based
Tyson Foods, which owns 11 factory trawlers.
 
<p>"This technology was used to hunt the great whales to near-extinction," said
Greenpeace Executive Director Barbara Dudley.  "No longer able to hunt whales,
this technology was modified to catch whale-sized nets of fish."
 
<p>Greenpeace called on the U.S. Department of Commerce to phase out the U.S.
factory trawler fleet by 2001.  The group also demanded that U.S. fisheries be
closed to all foreign trawlers.
 
<p>"This environmental tragedy isn't being perpetrated by a developing nation
desperate for cash," said Dudley.  "This is an American fleet, backed by
Norwegian and Japanese investors. 
Greenpeace is committed to ending this wasteful depletion of our oceans."
 
<p>Concerned citizens can send a free fax in support of the ban to the CEO's of
Tyson Foods and American Seafoods (the largest owners of these trawlers) by
going to www.interactivism.com on the Internet.

</B>



<P>
<B>Vancouver, BC. August 13th, 1996</B>


 
<P>Greenpeace today
released a report documenting the control and destruction of
Canada's temperate rainforests by 10 large timber companies.  At a
press conference today in Vancouver, Greenpeace announced that it
is launching an international campaign to protect the temperate
rainforests, expanding their work from Clayoquot Sound to the coast
of British Columbia.  
 

<P>"One half of the world's temperate rainforest have already been
destroyed and unless we take action now within the next 10 years
most of Canada's rainforest will be clearcut or suffer serious
ecological damage through fragmentation and roadbuilding," said

Greenpeace forests campaigner Karen Mahon.
 
<P>The Greenpeace report documents the control of Canada's temperate
rainforests by timber corporations and summarises that three
companies (MacMillan Bloedel, Interfor and Doman/Western Forest
Products) control 50 per cent of the logging of Canada's temperate
rainforests. The top 10 companies control 75 per cent of rainforest
logging. 
 

<P>According to the companies' development plans, logging or roading
is scheduled to occcur in over half of the approximate 50
rainforest valleys that are currently unlogged within the next five
years.
 
<P>"In the Amazon, a place of global concern, only 15 per cent of the
rainforest has been lost. In Canada we have already lost 50 per
cent of our old growth rainforest and the rest is disappearing at
an incredible rate," said Tamara Stark of Greenpeace Canada.
"Temperate rainforests are an endangered ecosystem and we must take
decisive action now if we are preserve them for the future."
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for an immediate moratorium on logging in the
remaining pristine rainforest areas, and an immediate end to
clearcutting and roadbuilding in the temperate rainforest.  In the
longer term Greenpeace is seeking a phase-out of industrial logging
in the remaining old growth rainforests, with a shift to logging
secondary forests according to ecological principles.
 
<P>Greenpeace is launching an international campaign to protect the
temperate rainforest. The campaign will consist of community work,
lobbying, tracking and publicizing rainforest products in the
marketplace and public protests.
 
<P>For the past week Greenpeace has been engaged in blockades against
the Haida Brave, MacMillan Bloedel's log barge.  MacMillan Bloedel
is currently pursuing a lawsuit and civil injunction to prevent
further Greenpeace protests.

<P><B>SPANISH FISHERMEN AND GREENPEACE EJECT  ILLEGAL ITALIAN
DRIFTNETTERS FROM THE BALEARIC SEA </B>
<P><B>Balearic Sea, Western Mediterranean - 12th August 1996</B>
 
<P>Last night at 12:30, the MV Arctic Sunrise approached the end
of a driftnet  seven miles long. 

<P>Hours before, Spanish
fishermen had radioed the net's position, as was 
agreed during the meeting held with them onboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic 
Sunrise  on Sunday afternoon.
 
<P>Around 20 Spanish driftneters tied along the net, mantaining a 
distance of 200 meters between each vessel.  Next, three inflatables 
from the Arctic Sunrise went into the area.  An activist tied wooden fish and 
turtles to the italian net  to make the hauling operation more dificult.

<P>Spanish driftneters, upset because of the continuing situation with illegal driftnets, took the net, hauling it aboard their boats. In the net 
 a sea turtle and a swordfish were found in the net ( and then released alive ). <P>Some Spanish
longline fishermen cut the illegal Italian driftnet and took away  pieces of it which were 
left in the water.
 
<P>The Italian driftnetter -the name of which could not be identified- 
then escaped from the area.
 
<P>In the meantime, some longliners sailed to another net 2 nm away from the first one and tied  up to it. The driftnetter 
(SEBASTIANO ACIPLATANI) started to haul quickly. Greenpeace 
inflatables were trying to stop the operation, and Italian 

fishermen threw potatoes and other objects at them, shouting 
and using abusive language.
 
<P>The tension grew. The illegal Italian driftnetter shot four bengal lights against 
environmenatlists and fishing boats. Some crews almost came to blows, 
and the situation was quite dangerous. In the meantime GP 
inflatables were asking for a peaceful protest. Eventually, this 
second driftnetter abandoned the area.
 
<P>" Both our fleet and the environmentalists want the total elimination 
of the driftnets. We want the Spanish government to pressure 
Italy to dismantle this fleet and we want the European Union to 
ban this type of fishing" said the skipper of one of the 
longiners who participated in the action.

<P>
Today, Spanish Mediterranean longliners have had a meeting onboard the MV Arctic
 Sunrise with Greenpeace members.  
<P>The aim was to joint efforts against illegal

driftnet fishing. During this meeting, it was agreed to take actions to eject th
e Italian driftnetters from the Balearic sea as well as to ask the Spanish gover
nment to push Italy to implement a plan to eliminate driftnet fishing.
 
<P>Both fishermen and environmentalists agree on their opposition to this type of no

n selective fishing. Apart from the problem of its illegal use, high seas driftn
etting makes a great impact over the commercial and not commercial  marine speci
es.

<P><B>Note for the editor</B>: 

<P>The maximum net lenth per vessel established by the European community and the
Italian government is two and a half kilometres, nevertheless the Italian
fishermen use nets of 12, 15 or even 20 kilometres of length. Less than  20% of
the fish caught is swordfish (the target species) and the rest of the catch is
normally discarded. Sperm whales and dolphin populations in the Mediterranean
are seriously threatened if this type of net is not eliminated.

<p><b>MACMILLAN BLOEDEL SUES GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS
</b></p>
<P><B>Greenpeace vows to continue battle against logging giant
</B>



<P>
<B>Vancouver August 12th, 1996 3:00pm local time</B>

<P>Greenpeace announced today
that MacMillan Bloedel is pursuing a lawsuit, injunction and
restraining order to try to stop Greenpeace protests about the
clearcutting of the temperate rainforest.
 
<P>The legal action stems from a series of protests Greenpeace carried
out last week against the MacMillan Bloedel log barge the Haida
Brave.  The barge carries raw logs from the temperate rainforest to
Southern British Columbia and is one of the world's largest log
barges carrying up to 400 logging trucks worth of wood each load.
 
<P>Contrary to MacMillan Bloedel's statements there is no "truce"
between Greenpeace and the logging giant. "MacMillan Bloedel is the
#1 rainforest destroyer in Canada and we pledge to stop this
destruction. Public protests of this kind are a critical part of
the democratic process" said Steve Shallhorn, Greenpeace Canada
Campaign Director.
 
<P>In response to MacMillan Bloedel's claims that they are acting out
of concern for the safety of the activists, Karen Mahon, Greenpeace
forests campaigner named in the lawsuit said, "I do not believe
that suing a single mother of one for trying to save the rainforest
is motivated by 'safety concerns'.  It is an act of intimidation
and we refuse to be intimidated".
 
<P>Greenpeace and MacMillan Bloedel will appear in the Supreme Court
of British Columbia on Friday August 16th.
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium on logging in the remaining
intact areas of rainforest.

<P>
<B>Howe Sound British Columbia August 9th, 1996</B>
 
 
<P>Greenpeace activists
occupying one of the world's largest log barges, the Haida Brave,
left the site of the two-day long blockade. 
 
<P>Under RCMP supervision, the six activists, who had attached
themselves to cranes and the log deck onboard the barge,
disembarked the Haida Brave at 8:00 p.m. Pacific time. 
 
<P>Said Karen Mahon, one of the people occupying the Haida Brave's
crane, "'We successfully blockaded the Haida Brave for 38 hours,
stopping it from dumping its load of clearcut rainforest logs. This
is only the beginning. Greenpeace is determined to continue to work
to protect the temperate rainforests and expose those responsible
for its destruction."
 
<P>Satellite mapping has shown that over 50 per cent of the productive
rainforests on the BC coast have already been logged.  Company
plans reveal that half of the remaining intact valleys will be
logged or roaded in the coming five years. 
 
<P>The Haida Brave and the Haida Monarch travel the BC coast two to
three times per week, and on each trip carry the equivalent of 400
loaded logging trucks. Approximately 25-million cubic meters of
British Columbia's 73-million meters Allowable Annual Cut is
oldgrowth temperate rainforest. 
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for a full moratorium on logging in the
remaining pristine rainforest valleys and an end to clearcutting
and new road building in the temperate rainforests.

<P>Greenpeace activists currently blockading MacMillan Bloedel's log

<P>Activists chained themselves to the Haida Brave at 5:30 this
morning to protest rainforest destruction. Both the Haida Brave and
the Haida Monarch transport clearcut ancient rainforest from the
coast of B.C. to mills in the south of the province: each barge
transports the equivalent of 400 loaded logging trucks.
Approximately 25-million cubic metres of B.C.'s 73-million cubic
metre Annual Allowable Cut is old-growth temperate rainforest.
 
<P>Said Karen Mahon, one of the Greenpeace people onboard the Haida
Brave, "At the current rate of logging, many of the remaining
rainforest valleys will be roaded or clearcut within the next 10
years. We can not stand by and watch as MacMillan Bloedel destroys
British Columbia's rainforest."
 
<P>At the site of the protest no one has yet been arrested. Late this
afternoon, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sergeant Browoski
told Greenpeace that they had been ordered to leave the site of the
protest by the office of the Attorney General. It is unclear when
the RCMP will return.
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium of all logging in the

<p><b>GREENPEACE AGAIN BLOCKADES WORLD'S LARGEST LOG BARGE TO PROTEST
RAINFOREST DESTRUCTION
 
</b></p>

<P><B>calls for a moratorium on logging in pristine
rainforest areas and a 50 per cent reduction in the rate of cut. 
</B> 



<P>
<B>Howe Sound British Columbia August 8th, 1996 -</B>
 
 
 <P>Today at dawn, activists
deployed from the Greenpeace ship the Moby Dick blockaded the
Haida Brave, the world's largest log barge, stopping it from
dumping its load of rainforest logs at Howe Sound. 
 
<P>Owned by MacMillan Bloedel, the Haida Brave and its sister ship,
the Haida Monarch, are used to transport logs clearcut from the
temperate rainforests to mills in southern British Columbia.  The
activists used zodiacs to board the barge and locked themselves
onto it. Others attached themselves to the barge's crane towers
with banners that read, 'MacMillan Bloedel, #1 Rainforest
Destroyer', and 'Save Canada's Rainforests'.
 
<P>"People were outraged when the news got out that the Amazon
rainforests were being destroyed, yet 85% of the Brazilian Amazon
still stands. In Canada the bulldozers are moving faster than
public awareness  -- yet we have already lost over 50% of our
rainforest valleys," said Tzeporah Berman of Greenpeace
International.
 
<P>Today's blockade follows a series of actions last week when
Greenpeace and Haida First Nation activists blockaded the Haida
Brave to prevent it from removing a load of rainforest logs from
Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands).  Greenpeace is vowing to
stop the barge for as long as possible.
 
<P>The Haida Brave and Haida Monarch travel the BC coast two to
three times per week and on each trip carry the equivalent of 400
loaded logging trucks.
 
<P>Greenpeace forest campaigner Karen Mahon chained herself to the
barge saying, "Unless we take action now, most of the remaining
pristine rainforest valleys will be gone within 10 years. The
current 12 per cent protection target ensures that companies like
MacMillan Bloedel will be allowed to destroy the majority of
Canada's ancient rainforests."  
 
<P>Canada's rainforest stretches from south of Vancouver along the
west coast to the Alaskan border. Currently only 5.9 per cent of
the rainforest is protected. The government is currently
embarking on a new management plan (through the LRMP process) for
the Coastal
Rainforest zone. 
<P>The BC State of the Environment Reporting Office
released a report on July 16 stating that one in 10 plant and
vertebrate species in BC are under threat of extinction. Logging
is cited as one of the primary causes of species decline.
<P>Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium on all logging in the
remaining pristine rainforest areas, an immediate end to all

<P><B>   GREENPEACE CONFRONTS IRRESPONSIBLE FRASER RIVER  SALMON FISHERY
</B>
  
<P>VANCOUVER, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 7TH, 1996


<P><B> Activists stop gillnets from being deployed--Condemn Federal
management 
</B>
 
                                     
<P>Today Greenpeace activists
interfered with gillnets deployed in the controversial Fraser
River commercial sockeye fishery.  Volunteers in zodiacs,
launched from the Greenpeace vessel Moby Dick, pulled gillnets
from the water and
bundled them with twine to prevent sockeye catches. The action
was designed to highlight the irresponsible decision of the
federal government to go ahead with a one day gillnet opening
despite the extremely small size of this year's Fraser River run.
 
<P>"This is not the "risk averse" management we were promised - this
is a complete failure of the federal government's  mandate to
conserve fish for the future," said Catherine Stewart, Greenpeace
Fisheries Campaigner.  "Canadians should be asking who has
pressured the federal government to make this decision.
Greenpeace believes the Department of Fisheries has caved in to
the lobby efforts of B.C.Packers and the Canadian Fishing
Company. Industry's processing needs are taking precedence over
conservation."
 
<P>Despite unreliable estimates of an increase in the run size to
2.7 million sockeye, the 1996 run is still the smallest in almost
50 years. DFO has set targets of 2.5 to 5 million spawners in
recent years, this year's low target of 1.1 million spawners was
based only on the low returns. Greenpeace roundly denounced the
claim that a total run of 2.7 million is enough to allow for a
commercial fishery.
 
<P>In May, 1996, Greenpeace issued a comprehensive "Salmon Recovery
Plan" which includes a demand for a moratorium on commercial
fishing of all vulnerable salmon stocks including the Fraser
River sockeye runs.
 
<P>Canada has committed themselves the Precautionary Principle
regarding fisheries management at the United Nations conference
on Highly Migratory and straddling stocks, and DFO has
additionally committed to a risk averse management strategy. 
Allowing a commercial fishery on a run that is this low when
returns have been so difficult to accurately predict is clearly a
violation of these commitments and poses a serious threat to the
stocks.
 
<P>Greenpeace demands the immediate closure of commercial fisheries
for Fraser sockeye in 1996 with no further openings allowed.

<p><b>GREENPEACE STOPS WORLD'S LARGEST LOG BARGE</b></p>




<P>
<B>Vancouver/Amsterdam, August 2nd, 1996  </B>


<P>Yesterday Greenpeace activists
boarded and stopped the world's largest log barge, owned by
multinational logging company MacMillan Bloedel, at Haida Gwaii in the
Queen Charlotte Islands of Canada. The action, carried out off the
Coast of British Columbia by 3 activists, is aimed at preventing
further destruction of the remaining ancient Canadian rain forests.

<P>As logs were being loaded onto the barge, two Greenpeace inflatables
approached the loading operation by water and three Greenpeace
activists climbed onto the barge. The activists locked themselves onto
the cranes of the barge and unfurled a banner that read " MacMillan
Bloedel - Number 1 Rainforest Destroyers." The operators were forced
to stop all loading operations for several hours before they could cut
off the activists. 

<P>Haida First Nation natives supported the Greenpeace action and joined
in the protest in their war canoes, thus blocking the barge and
preventing it from continuing its work. The Haida have accused the
company and the Canadian Government of ignoring the concerns of the
local people and stealing and plundering their forests. "MacMillan
Bloedel is tearing down irreplaceable Canadian rainforests and
shipping them out at a rate that will destroy the Haida Gwaii forest
within 5 - 10 years", said Ralph Stocker, a local Haida activist at
the site of the barge occupation.


<P>Greenpeace is calling for permanent protection of all the remaining
ancient rainforest areas that are still intact in the Haida Gwaii
area. "At a time when the Brazilian Government has recently announced
a 2 year ban on the logging of all mahogany in the Amazonian rain
forest, Greenpeace urges the Canadian Government to announce a
moratorium on all industrial logging in the threatened Canadian rain
forests", said Thilo Bode, Executive Director of Greenpeace
International.

<P>The barge, called the Haida Monarch, can carry a log load equivalent
to 400 logging trucks. MacMillan Bloedel is one of the largest timber
companies in the world and is the number one destroyer of Canada's
threatened rain forests, cutting an annual 1.2 million cubic metres of
wood on Haida Gwaii alone.

<P>The Haida Monarch loads up with logs two or three times a week from
Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. This means that over 30,000 cubic
metres of timber are logged every week from the rain forests in the
region and transported down the coast to mills near Vancouver for
processing.         

<P>Canada's coastal temperate rainforests, which comprise 25 per cent of
the remaining coastal temperate rainforests in the world, are found
exclusively in a narrow band along British Columbia's coast. This type
of rainforest once found on every continent except Africa and
Antarctica is one of the most endangered forest types in the world. 

<P>Less than 6 per cent of Canada's ancient rainforests are protected
from logging and approximately one third of this rainforest has
already disappeared. These forests are home to countless plants and
animals including endangered grizzly bears and wolves, otters, eagles
and salmon and trees that are hundreds of years old.

Haida activists, protesting the logging giant's destruction of
temperate rainforest on their islands.  

<P>Late yesterday,  eight Haida paddled a cedar canoe into Masset
Inlet in front of the village of Old Masset.  Other members of
the First Nations community accompanied the paddlers in small
boats.  The activists brought the barge to a standstill as it
attempted to leave the area loaded with logs. Eventually
operators of the barge retreated back inside Masset Inlet.

<P>The action followed another confrontation with barge earlier in

the day, launched by Greenpeace activists who boarded the "Haida

<BR>MC CLINTON BAY, HAIDA GWAII, BRITISH COLUMBIA , 
</B>


 
<P> Today on Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands)
Greenpeace activists boarded and prevented further
loading of the Haida Brave one of the world's largest
log barges. Owned by MacMillan Bloedel, the ship is used
to transport raw logs from clearcut areas of temperate
rainforest to pulp and lumber mills in the south of
British Columbia.
 
<P> As logs were being loaded onto the Haida Brave, two Greenpeace
zodiacs approached the loading operation by water, chained
themselves onto the barge.  The operators were forced to stop
all loading procedures and responding by rocking the ship
trying to shake the activists off.  
 
<P> "MacMillan Bloedel is tearing down these irreplaceable
rainforests and shipping them out at an astonishing rate," 
said Tamara Stark, Greenpeace Forests Campaigner. "Greenpeace
will not stand idly by and allow the last areas of pristine
rainforest be destroyed."
 
<P> MacMillan Bloedel currently cuts 1.2-million cubic metres of
 
wood on Haida Gwaii each year and ships the raw logs
 
off-island to mills in the lower mainland and Vancouver Island
 
for processing. None of the four logging companies currently
 
clearcutting on Haida Gwaii operate processing facilities
 
on-island. A local community process (Island Community Stability
 
Initiative which brings together people from Share BC, Haida
 
First
 
Nations and MacMillan Bloedel staff and the environmental
 
community) has called for a 50% reduction in the volume logged
 
annually and for dramatic tenure reform which would give the
 
local
 
community more control over forest management. The logs are
 
coming from disputed land that the Haida are currently
 
claiming through the treaty process.
 
 
 
<P> "Every time the barge goes by loaded with logs, everyone knows
 
and feels it's grand theft taking place, that it's genocide
 
for the Haida people and a continuation of the company's and
 
government's intentions to log off our islands for their own
 
benefit. They take with them our past and our future. It must
 
be stopped," said Ralph Stocker a Haida First Nations
 
activist. 
 
 
 
<P> Greenpeace is vowing to stop the barge for as long as
 
possible.
 
<P> Haida Gwaii is one of the areas of concern within the
temperate rainforest region. Canada's temperate rainforest
stretches from South of Vancouver along the west coast to the
Alaskan border and currently 96% of it is open to logging. 
Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium on all logging in the
remaining pristine rainforest areas and for full biological
and cultural assessments.

<P><B> ITALIAN PLAN TO ELMINATE DRIFNETS NOT GOOD ENOUGH SAYS GREENPEACE</B>
<P><B>Amsterdam - 27th July 1996</B>

<P>Greenpeace today criticised a multi-million dollar plan to eliminate

Italian driftnets by 1999 as lacking  in the detail needed to end 
illegal driftnetting practices  in the Mediterranean.

<P>An estimated $283 million of public money -- half of it from the
European Union and half from the Italian Government -- is believed to
have been allocated to the programme.

<P>"Of course we strongly support  the objective of ending overfishing
and the accidental catching in driftnets of whales and dolphins and
other marine species, " said Greenpeace campaigner Alessandro Gianni,
"but this is a huge amount of public money and we would have expected
a much more detailed and thorough plan from the Italian Government.

<P>"The plan contains no indication of how the nets will be withdrawn
from use or how this will be verified. Unless this is ensured the nets
will continue to be used  and the whole programme could turn out to be
a huge waste of public money. Even the European Commission has
insisted that compensation should be linked to the confiscation and

destruction of the nets."

<P>In addition, the  plan is voluntary and while it states that those who
continue to use driftnets will be subject to stricter controls, the
Italian Government has a poor record in this area. Earlier this year
the EU confirmed that illegal driftnetting by italian fleets was
widespread.

<P>"A control system must be put in place to ensure that the money
allocated to compensate fishermen is effectively used to eliminate
driftnets once and for all," added Greenpeace.

<P>The Greenpeace boat Arctic Sunrise has been patrolling the sea around
Sicily this week and identified 10 illegal driftnets in a few days. 
In the last four fishing seasons alone 32 sperm whales  were
discovered dead as a result of driftnet fishing off the Balearic
Islands. The true total will be much higher.

<P>The Italian fleet is thought to be responsible for the largest number
of illegal driftnets in the world. Their target is primarily swordfish
but other animals are caught up in the nets and die.

Amazon -- with the news that the Brazilian President has signed a two
year moratorium on mahogany logging.

<P>"This is a major step forward," said Tim Birch, Greenpeace
International Forest Campaigner. "We have been campaigning for a
moratorium on mahogany in Brazil for more than three years." 

<P>The international market for mahogany is the driving force behind
massive deforestation and colonisation which is opening up vast areas
of untouched Amazonian rainforest, one of the most important and
threatened ecosystems on the planet.

<P>Greenpeace will now be trying to ensure that the moratorium -- which
still has to be approved by the Brazilian Congress -- is properly
implemented and enforced. The moratorium was agreed by President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and follows the release of new data showing
an increase in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon region.

<P>In another significant step welcomed by Greenpeace, the president has
also anounced a ban on increasing deforestation in agricultural areas
in the Amazon. This measure - if approved by the Brazilian parliament
- will limit the area liberated for deforestation in forest regions
from the current 50 per cent to 20 per cent.

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CALL FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION ON INDUSTRIAL FISHING</b></p>

<p>COPENHAGEN, THURSDAY, JULY 25th 1996 </p>


 
<p>Environmental, fishing groups and politicians
today called for urgent action from 
governments to address industrial fishing in the North Sea as the Greenpeace
ship MV Sirius concluded the
first stage of its campaign against overfishing. 

 
<p>A total 15 fishing associations,  16 environmental groups,  European
politicans, fish buying and selling
companies and marine scientists have signed petitions calling on Dutch, German
and British governments
to  ensure urgent measures are taken to control industrial fishing in sensitive
marine areas of the North Sea.
 
<p>The MV Sirius today arrived in Copenhagen from the Wee Bankie area off the
Scottish coast near Edinburgh. 
 
<p>For the past three months the MV Sirius  has been conducting direct action to
stop industrial fishing 
by Danish, Scottish, Norwegian and English boats in an area known as the Wee
Bankie off the Scottish 
North Sea coast.
 
<p>Greenpeace is calling on European Environment Ministers, at a special meeting

of the North Sea Ministers
conference in March next year to agree an emergency recovery plan for the
overfished North Sea. This should
include a programme to increase all threatened fish stocks such as cod, herring
and plaice to safe levels, a ban
on discarding, massive reductions to by-catch of other species and major cuts
to fishing capacity. 
 
<p>"European environment ministers must look beyond national self-interest and
take urgent action to 
stop the current plundering of  North Sea fish stocks which cannot withstand
current fishing levels
and practises," said a Greenpeace spokesperson

<P><B>UNREGULATED TESTS OF GENE-TECH PLANTS THREATEN 
ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
</B>
  
<P><b>AARHUS, DENMARK, MONDAY JUNE 22ND, 1996</b>
 

<P>Unregulated field-testing of genetically

manipulated plants threaten 
to cause genetic pollution and damage to the environment and economy of
developing countries,
 Greenpeace concludes in a case-study of Guatemala released on Monday at the
start of global 
negotiations on a Biosafety Protocol in Aarhus (Denmark).
 
<P>Investigations by Greenpeace Central American office in Guatemala found that
one of the companies,
the US-based Asgrow, which had imported and tested genetically 
engineered tomato, squash and cantaloupe, had taken no measures to prevent
accidental releases 
of genetical material from the genetically engineered products. 
<P>Several varieties of tomato and squash in particular can be found in Guatemala,
making genetic 

pollution an acute risk. In fact, for these two species, Guatemala represents a
center of biological 
diversity, and as such a unique gene-pool for future cultivation. This could
well be destroyed by 
such irresponsible activities. 
 
<P>Guatemala has no legislation to specifically regulate the flow of genetically
engineered organisms 
and the country has been used as a testing field. Even the Ministry of
Agriculture, Guatemala's 
competent authority for the import of seeds, was not informed about those
tests. 
Not even a prior notification was received by these authorities, despite the
threat of 
ecological and economic damage. In fact, the introduction of improved
commercial species could 
totally displace other varieties and accelerate the disappearance of native
cultivars.
 
<P>Since 1994, Greenpeace has documented several illegal and unregulated
field-tests of gene-tech plants
 in developing countries."There is clearly a need for a stringent biosafety

protocol, which regulates 
not only the transboundary movement of genetic material, but also provides
clear rules of liability 
which makes foreign companies responsible for the damage they may cause", says
Jester Grolin, 
Greenpeace Political adviser on genetic engineering.
 
<P>Until such a stringent protocol is in place, Greenpeace urges governments at
the global biosafety
 negotiations in Aarhus to introduce an unconditional moratorium on all
field-testing and releases
 of genetically manipulated organisms.

<B>
<P>Background information:
<P>Genetic engineering allows the transfer of genes between totally unrelated
species. <P>Genes have
 been transferred from humans to fish, from bacteria to plants and from animals
to vegetables. 
<P>In this manner, food companies believe genetic engineering can improve the
quality of certain 
foodstuffs. However, independent studies are still underway to verify  that
this type of products
 do not present toxic effects or allergic reactions in humans. In addition,
genetically manipulated 
plants can transfer their "alien" gene to wild related plant species threby
causing genetic pollution
 of natural species. 
<P>Greenpeace believes that a precautionary approach should
be applied in general, 
otherwise the consumers' health would be at risk for the commercial interests
of these companies.

<P>The Biosafety Protocol is being negotiated as part of the Biodiversity
Convention 
agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio.

<P><B>WHALERS FAILURE TO FILL QUOTAS CASTS DOUBT ON POPULATION ESTIMATES
<P>International Whaling Commission (IWC) Conference, Aberdeen</B>
  
<P>OSLO, TUESDAY, JULY 16TH, 1996






<P>Norwegian whalers failure to fill their 
expanded 
quotas of minke whales in the North Sea, as the season ended at 
midnight 
Monday,  cast serious doubt on the Norwegian population estimates, 
Greenpeace and the International Fund for Animal Welfare  said 
today.

<P> "In 1995 a Norwegian whaling ship with an all-whaler crew spent a 
month 
sighting minke whales and the resulting data used to estimate a 
population of 20,294 minkes for the northern North Sea, "  Greenpeace 

whale campaigner John Frizell said. "A year later four Norwegian 
whaling 
vessels given quotas of 42 minke whales for that area were unable to 
fill them in a season that was extended a week to last almost two 
months."

<P>The Norwegian government has not yet released catch figures by area 
but 
it is believed that three of the four vessels hunting in the northern 

North Sea, between Edinburgh and Shetlands,  ended the hunt with 
their 
quotas unfilled despite the season being extended .

<P>"This shows how ludicrous the population estimate is," said INFAW 
spokesperson Vassili Papastavrou. "The Norwegians are claiming that 
there are over 20,000 minke whales in the northern North Sea  that is 
a 
population density of over one whale every four square miles 
square 
kilometres). It is very surprising that the whalers cannot find the 
whales if there really are this many."

<P>An international collaborative survey sponsored by the European 
Union, 
which was more intensive that the Norwegian survey, estimated about 
3,600 whales for the same area in 1994.

"The whaling industry says that there are plenty of whales but their 
ability to catch them does not bear this out," said Papastavrou. 
"Probably they will blame bad luck or bad weather but I have no doubt 

that we will discover the present Norwegian estimate is much too 
high."

<P>Norway raised its quota of minke whales by more than 50 percent -- 

from 
232 last year to 425. The Norwegian whalers caught 382 of this new 
quota.

<p><b>DANISH INDUSTRIAL FISHING CREW THREATENS TO SINK GREENPEACE VESSEL M.V.SIRIUS
</b></p>

<p>AMSTERDAM, MONDAY, JULY 11th 1996 </p>


<P> A Danish industrial fishing vessel 
threatened to sink the  
Greenpeace boat, MV Sirius, during confrontations this morning off 
the Scottish North  
Sea coast, near Edinburgh. 
 
<P>Greenpeace spokesperson on board the MV Sirius, Desley Mather, said 
as the Danish  
vessel Triton approached the Sirius around 8.30 am a radio message 
was received in  
Danish which stated: "Better put on your lifejackets. We're going to 
sink you now". The  
crew of the Triton later fired a flare towards the MV Sirius.  
  
<P>Earlier, a second Danish vessel, the Long Forties, had harassed the 
Sirius, drawing  
along side the vessel. A Fisheries Protection boat, the HMS Alderney, 
launched an  
inflatable which moved between the two vessels after which the Long 
Forties changed  
course. 
 
<P>"Greenpeace is here to peacefully protest against industrial 
fisheries in sensitive  
marine areas and will not be intimidated by the aggressive tactics of 
the Danish  
fishing fleet," said Desley Mather. "It is time the European 
governments stopped  
talking and took some action to prevent this ecological disaster from 
continuing in the  
North Sea."    
 
<P>The exclusion of industrial fisheries from sensitive areas is one 
part of an emergency  
recovery plan needed for the overfished North Sea.  For industrial 
fisheries,  
Greenpeace also believes any catch limits outside sensitive areas 
should be set using  
the precautionary approach and bycatch of other species should be cut 
drastically.    
 
<P>Industrial fisheries are virtually unregulated and yet take nearly 50 
per cent of all  
fish landed in the North Sea. They use ultra-fine nets to catch 
sandeels and other  
small fish near the bottom of the marine food web. These fish are 
food for "table" fish  
(such as cod, haddock and whiting), sea birds and other marine 
wildlife.

the Wee Bankie area 20 km off the Scottish North Sea coast near Edinburgh.


<P>After Greenpeace tried to stop one of the vessels,  one chased back to throw

<P><B>BRITAIN'S MAJOR GREEN GROUPS JOINED BY FISHERMEN IN CALL
FOR ACTION ON INDUSTRIAL FISHING
 </B>
  
<P>MONDAY, JULY 1st 1996 

 

<P>Seven leading environment groups today join forces with
scientists, politicians and fishermen's organisations to
call on Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry MP to "ensure that urgent measures are taken to control industrial fishing"
in ecologically sensitive areas such as the Wee Bankie.
 
<P>The unique alliance uses an advertisement in today's
edition of  "The Independent" to deliver its message.  It is signed by the green groups
Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Royal Society for the
Protection of
Birds,  The Marine Conservation Society, The Scottish
Wildlife Trust, The Wildlife Trusts  (Royal Society of
Nature Conservation) and The World Wide Fund for Nature,
together with leading environmentalists David Bellamy and Jonathon Porritt; Alex Falconer MEP; Tony Rice of the
Southampton Oceanography Centre; The Abroath Fishermen's
Association; The Fishermen's Association Ltd; Fishermen's Mutual Association (Pittenweem) ; The Fife Fisherman's
Association and The Salmon and Trout Association.
 
<P>This week the groups are seeking a meeting with Tony
Baldry.
 
<P>The common demand comes as Danish and other fishing boats continue fine-net trawling for sandeels across the Wee
Bankie off Eastern Scotland, a feeding ground to
porpoises, dolphins, whales and tens of thousands of
seabirds, and a fish nursery.
 
<P>The statement highlights the importance of protecting the "feeding, spawning and nursery grounds".  Haddock, once a mainstay of Arbroath fisheries (Arbroath smokies) are now almost absent from the Wee Bankie thanks to overfishing.
 
<P>Greenpeace Campaign Director Chris Rose says "It is
unprecedented that Britain's major environmental
organisations can unite with people in the fishing
industry to oppose industrial sandeel fishing: the
Minister must now wake up to public opinion and put a
stop to this unacceptable hoovering of the seas".
 
<P><B>Statement:</B>
 
<P>(Addressed to Rt Hon Tony Baldry MP, Minister of State,
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: `Regarding
industrial fishing for sandeels on the Wee Bankie off the Scottish coast and other areas of the North Sea')
 
<P><B>"Recognizing the importance of protecting the marine
environment and conserving fish feeding, spawning and
nursery grounds, the following organisations and
individuals call on the UK Government to ensure that
urgent measures are taken to control industrial fishing
in sensitive areas."</B>

<P><B>DANISH FISHERMEN THREATEN TO SINK GREENPEACE SHIP, M.V. SIRIUS
 </B>
  
<P>FRIDAY, JUNE 28TH 1996 





<P>At seven o'clock this morning we've launched two inflatbles again
to start messing around with the Scottish Omega B. This was the
first vessel we did actions on last sunday. They then left the
Wee Bankie. 
<P>Omega B asked for assistance and the Jannie replied
that all Danish vessels were standby for help. HMS Shetland
called on the radio for an inspection of the Omega B. 
<P>We changed
to the Jannie. The fisheries protection people went over to the
Jannie as well. Jannie was hauling it's net and there not a
single fish in it. It seems like they've fished out most of the
sandeels by now. The fleet is very scattered over the banks to
find the last sandeels.


<P>8.45 hrs: 'this is vessel Pernille for Sirius, will you give up
your actions in the area if not we are going to sink you now.'
Then Pernille and Jannie came after us. They are getting very
close, we can see the men on the fore deck ready with the
grappling hooks and flares. For entering, to tear up the three
inflatables still on deck? All paople are on deck wearing life
jackets and survival suits waiting for things to happen. I'll
send this out now and go on deck too.



<B><P>Later radio exchanges between the Danish industrial fishing fleet, fisheries protection vessel HMS Shetland and
Greenpeace vessel M.V. Sirius:


</B>

<P>

<B>8.55 hrs</B>

<P>'This is Pernille Kim fir Sirius. If you wanna save your ship .
We will sink it now and all our collegues are coming. If you
wanna save your ship and your crew and all the members on your
ship you are requested to cancel your mission immedeately. Then
we let your ship and the people go.
This time we've got you.
OK you have been warned.'


<P>Then the vessels Pernille Kim and Jannie started the chase, the
crew ready on the fore deck with grappling hooks etc..


<P><B>9.55 hrs</B>

<P>HMS Shetland for vessel Jannie
'You're now inside British territorial limits. Your current
actions are prejudicial to good order and peace woithin British
territorial seas. Therefore we ask you to call off your present
pursuit of the vessels in front of you.'


<P>Jannie: 'OK we stop.'


<P><B>10.00 hrs</B>
The chase is off, but the whole fishing fleet has stopped fishing
and is now coming our direction.

<P><B>FISHERIES PROTECTION REQUESTS GREENPEACE TO CEASE "INTERFERING"   
WITH INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES OFF THE SCOTTISH COAST 
 </B>
  
<P>TUESDAY, JUNE 25TH 1996 

<P>Greenpeace this morning was continuing its 
campaign to stop industrial   
fishing in sensitive marine areas off the Scottish North Sea Coast 
despite a request from the Fisheries   
Protection Agency to stop interfering with the fishing vessels.   
  

<P>Greenpeace spokesperson aboard the MV Sirius Stefan Flothmann said it 
was ironic that the   
government agency entrusted with protecting the marine environment 
was telling Greenpeace to stop    
campaigning. Industrial fisheries are virtually unregulated and yet 
take nearly 50 per cent of all fish   
landed in the North Sea, he said.   
  

<P>"Greenpeace is protecting the marine environment of the North Sea  
while European governments are   
protecting the financial interests of the industrial fishing fleet," 
said Flothmann. "Greenpeace is   
calling on European governments to stop industrial fishing in 
sensitive marine areas of the North   
Sea."  
  

<P>Greenpeace this morning was again attempting to stop Danish vessels 
from industrial fishing in an   
area known as the Wee Bankie, a feeding ground for birds,  fish, 
dolphins and other marine wildlife    
near Edinburgh off the Scottish North Sea coast.   
  

<P>Greenpeace's third consecutive day of  protest began at 8 am with the 
Greenpeace vessel MV Sirius,   
using four swimmers with buoys and four inflatable boats, attempting 
to stop the Danish vessel   
Thinghold from fishing in the Wee Bankie.  
  

<P>At least two other Danish industrial fishing vessels were in the area 
and also a Fisheries Protection   
boat.   
  

<P>"Greenpeace will  stay on the Wee Bankie and continue to protest 
non-violently against industrial   
fishing in sensitive marine areas until either the industry agrees to 
leave these areas or European   
governments take action to stop this destructive fishing practise in 
the North Sea," said Stefan   
Flothmann.  
  

<P>Yesterday a Danish industrial fishing vessel rammed the MV Sirius 
while others fired flares at   
Greenpeace inflatable boats during a confrontation between Greenpeace 
and 11 industrial fishing   
boats including one Scottish registered vessel. On Sunday the English 
vessel, Omega B, agreed to   
leave the area after Greenpeace stopped it fishing on the Wee Bankie. 
  
  

<P>Industrial fisheries using ultra-fine nets to catch sandeels and 
other small fish near the bottom of the   
marine food web.  These fish are food for "table" fish (cod, haddock 
and  whiting), sea birds, whales   
and dolphins and other marine wildlife.  
  

<P>The exclusion of industrial fisheries from sensitive areas is  one 
part of an emergency recovery plan   
needed for the overfished  North Sea. For industrial fisheries, 
Greenpeace also believes any catch   
limits outside sensitive areas should be set using the precautionary 
approach  and bycatch of other   
species should be cut drastically.

<P><B>BASIS FOR NORWEGIAN WHALING WRONG: IWC SCIENTISTS.

<P>International Whaling Commission (IWC) Conference, Aberdeen</B>
  
<P>ABERDEEN, MONDAY, JUNE 24TH, 1996







<P>
 
A new estimate adopted unanimously by IWC scientists demonstrates
that Norway re-opened its whaling industry under false premises,
Greenpeace said from the IWC conference in Aberdeen today.
 

<P>In 1992 Norway announced that it was starting whaling on the
strength of an estimate of 86,732 minke whales, an estimate
prepared by Norwegian scientists. This number, the IWC later
found, had been inflated by a computer error.  The IWC now
estimate that the number should have been 67,500.
 

<P>"That is a drop of almost 20,000" said Greenpeace whale
campaigner, John Frizell, "Norway's decision to start whaling was
based on a mistake".
 
<P>A 1995 Norwegian survey of the same minke population produced an
estimate of 118,000, a substantial increase on 1992. The slow
growth rate of whales means that this difference cannot be due
 
to natural increase. John Frizell, "In the last 15 months Norway
has announced population figures ranging from 69,600 to 112,000.
It is clear that Norway just don't know how many whales there
are".
 
<P>Norway has used this latest estimate to justify its decision to
nearly double its quota from 232 to 425 minke whales in 1996. 
Ironically the market for whale meat in Norway has collapsed and
subsidies are now required to keep the hunt alive. Figures
released last week show that Norway had only sold 59 of the 239
whales it had killed.
 
 

 
 

<B><P>Notes to correspondents:</B>

<P> Both the 1989 survey (which produced the figures used in 1992)
and the 1995 survey were paid for by Norway, used mostly
Norwegian whalers as observers and the data was prepared in
Norway.  The final calculations were done by a Norwegian computer
programme.

<P><B>INDUSTRIAL FISHING CREWS FIRE FLARES AT GREENPEACE BOATS
 </B>
  
<P>MONDAY, JUNE 24TH 1996 


<P>Danish industrial fishing vessels were 
firing flares at Greenpeace inflatable boats as the 
environmental group continued its campaign this morning to stop 
industrial fishing in sensitive marine areas, near Edinburgh off 
the Scottish North Sea coast.


<P>The MV Sirius confronted a group of one Scottish and 10 Danish 
industrial fishing vessels this morning in an area known as the 
Wee Bankie off the Firth of Forth, east of Edinburgh. The Wee 
Bankie is a major feeding ground for commercial fish stocks, 
dolphins and birds.

<P>The 11 vessels initially stopped fishing when Greenpeace 
launched four inflatables this morning with 12 activists aboard. 
However the Scottish vessel, Aquarius 2, continued fishing. 
Greenpeace, using three swimmers and floating rope stopped the 
Scottish vessel while other activists attached a barrel to the 
net and stopped it from sinking.

<P>The crew of a Danish vessel then pulled along side the MV Sirius 
and fired a flare across its bows and flung grappling hooks at 
the boat. Later other industrial fishing boats fired flares at 
Greenpeace inflatables. 

<P>"Greenpeace will not be intimidated by the industrial fishing 
fleet and will continue to protest non-violently against 
industrial fishing in sensitive marine areas such as the Wee 
Bankie," said Stefan Flothmann. "The governments of Europe must 
take action to stop this plundering of the North Sea."

<P>Yesterday Greenpeace stopped one English and five Danish 
industrial fishing boats from fishing on the Wee Bankie despite 
attempts by the Danish crew to slash the inflatable boats with 
knives on poles. The English vessel, the Omega B, agreed to 
leave the area.

<P>Industrial fisheries using ultra-fine nets takes about 50 per 
cent of all fish landed in the North Sea. They catch sandeels 
and other small fish near the bottom of the marine food web. 
These fish are food for "table" fish such as cod, haddock and 
whiting, sea birds and other marine wildlife.

<P>The exclusion of industrial fisheries from sensitive areas is 
one part of an emergency recovery plan needed for the overfished 
North Sea. For industrial fisheries, Greenpeace also believes 
any catch limits outside sensitive areas should be set using the 
precautionary approach  and bycatch of other species should be 
cut drastically.

<P><B>FISHING CREWS ATTEMPT TO SLASH INFLATABLE BOATS AS GREENPEACE 
CONFRONTS DANISH INDUSTRIAL FISHING FLEET OFF SCOTTISH COAST 
 </B>
  
<P>SUNDAY, JUNE 23rd 1996 release 3, 6pm


 

<P> Industrial fishing crews used poles with knives to try
and slash 
Greenpeace inflatable boats as the environmental organisation tried  to stop a
group of Danish vessels 
from industrial fishing this afternoon off the Firth of  Forth, on the Scottish
North Sea coast.
 

<P>Four Greenpeace activists from the Greenpeace ship MV Sirius and an oil boom
were placed in front 
of the Danish vessel the "Jannie" in an attempt to stop it fishing for sandeels
on the Wee Bankie, 
which is  a major feeding ground for commercial fish stocks,  dolphins, and
birds..
 
<P>The action began at about  2.10 pm and soon four other Danish industrial
fishing vessels arrived to 
assist the Jannie. During two hours of  manoeuvring the  fishing boats managed
to pull in and slash 
the oil boom and pull up several buoys held by the four Greenpeace activists in
the water. However 
Greenpeace successfully stopped the five vessels from fishing during afternoon. 
 
<P>Earlier today the MV Sirius successfully stopped the English industrial fishing
vessel Omega B from 
fishing on the Wee Bankie and the vessel agreed to leave the area. The MV
Sirius has been patrolling 
ecologically sensitive areas along the Scottish coast since the beginning of
May and prevented major 
industrial fishing activities.   
 
<P>"This is just the first confrontation of a long campaign against overfishing
until the European 
governments get sensible and take action to stop the plundering of the North
Sea," said Greenpeace 
spokesperson Stefan Flothmann.  "Industrial fisheries take about 50 per cent of
all fish landed in the 
North Sea yet are virtually  unregulated."
 
<P>Industrial fishing uses ultra-fine nets to catch sandeels and other small fish
near the bottom 
of the marine food web. These fish are food for "table" fish (such as cod,
haddock and whiting), sea 
birds and other marine wildlife. 
 
<P>The exclusion of industrial fisheries from sensitive areas is one part of an
emergency recovery plan 
needed for the overfished North Sea.  For industrial fisheries, Greenpeace also
believes any catch 
limits outside sensitive areas should be set using the precautionary approach
and bycatch of other 
species should be cut drastically.

<P><B>GREENPEACE STOPS INDUSTRIAL FISHING OFF THE SCOTTISH COAST  
 </B>
  
<P>SUNDAY, JUNE 23rd 1996






<P> The Greenpeace vessel MV Sirius used swimming
protesters and an oil 
boom today to stop an industrial fishing boat fishing in a sensitive marine
area off the Firth of Forth, 
on the Scottish North Sea coast.   
 

<P>The  English vessel,  Omega B, was found fishing at 4 am this morning east of
Edinburgh in an area 
known as the Wee Bankie. Greenpeace believes the Wee Bankie is ecologically
sensitive because it is 
a major feeding ground for commercial fish stocks,  dolphins, and birds
including the large 
population  on the Isle of  May.  The MV Sirius has been patrolling such areas
along the Scottish 
coast since the beginning of May and prevented major industrial fishing
activities in these areas.   
 
<P>"Until now the industrial fishing fleet has avoided these sensitive areas but
today the Omega B 
ignored our requests not to fish in this area. Other industrial fishing boats
have also been sighted and   
Greenpeace will be attempting to stop them," said Stefan Flothmann aboard the
MV Sirius. The Danish vessels, the Jannie and the Jette Toft, have been sighted
by the MV Sirius. 
 
<P>Greenpeace called the Omega B at 4.40 am and requested it to stop fishing in
the sensitive area but it 
refused.   Four Greenpeace protesters, wearing survival suits,  were placed in

the water in front of the 
Omega B in an attempt to stop the vessel but it continued. In a  second
successful attempt Greenpeace 
used an oil boom as well as the swimmers to stop the vessel fishing.  The Omega
B hauled in its net 
and told Greenpeace it would stop fishing in the area.     
 
<P> "Greenpeace has stopped the industrial fishing fleet on this occasion but it
is time for North Sea 
governments to take action and finally control the virtually  unregulated
industrial fishing industry
which takes about 50 per cent of all fish landed in the North Sea," Flothmann
said. "Overfishing is 
destroying the North Sea and industrial fishing is a major cause of this
ecological and economic 
crisis."
 
<P>Industrial fishing uses ultra-fine nets to catch sandeels and other small fish
near the bottom 
of the marine food web. These fish are food for "table" fish (such as cod,
haddock and whiting), sea 
birds and other marine wildlife. 
 
<P>The exclusion of industrial fisheries from sensitive areas is one part of an
emergency recovery plan 
needed for the overfished North Sea.  For industrial fisheries, Greenpeace also
believes any catch 
limits outside sensitive areas should be set using the precautionary approach
and bycatch of other 
species should be cut drastically.

<p><b>MAC BLO'S NEW LOGGING PLAN FOR CLAYOQUOT DOESN'T MEET EVEN B.C.'S
FOREST PRACTICES CODE</b></p>

<P><B>Blockade enters second day in Clayoquot Sound</B>


<P>VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUBIA, JUNE 21st 1996.
 
<P>Greenpeace, the Friends
of Clayoquot Sound and the Sierra Legal Defence Fund today revealed
that MacMillan Bloedel's proposed 5-year logging plan for an area
in Clayoquot Sound fails to meet even the rudimentary standards of
the Forest Practices Code, which are far less stringent than those
of the Clayoquot Scientific Panel which are supposed to apply in
this area.  
 
<P>The report and other key findings in Clayoquot prompted the
blockade that began in Clayoquot yesterday and is continuing today.
Currently, the Greenpeace ship MV Moby Dick is blocking
International Forest Products and MacMillan Bloedel from logging or
shipping out logs.
 
<P>In addition to the problems in the proposal for Tranaquil Creek,
there are a number of major problems in the adjacent watersheds. In
Rollingstone Creek, a road badly built by Interfor has collapsed
into a stream. In another, the Bulson watershed, one of Clayoquot's
remaining pristine watersheds, MacMillan Bloedel has already begun
clearcutting. Members of Greenpeace and the Friends of Clayoquot
Sound are on land, locked onto logging equipment and blocking four
roads.
 
<P>"Based on the information we've released over the past two days,
it's clear that these companies are steamrolling over the Science
Panel recommendations - on into the pristine valleys," said Valerie
Langer of the Friends of Clayoquot Sound.  
 
<P>A critique of the five-year plan for Tranquil Creek by lawyers and
fisheries biologists from the Sierra Legal Defence Fund documents
failures in the plan in more than 10 key categories.
 
<P>"MacMillan Bloedel has misclassified streams, failed to protect
fish habitat and plans to build roads on steep slopes exceeding a
80 per cent grade without adequate planning - all of which are not
in compliance with the Forest Practices Code," said Will Horter,
lawyer with the Sierra Legal Defence Fund. "This is a far cry from
the world-class logging we were promised when the Science Panel's
recommendations were adopted one year ago."
 
<P>Nearly one year ago the B.C. government and the companies logging
in Clayoquot pledged to fulfill all the recommendations made by the
Scientific Panel.
 
<P>"The pristine valleys and islands must be permanently protected,"
said Karen Mahon of Greenpeace. "Clayoquot's rainforests are of
global significance.  We will conitune to blockade them on the road
and make sure they do not get into these areas and we will ensure
that international customers of MacBlo know that it's business-as-
usual in Clayoquot Sound." 
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium on all logging in Clayoquot
Sound and demanding full protection for the intact rainforests of
Clayoquot Sound.

<P>
<B>THE SCIENTIFIC PANEL FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST PRACTICES 
IN CLAYOQUOT SOUND: ONE YEAR LATER</B>
 

<P>On July 6, 1995 the government of British Columbia adopted in its
entirety over 120 recommendations of the Scientific Panel for
Sustainable Forest Practices in Clayoquot Sound. The report
represented a significant shift in the way forestry is viewed in
B.C. Some of the key recommendations in the report were:
 

<P>1) a moratorium on all logging in the pristine areas until full
biological and cultural inventories of these areas are completed,
and until such time as logging methods are proven to have no
negative impact on biodiversity;
<P>2) the creation and implementation of ecosystem-based planning for
Clayoquot Sound;
<P>3) an end to conventional clearcutting in Clayoquot Sound;
<P>4) no logging in areas that have already been seriously overcut;
and
<P>5) base the level of cutting on watershed planning, rather than on
a pre-determined annual allowable cut. This was to ensure that the
focus is on what must remain in the forest to maintain biodiversity
rather than than a focus on extracting a set volume of wood.
 
<P>Now almost a year later and it has become clear that spirit and
intent of the Scientific Panel's recommendations have in many cases
been violated by both MacMillan Bloedel and International Forest
Products. 
 
<P><B>MacMillan Bloedel's Five Year Development Plan for Tranquil Creek </B>
 
<P>MacMillan Bloedel recently submitted for approval of a five-year
development plan for Tranquil Creek, an area of Clayoquot Sound
that has already been heavily logged. A critique of the plan by the
Sierra Legal Defense Fund reveals that in 43 separate occasions the
plan fails to meet the standards imposed by the Forest Practices
Code, demonstrating that the logging giant is light years away from
being able to meet the far more stringent Science Panel guidelines.
 
<P>In particular the plan fails to protect fish habitat and the
riparian zones around the streams. The government's Clayoquot Sound
Watershed Assessment clearly states that:
 
<P>"Because substantial portions of streams in Tranquil Creek
watershed have been impacted to some degree by forestry, including
90 per cent of all streams known to be fish-bearing, all streams
potentially affected by proposed future harvest blocks must receive
a high level of streamside protection".
 
<P>The Code's riparian zone standards are meant to protect fish
habitat from the impacts of logging by retaining a wider buffer
zone of trees next to streams, in particular fish-bearing streams.
MacBlo's proposed riparian zone protection fail to do so. In the
plan MacBlo misclassified streams, using the old Fish-Forestry
guidelines rather than the new Code.                              
 
<P>In addition, there is no terrain stability assessment, which is
mandated by both the Forest Practices Code and the Science Panel.
In many cases, road-building is planned to occur on slopes that are
in excess of a 70 per cent grade, with a significant number on
slopes of 80-100 per cent. All of these areas, if identified
correctly, would classify as Class 5 terrain which, according to
the Science Panel, would exclude them from logging activities.
 
<P><B>The plan also fails to fully identify cultural heritage sites.</B>
 
<P>MacMillan Bloedel has also neglected to include visual quality assessments,
assessments of factors which might damage forest health (such as
windthrow or infestations),road deactivation and maintenance plans,
and has likewise failed to identify how stand-level biodiversity
will be protected.
 

<P>The plan for this region of Clayoquot Sound is woefully inadequate
and suggests a serious lack of awareness by MacMillan Bloedel of
logging methods that would not irreparably harm the forest health
of Clayoquot Sound.
 
<P><B> Entry Into One of Clayoquot's Pristine Valleys</B>
 
<P>One of the Scientific Panel's key recommendations was that there
should be no entry into undeveloped watersheds in Clayoquot Sound,
until such time as full biological and cultural inventories of
these areas are completed, and until such time as logging methods
are proven to have no negative impact on biodiversity.
 
<P>The Science Panel defines an undeveloped watershed as "less than 2
per cent of the watershed has been modifed by industrial or land
use practices".
 
<P>According to the government's Clayoquot Sound Watershed Assessment,
the Bulson watershed is only 1.1 per cent impacted and therefore is
considered to be pristine. If the Science Panel's recommendations
were followed, a moratorium would be imposed on all logging in the
Bulson watershed. 
 
<P>Despite this knowledge, MacMillan Bloedel is now roading and
clearcutting in the Bulson watershed, with governmental approval.
This cutting is clearly in violation of the Scientific Panel.
 <B>
<P>International Forest Products Prosecution in Rolling Stone Creek
 </B>
<P>After over one year of complaints regarding Interfor's new Rolling
Stone Creek road building by the Friends of Clayoquot Sound the
Ministry of Forests, recently imposed a $10,000 fine on InterFor
for negligence. The road collapsed into some creeks in October
1995.                                                             
 
<P>The Watershed Assessment report stipulated that limited logging of
50 hectares could be allowed in Rollingstone, on the condition that
concurrent restoration begin in the lower impacted section of the
salmon-bearing stream. 90% of the salmon bearing reaches of Rolling
Stone Creek have already been impacted by logging.
 
<P>Interfor and MacMillan Bloedel have both failed to produce a
restoration plan for this area. Despite the violation in
Rollingstone, Interfor was given approval to log an adjacent
cutblock R50. Cutblock R40 currently awaits approval.

<p><b>MACMILLAN BLOEDEL VIOLATES RAINFOREST PROTECTION AGREEMENT</b></p>


<P><B>Activists Blockade Logging in B.C's Clayoquot Sound, Target U.S. Customers</B>


<P>TOFINO, BRITISH COLUBIA, JUNE 21st 1996.
 
<P>Activists from Greenpeace and the
Friends of Clayoquot Sound are in
the second day of a blockade of a logging operation in one of N. America's
largest contiguous rainforest areas.
Thirty-six activists have shut down the active logging roads and three
activists are chained to the log loader, which
is used to load the logs from the pristine valleys of British Columbia's
Clayoquot Sound. The blockade in B.C. was
mirrored by a mailing in the U.S. to the country's largest newspaper, magazine
and phone directory publishers,
urging them to sever their business ties to MacMillan Bloedel.
 

<P>The blockade occurred after discovering that MacMillan Bloedel was logging in a
pristine area of Clayoquot Sound -
 a clear violation of the recommendations made by top government-chosen
scientists. Almost one year ago, the
Science Panel for Sustainable Forest Practices in Clayoquot Sound made
stringent recommendations which
MacMillan Bloedel promised to abide by, a commitment MB used to assure their
international newsprint and phone
directory paper customers that they should keep buying from the Canadian
logging giant. The Science Panel was

formed after 850 people were arrested blockading MB's logging in Clayoquot in
the Summer of 1993 - the largest
act of civil disobedience in Canadian history.
 

<P>"The world has a right to know that Clayoquot Sound's rainforests are still
being destroyed. A year after the Science
Panel the pristine areas remain on the chopping block," said Karen Mahon of
Greenpeace. "The band-aid solutions
that have been tried in Clayoquot have not worked. We need to protect the
rainforest valleys before we lose them
forever."
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for full protection of all the remaining pristine
rainforest areas in Clayoquot Sound. Based
on this flagrant transgression, Greenpeace and its partners in the Clayoquot
Rainforest Coalition - Rainforest Action
Network, Natural Resources Defense Council and Pacific Environment & Resources
Center - have renewed their
efforts to shift the U.S. paper market away from clearcut ancient rainforest
products and towards ecologically sound
alternatives.
 
<P>"The ongoing destruction of Clayoquot Sound is an international scandal," said
Marc Evans, Greenpeace Forest
Campaigner. "B.C.'s industry and government have led the world to believe that
the controversy is solved. We will
ensure that major paper buyers in the U.S. and Europe are informed of the
continued threat to Clayoquot's
remaining pristine rainforests by MacMillan Bloedel." 

<P>Clayoquot Sound is 650,000 acres of coastal temperate rainforest, 20% of which
has been clearcut to date. It is the
traditional home of the Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations and contains redcedar
trees up to 1700 years old, as well as
wolves, bald eagles, Rosevelt elk, river otters, martens and salmon.

<P><B>Protest Highlights Ongoing Destruction of Temperate Rainforest </B>


<P>TOFINO, BRITISH COLUBIA, JUNE 20th 1996.

<P> Activists from Greenpeace and the
Friends of Clayoquot Sound blockaded a logging operation in
Clayoquot Sound today, using the Greenpeace vessel MV Moby Dick
and inflatable boats.


<P>"Canadians have a right to know that Clayoquot Sound's
rainforests are still being destroyed by Macmillan Bloedel and
Interfor.  It's been a year since the science panel was adopted
and the remaining pristine areas remain on the chopping block," 
said Greenpeace forests campaigner Karen Mahon.  "We will not sit
idly by and watch Clayoquot Sound  become the company's
experimental playground." 
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling for full protection of all the remaining
pristine rainforest areas in Clayoquot Sound.  MacMillan Bloedel
is currently logging in the Bulson watershed in Clayoquot Sound,
an area that that the government reports say is pristine.* 
According to the Science Panel no logging should occur in the
pristine areas.

<P>"Companies have slowed down logging down in Clayoquot Sound, but
they are still doing extreme damage as they creep silently into
pristine watersheds. The Bulson is pristine and MB cannot log in
it.  It's time to get our priorities straight and restore salmon
habitat instead of destroying it," said Valerie Langer from the
Friends of Clayoquot  believe that the
controversy is soling Stone Creek directly adjacent to
an area where they were recently found in violathe continued
threat to the remaining pristine rainforests of Clayoquot Sound."
said Greenpeace International campaigner Tzeporah Berman.

<P>*Note to Editors
The Ministry of Forests report by Alan Chapman lists the Bulson
watershed as only 1.1% impacted.  The Science Panel defines a
watershed as pristine if it is less than 2% impacted.  However,
the Ministry of Forests has decided to allow logging in the
Bulson basitrary political division
(not an ecological division)  to ensure that MacMillan Bloedel
can continue to log in this area

	GREENPEACE BLOCKADE OF NORWEGIAN WHALERS ENDS 
	AS LOCAL THUGS THREATEN VIOLENCE
</B>
  
<P>OSLO, FRIDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1996
                                    


<P>With the arrival of local Norwegian youth apparently called in by whalers to forcefully end Greenpeace's peaceful effort to prevent their leaving port for the whaling grounds today, Greenpeace agreed to end its protest after four hours.


<P>Some 15 local Norwegian youth arrived at the port of Kristiansand in Norway and physically tore down a Greenpeace banner being held by activists near the four whaling vessels they were blockading.  Protesters were physically shoved by the youth and one youth wielded a hook.  


<P>To ensure that their efforts remained non-violent, Greenpeace agreed to end its four-hour protest and leave the site. Inflatable vessels were taken out of the water and whalers disentangled their vessels from the floating blue net protesters used to tie them up.


<P>Three Greenpeace activists were arrested in all, including whale campaigner Urmi Musak of Germany, but all were released shortly after without charge.
 

<P>Earlier today, 40 Greenpeace activists from six nations (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, UK and Germany,) blockaded four Norwegian whaling vessels (Villduen, Seie, Senet and Seiebuen) to prevent them leaving port.  Activists secured themselves to the railings of one whaling ships and tied floating blue rope through three of the vessels.  Other activists remained in the water with buoys blocking their exit and held up a banner reading "NORWAY STOP WHALING."     


<P>"For four hours Greenpeace prevented Norwegian whaling ships from leaving port," said Greenpeace's Katrin Brubbak of Norway.  "With the International Whaling Commission meeting starting in less than 10 days, we call on those nations attending to force Norway to comply with the international ban on commercial whaling and end this slaughter once and for all."

<P><B>GREENPEACE TRIES TO BLOCK NORWEGIAN WHALING SHIPS 
	FROM LEAVING HARBOUR.</B>
  
<P>OSLO, FRIDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1996




<P>Greenpeace activists boarded and 
blocked Norwegian whaling ships in Kristiansand harbour today to non-
violently prevent them sailing to catch their quota of minke 
whales.
 

<P>Forty Greenpeace activists from six nations (Norway, Sweden, 
Finland, Denmark, UK and Germany,) in inflatables, in the water 
and on land are attempting to board and block Norwegian whaling 
vessels (Villduen, Seie, Senet and Seiebuen) to prevent them 
leaving for the whaling grounds.  Two activists are secured to 
the railings of one whaling ships, some activists have been 
aggressively removed and thrown into the water while trying to 
board.  Blue floating rope has been used by activists to ensnare 
three whaling vessels to keep them in port and swimmers with 
buoys are blocking their exit.


<P>Whalers on the vessels are using water hoses and force to try to 
prevent activists from getting on board.  Reports from the 
harbour say whalers have loaded harpoons on deck threatening to 
to fire them at Greenpeace inflatables in the water. 

<P>Two activists have been arrested.  Additional Greenpeace 
activists have placed a banner in front of two of the whaling 
vessels in port reading "NORWAY STOP WHALING."   

<P>Greenpeace efforts to try to stop Norway's whaling began after 
Norway announced it would raise its quota of minke whales killed 
this year by more than 50 percent -- from 232 last year to 425. 
 The Greenpeace protest took place 10 days before the start of 
this year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission 
(IWC) in Aberdeen, Scotland.

<P>Norway's quota of whales is based on a new estimate by
Norwegian scientists that there are 110,000-120,000 minke
whales in the North east Atlantic.  This is the sixth estimate
from Norwegian scientists in the last 14 months.  The IWC has
not accepted any of these estimates as valid and maintain this
population classified as "protected stock".

<P>In Norway, where national consumption is most often given as
the reason to continue hunting whales, 50-100 tonnes of whale
meat from last year's hunt is languishing in cold storage 
unpurchased.  Norwegian national radio reported this week that 
only 56 out of 202 whales caught so far this year have been 
sold.  

<P>Yesterday, the Norwegian raw fish sales organisation, 
Raafiskarlaget, agreed to subsidise the sales of whale meat and 
whale blubber. It will pay 500,000 Norwegian kronor (USD 76,000) 
toward the sales of meat and 300,000 kronor (USD 46,000) for 
whale blubber.  Wholesale buyers have refused to pay the 
official minimum price so the Raafiskarlaget has intervened to 
keep the industry functioning.

<P>Norwegian whalers have repeatedly said they want to increase the 
quota up to 1,800 whales a year.  Whalers are also asking for 
quotas on other species, mainly on fin whales.

<P>Norway and Japan are the only two nations still killing whales 
despite a moratorium on commercial whaling agreed by the IWC in 
1982.  Japan continues to hunt whales via a loophole which 
allows for the killing of whales as "scientific research" while 
Norway is openly hunting commercially.  
 
<P>In April this year, Japanese authorities seized six tonnes of 
whale meat, part of a larger effort to smuggle 60 tonnes (an 
estimated 30 whales or 15 percent of Norway's 1995 quota) into 
the country from Norway.

<P><B>   B.C. PACKERS AWARDED BLUE RIBBON 
                     AS TOP SALMON DESTROYER</B>
  
<P>VANCOUVER, THURSDAY, JUNE 13TH, 1996


<P><B> Greenpeace occupies corporate offices and calls for      
       50 per cent cut in corporate seine fleet</B>
 

<P>Greenpeace activists today
"pointed
the finger" at B.C. Packers, awarding Galen Weston's firm the
blue
ribbon for first place salmon destroyer.
 

<P>Volunteers from the environmental organization scaled the offices
of B.C. Packers in Steveston, to unfurl a blue ribbon banner
reading "#1 salmon destroyer". Greenpeace also held aloft a giant
hand to "point the finger" at the company's over-harvesting of
salmon stocks. Four activists occupied the offices and Greenpeace
demanded that B.C. Packers begin an immediate decommissioning of
50
per cent of their seine fleet. The seiners are the most powerful
boats in the fishing fleet and despite Fisheries Minister
Mifflin's
ineffective efforts to cut the number of vessels, there is still
far too much catching capacity to ensure a future for salmon in
B.C..
 
<P>"Canadians are quite familiar with the failings of our federal
fisheries department," said Catherine Stewart, Greenpeace
fisheries campaigner. "But it's time to name the powerbrokers
behind the fisheries minister's throne--the corporate harvesters
pushing the overfishing agenda."
 
<P>B.C. Packers, a subsidiary of food giant George Weston Ltd.,
owned by entrepreneur Galen Weston, is the marketer of "Clover
Leaf" brand salmon.  The company owns over 90 salmon seiners, the
most "efficient" harvesters in the salmon fishery, with nets
large
enough to encircle a 747 jumbo jet and capable of taking as much
as
20,000 salmon in a single set of the net.  
 
<P>A frightening number of B.C.'s salmon stocks are in a state of
crisis and can no longer withstand the tremendous fishing
pressure
of the corporate seine fleets. As Canada's Ambassador for the
Environment, The Honourable John Fraser said "The capacity of the
seine fleet in Johnstone Strait in 1994 was such that, in a 12-
hour
opening on August 20, an estimated one million Fraser River
sockeye
were caught." The entire Fraser River sockeye run in 1996 is
currently being forecast at 1.3 million.
 
<P>Greenpeace also released a report entitled "Fishy Business",
which
outlines the corporate profile of key industry players driving
the
destruction of fisheries in Canada. On the Pacific coast, B.C.
Packers and the Canadian Fishing Company (CanFisCo) are in first
and second place, respectively.
 
<P>CanFisCo is owned by B.C. entrepreneur Jimmy Pattison and holds
46
seine licenses.  The company fishes, processes and markets salmon
under the Gold Seal Label through Pattison's control of the Save-
On, Overwaitea and Buy-Low chains of supermarkets.
 
<P>"Corporations and businessmen like Galen Weston and Jimmy
Pattison have an ethical obligation to harvest salmon with an eye
to the future of the stocks. The survival of our fish is more
important than shareholder profit," said Stewart.  "It's time to
hold these companies up to public scrutiny.  Weston and Pattison
must be held accountable for their actions - the future of salmon
is not just up to DFO."
 
<P>Greenpeace recently called for a moratorium on almost all salmon
fishing in British Columbia's waters for the 1996 season and is
demanding a fundamental restructuring of the fishing fleet and
fisheries management.

<P><B>GREENPEACE WARDS OFF INDUSTRIAL FISHERS AS ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS
FALTER OVER NORTH SEA FISHERIES CRISIS</B>
  
<P>BERGEN, THURSDAY, JUNE 13th 1996



<P>Greenpeace vessel mv Sirius has
chased two Danish industrial fisheries vessels out of an
ecologically sensitive area near the Scottish coast, acting to
protect the North Sea from overfishing where environment
ministers have failed to act.
 
<P>Today, environment and fisheries officials meet in Bergen,
Norway, to decide on a draft declaration for an "emergency"
meeting on North Sea fish stocks.   However, environment
ministers have so far failed to challenge the fisheries ministers
on reducing fishing catches and protecting the marine
environment.  At last year's 4th International Conference on
Protection of the North Sea, environment ministers vowed to press
fisheries ministers to achieve a 16 point action plan to
safeguard fish stocks and marine life.  They have yet to meet
this commitment.
 
<P>"The environment ministers are failing across the board," said
Greenpeace's Chris Rose from the mv Sirius.  "They are
surrendering the fate of North Sea fisheries and the marine
environment to the nationalistic infighting of the fisheries
ministers, which is a recipe for disaster."
 
<P>Yesterday, the Sirius took the lead when its crew found and
chased away two industrial fishing vessels east of Scotland's
Firth of Forth.  Industrial fishing is virtually unregulated and
accounts for over half the weight of fish landed from the North
Sea.  The vessels found were searching for shoals of sandeels,
which are at the hub of the North Sea foodweb.  Once fished, the
sandeels are ground up into oil and meal for use in margarine and
cakes and animal feed.  Greenpeace has repeatedly asked the 
Danish industrial fishers and their representatives to stay out
of areas likely to be sensitive to industrial fishing. 
 
<P>A ban on industrial fishing in sensitive areas is one of the
first steps of an emergency recovery plan that must be adopted
by environment and fisheries if the North Sea fisheries crisis
is to turned around.
 
<P>"We are defending key wildlife areas from industrial, or
`hoover', fishing -it's time for ministers to act, otherwise the
North Sea Conference will be a waste of time," said MacGarvin. 

<P>At their meeting on Monday, EU fisheries ministers at the EU
Fisheries Council failed to reach agreement to cut herring quotas 
despite scientific advice for a 50% cut in 1996 and 1997.
Fisheries ministers also took no action on industrial fishing.

<P><B>NORWAY'S WHALE MEAT GLUT SHOWS NO NEED FOR HUNT: GREENPEACE.</B>
  
<P>OSLO, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 12TH, 1996


<P>Norwegian whalers are killing whales
at their highest rate in a decade.  But no one is buying the meat.

<P>Norway's national radio news reported on 10 June, that only 56 
out of 202 whales caught this year have been sold.  

<P>"This is no surprise," said Katrin Brubakk of Greenpeace Norway. 
"Norway's whalers could not sell all of last years catch and had
between 30 and 60 whales still in cold storage at the start of
this year's hunt.  Clearly where whale meat is concerned,
Norwegians are just not buying it." 
 
<P>Last year's catch was 218 minke whales; this year's quota was
sharply increased to 425.  Norway calls its whaling small scale
and traditional and has forbidden export of whale products since
this would make the hunt obviously commercial and increase
international opposition. 

<P>A meeting of the Norwegian government and the whaling industry was
held on 11 June to try and resolve the problem of the growing
whale meat mountain.

<P>Norwegian authorities have set a minimum price which wholesale
buyers must pay for whale meat but buyers are refusing to purchase
it saying that, due to the weak market they can't make a profit. 
Individuals close to the whaling industry are suggesting that 
either the minimum price be lowered or the government must subsidise
the industry to store unsold products.

<P>"The idea of further government aid for whaling is grotesque," 
said Brubakk.  "The government already pumps huge amounts of money
into public relations.  Why don't they just accept the obvious -
Norway has no need for the hunt and no need for whale products."

<P><B>GREENPEACE DEMANDS THAT FISH INDUSTRY STOPS TRADING NORTH SEA
HERRING AND FARMED SHRIMPS</B>
  
<P>BREMEN, TUESDAY, JUNE 4th 1996



<P>Greenpeace demands that fish traders and
processors take definite steps to stop the exploitation of the
oceans. At a press conference during the Fish Conference of the FAO
in Bremen, Greenpeace demanded that the industry no longer process
North Sea herring and no longer do trade in tropical shrimps from
Asian or South American farms.
 
<P>Herring fishing and shrimp farming are two of the most urgent
examples where the industry must behave responsibly. "Global trade
of fish products is increasing the exploitation of the seas", said
Stefan Flothmann, Greenpeace marine biologist. Greenpeace is calling
for a fisheries reform. In February, the environmental organisation
published the "Greenpeace Principles for Ecologically Responsible
Fisheries" and called for industry and trade to base fish product
buying on ecological criteria. 
 
<P>As far as North Sea herring is concerned, this means that fishing
must stop until stocks have recovered. In the past few weeks,
scientists have observed that herring stocks in the North Sea have
collapsed. Greenpeace is starting an aid fund to support small
coastal fisheries during a ban on herring fishing. 
 
<P>In addition, Greenpeace is calling on shrimp importers to stop
buying from shrimp farms that clearcut mangrove forests on South
American and Asian coasts. "Shrimp farming leads to salination and
contamination of drinking water", said Matthew Gianni, Greenpeace
International fisheries expert. "The local population must often be
relocated."
 
<P>In reaction to the "Greenpeace Principles for Ecologically
Responsible Fisheries", the Unilever food company, together with
WWF, initiated the "Marine Stewardship Council".  This council will
develop ecologically sound buying criteria. Greenpeace welcomes this
step but insists that protective measures begin immediately so that
the fish industry can prove its credibility.

<P><B>FISH OIL AND MEAL ASSOCIATION SET UP FIGHTING FUND TO OPPOSE 
GREENPEACE CAMPAIGN AGAINST INDUSTRIAL FISHING IN THE NORTH SEA </B>
  
<P>LONDON, THURSDAY, MAY 23rd 1996

<P>Stung by the withdrawal from the market
of  major customers such as Unilever,  the international fish oil
and  meal association is attempting to set up a  $US100,000
fighting  fund to combat a Greenpeace campaign to stop the
destructive  practise of industrial or hoover fishing in
sensitive areas of  the North Sea.
 
<P>The International Fishmeal and Oil Manufacturers Association, in 
a circular to members, states that the Greenpeace campaign 
against industrial fishing in sensitive marine areas was of  
"serious concern" and calls for minimum donations of $US2,000 
from each member to establish an "emergency fund starting at 
$US100,000".
 
<P>The circular says the fund would be administered by an 
international committee made up of representatives from Norway, 
Chile, Peru, USA, Iceland, Denmark, United Kingdom, Spain and 
South Africa. 
 
<P>Industrial fishing is virtually unregulated and takes over half 
the weight of all fish landed in the North Sea. Using ultra-fine 
nets industrial fishing fleets take sandeels and other small fish 
near the bottom of the marine food web. These fish are food for 
"table" fish (such as cod, haddock and whiting), sea birds and 
other marine wildlife.
 
<P>The exclusion of industrial fisheries from sensitive areas is one 
part of an emergency recovery plan needed for the overfished 
North Sea.  For industrial fisheries, Greenpeace also believes 
any catch limits outside sensitive areas should be set using the 
precautionary approach and bycatch of other species should be cut 
drastically.  
 
<P>The Greenpeace ship,  Sirius, is currently patrolling  sensitive 
marine areas off the east coast of Scotland near Edinburgh which 
are feeding grounds for birds, seals, dolphins and fish.  
Greenpeace has also written to North Sea fisheries and 
environment ministers asking for an urgent response on what they 
will do to stop industrial fishing in such sensitive areas of the 
North Sea. 

<P>Stefan Flothmann, Greenpeace campaigner on the MV Sirius said: 
"This is a last ditch attempt to defend an ecologically 
destructive industry which should not be allowed to continue to 
operate in  sensitive areas of  the North Sea such as feeding and 
nursery grounds." 
 
<P>It's now clear that  industrial fishers are ignoring the calls 
for them to leave these sensitive areas.  We are now urging 
governments to act quickly to stop this destructive fishing 
practice."

_____________________________________________________________  
Dear Sirs
 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL - GREENPEACE TO ATTACK FISH MEAL AND OIL 
INDUSTRY 
 
On the 25th April the Governing Body of IFOMA considered the 
unofficial but usually reliable reports from a number of European 
sources that Greenpeace are about to launch an attack on the fish 
meal and oil industry.  This attack has now commenced in the UK 
with peak time TV news coverage on 13th May together with a great 
deal of press publicity.  Greenpeace is targetting the consumers 
of fish oil.
 
These actions are of serious concern to the Governing Body and 
the commercial actions of Unilever in announcing its intention
to  cease purchasing fish oils derived from North Sea fish and
to  review its continued use of other types of fish oil were
noted.  (See Unilever News Release attached) and United Biscuits,
the  largest biscuit manufacturers in Europe, to announce a stop
in  using fish oil (see press statement).
 
Press calls for supermarkets to follow Unilever's lead has 
already resulted in one of the UK's largest supermarkets 
(Sainsbury's) announcing the phasing out of fish oil from all 
their food products (see press statement attached).
 
The Governing Body therefore called upon all fish meal/oil 
producers and the related trade to set up an emergency fund 
starting at US$100,000 to fight against this attack.
 
The fund would be administered by IFOMA but be held in a separate 
bank account and would only be used to fight this campaign.  The 
fund would be used to fight campaigns in any part of the world 
where it was felt to be necessary.

The fund and campaign would be administered by an international 
committee made up of:
 
[note some partly illegible]
 
Mr Snorre Tilarth  (Norway) - Chairman
Dr Stuart Barlow (IFOMA) Secretary
Mr Rodrigo Sarquil (Chile)
Mr Sjeng Hoefsloot (Peru)
Mr Barny White (USA)
Mr Jon Magnusson (Ireland)
Mr Jannik Schougaard (Denmark)
Mr Helgo Korsager (UK)
Mr Alvaro Vigirez (Spain)
Mr Steve Malherbe (South Africa)
 
The Governing body of IFOMA is inviting all Associate Members to 
contribute a minimum of US$500 for each company.  In addition it 
has invited all Members of IFOMA to donate a minimum of US$2,000.


In the event that the campaign fund is not fully utilised the 
remaining funds will be redistributed to the contributors pro-
rata to their contribution.
 
IFOMA has prepared the first in a series of defence documents 
describing the present practices of industrial fishing in the 
world.
 
Please complete the attached questionaire

<P><B>NORWAY TO BUILD WHALE MEAT MOUNTAIN </B>
  
<P>MONDAY, MAY 20, 1996

<P>Norway's whalers went to sea today to hunt for 425 minke whales - 
  nearly double last year's catch of 218. 
 
<P>"This is absurd," said Katrin Brubakk, Greenpeace Norway's whale  
campaigner. "What do they intend to do with 425 whales? They  
could not sell all the meat from last year's catch and had to  
freeze 50 tons. Do they plan to build a mountain of whale meat?" 
 
<P>The Norwegian government claims that hunt is small scale  and 
traditional and its purpose is to sustain communities in the  
sparsely populated north of the country. Export of whale meat,  
which would demonstrate the commercial nature of the hunt, is  
forbidden. 
 
<P>"By doubling the quota the government is encouraging whale meat  
smuggling," said Brubakk. "This is a charter for smugglers. 
 
<P>An April 1996 seizure of 6 tons of smuggled Norwegian whale meat  
in Japan led to the uncovering of a conspiracy to smuggle 60 tons  
to Japan, equivalent to 30 whales, almost 15% of the 1995 catch.  
There have been two seizures in the last three years of whale  
meat smuggled from Norway - in both cases the contraband had  
cleared Norwegian customs without difficulty. 
 
<P>"Not only are they catching far more than they can consume, but  
there is no scientific basis for the quota," said Brubakk. "Over  
the last 13 months Norwegian government sources have used six  
different figures for the population and not one of them has been  
agreed by the International Whaling Commission. The IWC has said  
that they have no agreed estimate for this whale population an 
so  there is no basis for calculating any quota. The Norwegian  
government is ignoring the normal rules for international  
cooperation because its own interests are at stake." 
 
<P>Norwegian whalers, who have disproportionate clout in Norwegian  
politics since the thinly populated north of Norway needs fewer  
voters to elect an MP, have been vociferous in demanding increase  
quotas and weakening of IWC regulations. When Norway resumed  
whaling in 1992, the Norwegian press attributed the decision to  
polls showing that the government was losing ground in the north. 
 
 
<P>"The Norwegian government is putting national politics ahead of  
protecting the environment," concluded Brubakk. "Mrs Brundtland  
should be ashamed."

<P><B> GREENPEACE FINDS INDUSTRIAL FISHERS OFF SCOTLAND</B>
  
<P>FRIDAY, MAY 17, 1996-

<P>Greenpeace vessel MV Sirius has found
industrial fishing boats off the Scottish North Sea coast.  
 
<P>The eight Danish vessels were found fishing east of Aberdeen
inside an area that Greenpeace believes is ecologically sensitive
to industrial fishing.  In a meeting in Copenhagen last week,
Greenpeace asked representatives of the Danish industrial fishing
industry to voluntarily stay out of these areas ahead of
government regulation.
 
<P>The MV Sirius crew contacted the boats this morning and delivered
a leaflet explaining the Greenpeace demands with a map of these
sensitive areas.
 
<P>Greenpeace also today wrote to North Sea fisheries and
environment ministers asking for an urgent response on what they
will do to stop industrial fishing in those sensitive areas.
 
<P>Industrial fishing is virtually unregulated and takes over half
the weight of all fish landed in the North Sea. Using ultra-fine
nets industrial fishing fleets take sandeels and other small fish
near the bottom of the marine food web. These fish are food for

<P><B> BISCUIT GIANT CRUMBLES BEFORE PUFFIN PROTEST</B>
  
<P>13th May 1996

 
<P>Following a Greenpeace protest today United Biscuit has agreed “to cease the use of fish oil 
from non-sustainable industrial fishing in European waters within one year”. This 
announcement came after 150 Greenpeace activists dressed as puffins, with a 40 foot lorry, 
blocked the entrance of McVitie’s biscuit factory in Harlesden, West London this morning.

<P>The decision was greeted by cheering from the Greenpeace “puffin” protesters, and the 
organisation called on other users of fish oil, including Tescos, Heinz, Co-op, Iceland, Spar 
Asda and Safeway, to follow suit immediately.   The companies have been approached by 
Greenpeace and the Co-op has already agreed to stop using the oil.

<P>McVitie’s currently use around 6,000 tonnes of fish oil in their biscuits each year, some of 
which comes from the North Sea.  

<P>John Sauven of Greenpeace said, “United Biscuit’s swift decision must be congratulated. It’s 
great news. United Biscuit’s, Unilever and Sainsburys now all recognise the folly of using 
unsustainable industrial fish oil.”

<P>Each year,  8 billion sandeels are taken from the North Sea by industrial fishing.  This 
particularly destructive form of fishing threatens the puffins’ food supply. Sandeels are also a 
food source for “table” fish such as cod and haddock whose numbers are already perilously 
low, as well as seals, porpoises and whales.  Using fish oil in products like biscuits could 
threaten the North Sea marine eco-system.

<P>Today’s event marks the start of Greenpeace’s campaign against industrial fishing for sandeels 
in the Wee Bankie (off the East Coast of Scotland) and other sensitive areas in the North Sea. 
The Greenpeace ship MV Sirius is currently in the Firth of Forth, ready to take part in this 
campaign.

<P><B>GREENPEACE DEMANDS GOVERNMENT ACTION ON INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES</B>
  
<P>DUNBAR, Scotland, May 7, 1996 -
<P>Greenpeace today called for an 
end to  industrial "hoover" fishing in ecologically sensitive 
areas as part of an emergency recovery plan for the overfished 
North Sea.
 
<P>In a letter sent to North Sea governments, Greenpeace has called 
for urgent regulation to stop industrial fisheries in sensitive 
areas of the North Sea including fish spawning and nursery 
grounds and important bird feeding grounds. Any catch limits 
outside sensitive areas should be set using the precautionary 
approach and bycatch of other species should be cut drastically. 
 
<P>Greenpeace released a map, showing areas in the North Sea that 
should be immediately closed to all industrial fisheries until 
governments present a more comprehensive assessment of sensitive 
areas. Greenpeace believes that these areas are likely to be 
included as areas identified as senstitive by North Sea 
Governments.
 
<P>The Greenpeace vessel MV Sirius is currently stationed in 
Scotland's Firth of Forth -- a crucial feeding ground for 
seabirds, fish and marine mammals. The Firth of Forth is the 
site of one of the biggest sandeel fisheries, where Danish and 
Scottish industrial fishing boats are due to start fishing for 
sandeels within the next few weeks. 
 
<P>Tomorrow, at a meeting called by the Danish fishmeal industry, 
Greenpeace will ask Danish industrial fishers to voluntarily 
stay out of sensitive areas until governments have implemented 
formal regulations for the fishery that adequately protect the 
North Sea.  
 
<P>Industrial fishing at present is virtually unregulated and takes 
over half the weight of all fish landed in the North Sea. Using 
ultra-fine nets industrial fishing fleets take sandeels and 
other small fish near the bottom of the marine food web. These 
fish are food for "table" fish (such as cod, haddock and 
whiting), sea birds and other marine wildlife.  
Fish oil is used to make food products such as cakes, biscuits 
and margarine.  Fish meal is fed to poultry, pigs and farmed 
fish.
 
<P>Chris Rose of Greenpeace said: "Industrial fishing in areas like 
the Firth of Forth threatens marine wildlife and further 
contributes to the crisis of overfishing in the North Sea.  Time 
and again industrial fishing has led to the collapse of fish 
stocks. We cannot allow this to happen in the North Sea.   
Governments must call an immediate halt to this particularly 
destructive practice in sensitive areas of the North Sea."  

<BR><BR><HR>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
<BR> CHRIS ROSE 00873 1300144 or 0402 605187, 
<BR>STEFAN FLOTHMANN 01368 865 982 
<BR><HR><BR>
<P><B>Letter to government ministers demanding immediate action</B>
 
<P>Dear Minister,
 
<P>We wrote to you recently regarding Greenpeace's extreme concern 
at the state of North Sea fisheries. One of the issues 
identified in that letter was that of industrial
fisheries.
 
<P>While the UK Government brought up this issue at the recent 
Fisheries Council Meeting, little progress was made. This issue 
is extremely urgent, not least because one aspect of industrial 
fisheries that gives us great concern -the targeting
of coastal areas for sandeel - is due to resume in the next few 
weeks.  
<P>We are therefore asking you to take urgent action to protect 
sensitive areas from
industrial fishing.
 
<P>Specifically, we are calling on you to:
 
<P>1) initiate a process for the general regulation of North Sea 
industrial fisheries,
based on the precautionary principle, to be implemented in time 
for the 1997 season.  Greenpeace would expect this to include 
both general regulation and limitation of catches, a reduction 
of by-catch to levels approaching zero and the
establishment of special measures for critical (or sensitive) 
areas.  
<P>We ask that you and your colleagues secure immediate agreement 
in principle to such measures. This will allow significant 
progress to have been made in addressing the practical 
requirements in time for the June 10 EU Fisheries Council,
and the June 13/4 preparatory meeting for the 1997 Inter 
Ministerial (Fisheries) Meeting on the North Sea.
 
<P>2) as an emergency measure, to declare provisional critical 
areas from which unregulated industrial fishing will be excluded 
forthwith.  
In the attached annex we set out what we believe to be relevant 
criteria when establishing critical areas, and a map indicating 
those areas of the North Sea that
we believe would be likely to be defined as critical areas using 
such criteria.  
<P>Governments have the ultimate responsibility to act decisively. 
However it is imperative that action is now taken to protect 
these sites in the short term, and
that all parties do everything in their power to facilitate this 
process.   
<P>In pursuit of protection of marine life in these sensitive 
areas, and the ultimate
well-being of the fishing industry, we are presently stationed 
in the Firth of Forth.
<P>We will be asking industrial fishers to cease operations in such 
areas until governments have established a formal (and 
convincing) regulatory mechanism.  
<P>We ask you to lend the support of your Government to this 
initiative, as part of your response to the wider North Sea 
fisheries issues outlined in our letter of [whenever national 
letter sent].
 
<P>Yours etc.,
<BR>

protest against the launch of the massive supertrawler,
American Monarch, at Langsten shipyard in Tomrefjord, Norway.
High-speed inflatables with sirens rushed into the fjord, and
activists displayed a giant banner with the words "American
Monster - Plunderer of the Seas"on the dry dock. 

<p>The ship, registered for the American Seafood Company and
owned by Norwegian based Resource Group International (RGI) is
destined to fish in already overexploited waters off the
Chilean coast. 

<p>&nbsp<img align=left border=0 width=20 height=20 src="../icons/bioact.gif"><br>Almost 100 metres long with state-of-the-art
fish finding technology, the US$ 56 million American Monarch
is capable of fishing and processing more fish each day than
any other vessel in the world.

<p>"This
vessel is a monster capable of putting the last nail in the
coffin for Chile's southern fisheries," said Greenpeace
campaigner Harald Saevareid.  "With seventy per cent of world
fish stocks either exploited or depleted, nations with long
distance fleets increasingly exploit southern ocean
fishstocks, usually at huge expense of the marine environment
and the local people. The American Monarchs of the world
belong to history."

<p>Of the 3.5 million fishing vessels on the world's oceans, only
38,000 are classed as "large scale".  This one per cent of the
fleet account for over half of the total capacity of the
global fleet, as measured by gross registered tonnes.

(Patagonian grenadier) from Chile's waters has already
prompted major protests by local smaller scale fishermen and
coastal communities supported by Greenpeace Chile. Very little
if any of the American Monarch's catch will reach Chilean
dinner tables. Most of the catch will be sold as surimi on the
lucrative Japanese market or as fish meal in northern
countries.

 <br>Today -- World Food Day -- Greenpeace offices in Europe are organizing
protests at Unilever's
     headquarters in the UK and Germany and at their Swedish head
     office. Unilever is a major user of soya which is found in about
     60 per cent of all processed foods, from bread to chocolate.

<p> "What we are seeing is just the beginning of retailers and
     consumers saying no," said Greenpeace campaigner Michelle
     Sheather. "Food processors thought they could slip this in to our
     food without telling us -- but this is a huge experiment with
     food and nature and people don't want it." 
<P>&nbsp<img align=left border=0 width=20 height=20 src="../icons/bioact.gif">
 <br>In addition to health fears, Greenpeace is concerned about the effects
on the environment of the release of
     genetically engineered crops. "This will be the first time
     genetically engineered ingredients have appeared in wide range of
     everyday supermarket products," said Ms Sheather, "and if the
     food multinationals have their way millions of tons of engineered
     crops will be grown in the environment".

     just another short-term dangerous attempt to provide a quick fix.
     It does not address the real problems of world famine."

 <br>More than 30 GP activists travelled to the remote area of Atlantic, Iowa,
and successfully "quarantined" a field of Monsanto's
"Roundup Ready Soybeans." Using non-toxic, milk and flour based paint, the
activists worked all night to paint huge slogans on the three acre field to be visable from the air: an enormous, 100-foot high "X" spoofing television's "The X-files" theme, and the
message: "Biohazard! Monsanto."

<br clear=all>A similar message was printed on a banner

the farm's harvesting equipment for the duration of the action so the field
could not be harvested.

     X-fields, said Greenpeace Campaigner Beth Fitzgerald from the site of the genetic invasion. 

 <P>Despite protests from European consumer groups, food manufacturers, retailers and even
     farmers themselves, the genetically engineered soya is now being harvested and mixed with
     normal soya ready for export to Europe. Soya is used in about 60 per cent of processed
     foods, from bread and cakes to chocolate and margarine. 

 <P>The "Roundup Ready Soybean" developed by the US firm Monsanto -- also responsible for
     their production of Agent Orange used in Vietnam -- has been genetically engineered to be
     resistant to Monsanto's own "Roundup" herbicide. The soybean contains genes from a virus
     and a bacteria. 

<P><img align=left border=0 width=20 height=20 src="../icons/bioact.gif">&nbsp
     In a separate action, activists from Greenpeace Germany dressed as laboratory rabbits today
     also protested outside the headquarters of the food giant Unilever, calling on them to use their
     consumer power to demand non-genetically engineered soya.

<blockquote>
<p>"After hosing off Greenpeace activists yesterday with a with a strong spray from
their barge's fire hose and cutting off a Greenpeace activist who was chained
to the barge's ladder by using a gas-powered grinder, MacMillan Bloedel's
employees aboard the world's largest log barge were forced to retreat into an
inlet of the Queen Charlotte islands after being confronted by Haida natives.
<p>The barge remains anchored today after a day-long blockade by Haida traditional
war canoes and fishing boats.  MacMillan Bloedel, the largest logging firm in
Canada, remains unable to transport the clearcut temperate rainforest logs to
southern British Columbia for processing and export to the U.S. 
 
<p>Haida activists currently maintain a vigil on the beach, waiting to see if
MacBlo's barge will weigh anchor and attempt to sail  to Vancouver with its
load of old-growth cedar, hemlock and spruce logs. The Haida activists are
protesting the logging giant's destruction of temperate rainforest on their
islands, calling for a massive reduction in the amount of timber harvested and
an overhaul in the way the timber concessions are granted by the government.
 
<p>"The B.C. government and multinational corporations have decimated the majority
of the old-growth rainforest of Haida Gwaii", said Ralph Stocker, Haida

activist. "The Haida culture is based on and in the forests: without it, we go
extinct. We must protect the remaining old-growth rainforests".

<p>Late yesterday, eight Haida paddled a cedar war canoe into Masset Inlet in
front of the village of Old Masset on Haida Gwaii.  The First Nation activists
brought the barge to a standstill after it had escaped from the Greenpeace
Zodiac inflatables as the the Greenpeace crew members collected their
colleagues who had been roughly deposited in the frigid northern waters by
MacMillan Bloedel's employees. Three Greenpeace activists had boarded the barge
Thursday morning, disrupting the loading of logs by chaining themselves to the
barge's ladders and bowline before being hosed off. 
 
<p>Greenpeace is calling for a full moratorium on industrial activity in the
remaining intact areas of temperate rainforest in Canada. Half of everything
logged in British Columbia is exported to the U.S.

The call went out. Ten days later there were 21 people ready to give up two days to attend a briefing and an action. During the briefing the 'Puffin' costume was unvieled this caused much hilarity amongst the volunteers. Our team was asked to climb on top of the trailer section of the 'McFishies' truck, unvieling it as we clambered aboard.

On the day of the event, we arrived to find the truck in place.  A quick sprint across the road, the ropes were pulled and the tarpaulin covering came off.  The team went up the ladder like gymnasts, despite the age of some team members, the combined ages of two came to more than 140.</td>

Seated along the edge of the container we watched the delivery trucks came and go, drivers realising that for today at least there would be no deliveries.  Word was passed that McVities were considering their position, not surprising with 150 Puffins and a truck blocking their plant.</td>

Finally Greenpeace UK campaigner John Sauven emerged from his meeting with McVities executives, "They've given into our request" he said, and the 'birds' went wild.  We went home tired but elated.  Another major step toward protecting our seas against commercial over-fishing had been taken.</td>

<h1>SOLOMON ISLANDS MURDER AND CORRUPTION: LOGGING TAKES ITS TOLL

</h1>


<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Conflict over natural resources in the Pacific region is escalating.  Landowners are fighting for their rights and their
future against corrupt governments and destructive companies. 
The seven year old Bougainville armed conflict is a result of
landowner discontent and environmental destruction.  In Melanesia, the "logging fields" are the latest arena where these
bitter conflicts are being fought.  Community tension over government supported logging of disputed
lands on Pavuvu Island has lead to one murder, one suspicious
death, and escalating violence.  Maving Brothers Ltd, a Malaysian
company, have logged half the remaining forest already, and are
planning to move in on the rest.

<p><center><a href="log7.gif">Gif <img src="log7t.gif" width=72 height=72></a> <a href="log7.jpg"> Jpeg</a></center>
<p> The indigenous landowners are
fighting to regain control of their lands and establish small scale village based "Ecoforestry". A recent report released to the Solomon Is media has documented
US$2.2 million worth of bribes from one logging company to
Cabinet Ministers and government workers.  In response, a public
rally and petition by Churches, Unions and Non¸governmental
Organisations has called for the sacking of the Ministers
concerned.  On 4th December seven Solomon Island Government
Ministers appeared in the Central Magistrates Court in Honiara
on corruption charges.
<p>In Solomon Islands logging continues at three times the estimated
sustainable level, with production forests predicted to be logged
within the next ten years.  Logging practices by the mainly
Malaysian and South Korean companies are uncontrolled and
destructive, and supply the Japanese and Korean log market.  With
more than 60% of government revenue derived from log export
levies, forest depletion means a looming disaster for the
economy.

<H3>The Amazon Rainforest</H3>

 The  Amazon rainforest extends for 4 million  SqKm,  and 
is  home  to  hundreds  of thousands of  animal  and  plant 
species.  Although it  covers only  3.5% of the overall
Earth's surface  -  it is home to around 50% of the world's
living species (estimates  range from 2 to 30 million
species), many of which are still  unknown  to humans.   It has
been estimated that  a  hectare  of  forests  in Eastern
Amazon can  contain  up  to  120  species  of trees.

<P>The Amazon is also home to some 250,000 indigenous
peoples in 510 areas, many of them fighting for rights to
land that they and their ancestors have lived on for
centuries.  In the last decade many thousands of indigenous
peoples have been forced off their lands as more and more of
the forest is taken over for cattle ranching, the expansion of
cash crops, mining and logging.  This development that is
destroying the forests and threatening indigenous cultures is
often made possible through government subsidies for
colonization of uninhabited forest land given to big companies
and in some areas to landless workers that were evicted from
other regions of Brazil.   In the last decade as much as 12%
of the original forest cover of the Amazon has been destroyed.

  <P>   Mahogany  logging  can  be singled out as one  of  the 
main  catalysts  for  deforestation  and  forest  degradation 
in   the  Brazilian Amazon. Most of this logging occurs inside
Indian lands or protected areas,  and  extractive reserve,
with no control  by  the  authorities.   According  to  an 
ITTO/FUNATURA study  published in 1993, the  majority  of the 
mahogany  exploited (from 53 different areas of Indian land)
is illegal.  
  
     Mahogany logging in the Amazon has been so intensive that
now trucks  have to travel hundreds of kilometers to reach 
the  last  mahogany  stands. By bulldozing long roads to log,
access is provided into the   previously inaccessible virgin
forest lands for cattle  ranchers,  speculators  and  landless
farmers, who slash and burn the forest in the  quest for
survival. As many as 3000 kms of roads  have  been  opened in
the State of Para only, in order to  log mahogany.

<img vspace=10 hspace=20 align=left lowsrc="../thumbs/for72t.gif" src="../pics/for72s.gif" width=115 height=175 border=0></a>


 <P>    Companies,  such  as Peracchi,. Maginco, Bannach  have 
been  repeatedly accused  of corruption and misbehavior, and
the first were found guilty of illegally logging in indian
lands  by  a  Federal judge in 1993.  Yet the logging
continues.

<P>Mahogany from the Amazon and seeral other timber species are
exported to furnish  the  sitting  rooms  or  toilets  of 
British,  Spanish or US  families.  Mahogany  export  volumes
in 1971-1990 have been assessed to amount to 1.5  million 
cubic  meters of sawntimber. In order to produce this amount, 
as  many as sawn =  600,000 trees would have to be felled. 

 <P>    According  to  Brazilian press, losses  caused   by 
illegal  logging and illegal  timber  trade in  Brazil  have
been assessed  to be around USD 1.2 billion  a year,  with
losses due to illegal  trade  of  mahogany in Para amounting
to  USD 2 million  a  year.  Most  of  it is due to tax
frauds. In Para only, in four   Fiscal   regions,  the
percentage of tax frauds equaled between 91-99  per  cent in 
1993.  

  <P>   Mahogany  logging is a very destructive practice: 
Brazilian  scientists have assessed that  the predatory
logging of a  single  mahogany tree causes  -  in  average -an
opening in the   canopy  equal to 356m2, that - summed  up  to
the openings for roads  and  others infrastructures - will 
lead to the figure of 1,450 m2  of  forest  per  each tree.
For each mahogany tree felled,  28  other  trees with a dbh 10
cm are damaged and regeneration is scarce.

</p>
<br>
<B>The executive director of Greenpeace
Brazil, Roberto Kishinami, sent today a letter to the Brazilian
President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, saluting his decision of
signing a decree determining a two year moratorium in the Mahogany
(Swietneia macrophyla King.) and Virola (virola surinamensis Warb)
logging in Amazonia. 
These species are the most valuable timbers
exported by Brazil. 
<P>In the same letter, Kishinami observes that now
it is crucial to identify and label the existing stocks already
cut, and to make an inventory of the areas of occurrence of these
timbers, in order to guarantee the success of the presidential act.
"Is very important the involvement of civil society in the
controlling process", said Kishinami.
<P>Greenpeace has been campaigning this issue for the last four years
- using direct actions and political pressure with the help of
other NGOs. <P>The moratorium is the most important victory in GP
Brazil short history.

<P>The only exception in the decree is the timber from plantations -
which doesn't exist, in the case of mahogany. The Ministry of
Environment and Legal Amazonia, and the Brazilian Institute for
Environment and Natural Resources (IBAMA) have 60 days to identify
and cancel all concessions of irregular logging companies. 

<P>This means: 
<BR>1) the Government will not give any new license to
explore Mahogany and Virola in the next two years; and 
<BR>2) the
companies operating now will be submitted to audit - and the one
with irregularities will have their licenses canceled. The official
expectation is that 60% to 70% of the actual licenses will be
canceled.

<P>In another decision (a provisory act, which gets immediately
into force but must be further approved by Brazilian Parliament)
the President legally ban the increase of deforestation in
agricultural areas in the whole "Legal Amazon" - which include
the states of Amazon, Acre, Para, Roraima, Rondonia, Amapa and
Mato Grosso, and the northern regions of Tocantins, Goias and
Maranhao states. The act limit to 20% the area freed for
agriculture in forest regions, against the limit of 50% to date.

According to IBAMA, US$ 6 million will be spent in the controlling
program, using 650 agents, 120 vehicles, 30 boats and 300 flight
hours. 

<P>The presidential decisions were personally communicated to
Greenpeace by the president of IBAMA, Eduardo Martins. Ibama is
the federal agency for the environment. "This is a Greenpeace
victory", said Mr. Martins during his phone call, asking for GP
support to convince the Parliament to approve the provisional
act. 

"We expect an important reaction from logger's lobby, deputies and
senators from Northern States", said Roberto Kishinami. "To face
this upfront and guarantee the approval governmental decisions,
Greenpeace Brazil is organizing a meeting with NGOs to set up a
common strategy." 

<P>"Both decisions - the decree and the provisory act - mean a very
important contribution to our fight to preserve the Amazonian
biodiversity", said Kishinami. "And can contribute to reduce
increasing deforestation in the region, which grew
from 11,130 square kilometers/year (in 1991) up to 14,896 sq
km/year (in 1994). These figures were announced yesterday by INPE
(National Institute of Space Research). The INPE monitors
Amazonian using data from the Landsat satellite. According to the
Government, the area affected by deforestation in the Amazonian
region was 470,000 square kilometers.

<P>"These numbers show that the authorities failed in controlling the
destruction", said Kishinami.

<B><H2>The Greenpeace Campaign</H2>

   <P>  Greenpeace  Brazil has been working with  local 
communities  and  indigenous peoples to stop the plunder of 
the  Amazon  rainforest,  by targeting the mahogany industry. 

<P>As a result of Greenpeace~s work and the coordinated effort
with other environmental groups, several logging  companies 
have  been forced to  stop their  operations in the Indian
lands of the State of Para. In addition the state  Association
of Timber Exporters was forced to sign an  agreement  not to
log in Indian lands anymore.  But  the fight goes on.


<P>Greenpeace Brazil forests campaign has been pursuing the following
goals:

<UL>
<LI> implement  a moratorium on mahogany logging to  push  for 
the  ecological reform of the broader timber sector;
<LI> reduce the consumption of mahogany in the main consumer
countries  (the  US,  the UK, Spain) as well as in  the 
Brazilian  domestic  market;
<LI>help  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity   of  
the  governmental  agencies, such as IBAMA, to  increase 
transparency  and  enforce  legal controls on mahogany
logging,  marketing  and  exports
<LI>include mahogany in Appendix II of CITES at the next
Conference  of the Parties in July 1997; -  assist and support
local communities in the identification  of  environmentally 
and  socially sound alternative  use  of  forest  resources.

<a name="relationship"><P><H3>INTRODUCTION: THE NEED FOR A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH FORESTS </H3></a> 

<P>Humanity depends for its survival on the healthy functioning of
the planet's natural ecosystems, including forests.  Forests are
home to the vast majority of the earth's rich evolutionary
heritage of species.  In conserving this heritage, Greenpeace
seeks ways to value all living beings without devaluing humans.  

<P>Forests provide many essential services such as regulating climate
and cycling nutrients and water.  They are sources of food, fibre,
fuel, medicines, and building materials which underpin the human
economy, and of cultural and spiritual values which give meaning
to human societies.  

<P>Forests sustain us, but we are not sustaining them.   Escalating
predatory human use of forests over the centuries has reduced,
 
degraded, destroyed and even completely eliminated forest
ecosystems.  Hundreds of thousands of forest-dependent species
face extinction in the next few decades from destructive forest
use.

<P>Today many of the threats to forests come from industrialised
societies.  This is due to the large-scale and intensity of forest
exploitation practices, and to wasteful and irresponsible
consumption of forest products.  

<P>Greenpeace believes that industrial societies must redefine their
relationships with forest ecosystems.  Rather than the historical
predatory relationships towards forests, Greenpeace calls for
adjustments to both production practices and consumption patterns
such that they do not threaten the biological diversity and
sustainability of forest ecosystems.

<P>To further this goal, Greenpeace advocates that management of
forest ecosystems be based on the study and application of the
ecological properties of natural forests.  In doing this,
Greenpeace believes forest management must mimic natural processes
and maintain ecosystem integrity.  Nature should take the lead
role in determining how to manage forests. 

 
<P>At present, human knowledge about the ecological properties and
species composition of natural forests is profoundly limited.
Extensive protected areas are necessary as a precaution against
inadvertent and irreversible damage from forest use.  Only then
can the full diversity of forest structures, functions and
dynamics be protected and maintained. 

<P>Precedents for respectful human relationships with forests do
exist among many indigenous peoples.  Upholding their rights,
respecting their cultures and incorporating their ecological
wisdom into forest management planning will be an essential and
necessary step towards the goal of establishing a respectful
relationship between industrial societies and forests. 


<a name="morethan"><H3>A FOREST IS MORE THAN JUST TREES</H3></a>

<P>Forests are diverse communities of species forming a complex web
of life.  Together they sustain the whole, not the production of
any one part or commodity.  The web of mutual dependencies in
forests exists at all scales, from the microscopic to the global. 

<P>Trees, the most obvious part of a forest, are critical structural
members of a forest framework.  However, living trees are only a
small part of the structure needed for a fully functioning forest. 
Forests are dynamic systems, with steady transitions between
various living and non-living parts.
 

 
<a name="purpose"><H3>THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT</H3>

<P>Worldwide, the public knows that forests are under attack and that
the harvesting practices widely used by logging industries are
intolerably destructive.  Furthermore, the environmental and human
rights movements have shown that the destruction of temperate and
tropical forests is often stimulated by consumer demand in distant
markets, particularly in industrialised countries. 

<P>Many individuals, corporations and governments now acknowledge
their responsibility as consumers in causing forest destruction. 
Some are taking steps to change their consumption patterns for the
better.   This new consumer ethic is progressively altering the
international marketplace for forest products.  

<P>Greenpeace believes that consumers have an obligation to lessen
their impacts on forest ecosystems through strengthening markets
for ecologically sound forest products, and by reducing, reusing
and recycling the forest products they use.  

<P>Inevitably, more and more forestry industry companies are laying
claim to sustainable forest practices.  These are based on many
different, often conflicting, and typically inadequate standards. 
They provide little information or confidence to either consumers,
or the groups challenging destructive forestry operations.  

<P>Greenpeace is involved in efforts to develop international
criteria for respectful forest use.  Our work has included input
to the draft standards of the Forest Stewardship Council, and
discussions with governments, industry, communities and small-
scale operations.  

<P>In response to inquiries from policy makers, producers and
consumers of forest products, Greenpeace is making available the
following principles and guidelines which it has developed for
ecologically responsible forest use.  

<P>Greenpeace believes that these principles and guidelines are
globally applicable.  More detailed reports describing the
application of these principles in several specific forest regions
are to follow.  We are also developing guidelines for the social
and economic aspects of forest use, paying particular attention to
the rights of indigenous peoples and forest-dependent communities.

<P>Greenpeace foresees an evolutionary process of further development
and periodic revisions of these principles and guidelines. 
Comments and suggestions are desired and welcomed. 


<a name="relationships"><H3> PRINCIPLES OF RESPECTFUL HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WITH FORESTS.</H3></a>

<P><B>CONSERVATION OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY</B>
 
<P>Forest ecosystems must be protected and maintained at all
scales, from the microscopic to the ecosystem level.

<P>The native biological diversity of forests must be
protected and maintained at all spatial scales and through all
time frames. 

<P>The ecological structure, function and dynamics of forests,
including water, soil, and nutrient cycles, landforms, and micro-
climate must be protected and maintained, or where degraded by
past human activities, restored.

<P>The ecological knowledge of indigenous peoples in relation
to forests must be recognized, respected, valued and applied as a
critical part of defining ecologically responsible forest use.


<P><B>THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE</B>

<P> Where there is a threat of reduction or loss of biological
diversity or other irreversible environmental impacts, lack of
full scientific certainty shall not be used a reason for
postponing measures to avoid such threats.  

<P>Forest planning and practices shall err on the side of
precaution.



<P><B>RIGHTS AND PARTICIPATION</B>

<P>The customary rights of indigenous peoples to own, use,
manage and conserve their lands, territories, and resources must
 
be recognised and respected in all forest management plans. 

<P>The public has the right to open and accountable planning
processes for forest use.  Forest use decisions must provide for
the meaningful participation of those sectors of the public
affected by proposed and on-going uses.  This shall include but
not be limited to indigenous peoples, local communities and non-
governmental organisations.

<P><B> FOREST PLANNING</B>

<P>In order to maintain forest structure, function and
dynamics, forest planning shall first determine what to leave, and
then what to take.

<P> Impacts to forest ecosystems from one use must not
compromise the potential for other uses.

<P>Forest planning shall favour uses and products which have
the lowest environmental impacts over their life cycle.
 


<a name="respectful"><H3>GUIDELINES FOR RESPECTFUL FOREST USE</H3></a>

<P>*Forest use areas shall be defined after the
establishment of a protected ecosystem network within each
landscape used by human beings. 

<P>* Protected ecosystem networks shall be respectful of
indigenous peoples' customary rights.

<P>* Protected ecosystem networks shall be designed
based on the principles of conservation biology and ecosystem
management.

<P> *Components of a protected ecosystem network
include: large protected reserves, riparian ecosystems,
ecologically sensitive sites, culturally significant areas,
representative and ecologically viable areas of all forest types
and successional phases, interconnecting corridors, naturally rare
habitats, and habitats for rare and endangered species and species
of special scientific significance.  

<P>* If a landscape has insufficient native forest to
make up a protected ecosystem network, restoration of forest areas
must be carried out as an integral part of the determination and
development of appropriate human use areas.

<P>*For every forest use area representative reference sites
must be identified, set aside and fully protected. Reference sites
may correspond to a number of production areas.


<P>*Reference sites shall be representative of the
native forest in the forest use area as determined by landscape
characteristics, biotic and abiotic components and the naturalness
of the reference site including its history.
 
<P> *Reference sites may be selected from, but are not
limited to, areas set aside within a protected ecosystem network. 

<P>* Reference sites should be as close to natural
ecosystems as possible.  Where such sites are not available,
restoration must occur.

<P>*Forest use areas shall be managed to mimic reference sites
in structure, function and dynamics. 

<P> *Reference sites serve as models for corresponding
use sites.  Inventories of structure, function and dynamics of
reference sites shall be used to establish minimum standards
necessary to design ecologically responsible forest use.
  
<P>  *Inventories shall occur on forest use sites to
 
determine any differences between the site being planned and the
reference sites.  These differences shall be used to strengthen,
but not weaken, the minimum standards established from reference
sites. 

<P>* Forest operations will seek to minimise differences
in structure, function and dynamics between the reference sites
and the forest use sites over time.

<P>*A management plan appropriate to the scale,
intensity and frequency of forest operations must be prepared. 
Management plans will be for specific forest sites and/or
ecosystems and must include provisions on the protection and
maintenance of adjacent and interconnected sites and/or ecosystems
as relevant.

<P>*Independent monitoring of the impacts of operations in the
forest use area shall occur.  Procedures for regular review and,
if needed, revision of the management plan must be established.

<P>* An environmental assessment shall take place prior
to and following extractive activities to make sure that forest
structure, function and dynamics are being protected. 

 <P> * Frequent inventories of the structure, function and
dynamics of forest use areas - as appropriate to the intensity,
scale and frequency of forest operations - and of their reference
sites shall occur to determine progress towards minimising
differences between them. 
     
 <P> * All assessments, inventories and management plans
must be documented and available to the public.



 
<a name="prohibited"><H3> SOME PROHIBITED MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</H3></a>

<P>In practical terms, the above guidelines mean that many presently
applied forest management practices must be avoided.  The
following is a partial list of those practices whose use should be
 
prohibited.  Prohibited management practices include use of:

<P>- bio-accumulative, toxic and/or persistent substances; 
<P>- genetically modified organisms (GMOs);
<P>- clearcutting;
<P>- highgrading;
<P>- direct manipulations of soils such as ploughing, harrowing,
and/or drainage of forest lands and peatlands.
<P>- replacement of natural forests by tree plantations.

<P>Despite growing opposition to whaling by people around the world and the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium both Norway and Japan are currently hunting whales for commercial
gain.  Norway is openly flouting the moratorium, while Japan 
is hunting whales under a "scientific research" loophole in the IWC convention.

<P><B>Such whaling has been driven by greed with no concern for the protection 
and preservation of whale stocks.</B> The income 
from the international trade in whale meat, whale products and associated 
illegal trade, is the catalyst driving the whaling industry.
 
<P>The whaling industry in both countries currently hunt the minke whale, the
smallest of the great whale species and the only one left in anywhere near its
original numbers.  The minkes, although larger than elephants, were too small
for whalers to bother with until the early 1970s when most of the larger whale
poplulations were decimated by commercial whaling.<BR><BR>

 <!--P>PHOTOS: HUGE NET WITH THOUSANDS OF FISH (2) BIG BAD CLEARCUT<--> 
 
<P>By far, the most important causes in the current loss of 
biodiversity are the destruction and alteration of habitats.  
The United Nations reports that 80% of species decline is a 
result of habitat destruction. 
 
<P>Because of the worldwide loss or conversion of habitats that 
has already taken place, tens of thousands of species are 
already committed to extinction. 
 
<P>Other major contributors include: the direct  exploitation of 
plants, forests and wildlife, the introduction of species into 
areas where they do not naturally occur, and pollution. The 
alteration of the atmosphere, and hence global climate, will  
likely be an important component in the very near future.      
Though individually each of these components are important, 
they do  not operate in isolation.  All of them combine, 
interact, and feed  back upon each other to produce a myriad 
of greater, accelerated and  cascading effects.  Ultimately, 
we are playing roulette with the  Earth's living systems, the 
end result of which may be a planet  unsuitable for human life 
as we currently know it.

<!--P>(A COUPLE GOOD ACTION PHOTOS HERE: COD ACTION AND A STOP 
CLEARCUTTING ACTION WITH BIG MACHINES IN CLAYOQUOT OR A 
MAHOGANY WITH BIG MACHINES?)<--> 
 
<P>Greenpeace campaigns around the world against pollution, 
nuclear  energy and weapons, and for a change in practices and 
activities which lead to alterations in the atmosphere.  
Within our International Biodiversity Campaign, our work is 
focussed on key areas involving  habitat destruction, the 
direct exploitation of species and systems,  and the genetic 
manipulation of natural biodiversity.  
  
  
	<P><H3>Forests  
 </H3>

<P>"Clearcutting causes two kinds of fundamental damage, one 
long-lasting, the other permanent.  The long-lasting damage is 
to the soil, the permanent damage is to biological diversity." 
Dr. C. Pielou, Professor Mathematical Ecology, ret. 
  
<P>Although they comprise only 30 per cent of the global land 
area,  forests are home to the majority of the Earth's 
species. However, vast  segments of the world's forests have 
already been destroyed, including  virtually all of Europe's 
original old growth forest and close to half of all tropical 
rainforests. Still the onslaught continues, through  
destructive logging for wood and paper production, wholesale 
clearing for agriculture, urban development and fuelwood, and 
more recently as a result of pollution. Tropical rainforests 
alone are being reduced at a rate equivalent to an area the 
size of the Netherlands and Switzerland each year. 
 <BR><BR>
<table width=100% border=2 cellpadding=5><tr><td><B>In Brazil an acre of rainforest is destroyed 
every 9 seconds.<P> In Canada an acre of ancient forests is 
clearcut every 12 seconds. <P> Worldwide 76% of the planet's 
original primary forests have already been destroyed or 
degraded. </B></td></tr></table>
 
<P>The effects are devastating. Anywhere between 40,000 and 60,000 
unique  types of forest-dependent plant, animal and insect 
species are becoming extinct annually.  Meanwhile, the 
livelihoods and cultures of numerous indigenous forest-
dwelling peoples and the economies of many forest-dependent 
communities are also in danger of completely  disappearing. 
  
<P>Greenpeace is working worldwide to seek protection and 
restoration of the planet's remaining forests and their 
associated biodiversity. We have developed guidelines for 
environmentally and socially responsible forest use and are 
extensively campaigning for their adoption by  governments, 
industry and international regulatory organisations.  
Greenpeace is advocating a ban on the further development of  
monoculture plantations, on clearcutting and predatory 
logging, and on the use of chemical pesticides and 
fertilisers. At the same time, the organisation is urging a 
reduction in the manufacture of wood and paper products and 
promoting the use of non-tree fibres and products  which are 
known to be environmentally and socially responsible. As  part 
of this process, we are supporting the struggles of indigenous  
peoples in securing land rights and the protection of their 
forests  from destructive activities. 
  
                            <P> <H3> Fisheries </H3>
  
<P>The oceans cover seventy-one per cent of the planet's surface.   
Because of their size, humans have regarded them as bottomless  
receptacles for waste and infinite reservoirs of natural 
resources.   Both assumptions are wrong, and as a result of 
human activities, the  oceans' productivity and diversity are 
in decline. 
 
<P>A prime example is the commercial fishing industry.  Increased 
market demand, modern technology and destructive fishing 
practices have led  to the decimation of fish and shellfish 
stocks around theworld. Over 70 per cent of global fish stocks 
are considered heavily, fully or  over-exploited.  Many are 
seriously depleted, while others have  completely collapsed. 
<BR><BR> 
<table width=100% border=2 cellpadding=5><tr><B> In 1992, in a desperate effort to protect what 
remained of the overfished and collapsing cod stocks off the 
coast of Newfoundland the Canadian government closed the 
fishery.  Over 30,000 people were thrown out of work </B></td></tr></table>
  
<P>The damage caused by the commercial fishing industry includes 
the  incidental catch, entanglement and mortality of non-
target fish,  marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles; 
habitat destruction -- for  example, through damage to the 
seabed caused by bottom trawls; reduced food for marine 
mammals and seabirds; and the massive disruption of  food 
webs. 
  
<P>To avoid the continued collapse of fish stocks, and to 
facilitate the recovery of depleted populations, Greenpeace is 
actively promoting:   
<P>* A reduction in the size and capacity of fishing fleets, and 
the    amount of fish taken.  
  
<P>* The end of the use of public money to subsidise the growth 
and    operations of the fishing industry. 
  
<P>* The development and implementation of fishing gear and 
methods to eliminate the bycatch of marine mammals, seabirds, 
sea turtles, non-target and underage fish and other marine 
wildlife.  
  
<P>* Adoption of a precautionary approach to the exploitation of 
the    world's fish stocks. 
  
  
                  <P>      <H3>  Commercial Whaling </H3>
  
<P>Over the centuries, commercial whaling has devastated whale  
populations, often to the point of extinction.  Decades later, 
many  populations still show no apparent signs of recovery. 
Some, such as  the right whales of the Northwest Atlantic, are 
now facing additional pressures, including entanglement in 
nets, habitat disturbance, contamination by pollutants and 
even collisions with ships.  Despite its tragic history and an 
International Whaling Commision  (IWC) ban, commercial whaling 
continues under the guise of "scientific research"  and 
through a loophole which allows countries to bypass IWC 
decisions.  Meanwhile, pressure is mounting from whaling 
nations for  the ban to be overturned and for full-scale 
commercial whaling to be  resumed. 
  
<P>There is only one sure way to prevent whale populations being 
over-exploited by commercial whaling, and that is to ensure 
that the ban on commercial whaling remains in place and is 
properly enforced.  Loopholes which allow whaling to 
masquerade as "scientific research"  should be closed. There 
should be a programme of non-lethal research  on whale 
populations and their environment, especially in areas set  
aside for whales' complete protection, such as the Indian 
Ocean and  Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuaries, to monitor the 
recovery of these populations and their interaction with the 
changing ocean environment. 
  
  
                  <P> <H3>      Genetic Engineering </H3>
 
<P>Genetic engineering poses a serious threat to the earth's 
biodiversity. Genetic engineering allows genes to be 
transferred between completely unrelated species. Human genes 
have been moved into fish; bacterial and animal genes into 
plants. 
  
<P>Multinational companies at the forefront of developing 
genetically-engineered versions of plants and crops now have 
the go-ahead to  market their first products.  Genetically-
engineered tomatoes are on supermarket shelves in the USA, and 
farmers in the US and Europe will soon be able to buy 
genetically engineered tobacco, cotton, corn and oilseed rape. 
  
<P>The claim is that such "transgenic" crops will produce 
healthier  foods, an end to the reliance on chemical 
fertilizers and pesticides, and a solution to world hunger. In 
reality, such crops are likely to  prolong, rather than 
reduce, agriculture's reliance on chemicals.   Many of the 
first generation of engineered crops are herbicide  resistant, 
developed so that chemical weed killers can be used on them 
with impunity. Most of the world's hungry are too poor to buy  
traditionally-bred crops, much less the expensive products of  
biotechnology.    
 
<P>The industry is developing rapidly, despite having virtually 
no idea  of the ultimate environmental consequences. 
Transgenic organisms could behave in unexpected ways and 
become pests themselves; for example,  transgenic crops could 
become troublesome weeds. The"foreign" gene  could be 
transferred to a wild relative through pollen spread and  
fundamentally alter the genetic material of natural organisms.  
 
<P>These impacts, together with the monocultures of "improved" 
crops that  companies will be seeking to establish, will 
reduce genetic and  biological diversity. In addition, some of 
these genetically-engineered organisms will include virus 
genes, which could lead to the creation of new viruses and the 
spread of new diseases.  
 
<P>The biotechnology industry is also demanding patent protection 
for its "inventions." Patents on genes and living material 
give control over  the genetic makeup of the world to private 
interests and reward their efforts to "improve" on millions of 
years of evolution.  
  
<P>Following campaigns by Greenpeace and others, the European 
Parliament rejected a proposal for patents on life. In a test 
case at the European Patent Office, Greenpeace established 
that patents on plants and seeds should not be allowed. 
Greenpeace will now build on these early successes in its 
continuing campaigns against the development,  patenting and 
release of genetically engineered products. 
  
<P><H3>The Future </H3>
 
<P>Greenpeace has already achieved remarkable
victories on some of these and on many other
issues. 
<P>In the past decade Greenpeace
campaigns have contributed to: a world wide
ban on the use of large scale driftnet
fishing; the creation of a whale sanctuary in
Antarctica; the creation of
maritime/terrestrial national park in the
Spanish Cabrera archipelago; a United Nations
global Fisheries Treaty; a World Bank forest
policy that prohibits Bank financing of
logging in primary tropical forests;  stopping
the illegal destruction of the endangered Mata
Atlantica rainforest in Brazil; the creation
of the first certified clearcut-free
ecoforestry operation in Canada; the dramatic
reduction of logging in Clayoquot Sound, a
region of Canadian temperate rainforest; and
the protection (United Nations World Heritage
Designation) of the Russian Komi region,
Europes largest intact old growth boreal
forest.  

<P>Greenpeace was also  influential in the 1980 
in achieving a world-wide moratorium on
commercial whaling. While there are two
remaining commercial whaling nations, we
anticipate the demise of this industry in the
near future as a result of our continued
campaigns. 

<P><B>With your support, we will continue to fight
against biodiversity loss;  we are confident
these trends can be halted and eventually
overcome.</B>

<head>From:  Desley Mather,  Greenpeace Press Officer<P>
Date:  Sunday 30 April 1995<P>
Day One of Brent Spar Occupation<P></head><body>
 <P>
We arrived in the Brent oil field before midday.  All morning we passed through oil fields and those of us new to the 
North Sea just can't believe how many oil rigs and platforms are actually out here.  The MS Embla, a chartered vessel, 
has arrived with Greenpeace activists from having sailed from Hamburg, Germany.
 <P>
Everything happened very quickly as inflatable speed boats were put in the water to take  climbers to the Brent Spar 
rig.  We could see the climbers scaling the outside of the rusting platform.

<P>Soon after, one of the oil rig supply vessels 
came at us at a great speed.  It steamed alongside us and its wake made our little vessel, the Moby Dick, rock.

<P>The skipper called for us to lash the galley -- I caught five plates before they fly off the bench onto the floor.  Next, 
the supply vessel turned and headed for the Brent Spar rig, where about three Greenpeace inflatables were standing 
under the climbers who were still climbing toward their soon-to-be temporary home.  The inflatables felt the wake but 
the skilled drivers had no problem staying afloat and in control.<P>

 or <a href="close01.jpg">31KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace inflatable alongside Brent Spar platform. ©Greenpeace/Sims.

 <P>
Media from North Sea countries began calling us for interviews about why Greenpeace are out on the rig and what Greenpeace hoped to achieve.  Most were shocked to find out that 
while in the UK the oil industry is given permission to dump these toxic platforms at sea, US law requires that they 
must dispose of them onshore--clearly a double standard.  And the plan to dump this rig is taking place just days 
before the upcoming North Sea Ministers meeting in Denmark.  Ministers attending the meeting are expected to 
come up with real solutions to the toxic environmental problems effecting the North Sea but it is clear that the UK 
will be, once again, attempting to undermine strong regulations to North Sea dumping.<P>
 <P>
It's not long before the climbers have made it onto the platform's helideck.  A cheer goes up from the Moby's bridge as 
the Greenpeace activists unfurl the banner from the very top of the 28 metre-high platform.  It read: "Save the North 
Sea".

<P>
All day the ship ferried supplies for the climbers from our two ships to the platform, hoisting containers and boxes 
using a pulley, a speed boat and elbow grease.  She was held up by a few mechanical problems with some of the small 
inflatables and had to call it a night after a swell came up and bad weather set in.  <P>
Speeding back to the Moby in the dark, the oil field looked like a city in some sort of weird science fiction movie -- 
lights from the surrounding operational rigs and their huge gas flares lit up the ugliest kind of "field" on earth.  One 
of the lights made us smile, though--a dim glow could be seen from the Brent Spar.  Our generator on the rig was 
working.<P>
 <P>
We put out a <a href="apr30.html">press release</a> early morning to announce our protest on the rig. <P>
 <P>
More from the rig as we continue our occupation.<P>
Desley from a rough North Sea!<P>

              TO DUMP THE BRENT SPAR OIL PLATFORM</H4></head><body>
 
<P>

<P>Just a short one today to say that the Greenpeace crew on board
the dilapidated and abandoned Shell oil platform Brent Spar are
healthy, content and relatively comfortable.  The weather is
quite cold but clear.  To let you know a little bit about what
our temporary home looks like, here's a brief description...

<P>Water up to our ankles in some places like the bottom of the
stairs of what was once the "accommodation" area where we stay
most of the time when we are not on watch.  We work around it but
since there is no heat, avoiding getting wet at all costs is
essential.  We dress in many layers, including a layer of
waterproof gear 24 hours a day.  There are also no bathrooms and
no other creature comforts.  Most of the journalists that have
visited are amazed at the conditions.

<P>At night, when the weather is bad, the wind whips through this
old platform loudly and the rig itself creaks.  It's quite
spooky.

<P>We've only been out here eight days and there are likely to be
many more to come.  We must stay on the Brent Spar
until either Shell or the governments that oversee North Sea
regulations do the sensible thing and recognize that this
platform, with its radioactive and toxic waste, has no business
being dumped on the bottom of the ocean floor where the marine
environment, including the fish that North Sea fisherman depend
on to make their living, will be negatively impacted.

<P>Shell have made millions of dollars from oil production in
this region, they have a clear responsibility to pay for the
clean up of the mess they have made.  Until companies own up to
the full cost of the products they produce from cradle to grave,
companies like Shell will continue to make money while the public
pays for the aftermath -- in more ways than one.

<P>More as it happens.

<P>Last night at 9.30pm, a Shell helicopter swooped down on the
Brent Spar oil platform with two Sheriff's officers from Aberdeen
wearing Shell survival suits and carrying a legal injunction.

<P>As the helicopter was hovering over the helideck, a legal
document was coming through the fax machine - all 13 of us were
being accosted from all angles.  This strong-arm tactic made us
even more determined to stay on the rig since we are the only
ones between Shell's crazy plan to dump this toxic rig and its
implementation.  The Sheriffs stayed overnight and shared our
'cosy' accommodation until the helicopter picked them up early
this morning.

<P>Amidst all the legal gloom, we just heard that yesterday, the
Danish Government condemned the UK government's decision to grant
a licence for the dumping of Shell's toxic platform.  What great
news!  The UK has always been known as "the dirty old man of
Europe" and it is certainly living up to its reputation by
regressing a decade in its environmental policies and outlook. 
The UK is certainly going to be the brunt of much criticism at
the upcoming North Sea Conference in Denmark in early June as
international concern over this issue grows.

<P>The Moby Dick is back to bring on very seasick
journalists who have courageously volunteered to share this
experience with us.  Their coverage will allow the world to know
about Shell's plans to dump this rig into the North Sea with its
100 tonnes of toxic cargo.

into the sea with its 100 tonnes of toxic sludge.

<P>The new crew, in inflatables, waited for the waves to rise high
enough for them to grab the one rusting metal ladder leading up
to the top of the platform.  They then scaled the steep ascent
to the platform -- up the peeling, yellow, 17-metre diameter
metering and pump room -- which leads to a trap door to the
dilapidated accommodation room.  While doing so, our inflatables
were dangerously obstructed by a Norwegian rig support vessel,
the Rembas.  The Rembas nearly pushed one of our inflatables
against the side of the Brent Spar.  We on the Brent Spar,
concerned by this irresponsible action, read the following
message to the Rembas:
<P><a href="shel.gif">

<img align=top src="shelt.gif" alt="photo1.">54KB GIF</a>

<P>"You are endangering life by manoeuvring in a life-threatening
and unseamanlike manner.  We request that you keep a safe
distance from our inflatables."

<P>The Rembas indicated that they understood this message but
continued to be obstructive. 

<P>All of us are now wondering if this is the first attempt to
remove us from the rig after the court issued an interim
interdict on the 14 May.  The Scottish Courts allowed Shell to
stop the Greenpeace vessel, Moby Dick, from resupplying us with
food and other essentials.....Shell want to starve us out and we
want to stop Shell from destroying the North Sea with its toxic
waste!

<P>Early this morning, around 6am, 15 police and security from the
Stadive, an enormous oil rig servicing vessel, moved to board the
Brent Spar in a metal cage suspended from a giant crane. 
Greenpeace activists repeatedly pushed the cage off of the Brent
Spar surface but eventually gave up the fight and allowed the
cage to land.

<P>  At that time, a number of activists scattered and
hand cuffed themselves to pre-arranged positions within the oil
platform and above it on large crane.  Eight activists and six
journalists were taken on board the Stadive after boltcutters
were used to remove them from their positions.

<P>It now appears that there are an unknown number of Greenpeace
activists hidden in various parts of the disused oil rig.  Shell
have not allowed us to communicate with the people aboard the
Brent Spar.  We are unclear as to the exact position at the
moment but one thing is for sure: the struggle continues, with
International pressure mounting against the UK government and
Shell, all our efforts will be concentrated on stopping the
dumping of the Brent spar into the North Sea in the lead up to
the North Sea Conference on 8-9 June.

  SHELL VESSEL RAMS GREENPEACE BOAT AS BRENT SPAR DUMP BEGINS

<P>BRENT OIL FIELD, SATURDAY, 10 June, 1995--The ink on the North Sea Conference
declaration condemning the dumping of the toxic laden Brent Spar was barely dry as Shell
UK moved in to dump the oil platform today.

<P>This morning, a Shell rigid-hulled speed boat rammed and drove over a Greenpeace life raft
attached to one of the Brent Spar's six massive anchor chains, upending it and throwing
three activists overboard into the sea.  Shell standby vessel, Rembas continued blasting
the activists with high pressure water hoses in a dangerous attempt to remove them.

<P>Shell's Brenda Viking supply vessel attached a wire to one of the anchor chains, lifting the
chain's slack onto its deck.  Another Shell vessel, the Smit Singapore, backed up to the
Brenda Viking, with a Greenpeace inflatable between them.

<P>The Greenpeace activists cut a heaving line as the Smit Singapore towing vessel tried to
pull a wire from the Brenda Viking.  The activists then pulled in the cable and tied it to
their inflatable.  As the two Shell vessels began to winch themselves together the Smit
Singapore let the cable go and the Brenda Viking began winching the Greenpeace boat
aboard under its stern.  The Greenpeace boat was flipped over and one activist was
thrown out.

At about 2.30pm, two activists jumped into the water in front of the Smit Singapore as
it attempted to approach the Brent Spar again.  Shell has been able to cut only one of the
anchor chains so far and have not managed to connect a tug.


<P>




<P>"Shell is showing contempt for most of the countries bordering the North Sea and is acting
aggressively towards Greenpeace's protest of their outrageous dumping plans," said Chris
Rose of Greenpeace.

<P>"This is an environmental obscenity.  Shell thinks the sea is its litter bin and the UK
Government is allowing the multinational oil company to call the shots," said Rose.

<P>Most North Sea countries agreed at the North Sea Conference -- which ended yesterday -
- that dumping offshore installations at sea was totally unacceptable and recommended
decommissioning of rigs on land.  Only the UK, Norway and France objected to the
recommendation.

<P>Yesterday, Greenpeace leaked a 1992 Smit Engineering report which shows that, contrary
to previous Shell assertions the Brent Spar could feasibly be towed back to land and
decommissioned for less than a quarter of the cost quoted in Shell's original estimate.

<P>"It appears that Shell kept this information from the UK Government to ensure the
disastrous decision to allow the oil giant to dump the Brent Spar," said Rose.  "There is
no good reason to dump the Brent Spar and every good reason not to."

<P> <head><H4>SHELL POSTPONES BRENT SPAR DUMP DUE TO BAD WEATHER, TANGLED WIRE</H4></head><body>

<P>BRENT OIL FIELD, NORTH SEA, Sunday June 11, 1995--Shell have suspended Brent Spar
dumping operations this afternoon.

<P>The Brent Spar is now hanging by only one of six anchor chains in Wind Force 5 conditions
with more than two-metre-high swells.  Two tugs are attached to the toxic-laden platform
but it seems the operation is not going according to plan.  

<P>A wire hanging from the Brent Spar is tangled with towing gear.  An attempt by Shell
vessel Brenda Viking to disentangle it was futile.  The Brenda Viking is believed to be
carrying the explosives for the final sinking of the Brent Spar about 140 nautical miles NW
of the Isle of Lewis in the Hebrides.

<P>reenpeace activists aboard the MV Moby Dick close to the Brent Spar heard the Shell
tugs postpone the dumping preparations over VHF radio.

<P>"Every step of the towing and dumping operation is dangerous but the worst is still yet to
come," said Chris Rose of Greenpeace.  "It's the final step that will pose even more danger
to the marine environment -- when the floatation tanks of the 14,500 tonne Brent Spar are
blown and over 130 tonnes of dangerous toxic waste are sunk with it." 

<P>Yesterday, a Shell chartered vessel rammed a Greenpeace lifeboat attached to one of the
Brent Spar anchor chains, tipped an inflatable boat under the Brenda Viking's stern and
blasted activists with a high pressure fire fighting cannon.  The confrontation continued
into the afternoon when two activists jumped into the water in front of the Shell chartered
tug Smit Singapore as it tried to approach the platform again.

<P>"Greenpeace will stay with the Brent Spar to monitor, expose and, wherever possible, take
non-violent action to stop this nightmare dump," Rose said.

SHELL COMMENCE TOW OF BRENT SPAR PLATFORM - GREENPEACE IN PURSUIT.</H4></head><body>

UPDATE ON BRENT SPAR



 <P>
 <P>The Brent Spar flotilla currently consists of two tugs, the
Smit Singapore and the President Hubert which are towing the
Spar.  Following this are two Shell support vessels the Rembas
and the Torbas, which continuously spray water cannons around the
Spar.  
 Following this is the Greenpeace vessel Altair (phone ++
871 130 2334) which is shadowed by the Grampian Pride.  Bringing
up the rear is the HMS Alderney, a British Navy Fisheries Patrol
vessel has now joined the flotilla accompanying the Spar.  The
vessel is maintaining radio silence, but appears to be there to
be monitoring the situation, apparently at the request of the UK
Department of Trade and Industry.

 <P>Another vessel, the Brenda Viking, was leading the flotilla
through the designated route through the deep waters of the Brent
Field, but left this morning. 

 <P>This morning, when the Altair launched some inflatable boats,
the Rembas and Torbas immediately began spraying the Spar with
water cannons, and sent a message out to Greenpeace saying that
it was doing Fire practice; that it would be dangerous to go near
the Spar and that Shell would have no liability if anyone was
injured by doing so. 

 <P>At 12.00 midday the position of the Brent Spar is 61 deg 04
North, 0 deg 11 East, which is 65 nautical miles from the
original position. Current distance from Shetland is 45 Nautical
miles.

<HR>
<P>POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS


 <P>The UK Department of Industry has now received from Greenpeace
a copy of the Smit Engineering BV 1992 analysis of the
decommissioning of the Brent Spar on land.  Peter Holt, at the
DTI's Oil and Gas Abandonment section in Aberdeen, is the
contact:  44 1224 238 3216.  Shell denies that this report
contains the full cost breakdown, but this is not the case.  For
example, Shell yesterday told a journalist that the analysis did
not include the costs of towing to the UK.  It does -- under a
section entitled "TOWING TO THE UK".  A complete budgetary
breakdown, detailing the cost of each step in the scrapping
process involved in each of the onshore disposal options is
available from Greenpeace.  It is 16 pages long but provides the
most realistic and detailed estimates available.  

 <P>Two Early Day Motions, one protesting the Brent Spar dumping
issue and the other calling for a halt in the light of the Smit
report, have been tabled in the UK House of Commons

 <P> Shell is saying that the Spar would break up in shallow water,
but the Smit report also addresses this question. 
 <P> Please contact
Chris Rose or Paul Horsman at Greenpeace UK  ++44 171 354 5100
for more information.

<head>From: --Activists Off duty, and sailing back to Amsterdam. <P>
Date:Friday June14th 1995<P>
</head><body>

 <P>After four weeks of cruising on the North Sea, the Moby Dick
sailed back to Amsterdam, allowing the larger Altair to continue
following the movements of Shell and the Spar, with its fresh
supplies and crew.
<P><a href="bspa09.gif">
<img align=top src="bspa09t.gif" alt="photo1.">62KB GIF</a>
 or <a href="bspa09.jpg">23KB JPG.</a> ©Greenpeace/Sims.


 <P>Throughout our time at the Spar sight, the eight-man crew worked
six-hour shifts, around the clock. We were dedicated, and worked
well together. 

 <P>We cruised three or four miles out and around the rig.  While on
watch, we would monitor the movements of Shell's boats, navigate,
answer press calls, chat with each other and, if there was a
spare moment, watch the sea. 

 <P>When we were off duty we would sleep, or go and relax in the
mess. We did have a radio and television, but we hardly ever had
them on because the reception was so bad. In saying this, we were
unaware of the amount of media coverage the Spar action was
continuing to recieve. 
 
<P><a href="bspa08.gif">
<img align=top src="bspa08t.gif" alt="photo1.">64KB GIF</a>
 or <a href="bspa08.jpg">23KB JPG.</a> ©Greenpeace/Sims.




 <P>Life on the Moby could be very uncomfortable when the weather was
bad. Ranging from slight gales to wind force 8, it was difficult
to deal with. We had to move around very carefully. If we took
a wrong step, we could be thrown under the stairs. It really was
a case of doing the most basic things while waiting for the storm
to pass.

 <P>Now sailing back, speaking for all the crew, I would say the
general feeling was emptiness. We were all still raring to go,
but, the Altair is bigger and has more crew so it made sense to 
swap over.

 <P>Although Shell was given the go ahead to dump the Brent Spar, we
fought very hard, and did everything we possibly could to stop
the dumping. I just hope the crew on the Altair
can follow with the protesting, and give it a good end.

 <P>I enjoyed being a part of the Brent Spar action. It's a great
feeling being involved with something like this, and knowing that
what you are doing is for such a worthwhile cause. We just cannot
condone Shell's actions. Money and profit are just academic, but
they seem to cloud rational judgement in too many people.

<img align=top src="bspa10t.gif" alt="photo1.">67KB GIF</a>
 or <a href="bspa10.jpg">26KB JPG.</a> ©Greenpeace/Sims.

 <P>The crew on Shell's boat, Rembas, behaved appaulingly. When we
were hanging the banners on the side of the installation, and
they turned on their fire hoses, the few of us standing, watching
on the Moby Dick, couldn't believe it.
It was a chance to show off their strength, and I couldn't do
anything about it. 

 <P>After failed efforts of trying to contact the captain of the
Rembas, I was so angry and frustrated. All I kept saying to
myself was, 'I wish we were on the GP Solo', so we could do the
same to them as they were doing to us. I wanted them to know how
it felt.

 <P>In another incident, they nearly decapitated members of the crew.
Our life raft was chained to one of the Spar chains. Rembas
lowered their rescue boats and tried to run over it. Luckily they
stopped, but it was frightening.

 <P>Both those incidents were so unneccessary. We were not
threatening those men, we were threatening Shell, because of
their actions.

 <P>Last Sunday, the Rembas communicated with us, and said they were
sorry for their behaviour, claiming it was due to 'irrational
thinking', but thats rubbish, they knew what they were doing.

<P>From:    The Greenpeace vessel Altair
<br>Date:    Fri 16-JUN-95 7:03:09 GMT
<br><head><H4>Subject: internet update</H4></head><body>

<P>Latest update:

<P>Today a helicopter went from the Altair with crew on board to
try to re-board the Brent Spar rig. 

<P>Our helicopter pilot, one of the best out there, made several
attempts to get close to the Brent Spar while Shell, amazingly,
used water cannons on the helicopter to prevent it from landing. 
After a first aborted attempt and with inflatable boats in the
water as well, the pilot took the helicopter back in and this time was
successful in dropping off two activists onto the Spar.  The
water cannonning continued after they were successfully on board
but the helicopter landed safely back on the Altair with our mission
accomplished.  Later, the pilot was able to return to the Spar on board
the Greenpeace helicopter with supplies which were dropped off
the Greenpeace staff on board the oil platform.

<P>Shell picked up two Greenpeace inflatable drivers earlier and are
holding them on board one of their service vessels.  They have
not had them arrested and have resisted any attempts to make
arrangements with us to transfer them to our boat.

<P>We've heard from our office in Canada that German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has raised the issue of the Brent Spar dumping at the
G7 Summit of heads of state currently going on in Canada.  John
Major reportedly has said he will refuse to reconsider his
decision.  This means we have four days to continue pressuring
him to do the right thing.

<P>Protests are planned at 100 Shell sites in the UK tomorrow.  Protests continue to take place across Europe. 

<P>There have been reports of damage to Shell property in Germany. 
We are very concerned and troubled by this.  As a non-violent
organization, Greenpeace abhors the use of any such tactics to
bring about change and we call on protesters to use only peaceful
means to prevent the Brent Spar dumping.

<P>Keep up the fight.  There's still a chance that we can prevent
the dumping!

<P>More from the Altair as we go.

<P>From:      Crews of the Greenpeace vessels Altair and Solo 
<br>Date:    Tues 20-JUN-95 10:31:11 GMT,
<br><head><H4>Subject: Morning update from the brent, Part 1</H4></head><body>






<P>At 5 am this morning, when all was quiet on the Shell front, we
prepared to fly two activisgs to Brent Spar and drop them on
board to join the two already on board.

<P>We decided last night, that if the weather was bad, and if
Shell's vessels tried to fire their cannons at us, we wouldn't
take the risk and would turn back.  But it was a nice morning,
if a bit windy, and as we approached the Spar we saw the position
of the boats, and realized it was quite possible we could get
them on board.

<P>The two Shell support vessels, the Rembas and the Torbas, were
at least 500 metres away from the Spar, with their water cannons
turned off -- a rareity, which provided the perfect opportunity
to attempt the drop. If they did see us, they were too far away
to stop us .

<P>The two men were high with excitement. They each had a bundle of
supplies; food, clothes and radio equipment, that would last them
quite a few days. 

<P>I hovered low over the helipad, but was unable to land because
of the razor-wire strewn by Shell. Fortunatly, because they were
tall were able to just step off the helicopter, safely onto the
platform.

<P>I am so pleased the whole thing went so smoothly, especially
after the first helicopter drop almost failed after water cannons
tried to knock them out of the sky. 

<P>The German pilot's who were taken in to custody are likely to be
in court this afternoon, and we are waiting to find out what
happens.

<P>We have also heard a rumour that the police are on their way by
helicopter to make arrests, so we wait in anticipation.

Time: 7pm

<br>Foghorns blasted -- people jumped up and down cheering. The only
words to describe the feelings here are complete elation. 

<P>Two of our activists on the Spar, dismantled the explosives Shell
had planted, before returning to the Solo.




<br><head><H4>Subject:Turn around of the Brent Spar, part 3</H4></head><body>
From:    MV Altair
Date:    TUE 20-JUN-95 22.00 GMT 
<P>The time is 22.00 BST and the Brent Spar has just completed a 180
degree turn. She is now heading NE back the way she came. As you
can imagine we are in a fantastic mood. The four heroes who occupied
the Spar have come off - two have just returned to the
Altair, and the other two have gone to the Solo.

<P>"I saw the tugs which had been dragging the the rig slowly
turning around just then a huge rainbow opened in the sky - I
thought I was dreaming!" said an activist who was on board the Brent Spar.  

We would just like to say hello to everyone and thank them for
all their efforts and hard work in making this whole thing
possible. It is all taking a little time to sink in, but it is
amazing what we can achieve if we all pull together.
 
<br>Well done to everyone
 
<br>Altair Crew
<br><head><H4>From:   A Greenpeace campaigner on board the Altair.</H4></head><body>

<P>Time: 11am

<P>Following the Spar we have now travelled 372 Nautical miles,
which leaves 60 N miles to go before we reach the dump site. Our
average speed is 1.6 knots.  The wind is South westerly at force
7.

<P>The pressure mounts as time ticks by. But Greenpeace, as ever
will not give up till the very end. Two more activists were
dropped on the Spar in the early hours of this morning.

<P>It was beautiful this morning -- the sky was clear and bright.
Seeing the helicopter fly across the horizon, without
interferance from the water cannons, and dropping the activists
safely on the platform was quite fantastic. Paula did a great
job.

<P>Shell will have to physically remove our activists, because they
are very determind and intend to stay on the Spar as long as they
possibly can. The heat is on.

<br><head><H4>From: The Captain of the Altair.</H4></head><body>

Time: evening update

It was just after six o'clock when we heard the marvellous news.
It is an incredible feeling when you believe in something so much
and do everything in your power to make it happen, and then it
happens. All that pushing, hard work and determination has paid
off, we won. 

<P>The time is 10 pm and the Brent Spar has just completed a 180
degree turn. She is now heading NE back the way she came. As you
can imagine, we are elated and incredibly emotional all at the
same time. 

<P>We have been speaking to a number of journalists via the
satallite phone. The Campaigner has almost lost his voice, he's
been talking so much.

<P>The four actvists who were occupying the Spar have returned to
the Altair and the Solo. It sounds corny, but it is true to say
this evening we saw, and took pictures of a rainbow over the
Spar.

<P>We would like to say hello to everyone out there on the internet,
for their support in making this whole thing possible. It is all
taking a little time to sink in, but it is amazing what we can
achieve if we all pull together.  



<P>One of the protesters on the Brent Spar describes the moment he found out that Shell were not going to
dump the platform:



<P>We were sitting inside the Spar's compartment, when suddenly the
water cannons just stopped. We walked out onto the platform to
see if anything was happening.

<P>On the Altair we could see little silhouetted figures dancing
around. We couldn't figure out what was going, until the Altair
radioed us and told us the great news.

<P>After that moment an incredible rainbow appeared in the sky.
Somebody later described the vision to look like a "film set",
which it did, the light was amazing.

<P>The three other actvists were air lifted by helicopter back to
the Altair and the Solo, but I chose to absail down the Spar, for
a boat to pick me up at the bottom.

<P>I had always wanted to, but thought it wouldn't get the chance
because if they dumped the Spar we wouldn't have left the rig on
our own accord.

<P>As I climbed down the installation I heard the fainting buzz of
a radio. Since we had been on the rig we had made this radio out
of bits and pieces, and chose to leave it on when we left as a
final sentiment.

<P>The Altair following the Spar:
 
<P>The Spar made a 180 degree turn last night and the current
position is...59 deg 31 North, 08 deg 37 West. Average speed is
1.5 knots, current speed is 1.5 knots.  Distance is now 75 n
miles from the dump site, 92 n miles from the Butt of Lewis.
Heading is 041 degrees. Wind is Westerly, force 4/5, sea swell
is 3 metres.

<P>The Shell support vessels, Torbas Krombas and Rembas have now
left the flotilla, apparently for Lerwick.
 
<P>Had a call from the Captain of the Starina - he had seen the news last night and said "Congratulations - I love you
people.."!!
 
<P>Have had many other supportive calls, including one from the
pilot of the fixed wing plane that flew on the day of boarding
and again later - he was "over the moon" about it.
 
<P><H4>From the Solo crew:</H4>

<P>The Greenpeace support vessel, Solo arrived in Stornoway, Western
Isles in the Outer Hebrides this morning at 10.30am to drop off
journalists.  We had a press conference for the many journalists
on board and the crowds of others on the quayside.  The Vice-
convenor of the Western Isles council presented the Solo and the
Altair with plaques as a "thank you" for helping them stop the
disused toxic laden oil platform, the Spar from being dumped near
their homes.  It was great!

<P>Last night our cheery journalists on board the Solo had a little
whisky sing song to celebrate the U-turn by Shell not to dump the
platform.  They composed a song for all of us:

<P>I WAS BORN UNDER A GREENPEACE FLAG

<P>(to the tune of Wandering Star)

<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag

<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag

<P>Do I know where Spar is?
<P>Spar is going back,
<P>Krombas, Rembas, Torbas,
<P>Are all going to get the sack!

<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag
<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag
<P>Do we know the heroes?
<P>We know who they are
<P>daa dee dah dee dah de dah
<P>Stopped the  Dumping of the Spar.

<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag
<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag
<P>What about the Solo?
<P>It came there to stay
<P>Ulf was at the helm
<P>And we chased them all away
<P>I was born under a Greenpeace Flag
<P>A Greenpeace, Greenpeace Flag.


<P>We were more than flattered.

<P>Evening update, from the crew members of the Solo and the Altair:


<P>The Altair is following the Brent Spar as it is being towed back
to the UK, expecting to arrive in Lerwick on Friday at around
4pm.


<P>The Solo arrived this morning in Stornaway harbour, in the
Western Isles, Outer Hebrides, to let off journalists. 


<P>After this incredible victory (everyone is still trying to let
it sink in) we are taking the huge amount of press calls,
conducting interviews and generally riding this wave of public
attention. 


<P>Today the story was on the front page of virtually every national
paper in Europe, and has received a huge amount coverage all over
the world.


<P>We continue to celebrate, and once again, we would like to thank
you all out there on the internet who gave us your support. Every
single voice counted in bringing about this last minute change
of thought. We couldn't have done it without you. Thanks again.

<title>Flooded Forest in Amazon</title>
</head>

<body>
<a><IMG SRC="biglogi.gif"ALT=IMAGE></a>

<h2>Logging in the flooded forest</h2>
<h3>A unique Amazon ecosystem under threat</h3>
<p> 
The lowland forests of the Amazon estuary are flooded to depths
of ten metres or more for six months of the year. During this
long wet season - from January to June - the loggers move in and
without any control, vast quantities of logs are floated out. One
of biggest companies logging in the Amazon Estuary is a company
named, Eidai, 49 per cent of whose shares are owned by the
multinational, Mitsubishi.
<p> 
Traditionally, virola was the most sought after species exported
from the Amazon Estuary, preceded only by mahogany from the
"upland" forests. However, as supplies have been exhausted,
virola has fallen to fourth place in the timber exports from
Brazil. The United States is the biggest importer of plywood and
veneer from this wood.
<p> 
The environmental impact of this exploitation is severe. In
certain areas the exploitation is so intense that very little
tree cover is left behind. This results in an elimination of
seedlings and dramatic changes in the river ecosystem. It is
estimated that at current rates of exploitation, the demand
created by the hundreds of sawmills in the region will decimate
stocks of virola within ten years.
<p> 
<h3>From boom to bust</h3>
<p> 
In the 80s virola was the principle wood exported from the Amazon
estuary, in the state of Para. The wood, mostly for export, is
used for construction in household interiors. It is also used for
high quality veneer and plywood, produced for both internal and
external markets. 
<p>
However, as supplies have been exhausted, the industry has 
become more intensive and moved from extensive logging of the
floodplains to intensive logging of high density virola in the
swamp forests. The use of heavy machinery is increasing and the
dredging of artificial channels to transport the logs results in
significant changes to this unique and fragile ecosystem. But in
the face of declining stocks, efforts to diversify to other
species have merely exacerbated the damage. 
<p> 
The kapok, or "tree of life" is one of the species logged as a
substitute to virola. It is the biggest tree on the shores of the
Amazon's white water rivers and is sacred to local people. Birds
flock to it in the evening and herons and storks nest in its
branches, giving the "tree of life" its name. 
<p> 
The volume of virola currently marketed requires the annual
exploitation of 50km2 of swamp forest or over 1,400km2 of
floodplain forest in the Amazon estuary. In some areas already
95 per cent of sawmills report difficulties in purchasing this
wood. This decline is reflected by high unemployment and rural
exodus from the estuary region.  
<p> 
<h3>Out of control</h3>
 
Official monitoring of the logging industry in the Amazon estuary
is pitifully inadequate and almost non-existent. The Brazilian
environmental agency (IBAMA) responsible, employs only a few
forest guards in the whole region. As a result, policies of
forest management and logging quotas are not implemented.
Regulations limiting the girth-diameter of trees cut are mostly
ignored. The result is an uncontrolled logging operation felling
vast quantities of illegally cut wood.
<p> 
<h3>Opportunities missed</h3>
 
Virola trees and also those woods exploited as substitutes,
actually have good potential for forest management. Virola grows
well on disturbed land, has strong regenerative capabilities and
is fast-growing. However, with no effective government monitoring
or incentive, the logging industries have so far failed to
implement any effective management plans in areas where virola
trees are felled. For example, the cutting of small-girth trees
could be restricted, giving the trees a chance to regenerate and
replace the more mature trees logged for the timber trade. 
<p> 
<h3>Slaves to destruction</h3>
<p> 
Most virola is logged on private land and the relationship
between landlord and worker reflects the grossly unbalanced and
exploitative working situation typical of Brazilian history. The
workers are paid very little for the wood which they log during
the rainy season. For the rest of year they are unemployed and
forced to pay inflated prices for essential goods from their
landlords. 
<p> 
In addition to the social damage wreaked on local people by the
working conditions of the logging industry, there are serious
concerns about health risks surrounding the process at the
sawmill itself. The mills frequently use a highly toxic drying
agent known as "chinese powder" or PCP which workers are exposed
to with no protection. No information is provided to employees
about the potential danger of exposure to this product, which
can cause cancer and infertility.
<p> 
The total lack of safety precautions for workers extracting the
logs and in the sawmills themselves, results in frequent
accidents, mutilations and even deaths. Children are also
employed, with no training and little pay.
<p> 
<h2>Greenpeace demands</h2> 

<ul>
<li> The Brazilian Government must fund effective enforcement of
regulations monitoring the logging industry in the flooded
forest. 
<li> In particular, the Government should introduce controls to
protect heavily logged timber species, such as virola, from
commercial and genetic extinction.
<li> The Brazilian Government should provide incentives to favour
sustainable logging practises which do not present a threat to
the Amazon ecosystem [1].

From:    MV Solo
<br>Date:    SAT 18-MAR-95 07:15:48 GMT -- DAY 24 PART I

<P><H4>PINTAIL TO ENTER ARGENTINEAN WATERS DESPITE SWELL OF GOVERNMENT
AND PUBLIC PROTEST</H4>
</head>
<body>
     <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 53
degrees and 38 minutes south and 58 degrees and 33 minutes west,
on a distance of some 200 miles east of the Argentinean Isla de
los Estados.

     <P>The exact position of the Argentinean EEZ is unclear, and
assuming it is right in the middle between the Falklands and the
Islas de los Estados, we will enter the Argentinean waters around
1600 GMT today. The Pacific Pintail is steering a compass course
of 240 degrees at a speed of 10.5 knots, which could bring her
as close as 30 miles from the Argentinean cost, south of the Isla
de los Estados.
     
     <P>The Argentinean House of Representatives passed a resolution
late Wednesday night urging the Executive Branch of the
Argentinean Government to ban the Pacific Pintail from the waters
under Argentinean jurisdiction. The full (translated) text of the
resolution reads:

<P>Honourable Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Nation Office of
the Secretary 72-D-95 and others Without Title
March 15, 1995, Buenos Aires 
The Chamber of Deputies of the Nation   
 
<P>DECLARES:
 
<P>1. We utterly reject the transit of the ship Pacific Pintail and
we would see it as a good measure that the Argentine government
takes all necessary steps to prohibit the entrance of this ship
transporting highly radioactive waste from plutonium, from the
French port of Cherbourg to its final destination Japan, from
Argentinean territorial sea, the exclusive economical zone and
the maritime area above the Argentine continental shelf where it
exceeds two hundred miles, in accordance with article 41 of the
National Constitution, law 24051 and the general and particular
principals of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea.
 
<P>2. The necessity that the Argentine government establishes joint
strategies with other countries from the region towards a
concerted and [word unclear] action with respect to the shipment
and in order to avoid actions such as the one which triggers this
declaration.
 
<P>3. The necessity that the Argentine government adopts necessary
measures to achieve before relevant international institutions
the closing of Cape Horn to the international shipment of
radioactive waste.
 
<P>4. A copy of this must be sent to the Embassies of both Japan and
France.
 
    <P>In the mean time, the Chilean government has also taken a
very strong position on the looming passage of the Pintail
through its waters. Chile's government has banned the shipment
from all its territorial and jurisdictional waters and has
entrusted the Navy with enforcement powers.  In passing the ban,
the Chilean Senate referred to the UN Convention of the Law of
the Sea in that maritime activities should not have a negative
impact on the protection and preservation of the marine
environment and its live resources.  The Commander-in-Chief of
the Navy, Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch has said that naval planes
and ships will start surveillance of the Pacific Pintail as soon
as the ship gets close to Chilean waters.  Greenpeace expects the
Pacific Pintail to come enter into Chilean waters around 1400 GMT
on Sunday.

     <P>The weather around Cape Horn has grown increasingly worse
over the past few days and the outlook is not much better: heavy
seas and high winds. In an urgent telex from Greenpeace's ship
Solo to the Pacific Pintail on Thursday, we informed the captain
that it is of grave concern to Greenpeace that he is attempting
to force his way through the waters of a region where his ship
and its radioactive cargo have been rejected out of safety
reasons, and both governmental and public opposition.  Neither
the Pacific Pintail nor the ship's managing company thus far have
even acknowledged having received our information.

     <P>The current transport onboard the Pacific Pintail involves
glassified high level nuclear waste generated in the course of
plutonium reprocessing in France for the Japanese. Greenpeace
calls for a world-wide ban on the production of all plutonium --
whether used for military or for civil purposes--in its campaign
to halt nuclear weapons production and proliferation.  

     <P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage
or it's cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas
Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-1301166--warning $10 per
minute), or Karen Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone:

<P><H4>CHILEAN NAVY FORBIDS PINTAIL TO ENTER 200 MILE EEZ;
PINTAIL HEADS THAT WAY ANYWAY</H4>

    <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 2300 GMT was 55
degrees and 58 minutes south and 65 degrees and 11 minutes west,
on a distance of some 20 miles east of the Chilean Exclusive
Economic Zone. We are sailing at a course of 240 degrees at a
speed of 4 knots.  We could thus reach the Chilean EEZ in
approximately 5 hours, ie. Monday morning at 0400 GMT.

     <P>Today the Chilean Navy issued a statement to the Pacific
Pintail in a radio communication, transcribed below (1).

    <P>Later today at 2242 GMT, the Chilean Navy informed
Greenpeace that they had sent the following telex message to the
Pacific Pintail by Chile's General Director for the Maritime
Territory and Merchant Marine. The text is also below (2).

     <P>The Chilean Government has taken a very strong position on
the looming passage of the Pintail into its waters. Chile's
Government has banned the shipment from all its territorial and
jurisdictional waters and has entrusted the Navy with its
enforcement.  For more information please contact Juan Carlos
Cardenas at Greenpeace Chile (++56-2-737 8140) or Damon Moglen
(++54-9-012-4550).

     <P>The weather around Cape Horn continues to worsen with waves
of 10 meters coming over the Solo's side and winds gusting off
the bow.  It's much as it was when we left France with the crew
having to strap down everything on board, including themselves
come bed time.  Cape Horn is renowned for its bad weather, drift
ice and heave seas.  The further south we and the Pintail go, the
worse the weather will be.  The captain of the Pintail is
knowingly acting irresponsibly by sailing this far south. The
Pintail may cross into the Antarctica Treat Area below 60 degrees
south, in flagrant denial of international agrement to preserve
the pristine continent from environmental threats.  

     <P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage
or it's cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas
Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-1301166--warning $10 per
minute), or Karen Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone:
++44-171-226-3151). Photo, video or other media requests to Blair
Palese or Mark Warford at Greenpeace Communications (phone:

waters, we will pass 15 miles inside Diego Ramirez and 15 miles
from the land-mass, the coast line therefore we are outside
territorial waters and we are carrying out a lawful trade, over;
<br>CN:   Sir, I understood, but one thing is that you are not
allowed to sail through our Exclusive Economic Zone, do you
understand?
<br>PP:    Yes sir, I understand but your economic zone as you know
every ship has the right of free passage and we are engaged in
freedom,free trade free trade and a legal trade and therefore we
are allowed free passage through an Economic Zone, over;
<br>CN:  Roger, but the Chilean Government have a resolution about
that you can not sail through our Economic Zone, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, well this maybe the case but these are my
instructions and I will have to refer the matter to my owners,
and possibly then to the British Government this is a very safe
ship as you know we have very bad weather and we are being very
careful with our passage safe navigation, and we feel that you
have no problem for your safety side of it, otherwise I will have
to revert with further information, over
<br>CN:   Yes, I understood, very clear, listen, but our resolution
from the Chilean Government said that you must stay 200 miles far
away from Diego Ramirez, do you understand?
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, I would like to repeat that we
will not transit your territorial seas we will not be within 12
miles of your coast line, and therefore we have freedom of
passage on the high seas, over;
<br>CN:    Yes, I would like to explain that our Economic Zone is not
high sea, is not high sea, it is our Economic Zone, and you are
not allowed to sail through this zone, over;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, I would like to dispute that, the
territorial waters are 12 miles from your coast line and on
either Diego Ramirez or the main land therefore anything outside
that which will be, will be high seas, the EEZ has nothing to do
with high seas. Any vessel on the high seas according to the
various conventions of the Safety at Seas, and the agreements of
the Law of the Sea allows us freedom of passage, over;
<br>CN:   Ok, that is very clear about that, only 12 mile is the
territory seas. But the Economic Zone is 200 miles and is not
high sea, is not high sea, is our Economic Zone and you are not
allowed ... you are not allowed to sail through our sea, over;
<br>PP:   Well at present we are in a very strong wind here, the wind
is gusting to 70 knots, that is 12 meters per second. I am not
in a position to alter course or argue. Can you tell me your
intentions, because my instructions are to carry on with a normal
route in the high seas which allows me freedom of passage,
freedom of passage, over;
<br>CN:   Yes, I would like you to change your intention. I would
like you to change your course to go outside of our 200 mile
economic zone, please;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, at the moment the wind is gusting
to maybe over 13 to 14 meters per second. We are in no position
to alter course for safety reasons. Sir, I will have to revert,
over;
<br>CN:   OK, I understood, (unintelligible).. time, your ship, it
will be tracked for this authority for this ship and plane will
like you to change your course and go outside our economic zone,
please;
<br>PP:   I am sorry the wind is blowing very strong here, and I had
a job hearing that, such is the noise. We are in a very, very
strong wind-squall, could you repeat that last message please,
over;
<br>CN:   The message is: That our plane and ship is to keep going
to tracking you from this moment from this time because you don't
want to change your course, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, that is quite acceptable, thank you, we are a safe
ship and we want to carry on a free trade, which is a legal
trade. We do not mind at all, we welcome you to escort us and we
would like freedom of passage, over;     
<br>CN:   OK, If you don't want to change your course. You are
intolerant to the international community. Cause we
(unintelligible) do is dissipation, over;
<br>PP:   Yes OK, I would like some information as to what you're
actions might be, over;
<br>CN:   Stand-by for one minute Pacific Pintail;
<br>PP   Standing-by
<HR>
<br>CN   (Calls Pacific Pintail)
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, go ahead sir,
<br>CN:  I would like to insist that if you don't change your course,
that you don't go away from our economic zone we are going report
this situation to the international community, because you don't
comply with our resolution, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, I receive that message and as such is the weather
at the moment which is as I say very bad, I can not alter course
at the moment, but I still insist that we are on the high seas
at all times, and we do not intend to pass through your country's
territorial seas. I will have to now inform my owners and they
will refer the matter to the British Government, over;
<br>CN:   Roger, Stand-by for one minute.
<HR>
<br>CN:   Pacific Pintail, this is Chilean Navy Patrol, over;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, go ahead sir,
<br>CN:  ..(unintelligible)..till this time we are going to tracking
your position every time because you don't want to change your
mind, you don't want to change the course. I hope, I hope you
change your course to don't go to sail into our economic zone,
over;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, I am sorry you were a little bit
broken, again, could you repeat that, please, over;
<br>CN:   Ok I say again, Pacific Pintail, from this time we are
going to tracking your position every time because you don't want
to change your idea, and you don't want to change your course to
sail far away from our 200 miles. I hope that you change your
course, I hope that you change your course to don't go to sail
into our economic zone, over;
<br>PP:   Yes, Ok I think I receive that I will try to repeat it back
that I understand that because we do not want to alter our
position you will track our course. We are very happy to
cooperate in any way we can with that, over;
<br>CN:   I would like to cooperate with you, but the idea of
tracking you is decide that you don't go inside of our economic
zone. The idea is not cooperate with you, it is that you change
your course, over;
<br>PP:   Ok, thank you Chilean Navy, you still insist that we pass
outside your 200 mile zone, over;
<br>CN:   Yes, please, I hope you change your course, over;
<br>PP:   I must contact my owners and the British Government for
this. At the moment we are on a safe course because we have 10
meter seas, 10 meter seas, here and I will revert, if you want
to contact us later I will tell you the message, over;
<br>CN:   Roger, have a good trip, channel 16
<br>PP:   We are going back to channel 16.

           <P><H4>PACIFIC PINTAIL STILL SAILING SOUTH;
  RADIOACTIVE WASTE SHIPMENT THREATENS ANTARCTIC PROTECTORATE</H4>
</head><body>
     <P>

     The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 58
degrees and 39 minutes south and 68 degrees and 43 minutes west.
We are sailing at a course of 200 degrees at a speed of 10.5
knots. We are currently just inside the Chilean EEZ, and 150
miles South of the Chilean Coast. The weather has fortunately
improved: wind is currently SW 4 while the swell is only about
4 meters.  A vast improvement from yesterday.

     <P>The Chilean Navy yesterday forced the Pintail to move south
on the basis of national legislation that forbids the ship
carrying radioactive waste cargo inside Chile's 200 mile
Exclusive Economic Waters. The Chilean Navy enforced this Chilean
government directive by sending a war ship which, after two hours
of heated radio exchange, turned the Pintail south.  Chile is
determined that the Cape Horn route not be used by the plutonium
industry in the future and has taken strong action along with
numerous other South American countries to prevent that.

    <P>In a statement by the Chilean Navy to the Captain of the
Pacific Pintail, a reference was made to the fact that the
Pintail with its cargo represents a violation of the 1992 Rio
Declaration for the preservation of the sea environment.

     <P>The Pacific Pintail is currently approaching the waters
surrounding the Antarctic continent.  Below a latitude of 60
degrees south lies what is known as the Antarctic Treaty Area,
established by the international community as an environmental
protectorate. In 1991, the 26 Consultative Parties agreed to and
signed a separate Protocol to the Treaty on Environmental
Protection, formally known as the Madrid Protocol.  Whilst the
Protocol does not come into force until all Consultative Parties
have ratified it, there is a loose agreement amongst Treaty
Member States to abide by the conditions of the Protocol until
it comes into force.  Article 3 of the Protocol on environmental
principles states clearly:  " Activities in the Treaty area shall
be planned and conducted .... to avoid ..... significant adverse
effects on air and water quality."   The Antarctic Treaty (1959),
(binding on its 26 Consultative or Voting Parties and on its 13
Associate Members) specifically prohibits the use or disposal of
radioactive waste material within the Antarctic Treaty Area
(ATA). 

     <P>The Pacific Pintail has been ordered by the Chilean Navy to
sail South to a latitude of 59 degrees and 35 minutes before
being allowed to set sail west for the Pacific ocean.  This
leaves the British flagged Pintail a gap of initially 65 and
later 41 miles if the ship is to steer clear from the Antarctic
Area. France, Japan and the United Kingdom are all Consultative
Members of the Antarctic Treaty. No Environmental Impact
Assessment has been conducted for this shipment which could be
seen as a serious breach of the UK's responsibilities under the
Antarctic Treaty.  The UK has ratified the Treaty but has made
ships passages exempt in their national legislation. 

     <P>Greenpeace is calling on Argentina and Chile to adopt
national legislation to prohibit the transit, sailing and stay
of plutonium and nuclear waste shipments in the waters under
their jurisdiction, and for the countries to enforce this with
a bilateral agreement.  Furthermore both countries should explore
the options to prohibit future radioactive waste and plutonium
shipments as part of the Nuclear Free Zone Treaties of Tlatelolco
and Roratonga.
 
     <P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage
or it's cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas
Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-130-1166), or Karen Richardson
at Greenpeace UK (phone: ++44-171-226-3151). Photo, video or

<P><H4>PACIFIC PINTAIL STILL IN CHILE'S EEZ; CONTINUES TO PROVOKE
CHILEAN GOVERNMENT</H4>

<P>At 1900 GMT, the Pacific Pintail sails in the Pacific Ocean and
is currently at a position of 57 degrees and 49 minutes south and
71 degrees and 25 minutes west. The Pintail is steaming at a
speed of 12.5 knots on a course of 320 degrees. The ship is
sailing at a distance of some 10 miles along the inside edge of
Chile's EEZ.

<P>This morning around 1430 GMT, the Chilean Navy checked the
whereabouts and position of the Pintail with one of its Navy
aircraft. The Chilean Navy asked the Pintail's captain how long
it would take the ship to leave Chile's EEZ.  The Chilean Navy
was subsequently informed by the Captain of the Pintail that he
was under instructions from his company to continue to violate
Chile's prohibition on his ship's passage of the EEZ for the next
48 hours.

<P>This last act of defiance of Chile's prohibition is a desperate
attempt by the British Government--which advises its owner
Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd (PNTL) on the matter--to provoke
a Chilean reaction in response.  As this could ensure passage for
future shipments of radioactive waste, plutonium and spent
nuclear fuel around the South American route.

<P>On Monday, the Chilean Navy forced the Pacific Pintail out its
jurisdictional waters and based its action to do so on the
Declaration of the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, 3-14 June 1992 (also called
the 1992 Rio Declaration). The relevant part of this declaration
deals with the protection of the sea and coastal areas and the
protection, rational use and development of its living resources
(Chapter 17). 

<P>In this chapter, states committed themselves, in accordance with
the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea, to protecting and preserving the marine environment and to
prevent, reduce and control degradation of the marine
environment. Countries thus committed themselves to apply
preventive, precautionary and anticipatory approaches to the
protection of the sea to avoid degradation of the marine
environment, as well as to reduce the risk of long-term or
irreversible adverse effects upon it.

<P>Greenpeace applauds the Chilean Government's commitment to its
responsibilities to protect the marine environment in the waters
under its jurisdiction from the possible effects of an accidental
release of highly radioactive waste. There is no doubt that an
accident with the Pacific Pintail could result in long-term and
possibly irreversible degradation of the delicate environment of
the Antarctic coasts and waters surrounding Cape Horn.

<P>Greenpeace calls on both Argentina and Chile to adopt national
legislation to prohibit the transit, sailing and stay of
plutonium and nuclear waste shipments in the waters under their
jurisdiction.  Chile and Argentina could call on the world
community of nations to support their efforts to ban these
hazardous radioactive shipments out of the dangerous waters
between their EEZ's and the Antarctic Treaty Area in order to
close the gap that currently exists.

<P>For more information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's
cargo of plutonium waste contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo (phone:
++871-1301166), or Karen Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone:
++44-171-226-3151). Photo, video or other media requests to Blair
Palese or Mark Warford at Greenpeace Communications (phone:

<P><H4>PACIFIC PINTAIL STILL IN CHILE'S EEZ - CHILEAN AIRCRAFT SUMMONS
PINTAIL TO GET OUT OF EEZ - PINTAIL REFUSES ON ADVISE OF OWNERS
AND BRITISH GOVERNMENT</H4>

<P>At 2115 GMT, the Pacific Pintail now in the Pacific Ocean and
still within Chile's 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone was
notified by a Chilean Navy aircraft that the ship should move out
of its EEZ since the weather had cleared enough to do so.  The
Pintail flatly refused and responded that on the advise of the
ship's owners and the British Government, would not alter course
to leave the Chilean EEZ.  

<P>The Chilean Navy plane then responded that the Chilean government
intends to formally complain to the British Government, and that
the Navy would track the ship with a warship and plane.  It also
stated that the Pintail could be subjected to the use of force
by the Chilean Navy to force the ship to change course.  The
Pintail's Captain is now talking to his owners/British
Government.

     <P>A transcript of the latest conversation between the Pintail
follows. 

<P>Currently (at 2130) the Pintail is in position latitude 57
degrees and 24 minutes south and longitude 077 degrees and 06
minutes west, on a course of 316 degrees with a speed of 12
knots.


<P>This morning around 1430 GMT, the Chilean Navy checked the
whereabouts and position of the Pintail with one of its Navy
aircraft. The Chilean Navy asked the Pintail's captain how long
it would take the ship to leave Chile's EEZ.  The Chilean Navy
was subsequently informed by the Captain of the Pintail that he
was under instructions from his company to continue to violate
Chile's prohibition on his ship's passage of the EEZ for the next
48 hours.

FROM:  GREENPEACE CREW OCCUPYING THE SHELL BRENT SPAR OIL
PLATFORM
DATE:  20 MAY, 1995 -- DAY 21
<P>
  <head><H4>
GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS PREPARE FOR EVICTION</H4></head><body>

<P>
Day 21 at 1600hrs on the abandoned oil rig, Brent Spar which
Shell are planning to dump into the North Sea with all 130 tonnes
of toxic sludge. We heard this afternoon that Shell's diving
support vessel, the Stadive, which is eight times the size of the
Spar and has been commissioned to pull us off the rig is about
10 miles away and we actually saw it on the horizon today.  It
looks huge, even from a distance.

<P>The Brent Spar became a flurry of activity in preparation today -
everyone getting prepared for whatever Shell may try.
<P>We hear that Shell intend to ensure that the order to eject John
Castle, the only one of us they know by name, will be served
today - we are going to peacefully resist attempts to take John
away. All is well aboard this gently swaying platform and morale
is very high.  The Moby Dick is standing by
and the fishing boat Starina left yesterday evening with a German
film crew and a journalist from the Independent.  

<P>At least we are not alone in our fight to keep Shell from dumping
the toxic-laden Brent Spar.  International opposition grows and
this is sure to be a hotly debated topic at the upcoming North
Sea Conference meeting coming up in early June.  With 400
additional rigs in the North Sea the dumping of the Brent Spar
would be a dangerous precedent to set!

<P>More later.....

<P>July 13
<P>The good news keeps flooding in: from Perth to Peru there seem
to
be demonstrations going on against the Bastille Day celebrations
(July 14).  The story I liked best was the wife of the former EU
Environment Commissioner, Mme de Ripa, disrupting a Bastille Day
function at the French embassy in Rome by climbing out onto a
balcony in her cocktail dress and high heels to wave a banner
"Stop French Testing" at the cameras below!
 <P> Former President Mitterrand has confirmed that the planned
French tests WILL be in order to develop new generation nuclear
warheads, not just to refine existing ones.  This clearly
illustrates France's betrayal of its non-proliferation
commitments; it not only committed to "exercise utmost restraint"
at the Non-Proliferation Treaty talks in April, but also vowed
the nuclear arms race was over.  
<P>Meanwhile, the New Zealand government is considering taking
France to the World Court, even though France would most likely
deny its jurisdiction.  This would be politically embarassing for
France, at the very least.  News that the NZ Government is also
prepared to send an official vessel to Moruroa accompanying a
peace flotilla of yachties is also very good news.
 
<P>Tomorrow the ship arrives in Tahiti, a peaceful contrast to the
military parades through Papeete which will make Bastille Day for
the French authorities.  Tahitians protesting at nuclear testing
will also take to the streets tomorrow, representing more of the
revolutionary spirit of the Bastille's "fraternity, equality,
liberty" than the formal ceremonies by the military.  The best
present President Chirac could give the international community
this Bastille Day would be the courage to take the decision to
give us all liberty from nuclear testing.

<P><H4><head>From:  Greenpeace Vessel SV Rainbow Warrior         
<br>Date:    Saturday 8-JUL-95 </head>
<br>Subject: Diary Update</H4><body>
 <P>Hi Everyone,
 
           <P>With the time now so close, and with the crew dealing 
with the fine details of last minute preparations, I'll just take 
a moment to pass on some of our reflections on the coming event.
 
   <P>This campaign is about so much more than the iummeadiate issue 
of the French government wanting to test eight nuclear bombs. 
This issue ranges right from the local to the global, and on to 
the entire question of the direction of human development: our 
relationships to one another, and our relationship to other forms 
of life and the world in which we all live. It is also of course 
an historic campaign for us, the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior 
notwithstanding, and pivotal in helping us express  our vision of 
the future.

  <P>On the local issue, we have the immeadiate effects of letting 
off nuclear explosions on a small island, and on the people - and 
other life - who live on the surrounding islands. Going to a 
wider frame, we see that the people of French Polynesia are very 
much in a majority in their opposition to these tests in there 
country. This is an issue of Democracy, and the power of a few to 
dictate their will over the many - particularly galling in the 
case of a country such as France that projects itsewlf to the 
world as democratic. Closely associated to this aspect is the 
pain of all the people in the Pacific - in Australia, Kiribati, 
and particularly the Marshall Islands - as well as French 
Polynesia who have suffered from nuclear weapons tests. Many of 
these people, and there descendants, are today still suffering terribly 
from tests that took place thirty and forty years ago - usually 
in obscure places that, even if the western world does look, it 
does not want to look too closely for fear of the extreme  moral 
contradictions that will be exposed. Nuclear war and 
international power politics were not a part of these victims 
lives ( at least not untill the military arrived).
 
  <P>Then globally: if the French resume nuclear testing it seems 
certain that the USA, UK and Russia will be at it again before 
the year is out, their protestations of good faith regarding the 
NPT and a CTBT as meaningless as the French pronouncements. If 
the genie climbs back out of the bottle that it has been so 
nearly squeezed back into - inspite of the arrogance of the 
Chinese - there wont be just the big five nuclear powers by the 
year 2000. The writing is clearly on the wall in that regard.
  
   <P>So, we find ourselves at an historic opportunity in the 
course of human development. On the one side, a mass of millions 
upon millions of people around the world who utterly reject large 
scale war as a means for socities to resolve their differences; 
on the other, a tchnologically advanced, yet developmentally 
paralysed clique of powerful, meglomanic elites for whom he (and 
I see few shes involved) who weilds the biggest stick gets the 
biggest slice of cake - even if the cake is destroyed in the 
fight! At this moment in time humanity has a chance to make 
serious advances on the questions of the way we relate to one 
anothere as human beings, and also to other forms of life. A step 
that I believe the future will show to be as significant as the 
invention of the wheel.

   <P>The focus of all this is a tiny island in the South Pacific, 
and an old ship with a crew of many nations, swept along by the 
power of millions. For us on the ship the support we have 
recieved from around the world is truely extrodinary, yet 
significant as to the collosal strength of our mission. We all 
understand the power of what is happening here. The crew is very, 
very positive about this action, and we hope it will greatly help 
the huge campaign all the offices have mounted. The crew has 
worked hard to prepare the ship, and we feel our work will be 
well rewarded. I am sure it will. All of us, together, are 
asserting the right to peacefully protest injustice, to fight for 
a better future, and use the power of that future to change the 
present.
   <P>So, here we go - hang on to your seats folks.....
<P>Alice on board the Rainbow Warrior

<h3>Chronology of events surrounding boarding of Rainbow Warrioir</h3>

<p>
(In local time, French Polynesia ie 12 hours behind Central
European time)
 
<p> 
 
<B>Saturday July 8  </B><P><B>15:30    </B> Rainbow Warrior rendezvous with Vega; crew transfer
          Inflatable with David McTaggart on board leaves Rainbow
          Warrior
          Radio contact made with Bifrost

<P><B>Sunday July 9 </B><P>
<B>02:00 </B>     Launch two inflatables in darkness from the Rainbow
          Warrior
          Three warships tail Rainbow Warrior
<P><B>03:30  </B>    Launch second pair of inflatables in darkness from the
          Rainbow Warrior
          French warships begin chase of inflatables
<P><B>04:00  </B>    Helicopter search for inflatables begins          
<P><B>05:00</B>      Rainbow Warrior and four inflatables cross into 12 mile
          exclusion zone around Moruroa atoll.  It is tracked by
          two patrol vessels and a frigate.                 
          French warship Vendemiaire warns Rainbow Warrior that
          it is prepared to use force to take control of the
          vessel
<P><B>06:15</B>      Julien Prieur aboard Greenpeace inflatable radioes
          Rainbow Warrior to say he is in the lagoon.  All three
          inflatables reach the drilling rig in the lagoon and
          two activists lock themselves to the rig.
<P><B>06:30 </B>     Commandos in inflatables storm the Rainbow Warrior as
          it enters the main channel into the pass at Moruroa. 
<P><B>06:35  </B>    Commandos break the window on bridge of the Rainbow
          Warrior and throw tear gas into the bridge.  Skipper
          David Enever stops the engines and all crew head for
          lower deck. The Rainbow Warrior is rammed by a French
          tug ripping a hole above water level on the starboard
          side of the bow and twisting antennae.
<P><B>06:40 </B>     Crew exit the lower accommodation onto the main deck,
          driven out by tear gas. Commandos enter the lower deck
          and take an axe to the door of the radio room.
<P><B>06;50</B>      A canister of tear gas is released into the radio room
          via the split made in the radio room door. Choking for
          breath, radio officer Thom Looney and campaigner
          Stephanie Mills exit the radio room via its porthole
          and clamber on to upper deck.  French campaigner Jean-
          Luc Thierry leans halfway out the porthole and
          continues to talk to French media via satellite phone
          until commandos enter the room.
<P><B>07:00</B>     Two Greenpeace activists are removed from the drilling
          rig by French commandos.  All four inflatable crews are
          taken to Moruroa.
          Journalists aboard the Rainbow Warrior, Oscar Temaru,
          Monseigneur Jacques Gaillot and Pastor Temarama are
          taken aboard a French military vessel and transported
          to Moruroa atoll. 
          Commandos and maritime police take over control of the
          Rainbow Warrior and a tow line is attached to a tug.
<P><B>09:30 </B>     The Rainbow Warrior crew demand that the inflatable
          crew are allowed to re-join the ship.
<P><B>10:0 </B>     Gendarmerie maritime (maritime police) demand to
          interrogate the women crew members on board the Rainbow
          Warrior individually.  The captain and crew refuse to 
          do this and demand access to a lawyer.  The French
          authorities back down.
<P><B>10:05 </B>     The Rainbow Warrior is towed into the Moruroa lagoon
          and moored onto a buoy inside the entrance to the
          lagoon.  Skipper Dave Enever continues to refuse to
          leave the ship until all his crew are returned to it.
          Meanwhile, interrogation of inflatable crew by the
          maritime  police is going on Moruroa atoll. The crew
          refuse to give their identities, merely saying their
          name is "Fernando Pereira", the photographer killed
          during the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985.  The
          inflatable crew non-violently resist the orders of the
          maritime police, who use French foreign legionnaires 
          to carry their limp bodies from interrogation room to
          holding rooms.  
<P><B>13:00</B>      The crew of the Rainbow Warrior, still refusing to
          leave their ship until the other crew are returned and
          an assessment of damage to the ship is done, is told 
          by the French authorities that they will forcibly be
          removed from the ship.  A party of French foreign
          legionnaires board the ship and force the crew, some 
          of whom resisting non-violently by going limp, onto a
          transport vessel.  The French authorities force David
          Enever, the skipper, to remain on the Rainbow Warrior.
<P><B>14:00 </B>     The Rainbow Warrior crew are disembarked at Moruroa and
          taken to a holding room pending interrogation.  They
          demand to see their captain and the rest of the crew. 
          They are interrogated individually, fingerprinted and
          photographed.  The French military refuse to tell them
          whether they are under arrest or not, and refuse access
          to lawyers.  In spite of French propaganda that the
          crew are free to walk around the atoll, they are in
          fact under guard at all times by French foreign
          legionnaires who physically manhandle them to prevent
          them walking away from the holding rooms.
<P><B>20:00</B>      After protracted negotiations between the skipper, Dave
          Enever and French authorities, French foreign
          legionnaires take half the crew to the dock at Moruroa
          and tell them to board a transport vessel back to the
          Rainbow Warrior.  The crew refuse to do anything until
          their captain and rest of crew arrive, and sit down on
          the dock.  Journalists waiting on the dock are forcibly
          prevented from asking questions of the crew by military
          personnel who place their hands over the mouths of
          reporters and put a human barricade of foreign
          legionnaires between the crew and media.  A truckload
          more of foreign legionnaires arrive to guard the crew.
<P><B>21:00</B>      The rest of the crew and then finally Greenpeace France
          campaigner Jean-Luc Thierry and skipper Dave Enever
          arrive at the dock.  Negotiations continue: Dave Enever
          refuses to return to the Rainbow Warrior without the
          vessel's inflatables and safety equipment such as hand-
          held navigational equipment and radiation protection
          gear being returned to the ship.
<P><B>22:30</B>      The French authorities refuse to return the ship's
          equipment except for one inflatable. They announce that
          they will tow the ship into international waters and
          demand that Greenpeace pledge not to return to the test
          site.  Skipper David Enever repeats Greenpeace's
          demands for the return of the equipment and says that
          as long as France prepares for nuclear tests at the
          atoll, Greenpeace will be prepared to come back.
<P><B>22:45</B>      Greenpeace crew sit on the dock, fearing use of force
          by the French authorities.  Around 100 French foreign
          legionnaires encircle the crew and bodily lift them
          into a transport vessel.  The crew are taken back to
          the ship and begin the clean-up of the ship.
<P><B>23:45  </B>    The Rainbow Warrior is towed by a tug toward
          international waters.  The ship remains under the
          control of French foreign legion and commandos but
          communications links are re-established.

<P><B>Monday July 10</B>
<P><B>02:00</B>      French commandos and foreign legion leave the ship.  
          It stays in international waters, under the watchful 
          eye of at least four French warships.
<P><B>09:00 </B>    Rainbow Warrior crew assess damage to the ship.  Broken
          windows on the bridge have been repaired but will
          require further strengthening.  The twisted antennae
          are lashed up and the hole in the bow requires further
          work but does not prevent the ship from being
          seaworthy.
<P><B>11:00</B>     The Rainbow Warrior makes radio contact with the Vega
          and Bifrost and agrees to rendezvous with the two
          vessels north of Moruroa at 1530 hours.
<P><B>15:30 </B>     The Viking model ship Bifrost, Vega and Rainbow Warrior
          meet 30 miles north of Moruroa to discuss further
          protest plans and to celebrate the birthday of Steve
          Sawyer with a barbecue on board the Rainbow Warrior.

<head><title>Greenpeace /recent media coverage14th September</title></head><body>

<br><br>
<H4>
  
<br>Date:Thursday 14th September 1995
 
 

<br>To:    all our supporters out there in cyberspace
<br>From:  Greenpeace anti nuclear campaigners everywhere</H4>

<P>There have been some strong criticisms of Greenpeace's Moruroa
campaign in the media today.<br> 

We would like you to know:<br>

<li>  We entirely support the actions of our team on the boats in
Moruroa.  As all of you know they did a great job under extremely
difficult circumstances.  Out there, on the exclusion zone
surrounding Moruroa, the Rainbow Warrior and the MV Greenpeace
did what they could to challenge the tests.  Ultimately,
Greenpeace leaves the final decisions of an action to our people
on the boats -- they are there, where the action is, and it's
their decision as to what they do.  They are the ones taking the
risks -- and we all know what risks they took to try to stop the
tests.<br> 

<li> The MV Greenpeace and Rainbow Warrior are now being held, with
no legal basis, by the French Military at Hao Atoll.  Greenpeace
is challenging the initial boarding of the Greenpeace in
International waters -- we are taking that case to the French
courts.  The damage to both boats and their incarceration is
completely illegal (just as the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior
in 1985 was illegal).  We are calling for the immediate release
of these boats.<A HREF="event01.html"> We ask you to do the same!</a> <br>

<li> It is clear that the French Military wanted both our vessels
out of the way before they carried out their first nuclear test. 
Whether they would have boarded and seized the MV Greenpeace if
a helicopter had not been launched is something we will never
know.  But now that they have them, the campaign is not over! Far
from it.<br> 

<li>  Greenpeace's campaign against French testing is only part of
a huge international campaign to stop Jacques Chirac from
continuing with the madness of his nuclear warfare programme.<br>  

<li>- the New Zealand Government is taking France to the
International Court of Justice to try to stop them from testing. 
Other governments:  Western Samoa, Solomon Islands, Marshall
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia and Australia, have
signed onto the court case with New Zealand.<br> 

<li>- the European foreign Ministers meeting at the weekend strongly
criticised the French nuclear testing programme.<br> 

<li>- The European Commission is sending a scientific mission to the
South Pacific and has demanded that France does not test until
the findings of this mission have been reported.  They are taking
this action under the terms of the 1957 Euratom Treaty.<br>

<li>-  South Pacific leaders have today strongly criticised French
testing.<br> 

<p> The campaign has grown to be a global one and
millions of people are united against French tests. Greenpeace
will continue to campaign strongly and we thank all those people
who signed on to the Greenpeace petition against French testing. 
As you may know, we tried to deliver these petitions to Jacques
Chirac at the Elysee Palace -- but they refused to take them and
actually arrested 100 peaceful protestors trying to deliver them! 
The French Government clearly doesn't want to listen to the
world's opinion against testing.<br> 

<li> The question of whether our boats did the right or the wrong
thing is something that Greenpeace will look at much later --
after we have finished our campaign.  Some people within
Greenpeace have criticised our actions through the press. 
Greenpeace is full of people with strong opinions (which is not
exactly surprising!).  But we always carry out an evaluation
after a campaign is over -- and that is where all of this will
be sorted out.  BUT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS NOT FINISHED!! Nowhere near
it.  

<P>KEEP UP YOUR PROTEST; WE'LL KEEP UP OURS AND TOGETHER WE'LL STOP
THIS NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE! </body></html>

<head><title>8th September 1995</title></head><body><h4>8th September 1995</h4>

<P>0330 Paris time          I decide its time we got some results
out of the gendarmes, so start to hassle them about getting a
lawyer, access to our consuls and a phone call as soon as we
arrive.  Also, that we don't want to get off the plane until we
know what is happening to us.  They keep insisting they know
nothing.

<P>0445 Paris time           We land at Le Bourget after a steep but
long descent through bumpy air.  It's dark, rainy and looks
chilly outside; they say its 12 degrees.  We taxi into the
military part of the airport. Out the window, it looks like the
final scene from Casablanca. A large crew of gendarmes, flashing
lights etc are waiting for us at the bottom of the stairs. A set
of plainclothes senior police and some uniformed gendarmes come
on board.  I refuse to leave without some warmer clothes and the
promise of a phone call.  I get some boots and my swandri, but no
phone call.  I shake hands with the gendarmes who have
accompanied us -- all but one accept to shake my hand -- but they
look glad to see the back of me.  A tough looking commando type
grabs my shoulder and takes my down the steps, me shrugging him
off.  We are bundled into two white vans with blue lights and
sirens, and ferried across through the damp to a police or
immigration office on the side of the airport.

<P>0530:          Derek is put in one office, me in another. I
demand a phone call and refuse to comprehend French.  They seem
to have only one translator, so eventually they give up on me in
frustration and go to process Derek, as I keep saying I won't
cooeprate or tell them where I want to be expelled to until I can
make a phone call.  I have two police officers guarding me,
rather casually.  Suddenly, I see a pale and rather ghostly face
peering through the dark at me at the window.  It seems to be
calling my name.  I don't register immediately what is going on,
but instinctively make a dash for the window.  Pulling it open, I
see through the wire covering the window Penelope and Remi.  It
feels AMAZING.  They're shouting at me - We love you, how are
you... I shout back - is the lawyer there -- yes he is.  The two
police officers grab me and holding on to the wire over the
windows only gives me an extra second or two.  They are clearly
pissed off, and go tell their superior officer.  I keep trying to
continue our shouted conversation with Remi through the window.
The senior officer is not amused -- tells me he doesn't care for
my attitude.  They take me through to a back office and tell me I
can't use the phone until after I tell them where I want to go
and after I have been notified formally of  my expulsion.

<P>The back office is the boss's office: it's very black, with a
cabinet full of a strange collection of knick knacks -- monkeys
in the "see no evil, hear no evil" pose; a plastic biro with
Hotel Cococabana on it (some police officer's junket?); wooden
animals from Africa, police badges and mementos.  On the wall is
a copy of the Charter of human rights and of the citizen, which I
ask to read.  I go swiftly through to Article 7, which bans the
arbitrary use of state force and condemns those who use the law
incorrectly and arbitrarily: "Those who solicit, expedite or have
executed arbitrary orders must be punished...".  
<P>While I'm moving around the room, I hear more knocking on the
window -- its Penelope again, this time with a photographer in
tow.  I make a dash for the window, but the two officers grab me
fast and threaten me with handcuffs if I do it again.  Remi
shouts out that I should go to Amsterdam, and that Michael sends
his love. A few minutes later, he urges me to show my face again. 
This time I make a determined effort for the window and manage to
stay there for 30 seconds or so, gripping on to the curtain and
the woman officer pulls me back by my hair, and the male officer
by my arms.  They dump me on the floor and then make me sit up
against the wall.  Finally the senior officer comes in again.  He
pleads with me: if I am quiet, tranquil, he will allow me to see
my lawyer once I have been notifed of my expulsion order. I say I
want the lawyer and a translator, as I don't think the lawyer
speaks much English -- basically hoping that this means either
Penelope or Remi can come in with him.

<P>The gendarmes finally do read me my official exclusion order:
immediate expulsion from metropolitan France because I pose a
serious threat to public order, the security of the State and
public safety.  I can challenge it (and will do!) through a
Tribunal in Paris.  I refuse to sign it.

<P>Finally, the lawyer and Remi come in. Remi has a tape recorder
and asks me for a few words and brings me up to date on what has
happened.  With the assistance of some information from the NZ
authorities, they had found out we would be arriving at Le
Bourget, and have turned up with half the Paris media corps
trailing them.  The lawyer says he will immediately challenge the
expulsion order, and takes the copy of the order.  They briefly
say hello to Philip, Derek and Peter;  Peter is being flown to
Switzerland, while Derek and Peter are both going straight back
to New Zealand.  I'm not envious of them facing another 24 hour
flight.

<P>0720      They have finally finished with us, so they bundle us
back into the vans and set off for Roissy (Charles de Gaulle
airport) where we will be flown out. With flashing lights and
sirens we tear through the traffic and through red lights.  Half
way, we pull over, having lost the back van -- and they have
forgotten to put a radio for communication in their van.  They
catch up, and we swing on out to the airport.  Escorted by
gendarmes and with some inquisitive stares from the travelling
public, we get taken into an immigration office to wait for the
arrival of a NZ embassy official, Nick Hurley.  He is sympathetic
but can't offer much assistance, as we have already been able to
get a lawyer. We explain why we believe our detention to be
illegal.  Just before 9am, the gendarmes return and hussle us out
to our respective flights. We say goodbye, and I get taken by car
to the KLM flight to Amsterdam.  I'm exhausted by now, just about
asleep on my feet, but still manage to have a good argument with
the officer escorting me about why French testing is such a bad
idea.  I run out of French and out of steam just as the flight is
announced.  It's bliss to sink into a business class seat,
courtesy of the French state, and relax into a stupour.

<title>Mercury contamination in the Amazon</title>
</head>

<body>
 
<h2>Quicksilver for Gold</h2>
<h3>The poisoning of the Amazon</h3>

<p> 
Mercury has been used in gold mining in Brazil since gold was
first discovered in the Amazon basin in the 18th century. In the
last ten years, between 1-2,000 tons of this highly poisonous
liquid metal have been released into the Amazon Basin.
<p> 
Mercury levels are increasing as more gold is mined. For every
kilo of gold produced, four times that amount of mercury is
released into the environment. Concern over the contamination of
the Amazon river and of local populations is escalating with
hundreds of thousands of people living in the region thought to
be at risk.
<p> 
Scientists have referred to the presence of such high levels as
a "chemical time bomb"; levels of poisoning that are likely to
appear in the Amazon may eclipse Bhopal or any comparable case
of industrial poisoning.
<p> 
The current gold rush started as a result of rapid increases in
the price of gold in 1979, and the goldfields are now reported
to involve over one million miners or 'garimpeiros'. It shows no
sign of abating. 
 
<h3>International trade</h3>
 
All the mercury used in Brazil is imported. Historically, up to
90 per cent of mercury imported into Brazil came from Mexico, but
in the last decade there has been a significant increase in
imports from Holland, Germany and the United Kingdom. 
<p> 
The metallic mercury is not produced in any of these countries,
but rather, these are the countries where exporting companies
have their headquarters. Mercury used in Brazil is produced in
Spain, Italy, the United States and Mexico.
<p>
The majority of mercury imported into Brazil is resold by
wholesalers to the goldmining sector, without any government
control. It is usually sold in packaging indicating its use for
dentistry.
<p> 
<h3>The mercury connection</h3>
 
Metallic mercury is used as an amalgam to separate particles of
gold from river sediment. During the simple process of adding
liquid mercury to filtered sediment, some of this highly toxic
substance escapes directly into the water and soils. Š<p> 
Mercury in the amalgam is later burnt off, releasing a toxic
white vapour and leaving near-pure gold ore. About three quarters
of the mercury used in goldmining is released into the
atmosphere, where it is absorbed by plants and soils in
contaminated rain. 
<p> 
Between 40 and 200 tons of gold is produced each year from the
Amazon using mercury amalgam techniques. Alternatively, gold is
excavated from rock, as seen in the dramatic photographs taken
by world-famous photographer, Sebastiao Salgado of the mine at
Serra Pelado, in the state of Para. 
<p> 
<h3>The risks</h3>
 
Metallic mercury escapes into the rivers where it is transformed
into the highly toxic and persistent methyl mercury which builds
up in the food chain, ultimately accumulating in high
concentrations in fish; the staple diet of local people. 
<p> 
The goldmining activities themselves also dramatically change the
river environment; as the sediment is disturbed clear waterways
turn to rivers of opaque golden brown. However, the ecological
effects of this stark alteration of the river environment have
been poorly studied. 
<p> 
Added to the accumulated contamination of the Amazon ecosystem
(both aquatic and aerial), is the serious risk posed to the
health of hundreds of thousands of people living in the region.
People are exposed to mercury both directly in mining operations
and indirectly as it moves through the environment into the human
food supply.
<p> 
Mercury vapour is inhaled as it is released when the mercury/gold
amalgam is burnt in open air containers. The elderly, children
and pregnant women, whose health is more vulnerable, are
particularly at risk.
<p> 
<h3>The reality</h3>
 
Levels of mercury found among people in goldmining areas are high
enough to produce clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning. In its
most advanced form mercury poisoning can result in birth defects,
brain damage and death. Less severe poisoning may result in
tunnel vision, instability and neurological disorders.  
<p> 
Recent surveys in the goldmining town of Itaituba, which has the
largest concentration of gold traders in the Brazilian Amazon,
show that up to 37 per cent of miners have excessive levels of
mercury in their blood. Itaituba is in the Tapajos valley, the
largest of nine major goldmining regions in the Amazon Basin.  
<p> 
Distance from mining operations is little protection as mercury
moves widely through the environment. Blood and urine samples
taken from individuals in the fishing village of Jacareacanga,Š100km from the nearest mining camp, had significantly elevated
levels of mercury, with 16 per cent showing exceedingly high
levels in their bodies. Kayapo children have also been found to
have average blood levels more than twice the acceptable upper
limits.
<p> 
Other samples show dangerously high levels of mercury in
floordust in gold workshops in Itaituba which are a major source
of atmospheric mercury and human exposure.
<p> 
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
 
The simplicity of the mercury amalgam process has made equally
user-friendly alternative technologies difficult to find. Other
amalgam agents such as arsenic are just as toxic and in order to
be adopted, alternatives must be cheap, simple and easy to use.
<p> 
Current research is focusing on developing simple methods of
reducing occupational exposure to mercury vapour, by using
filters or fume cupboards. Although there is no practical
alternative to the use of mercury itself, the garimpo method of
extraction can be conducted without mercury. But this requires
more skill and any miners not using mercury are generally
regarded as eccentric's by their peers.
<p> 
In addition, the use of "retorts" (simple enclosed cooking
vessels) in place of open pans in the amalgam process can reduce
atmospheric emissions by up to 99 per cent. But the use of
retorts is rare among gold mining communities who are still
largely ignorant of the dangers and have little concern for the
environmental impact of their work.
<p> 
Since Brazil relies entirely on imports for its mercury supplies,
the control of these imports is put forward as one answer to the
problem. 
 
<h2>Greenpeace demands</h2> 
 
<ul>
<li> A complete ban on the use of mercury in the environment.

<li> In the short-term, Greenpeace is calling for increased
regulation and restriction in the use of mercury in the Amazon
environment as a first step towards a ban on the use of this
highly toxic metal.
 
<li> Research into workable and environmentally-friendly
alternatives to the use of mercury in goldmining activities. 
 
<li> Support and education for the goldminers in finding alternative
activities which do not pose a threat to the Amazon ecosystem.

<title>Forests threatened by Mahogany export</title>

<H1>Mahogany for Export</H1>

<a><IMG SRC="s_brasil.gif"ALT=IMAGE.</a>

</head><body>
 
<h3>The mahogany trade</h3>
<h3>A threat to the future of the Amazon forest</h3>
<p> 
Mahogany, or "green gold", is the most valuable Amazon timber on
the international market. Up to US$850 is paid per cubic metre. 
Loggers will travel hundreds of miles through dense forest, in
search of this wood, cutting roads to gain easy access to
previously untouched wilderness. 
<p> 
Already in Brazil, an area of forest the size of Germany has been
cleared; as a result of cattle ranching and agricultural
activities, but also indirectly as loggers open up new areas of
forest. The uncontrolled exploration of mahogany over large areas
of the Amazon forest is typical of the unregulated exploitation
which dominates the economy of the Amazon region. 
<p> 
<h3>History in perspective</h3>
 
Until the 70s the logging industry in Brazil exploited the more
accessible forest along the Atlantic coast. The Atlantic forests
were closer to the big consumer centres and more easily logged. 
<p> 
But as these forests were exhausted, the logging industry was
forced to look elsewhere. New roads had made the "upland land"
forests more accessible and by 1989 the North of Brazil was
responsible for 70 per cent of the national wood production. 
<p> 
The uncontrolled cutting of mahogany by colonisers for luxury
consumer goods in Europe had led to its almost total extinction
in Central America. As a result, the international trade moved
to the Amazonian South; the last region where the species could
be found in its native condition. The largest remaining stocks
of mahogany are now found in Brazil and Bolivia. 
<p> 
<h3>The mahogany belt</h3>
<p> 
In Brazil, mahogany trees are found in over 1.5 million square
kilometres of Amazon forest. But the wood is commercially
accessible in only 8,000 square kilometres; in the states of
Acre, South Para, parts of Rondonia, Amazonas and Mato Grosso. 
<p> 
This "mahogany belt" corresponds with large concentrations of
native lands and nature reserves. About 90 indigenous groups live
within the mahogany belt and tribes such as the Nimbekwara and
Uru Eu Wau Wau in Rondonia are constantly invaded by loggers in
search of this valuable wood. 
<p> 
<h3>Ecological and social devastation</h3>
 
Investigations show that at least 3,100,000 cubic metres of
mahogany were removed from the Amazon forest between 1971 and
1990. The direct impact of this exploitation can be estimated
based on studies which show that for every mahogany tree
extracted, 27 other trees are damaged and 1,450 square kilometres
of forest are destroyed.  
<p> 
Alongside its direct impact on the forest by opening up
previously inaccessible areas, the logging industry acts as a
powerful catalyst of forest destruction. The building of new
roads in unexplored frontiers - driven mainly by the search for
mahogany - opens up the forest to farmers and ranchers who clear
the land. 
<p> 
More than 3,000 kilometres of illegal roads have been built in
the south of Para in search of sparsely distributed mahogany
trees. The unplanned and chaotic development of these roads
wreaks havoc on the forest ecosystem. The sale of wood has become
an important source of income to owners of the big cattle ranches
selling timber felled on their land.
<p> 
One of the most dramatic impacts of the mahogany industry is the
illegal and uncontrolled invasion of protected and Indian land.
Although the commercial exploration of these areas is prevented
under the Brazilian Constitution, as commercial stocks of
mahogany become more difficult to find, the invasion of these
areas increases. Tribes who have made agreements with the loggers
typically suffer social problems and conflict within their
traditional groups. Much of the mahogany exported from Brazil is
now illegally cut.
<p> 
But the loggers' abuse of the system has more than just social
and ecological implications. Studies on logging companies in the
states of Acre and Para, found that up to 95 per cent discrepancy
existed between the amount of timber timber declared by the
companies and the tax collected by government officials from
these companies. Furthermore, corruption within Brazilian
Government agencies responsible for controlling the industry are
rife.
<p> 
<h3>Power in the hands of a few</h3>
 
Profits from the mahogany industry in Brazil are shared between
a small group of logging companies. In the State of Para most of
the mahogany logging operations are run by only 23 sawmills. Most
of these are owned by businessmen who have moved north as the
coastal forests became exhausted. The export trade is controlled
by an equally select number of agencies, generating a
correspondingly small number of jobs. Any advantages or benefits
incurred by the trade are easily overwhelmed by the social and
ecological destruction wrought by this high profit industry.
<p> 
The mahogany trade contributes little economic wealth to the
region since 70 per cent of the wood is exported, mostly as
sawnwood. The United States and the United Kingdom are the two
principal consumers.  In Brazil, the remaining mahogany is sold
in the wealthy coastal towns and increasingly in Sao Paulo and
Rio de Janeiro. Mahogany is used in the production of a variety
of products from doors and windows, to furniture and toilet
seats.
<p> 

<h2>Greenpeace demands</h2>
 
Greenpeace is calling on the Brazilian Government to halt this
unsustainable "development" and focus its efforts on
ecologically-sound economic options alongside policies of land
reform which will ensure a long-term future and integrity of the
Amazon forest.

<ul> 
<li> The Brazilian government must prohibit any further felling of
mahogany in the Amazon region until the extent of the damage so
far has been assessed and appropriate measures have been taken
to bring the industry under control.
<li> The building of all illegal roads into untouched forest must
be stopped.
<li> The illegal exploitation of mahogany in biological, extractive
and native lands must be stopped; furthermore economic
alternatives for these communities must be investigated.
<li> All unsustainable logging of mahogany in areas where the
survival of this species is under threat must be stopped.
<li> A serious and consistent policy must be adopted by the
Brazilian government to prevent the uncontrolled and
unsustainable felling of all timber in the Amazon region; the
policy should aim to regulate the industry, identify restricted
areas where timber can be felled and define precise technical
conditions under which exploitation can take place.
</ul>

<title>MV Greenpeace in the Antarctic</title>

<h1>M/V GREENPEACE,  20 February 1995</h1>
<p>
The
<a href="mvgp2.gif"><img src="mvgp2i.gif" alt="(ship) ">
MV Greenpeace (225KB GIF</a> or <a href="mvgp2.jpg">86KB JPG)</a>
 is currently campaigning in the Southern Ocean
Whale Sanctuary against the whaling that is happening in these
waters.  The ship departed Ushuaia, Argentina at the end of last
year and has been doing research in Antarctic waters for the
last 1 1/2 months, including whale identification and recording 
of their underwater sounds, such as this
<a href="orca1.wav">orca song (389KB WAV)</a> or 
<a href="ftp://www.greenpeace.org/pub/realaudio/orca1.ra"> (35KB RealAudio)</a>

, debris survey, photosynthesis 
analysis, as well as having conducted a series of base visits in 
the Antarctic Penisula region.  Currently the M/V Greenpeace is 
in the Ross Sea area, where on the 9th of February it encoutered 
the Japanese whaling fleet that is here to kill 330 minke whales 
in the name of 'science'.  Co-incidentally these same whales are 
to end up on the food markets at prices up to US$680.00 per kilo.
</p><p>
The M/V GREENPEACE, built in 1959, started life as an ocean-
going tug and salvage vessel, then known as the ELBE.  In 1977, 
she changed ownership to serve as a pilot vessel to the 
Association of Maryland Pilots, in the USA.  In 1985, the Pilot 
Association gave the ship to Greenpeace as they had become shore-
based and no longer needed the ship.  The GREENPEACE was then 
refitted to make it fit for the upcoming Antarctic expeditions, 
strengthening the hull, preparing cargo space, and installing 
sophisticated communications and navigational aids. A year later 
a helicopter pad was also added.  The 905T (gross) ship has an 
overall length of 58 metres, breadth of 11,22 metres, and has a 
draught of 4,45 metres.  With two 1390 h.p. Smit M.A.N. diesels 
it cruises at a speed of 10kts, a maximum of 14kts.  There are 32 
berths onboard, although currently there are only 27 people 
onboard.
</p><p>
The vessel in its time for Greenpeace has been to the Antarctic 
waters on several occasions, also it has travelled as far as the 
Arctic, the Pacific islands, to the Arabian Gulf, around Indonesia 
and Eastern Asia, all around North & South America, including 
just recently a voyage up the Amazon river.

or <a href="0214nm1.jpg">60KB JPG</a> <b>Nisshin Maru</b> is the Mother ship to a fleet of three
catchers, from where all operations are controlled, whilst the
Japanese whaling fleet is in the Antarctic waters.  This fleet is
hunting 330 Minke whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary,
under program of so-called 'scientific research'-- although this
same fleet is the main supplier of whale meat to the exclusive
restaurant markets, where whale meat is sold at prices up to 
US$680.00 per kilo.
<p>
This 6095T (Deadweight) vessel, formerly named Chikushi Maru, is 
a converted fish factory stern trawler built in 1987.  It was 
rebuilt for whaling factory purposes in 1991, to replace the 
former Nisshin Maru No.3.  It cruises at a speed of 14.3kts, and 
has a top speed of 17.5kts.  It runs on a B&W 12L35MCE 12 cyl 2 
stroke engine which gives 7,320 (PS)(6220 b.h.p.).  The overall 
length is 127.92m, breadth of 19.41m and a max. draught of 7.21m.
<p>
Greenpeace protests the presence of the Nisshin Maru in the 
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, which was established by the IWC 
in May of last year, and came into effect in December.  
Greenpeace encourages anybody and everybody to state their own 
protest to the Japanese Government through your local Japanese 
Embassy/Consul, and also to the whaling fleet directly.

<P>On 23rd of February, after weeks of campaigning to stop highly radioactive waste from being shipped from France to Japan,

Greenpeace launched an all-out effort to prevent the transport ship from being loaded for departure.  The nuclear waste had been transported by truck

via the public highway system from the reprocessing facility at Cap La Hague and was being prepared for loading onto the transport vessel Pacific Pintail.

<P>Greenpeace held several press conferences prior to the departure of the radioactive waste ship to release information, raise concern about safety and liability and to announce plans to track the shipment with the Greenpeace vessel MV Solo.

<P>Greenpeace joined dozens of local French citizens in protesting the import, reprocessing, storage and disposal of nuclear waste in their community.  Together they built a monument representing the nuclear waste left behind in France as part of this dea
dly plutonium trade.

<P>At 3:15 AM on the 23rd, Greenpeace activists on board the Moby Dick, and four inflatable boats, moved to the docking area of the port of Cherbourg and placed themselves between it and the "Pacific Pintail" moving in to receive its dangerous cargo.  For
 30 minutes the Moby Dick and its inflatables delayed the docking of the freighter and prevented the plutonium waste from being placed on board.

<P>The protest ended when a French military tug-boat rammed Greenpeace's vessel Moby Dick, and French naval commandos boarded the vessel, cut its anchor line and towed the ship out of Cherbourg harbour.  The Greenpeace inflatable boats

were seized and removed from the area by commandos.  Ten protestors were arrested, one injured and four left on the Moby Dick which was tethered to a buoy outside Cherbourg  harbour.

<P>The Pacific Pintail, operated by Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. (PNTL) of the UK, arrived in Cherbourg under cover of darkness to load its cargo of some 14 tonnes of plutonium waste.  The first shipment contains 28 glassified blocks of highly radioacti
ve nuclear waste in one large packing container.  The material is so intensely radioactive that a person standing near a single unshielded glass block would receive a lethal dose of radiation in less than 60 seconds.

<P>Greenpeace crew were waiting on board a second vessel, the "Solo" , and met the "Pintail" after it left Cherbourg harbour.  They continue to track the shipment to alert countries along the route of the potential danger.



<P>Despite legal efforts to stop Greenpeace from tracking this shipment of nuclear waste, Greenpeace will continue to shadow the vessel for as long as is possible en route to Japan.



<P>"This shipment is dangerous, and Greenpeace has an obligation to alert the public about the dangers and its route and to demand an end to the plutonium economy worldwide," said Greenpeace's Damon Moglen. "The authorities think that they can escape atte
ntion by acting in secret and under cover of darkness.  This secrecy cannot conceal the real danger of this transport."

<P>After the Moby Dick was towed away, Greenpeace activists carried out another protest in Cherbourg harbour.  Six activists placed a banner reading "PLUTONIUM IS A DEAD END -- GREENPEACE" near the site where the plutonium waste was loaded aboard the Paci
fic Pintail.

DAY TWO -- TRACKING THE PACIFIC PINTAIL:

24 February, 1995 from the Greenpeace ship MV Solo:





<hr>

<P>As of 7:00 AM (GMT) the Pintail was in international waters off

the Brest/French coast -- 48 degrees and 17 minutes North, and

06 degrees and 42 minutes west.  The ship is heading on a

southwesterly course and will be off Land's End (the tip of England) by around mid-day.  The Solo is tracking Pintail at

a distance of 2.5 - 3 miles travelling at 10 knots.  The weather has been

rough with high tides and winds which we hope will subside as we

move south.



<P>We are travelling with a crew of 18 and our mission is to track

and report on the Pacific Pintail's route to countries along the

way.



<P>New statements of Opposition:

<P><LI>Brazilian Government bans transport from coast and waters under its jurisdiction.  the Brazilian government issues a statement of concern about the transport which states that their coast and waters "mustn't be exposed to eventual risks of accidents involving such cargoes.">

<P><LI>The Chairperson of the South African Parliament's Standing

Committee On Environmental Affairs and Tourism has just condemned

the secrecy around the transport has called for a ban on such

shipments.  The statement was issued late on the 23rd.  South Africa cited this shipment as a "reason to call for a comprehensive ban on plutonium separation and use at the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Conference in New York in April 1995."



<P><LI>The Foreign Office of Chile has just announced that the

"Pintail" will not be allowed to enter the waters under Chilean

jurisdiction.



<P><LI>The Philippines Foreign Secretary issued another strong

condemnation of the shipment on the day of the ship's departure. 

The Phillipines' government has already banned the shipment from

its jurisdictional waters.



<P><LI>An official in Portugal confirmed to Greenpeace that the

Portuguese navy would put to sea to guarantee that the ship does

not pass within its territorial waters.

<P>We find these strong statements of opposition very encouraging.  That's it for today.  We will keep you apprised of our position

and progress.

<P>From Greenpeace ship MV Solo
25 February 1995 -- 0700 GMT -- DAY 3

<P>Dear all,
<P>The "Solo's" position as of 0700 GMT is 380 km north La Coruna,
Spain.  The "Pacific Pintail" in bearing 217 deg 4.1 miles at a
speed of 10.5 knots.  The wind is a west force 6.

<P>We entered the 200 mile Spanish zone at 0630 this morning.
Best regards, and No Nukes!
Bas Bruyne<P>
<hr>                            

<P>From Greenpeace ship MV Solo
25 February 1995 -- 1500 GMT -- Day 3

<P>The current position of the Solo at 1500 GMT on Saturday 25
February is 45 degrees and 32 minutes North and 09 degrees and
21 minutes West.  We are following the radioactive freighter at
a distance of 3 miles on a course of 223 degrees and at a speed
of 12.5 knots. 

<P>At 1500 GMT today the Spanish Navy vessel Serviola appeared off
the port bow of the Pacific Pintail. The following exchange
occurred between the two vessels:

<P>Transcript of conversation between Spanish Navy vessel SERVIOLA
and the PACIFIC PINTAIL at 1500 GMT:

<P>--start transcript--
<P>"SERVIOLA:
<P>Merchant vessel Pacific Pintail this is the Spanish Navy vessel
Serviola over;

<P>The Spanish authorities suggest that you change your course in
order not to pass more than 100 miles off the Spanish Coast.
over;  

<P>PINTAIL:
<P>Serviola, this is Pacific Pintail, ehhh...yes OK that is no
problem,..ehhh,..as you can see we will probably be passing
within about 95 but we will pull out a few miles, over;

<P>SERVIOLA: This is Serviola, I appreciate it, over.

<P>PINTAIL: Back to 16.

<P>SERVIOLA: OK"

<P>--end transcript--


<P>The Spanish escort vessel "Serviola" (no. P71), a Serviola class
offshore patrol vessel specifically designed and employed to
enforce Spanish control over the Spanish EEZ.  The Serviola is
currently still escorting the Pintail at a distance of 2.5 miles
of her port bow.


<P>At 1600 GMT the Serviola has contacted the Portuguese Frigate
F332, the " CORTE REAL" (a Vasco da Gama class frigate).  We
believe that the Frigate will take over the escort from the
Serviola.  It is unclear if the Portuguese Navy will allow the
Serviola to remain at a distance of 100 miles within the
Portuguese EEZ.

<P>Sunday morning (02-26-95) around 0100 GMT we will pass close
to the Portuguese EEZ just 200 miles west of the most Northern
part of Portugal.  We do not expect that the Pintail will enter
the Portuguese EEZ at this time.

<P>Around Monday (02-27-95) 2400 GMT (if we maintain our current
speed and course) we will reach the 200 mile Portuguese EEZ
around the Azores and Madeira.  Thus far the Pintails' course
suggests that it will indeed have to pass in between Madeira and
the Azores, which brings it well within the Portuguese EEZ.

<P>Best regards
<P>Bas Bruyne (Campaigner on board the Greenpeace vessel Solo)

<P>From:    Greenpeace vessel MV Solo

Date:    SUN 26-FEB-95 12:10:41 GMT -- Day 4



<P>Solo's position as of 0700 GMT is 260 km west of Cabo Finistere. 

The Pacific Pintail in bearing 203 deg 3.2 miles and our speed

is 13.5 knots, course 215 degrees.  The wind is a west force 6

and 10 meter waves are coming into the side of the ship. Everyone

is hoping for a change in the weather.  The whole crew is bruised

from being knocked about the ship in all of our waking and

sleeping hours.



<P>A portuguese warship has just joined our party along with the

Spanish navy ship already with us.  The Portuguese ship contacted

the Pintail to announce that it will follow it.



<P>Continuing our current course and speed we will reach a point

some 300 miles West of Lisbon (042 degrees and 26.5 minutes North

and 012 degrees and 38.2 minutes West) on February 27 at around

0600 GMT.

<P>Date:    SUN 26-FEB-95 -- 03:40 GMT -- Day 4



<P>    The Portuguese warship (Frigate F 489) the "Oliveira E

Carmo" joined the Pintail at 0630 this morning and is still

accompanying the ship, while the Spanish Navy patrol vessel

"Serviola" left us at daybreak in the morning.



<P>     Yesterday we received a message from Monsanto Radio --a

shipping radio station which issues navigational and security

warnings to ships-- reporting the washing ashore of several (12)

boxes of ammunition on the Portuguese Coast.  Monsanto Radio

warned all ships of the possibility of the existence of more

boxes drifting in the ocean or ocean floor and said they could

be dangerous to navigation.



<P>We have learned that there are some 80 boxes of ammunition

drifting around somewhere.  The boxes of ammunition were lost at

sea during an attempt on 25th October 1994 to scuttle

(intentionally sink) the Portuguese ship "Sao Miguel" and its

ammunition cargo.  Reportedly the scuttling failed, the ship

exploded, and some 80 boxes were lost.  The Sao Miguel was sunk

at approximately 190 miles West of Lisbon.  The Pacific Pintail

will on Monday February 27th in the early morning hours (around

0200) come as close as 140 miles North East of the spot where the

ammunition boxes were reported lost. We have contacted the

Pintail with this warning and information but they have not

responded. 



<P>     On Monday (02-27-95) 2400 GMT (if we maintain our current

speed and course) we will reach and enter the 200 mile Portuguese

EEZ around Madeira. There is, however, a small gap of some 60

miles between the two Portuguese EEZ's around the Azores and

Madeira.  We think it's likely that the Pintail will pass through

this gap, thus avoiding a direct confrontation with Portugal over

it's 200 mile EEZ.

     

<P>That's all for now, 

<P>Bas Bruyne on board the MV Solo.

<P>From:    MV Solo

<P>Date:    MON 27-FEB-95 07:22:37 GMT -- Day 5



<P>     The radioactive waste ship Pacific Pintail sped up during

the night and is now sailing at a speed of almost 14 knots on a

course of 213 degrees. Our vessel Solo is still following on a

safe distance of 3 miles. Because of our increased speed, we will

reach and enter the 200 mile Portuguese EEZ around Madeira around

1600 GMT today. 



 <P>    The weather conditions have improved and only the large

swell coming from behind reminds us of the bad weather of the

past days.



 <P>    The Portuguese warship (Frigate F 489) the "Oliveira E

Carmo", which joined us early yesterday morning, is still with

us. 



<P>     We intend to send out a statement this morning about the

scuttling of the ship "Sao Miguel", on which occasion some 80

boxes with ammunition were lost at sea.  At 0930 GMT the Pacific

Pintail at its current course and speed will come within 140

miles northeast of the site were the boxes were lost. 



<P>Best wishes from the Solo, 

<P>Bas Bruyne

<hr>                            

<P>From:    MV Solo

<P>Date:    MON 27-FEB-95 20:24:09 GMT -- Day 5



<P>     Solo's position at 1900 GMT was 36 degrees and 05 minutes

North and 17 degrees and 59 minutes West. The Pacific Pintail

entered the Portugese Economic Exclusion Zone 200 miles North of

Madeira at 1930 GMT this evening. The Pintail is continuing its

course of 213 degrees at a speed of 14 knots and will remain in

the EEZ around Madeira for approximately the next 20 hours.



<P>     Upon entering the Portugese EEZ around Madeira at 1930 GMT,

the Potugese Frigate "Oliveira E Carmo" contacted the Pacific

Pintail, notified them that they had entered the Portugese EEZ

and requested the Pacific Pintail to stay at least 100 miles away

from Madeira.  The Pacific Pintail confirmed and replied that her

current course would not bring her closer than 120 miles from

Madeira. 



<P>     At the end of the conversation the Captain of the "Oliveira

E Carmo" asked the Pacific Pintail what route she would take --

if she would take the South Africa route or the South America

route.  The Pacific Pintail replied that SHE DID NOT KNOW YET. 



 <P>   We then called the "Oliveira E Carmo" and asked if she would

remain as escort until the Pacific Pintail would leave the EEZ

around Madeira, to which the Oliveira E Carmo replied that she

would stay until further notice.  



 <P>    Our calculations indicate that the Pintail will leave the

EEZ around Madeira around 1500 GMT tomorrow, and we believe that

also around that time the "Oliveira E Carmo" will leave the

escort.  At the time we leave Madeira's 200 mile EEZ, we will be

some 300 miles northwest of the Spainish Canary Islands.



  <P>    The weather conditions have continued to improve under a

clear to slightly overcast sky.



<P>Best wishes from the Solo, 

<P>Bas Bruyne

<P>From:    Greenpeace ship MV Solo

<P>Date:    TUE 28-FEB-95 07:48:27 GMT -- Day 6



<P>     Solo's position at 0700 GMT was 33 degrees and 52 minutes

North and 19 degrees and 53 minutes West. The Pacific Pintail

entered the Portuguese Economic Exclusion Zone 200 miles North

of Madeira at 1930 GMT yesterday evening at a course of 213 and

a speed of 14 knots. At 0730 GMT the Pacific Pintail altered its

course to 182 and will leave Madeira's EEZ at around 1800 GMT

this afternoon if we maintain our current course of 182 degrees

and our speed of 14 knots.



 <P>    The Pintail's change of course may indicate she is going to

take the South Africa route, but of course she could just be

playing cat and mouse as happened in 1992 with the Japanese

plutonium shipment.  We'll watch what she does over the next 24. 



 <P>    The Portuguese Frigate "Oliveira E Carmo" is still sailing

some 1 mile in from of our port bow shadowing the Pintail at a

distance of some 2 miles and confirming that her secret route

does not bring her closer than 100 miles from the Portuguese

island of Madeira.



 <P>   Today we will come as close as 100 miles west of Palma, the

main island of the Canary Isles archipel (Spanish).  



  <P>    The weather conditions are good, wind NE 4 under a clear

to slightly overcast sky. Today we will transmit some photo's of

the Portuguese Frigate to Greenpeace Communications.

<P>From:    MV Solo

<P>Date:    TUE 28-FEB-95 16:36:57 GMT -- Day 6

         

   <P>  The Solo's position at 1600 GMT was 32 degrees and 4 minutes

North and 21 degrees and 13 minutes West, which puts us 250 miles

northwest of Palma, one of the Canary Islands. We will pass the

Canary Islands at a closest distance of 265 miles at 1930 GMT

tonight.  Our current speed is 14 knots and our course is heading

southwest or 215 degrees on the compass.



   <P>   At 1530 GMT we left the Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) of

200 miles around Madeira and are again in international waters.

The Portuguese Frigate "Oliveira E Carmo" is still sailing some

1 mile from of our port bow.



 <P>     The weather conditions are good, wind is northeast 4/5.

Photo's of the Portages frigate and of crew onboard the Solo are

available from Greenpeace Communications.

<P>Date:    TUE 28-FEB-95 11:58:13 GMT -- Day 6

        

<P>     At 0830 GMT the Pacific Pintail changed its course back

again to 213 degrees! Are these shadowy moves made to fool us or

is she just not sure where she is going? We don't know, but she

is back on her old course of 213 degrees again and her speed is

almost 14 knots.  At 1200 GMT our position will be 32 degrees and

53 minutes North and 20 degrees and 40 minutes West.

<P>     The Solo's position at 0700 GMT was 29 degrees and 3 minutes

North and 23 degrees and 24 minutes West, which puts us 300 miles

<P>      At 2300 GMT yesterday night the Portuguese Frigate

"Oliveira E Carmo" left the Pacific Pintail and was replaced at

that time by the Spanish Patrol Boat P72, the "Centinella" .  The

Centinella is a sistership of the Serviola, which observed the

Pacific Pintail earlier in our voyage.

Subject: 0700 GMT March 2, 95 -- Day Eight





<P>POSITION IS NOW 440 MILES NORTH OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS



  <P>   The Greenpeace ship Solo's position at 0700 GMT on 2 March,

1995 was 24 degrees and 25 minutes North and 26 degrees and 37

minutes West. Our current speed is 14 knots and we are heading

southwest on a compass course of 211 degrees. We are currently

some 440 miles North of the Cape Verde Islands today passing the

Canary Islands yesterday.  The wind is easterly, force 6.  



<P>     Greenpeace is still unable to detect which route the Pacific

Pintail will take as the ship has changed course a number of times since

starting its voyage.  We hope to be able to determine the route

within the next 48 hours.  France, Britain and Japan remain secretive about the ship's

route despite opposition from some 25 countries and government

bodies around the world.

<P>Media/Position update from Greenpeace vessel Solo



<P>STILL STEAMING SOUTHWEST, 265 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE CAPE VERDE

ISLANDS



<P>     The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 19

degrees and 41 minutes North and 29 degrees and 36 minutes West.

The Pintail has maintained her speed of 14 knots and still sails

on a compass course of 210 degrees (southwest).



<P>     Yesterday evening we heard that people in the Virgin Islands

gathered in a vigil against the passage of the Pacific Pintail

through their region.  Within the next days it will become

clearer which route the ship may take. But, wherever the ship

will turn to --Cape Good Hope, the Panama Canal, or Cape Horn--

its radioactive cargo will endanger coast lines, fisheries, and

tourist industries while in France a deadly heritage of

radioactive pollution has been left behind as an invisible

witness of the nuclear age. 



<P>     The Pacific Pintail is currently on a distance of some 265

miles northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. 

     

<P>     Life on the high seas is less than exciting at the moment.

We steam along keeping an eye on our nuclear waste shipment

companion but other than that, there's not much to see out here. 

I had originally planned to attend the Non-Proliferation Treaty

talks this April at the UN in New York but, with the route so

uncertain, I may end up sailing with the Solo throughout the

whole, long journey.



 <P>    Having seen the round-up of media coverage on the Pintail's

departure from France, the crew and I are amazed that this story

has reach so many people around the world.  I have heard from

people in California by E-mail that other environmental and anti-

nuclear groups have been doing vigils and group meetings an thus

have given their support to our day-to-day efforts out here to

turn this nuclear horror around........ maybe a miracle will

happen and we'll witness the first signs of end of the nuclear

age.

<P>450 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS

<P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 11 degrees
and 31 minutes North and 30 degrees and 1 minute West. The
Pintail's speed is 13.5 knots and it is steering a compass course
of 180 degrees (South).  The Pacific Pintail is currently on a

<P>This dangerous transport is legitimised by the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty's promotion of nuclear power and
plutonium reprocessing.  Greenpeace urges en route nations to
call for a ban on plutonium production at talks on the NPT in New
York this coming April and to oppose indefinite extension of the
Treaty. An indefinite extension of the Treaty would amount to a
permanent licence to produce high radioactive wastes as currently
transported by the Pacific Pintail in addition to plutonium and
other nuclear bomb-usable material.

<P>Onboard of the Solo all is well.  For 3 days we have been
sailing in good weather and finally the crew has a chance to do
the necesarry maintance on the ship.  Other than that, no news.

<html><P>From:    MV Solo

<P>Date:    SUN  5-MAR-95 1900 GMT -- Day 11



<P>IN BETWEEN AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA



<P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 6 degrees and

11 minutes North and 30 degrees West. The Pacific Pintail is

still steering a compass course of 180 degrees South at a speed

of 13.5 knots.  The Pacific Pintail is almost exactly between the

African and South American continents on a distance of 730 miles

northeast of the Brazilian city Natal, and 860 miles southwest

of the West African country Guine-Bissau. 



<P>Over the past few days the Pacific Pintail with its nuclear waste

cargo has sailed passed, Cape Verde, Senegal, Gambia and

Guinea-Bissau. That the French, British or even the Japanese

governments haven't even informed countries of the route this

shipment is taking is an indication of their greatest fear:  That

countries along possible shipping routes will use their sovereign

rights to prohibit the ship from sailing through the waters under

their jurisdiction. 



<P>African countries recently negotiated a regional agreement to

remain free of nuclear weapons. Instead of threatening the shores

and fisheries of African States with Japanese radioactive waste,

industrialized countries should offer to develop, with African

countries, programs to sustain African energy demand with energy

from renewable sources like solar and wind energy.  



<P>Stay tuned for more information about the route the Pacific

Pintail will take on it's hazardous journey.  With the

Non-Proliferation Treaty Extension Conference in April (NPT),

Greenpeace is calling on countries along the route to send a

clear message to the governments of France and Japan to end the

production of plutonium for their 'energy programs'.



<P>The use of civil plutonium is increasingly becoming a

proliferation migraine for national security analysts and

national defense policy makers of all countries. Civil plutonium

can, without much difficulty, replace plutonium produced by

military production programs as the primary component of a

nuclear weapon.  Preliminary talks have started at the Geneva

Conference on Disarmament to ban all production of military

plutonium. Pressure exerted by France and the United Kingdom has

prevented thus far a civil plutonium production ban to be

<P>From:    MV Solo

<P><P>Date:    MON  6-MAR-95 1500 GMT -- Day 12 Part I

<P>Media/Position update from Greenpeace vessel Solo



<P>..........IN BETWEEN LIBERIA AND BRAZIL

<P>POSITION 1500 GMT: 1 degree and 30 minutes North and 30 degrees

West, 1,080 miles southwest off the coast of the city Freetown

in Liberia, Africa and 540 miles northeast off the coast of Natal

in Brazil, South America.



<P>Provided that we maintain our current course of 180 degrees and

our speed of 14 knots: (at 1500 GMT Monday) The nearest land to

us lies 60 miles southeast, small islands of rocks called the

"Penedos de Sao Pedro", which I believe is Brazilian territory

which we would reach at approximately 0100 GMT Tuesday). In any

case we will definitely be passing into the Brazilian Economic

Exclusion Zone of 200 miles at 0100 GMT Tuesday 07 March 1995,

when we expect to find ourselves 200 miles northeast of the

"Archipelago de Fernando de Noronha".



<P>The Pacific Pintail has now sailed passed, Cape Verde, Senegal,

Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. All's well on board the Solo. 

Tomorrow, campaigner Tom Clements will hold a press conference

on board the Rainbow Warrior near the Panama Canal as it looks

certain that the Pintail will not take the Caribbean route.  A

press release will follow tomorrow.



<P>I hear from Greenpeace campaigner Tom Clements that he will hold

a press conference today on board the Rainbow Warrior near the

Panama Canal.  He will join with Caribbean government leaders and

the public whose outspoken protest against this shipment in their

territorial waters have successfully forced the nuclear waste

ship to take another route.  We learned last week that they had

indeed filed the necessary papers to travel through the Canal but

have since changed course and avoided it.  We consider this a

success for those in the Caribbean region and now call on other

countries in South America and Africa to voice the same

opposition.  Only when France, Japan and the UK know that this

trade will not be accepted by nations worldwide will they be

forced to end it. 



<P>That's it for today.  More as we continue on our journey

tomorrow.

<P>TOUCHING THE EQUATOR -- SAILING TOWARDS CAPE HORN 

OR CAPE GOOD HOPE



    <P> The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 0

degrees and 40 minutes North and 30 degrees and 1 minute West.

The Pacific Pintail is still steering a compass course of 180

degrees South at a speed of 13.5 knots.  We are now less than 500

miles northeast of the Brazilian city Natal.



     <P>Today, on day 12, we concluded that the Pacific Pintail will

definitely not go through the Panama Canal, and that the ship is

sailing towards either Cape Horn, or towards Cape Good Hope

--however the Pintail would have to change is course considerably

for that route.



    <P> At around midnight we will be sailing from the northeast

into the Brazilian Economic Exclusion Zone of 200 miles around

the "Archipelago de Fernando de Noronha." On February 24th, the

Brazilian government issued a statement of concern in which it

declared that their coast and waters "mustn't be exposed to

eventual risks of accidents involving such cargoes."  It is

unclear if the Brazilian Navy will set to sea to prevent the

Pacific Pintail from coming closer to Brazil's coasts.  Thus far

both Spain and Portugal prevented the Pacific Pintail from coming

closer than 100 miles from their coasts and enforced this demand

by escorting the radioactive waste ship out of their

jurisdictional waters.



    <P> That the Pacific Pintail has received instructions not to

attempt the Panama Canal is a victory for the public and the

governments of the small island states in the Caribbean. It shows

how small states can form a united front to successfully ward off

an unwanted and unethical by-product of our consumptive nuclear

society. 



    <P> Although our particular journey -- following this ship with

radioactive plutonium waste -- will not be shorter for it, the

common journey that our society needs to take, if it is to rid

itself of the nuclear menace and increasing stockpiles of nuclear

waste, has hopefully become shorter by the united action of the

Caribbean nations. Greenpeace encourages the Caribbean community

to establish, through its 13-member regional forum CARICOM, a

zone that prohibits plutonium and nuclear waste shipments from

entering the Caribbean. 



     <P>Greenpeace is encouraging all countries around the world to

call for a halt to the plutonium industry at the United Nation's

April Extension Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation

Treaty (NPT) in New York.  

 

    <P> Greenpeace will issue a press release to some of the African

and South American countries today ensuring that they know this

radioactive waste ship is in their vicinity.



<P>That's it for today.  Best regards and No Nukes!

<P><H4>OVER THE EQUATOR INTO THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMIC EXCLUSION ZONE</H4>

<P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 2
degrees and 2 minutes South and 30 degrees and 2 minutes West. 
The Pacific Pintail is still steering a compass course of 180
degrees South at a speed of 13.5 knots.

<P>Tonight we crossed the equator. An amazing experience with
lots of sea lore about Neptune baptizing the uninitiated.

<P>We are now some 380 miles northeast of the Brazilian city
of Natal, and 180 miles northeast of the Brazilian island group
Fernando de Noronha. On February 24th, the Brazilian government
issued a statement of concern in which it declared that their
coast and waters "mustn't be exposed to eventual risks of
accidents involving such cargoes."  Greenpeace Brazil's Ruy de
Goes yesterday notified the Brazilian authorities of the
whereabouts of the Pacific Pintail, but at the moment of writing
this update it is unclear if the authorities will undertake
further action to underline their concerns.

<P>Greenpeace calls for a world-wide ban on the production of
all plutonium --whether used for military or for civil purposes--
in its campaign to halt nuclear weapons production and
proliferation.  The organization is encouraging countries around
the world to call for a halt to the plutonium industry at the
Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in
April at the United Nations in New York.

<P>Date:    TUE  7-MAR-95 19:04:36 GMT -- Day 13, part II

<P> <H4> SAILING THROUGH THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMIC EXCLUSION ZONE</H4>

<P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 4
degrees and 14 minutes South and 30 degrees West. The Pacific
Pintail is still steering a compass course of 180 degrees, due
South in a straight line at a speed of 13.5 knots.

 <P>The Pintail and Greenpeace's Solo are now some 380 miles
east of the Brazilian city of Natal, and 150 miles southeast of
the Brazilian island group Fernando de Noronha, which we passed
on a sailing distance of 8 hours. Still the Brazilian authorities
have not undertaken action in line with their February 24th
statement, which said that the Brazil's waters "mustn't be
exposed to eventual risks of accidents involving such cargoes."

 <P>The current transport onboard the Pacific Pintail involves
glassified high level nuclear waste generated in the course of
plutonium reprocessing in France for the Japanese.  The waste is
so tremendously radioactive that a person standing close to an
unshielded block of the nuclear waste would receive a lethal dose
of radiation in less than 60 seconds. Over 100 of these nuclear
waste shipments could occur between France and Britain to Japan
within the next 15 years.  Currently Brazil's marine environment
as well as its population are put at risk should an accident
involving the highly radioactive cargo of the Pacific Pintail
occur. 
 
<P>Greenpeace calls on the government of Brazil to formally
prohibit these dangerous shipments from sailing through the
waters under their jurisdiction.  Only such a course of action
could prevent the plutonium production companies British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd. and Cogema from making the route around Brazil's
coastline into a regular route for future shipments of both waste
and plutonium.  Previously both plutonium production companies
have used the route through the Panama Canal for the shipment of
nuclear waste between Japan, Britain and France. Recent protest
from nations in the Caribbean and Latin America have forced the
Pacific Pintail to choose an alternative route.
     
<P>Give the due South course the Pacific Pintail is sailing,
it is possible for it to route around Cape Horn (South America)
or the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa). Today, Greenpeace called
on South American as well as on African nations to formally ban
the shipment from their waters.

 <P>Greenpeace is calling for a world-wide ban on the production
of all plutonium--both military and civil-- in its campaign to
halt nuclear weapons production and proliferation.  The
organization is encouraging countries around the world to call
for a halt to the plutonium industry at the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks in April at the United
Nations in New York.

daily should access Greenpeace World Wide Web site at:

<H4>CHANGING COURSE -- LEAVING THE BRAZILIAN EEZ</H4>







     <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 7 degrees and 9 minutes south and 30 degrees and 37 minutes west.  The Pacific Pintail changed course at 0100 GMT to a   compass course of 205 degrees, due southwest and is sailing at a speed of 13.5 knots.







    <P> Yesterday, the Pintail slowed down a number of times, and onboard the Solo, we speculated that she was awaiting course orders from France.  We are now some 320 miles east of the Brazilian city Recife, and have left the Brazilian Economic Exclusion Zone.  We are sending two photos from the Solo to Greenpeace Communications in London today which will be posted on the Greenpeace WWW homepage.  One is of the Captain and myself on the bridge of Solo tracking the Pintail's route against ocean



charts.

    <P> It is still possible for the Pacific Pintail to choose either the shipping route around Cape Horn (South America) or



around the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa).  Yesterday, Greenpeace called on South American as well as on African nations



to formally ban the shipment from their waters. Thus far, only two African nations have issued protests, Ethiopia and Mauritius,



while in South America opposition to the shipment has been expressed by Argentina, Brazil and Chile.







     <P>Two years ago, opposition to a shipment of weapons-usable, highly radio-toxic plutonium from France to Japan was forced to



reroute after countries in the Caribbean and Latin-America declared their opposition.  That particular shipment, onboard the



sister-ship of the Pintail, the "Akatsuki Maru", then sailed around Southern Africa, across the Indian Ocean, passed between



Australia and New Zealand and sailed northwards through a number of South Pacific Island nations before arriving in Japan. In the



Pacific Ocean, Fiji, Micronesia and Nauru have stated their opposition to the possible passage of the Pacific Pintail through



their waters.







     <P>Greenpeace calls for a world-wide ban on the production of all plutonium--both military and civil--in its campaign to halt



nuclear weapons production and proliferation.  The organization is encouraging countries around the world to call for a halt to



the plutonium industry at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks in April at the United Nations in New York.

<H4>BRAZIL ENFORCES 200 MILE EEZ. SEND AIRFORCE TO FLY OVER PINTAIL</H4>



    <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 9

degrees and 41 minutes South and 31 degrees and 53 minutes West,

on a distance 200 miles east-south-east of the Brazilian city of

Recife.  The Pacific Pintail is currently sailing along the edge

of the Brazilian 200 miles Exclusive Economic Zone, on a course

of 202 degrees.



    <P> At 1600 GMT the Brazilian airforce flew closely over the

Pacific Pintail numerous times and engaged the vessel in radio-

communication.  The Brazilian airforce asked the captain of the

Pintail all navigational details necessary for Brazil to prevent

the ship from entering its 200 mile zone.  In addition the

airforce inquired into the nature of the Pintail's cargo and the

captain of the Pacific Pintail twice refused to answer saying,

"We are on a normal sea-trade."



     <P>The Captain of Greenpeace's ship Solo then contacted the

Brazilian Airforce and informed them of the Pintail's cargo.

Subsequently Captain Ulf Birgander was thanked by the Brazilian

Airforce for the job we have done thus far.



     <P>The full conversation follows. Also we took a photograph

of the Pacific Pintail with the Brazilian Airforce plane overhead which we have sent to Greenpeace Communications.

<H4>SAILING ALONG BRAZIL'S 200 MILE EEZ -- 300 MILES EAST OF SALVADOR</H4>



    <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 12

degrees and 12 minutes South and 32 degrees and 56 minutes West,

on a distance 210 miles of the Brazilian coast, putting us 300

miles east of the Brazilian city of Salvador.  The Pacific

Pintail is still sailing along the edge of the Brazilian 200

miles Exclusive Economic Zone, on a course of 205 degrees. This

course could bring the Pintail potentially into Brazilian waters

within the next 36 hours.



    <P> Yesterday, the Brazilian Air force checked the position of

the Pintail and enquired into all relevant navigational and

safety aspects of the nuclear waste ship. The captain of the

Pintail refused to inform the Brazilian authorities about the

nature of his cargo, and bluntly stated that his ship was on a

"normal sea-trade."  The Greenpeace crew believes this represents

the moral attitude of the companies involved in the plutonium

trade and commerce of radioactive pollution. 



<P>Brazil's Department of External Affairs confirmed yesterday that

it had sought bilateral contact with the Embassies of Japan,

France and UK to express Brazil's concern about the route of the

Pacific Pintail.



    <P> In Brasilia, Brazil's capital, the three National Workers

Federations of port workers adopted a motion late yesterday

stating: (1) Their strong protest against the passage of Pacific

Pintail in Brazilian waters, (2) Their decision to deny any kind

of help and assistance to the ship should it ask to stop in a

Brazilian port. The National Workers Federation's further

announced that this message will be circulated throughout Brazil

to all ports.



     <P> Media updates from the Solo are sent out on a daily basis

<H4>PINTAIL PASSES INTO BRAZIL'S 200 MILE EEZ</H4>

</head>
<body>

    <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 17

degrees and 12 minutes South and 35 degrees and 24 minutes West, on a distance

190 miles north-north-west of the Abrolhos Island, which means that the

Pacific Pintail has passed into the Brazilian EEZ.



    <P>The Brazilian Government, on March 8, released a statement saying that

the transit of the vessel 'Pacific Pintal' through the jurisdictional waters

of Penedos de Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo and of Fernando de Noronha, in the high

seas waters adjacent to national jurisdiction continues to cause concern for

the Brazilian Government because of the risks of pollution charecterised by

the nuclear waste transports. The Brazilian Government further called for a

re-evaluation of IMO and IAEA regultaions on the basis of the goals expressed

in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.



    <P>Chile's House of Representatives yesterday unanimously adopted a

resolution asking the Chilean Executive branch to take a tougher stance on the

issue of radioactive waste shipments. In the draft resolution the Chilean

House of Representatives requests the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to: 

-  deliver to the governments of Japan, France and the United Kingdom, as well

as to the legislative branches of those same countries, Brazil's most strong

protest over this new shipment of radioactive material by sea.

-  request the governments of England, France and Japan to 

terminate their plans to continue to ship radioactive wastes, since they are

a grave risk to the environment, human health and

international security.



  <P>The Chilean House of Representatives agrees as well to request the

Government of President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle to forbid the Pacific Pintail

to sail in Chilean territorial waters.  



    <P> Foreign Minister, Jose Miguel Insulza issued a statement on

February 23rd that Chile will not allow the shipment to pass through it's

territorial waters nor through the country's 200-mile economic exclusion zone.

The next day, on the same day the Pacific Pintail left France, the Brazilian

Government issued a statement of concern which stated that their coast and

waters "mustn't be exposed to eventual risks of accidents involving such

cargoes." 



     <P>On March 1st, in a meeting with Greenpeace, Argentina's Vice Foreign

Minister Fernando Petrella states that his government has formally notified

Japan that the transport will not be allowed entry to Argentina's 200 mile

EEZ. 



    <P>Petrella also states that the government does not want the Cape Horn

route to be used for such transports. On March 8th, Brazil's Department of

External Affairs confirmed that it had sought bilateral contact with the

Embassies of Japan, France and UK, to express Brazil's concern with the route

of the Pacific Pintail.



     <P>The French plutonium company Cogema continues to refuse to

inform countries about the details of the shipping route, most

likely out of fear that more countries will prohibit entrance of the British

flagged Pacific Pintail into the waters under their

jurisdiction. This veil of secrecy, however, also implies that

'selected transit' states are prevented from issuing navigational warnings to

ships in the vicinity of the Pacific Pintail or from ensuring with a Navy

escort that the radioactive waste freighter stays out of their waters.



     <P>Greenpeace is encouraging countries around the world to call

for a halt to the plutonium industry at the United Nation's April

Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at the United Nations in New York.  



     <P>Media updates from the Solo are sent out on a daily basis

at approximately 0700 GMT and 1900 GMT. If additional information on the

Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's cargo of radioactive pollution is required,

please contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-1301166--warning, cost is

$10 per minute), or Karen Richardson at ++44171-226-3151.  Photo requests

should be made to Mark Warford at Greenpeace Communications

(++44-171-8330-600).

<br><H4>Date:    FRI 10-MAR-95 11:29:37 GMT  -- ADDITIONAL UPDATE</H4>

<P>This morning at 0912 GMT the Brazilian Navy arrived and
positioned itself next to the Pacific Pintail and is keeping pace
with the ship.  The Brazilian Navy ship is the P42, the "Grajau".
This is a large patrol craft of 46.5 meters.

<P>At the time the Navy came, the Pintail was 180 miles northeast
of the Brazilian Island Abralhos. At the time of writing (1100
GMT), the Brazlian Navy has left us again, but we hope they will
return.

<P>That's all for now.  More in the 1900 updated.

<P>Cheers, Bas

<H4>SAILING INSIDE BRAZILIAN EEZ --- 170 MILES OFF THE COAST</H4>

    <P>The position of the nuclear waste ship Pacific Pintail at
1900 GMT was 19 degrees and 43 minutes South and 36 degrees and
41 minutes West, at a distance 170 miles of the Brazilian Coast,
east of the Brazilian city Vitoria.  This morning at 0912 GMT,
the Brazilian Navy vessel P42, the "Grajau" joined the Pintail
and stayed with the radioactive waste shipment for 2 hours. The
Pacific Pintail has been sailing since early this morning in
Brazilian waters.

    <P>The lack of information from the French plutonium company
Cogema about the route of the ship is causing deep concern with
states along the possible shipping route.  The Brazilian Foreign
Ministry, on March 8, released a note that the transit of the
vessel 'Pacific Pintail' through the juridical waters of Penedos
de Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo and of Fernando de Noronha, in the
high seas waters adjacent to national jurisdiction continues to
cause concern for the Brazilian Government because of the risks
of pollution characterised by the nuclear waste transports. The
Brazilian Government further called for a re-evaluation of
International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations on the basis of the goals
expressed in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

     <P>The production of plutonium not only is directly responsible
for the production of high level radioactive waste, and its
transport through shipping lanes, fisheries and tourist areas,
but is also a great cause for concern with regard to the spread
of nuclear weapons world wide. Civilian nuclear plutonium
programs will have produced around 550 tonnes of plutonium by the
year 2010, largely by France, the UK, and Japan. By comparison,
current military stocks of plutonium are estimated at 257 tonnes.
Combined, approximately 100,000 nuclear weapons worth of fissile
material has been produced over the last 50 years by the nuclear
military and civilian industries.  This shipment of highly
radioactive plutonium waste onboard the Pacific Pintail
represents a significant step in the nuclear industry's attempt
to further increase our society's dependence on plutonium.

    <P>Ultimately to end radioactive waste shipments like the
Pacific Pintail the international community will have to end the
production of plutonium, whether produced for civil or military
purposes. Only in this way can we hope to have a chance to deal
with the enormous radioactive pollution already left behind for
our children, their children and future generations to come.
Greenpeace is encouraging countries around the world to call for
a halt to the plutonium industry at the United Nation's April
conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in New
York.

    <P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage
or it's cargo of radioactive pollution is required, please
contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-130-1166--warning
$10 per minute), or Karen Richardson (++44171-226-3151).  Photo

Palese at Greenpeace Communications (++44-171-8330-600).

<P><H4>190 MILES OFF THE BRAZILIAN COAST STEAMING SOUTHWEST</H4>

    <P The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 24
degrees and 40 minutes South and 39 degrees and 10 minutes West,
on a distance 190 nautical miles off the Brazilian Coast at Cabo
Frio, and 240 miles east of the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro.
We are sailing on a compass course of 204 degrees at a speed of
13 knots.

    <P>Brazil, Argentina and Chile all have banned the shipment of
plutonium waste from the waters under their jurisdiction.   This
dangerous transport with the Pacific Pintail is legitimised by
the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty's (NPT) promotion of nuclear
power and plutonium reprocessing. Greenpeace urges en route
nations to call for a ban on plutonium production at talks on the
NPT in New York in April and to oppose indefinite extension of
the Treaty, which would amount to a permanent licence to produce
plutonium and other nuclear bomb-usable material and ship it
around the globe. 

    <P>Both France and the United Kingdom have been actively
promoting an indefinite extension of the NPT.  If passed in
April, indefinite extension would continue to favour nations such
as France and the UK who threaten global security with their
nuclear forces. In February, just after the final preparation
conference for the NPT, France demonstrated its lack of
commitment to disarmament (the stated purpose of the NPT) by
testing a new type of missile for the delivery of nuclear
warheads from their nuclear powered "Triomphant-Class"
submarines. These submarines may be used to operate off the
coasts of Asia, South America and Africa, and constitute a direct
threat to regional and global security. 

    <P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage
or it's cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas
Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-1301166--warning $10 per minute)

     <P>Instead of a traditional Solo update, today a Japanese story

that was told by Tony Danhakl, crew member on board Greenpeace's

ship Solo now tracking the nuclear waste ship Pintail from France

to Japan.  The original Japanese short story was published in the

late 1960s in the US magazine "Fantasy and Science Fiction".



     <P>"A man is walking near his village in Japan, and comes upon

an old shrine. The very weathered statue is so old that he can't

even tell what religious concept it was used for. Behind the

shrine he sees a hole. He throws a small pebble into the hole,

which he can't hear hitting the bottom, and next he shouts into

it "Hello, is anybody down there?"  He doesn't even hear the echo

of his voice, and thinking that all this is very curious indeed

he walks back to his village to tell his friends. Soon thereafter

many people come to take a look at the amazing hole. They throw

bigger rocks down, lower ropes, and even shine lights into it but

also they fail to discern the bottom of the hole.



     <P>Then somebody has the bright idea to use the hole for local

garbage, and no matter what they put in, the hole does not seem

to fill up.  Not before long, other villages hear about it and

send their garbage over as well. Eventually all of Japan is

sending garbage, toxic and even radioactive waste over to be

thrown into this special hole. The hole seems to be the perfect

solution to everybody's problems. It is conveniently located,

economically sound and thus popular with all. In fact, it is such

good business for Japan that other countries start to export all

their wastes to Japan until not before long every country in the

world sends all their waste to this amazing, special hole.



     <P>Years later, the same man who found the hole is walking near

his village. He reflects that the world looks much cleaner and

brighter than when he was young. The earth, the water, the air

and the people, all have benefitted from his discovery of the

amazing hole. Suddenly something small hits his head. He looks

up and a very loud, booming voice shouts to him from out of the

sky "Hello is anybody down there?"

<H4>COGEMA CONTINUES TO JEOPARDIZE SAFETY OF EN-ROUTE STATES BY

REMAINING SECRETIVE ABOUT ROUTE OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE SHIPMENT;

PACIFIC PINTAIL STEAMS SOUTHWEST TOWARDS URUGUAY

</H4>

</head>



<body>



<P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 30

degrees and 6 minutes South and 42 degrees and 8 minutes west,

on a distance of 380 miles east of the Brazilian coast. We are

sailing on a compass course of 204 degrees and at a speed of 13

knots.



    <P>The lack of information from the French plutonium company

Cogema about the route of the ship is continuing to cause a wave

of deep concern with states along the possible shipping routes.

Over the weekend Uruguay's Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs,

Carlos Perez del Castillo, issued a formal statement in which the

Pacific Pintail will be denied entrance to the waters under

Uruguayan jurisdiction. The lack of information provided by the

French plutonium plant Cogema about the shipment, and more

importantly the lack about the route it will take to Japan,

implies that states are forced to accept the radioactive waste

shipment along their coasts without being allowed to anticipate

and prepare for any possible accident.



     <P>Although the Pacific Pintail is currently sailing along the

coast of South America, the ship could still change course and

head for South Africa's Cape of Good Hope, especially following

increasing opposition in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile

against the Pacific Pintail passing around Cape Horn. Not only

could the passage of the radioactive waste shipment off the

coasts of these countries force a confrontation between the

French plutonium industry and these countries, but the passage

of a ship filled with radioactive waste around Cape Horn would

be an inherently unsafe decision. 



    <P>Recently it has been reported that icebergs have separated

from the ice-masses of Antarctica.  Should the Pintail choose to

go around Cape Horn the possibility exists that the ship may not

only encounter strong gale storms of up to force Beaufort 12, but

could also encounter drift ice along her route.  If the Pacific

Pintail indeed chooses to sail around Cape Horn with the dangers

so well known, it is a clear indication of the lack of safety

concern held by France, Japan and the UK.  Greenpeace calls on

all nations to ban these shipments from the waters under their

jurisdiction and to jointly call on the governments of these

countries to halt these high risk shipments for once and for all.



    <P>In South Africa, the National Union of Mine Workers (NUM)

the biggest union in South Africa, on March 11th at their

<H4>TRADE UNIONS SPEAK OUT AGAINST PLUTONIUM WASTE TRANSPORT;
SOUTH AFRICA BANS TRANSPORT FROM ITS 200 MILE EEZ</H4>

    <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 34 degrees and 13
minutes South and 44 degrees and 16 minutes West, at a distance of some 400
miles east of the Brazilian coast. We are sailing on a compass course of 204
degrees and at a speed of 12.5 knots. The Pacific Pintail is currently at a
distance of 240 miles North of the Uruguayan 200 miles Economic Exclusion Zone
(EEZ) and 395 miles North of the Argentinean EEZ.

     <P>The lack of information from the French plutonium company Cogema about
the route of its nuclear waste ship continues to cause deep concern with
states and people along the possible shipping routes. Over the weekend
Uruguay's Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Carlos Perez del Castillo, issued
a formal statement in which the Pacific Pintail will be denied entry to the
waters under Uruguayan jurisdiction. Previously, Argentina and Chile demanded
the vessel stay outside of their waters as well.

     <P>Trade Unions on both the South American continent as well as on the South
African continent are actively opposing the shipment of radioactive waste. In
Brasilia, Brazil's capital, the three National Workers Federations of port
workers adopted a motion that stated their strong protest against the passage
of Pacific Pintail in Brazilian waters and their decision to deny any kind of
help and assistance to the ship should it come to a Brazilian port. 

    <P>In South Africa, the National Union of Mine Workers (NUM)-- the biggest
union in South Africa--passed a declaration demanding that the waste transport
be banned from South Africa's economic zone waters which they hold to be 250
miles, at their March 11th national meeting.  On an international level, trade
unions have long protested against the transport of radioactive wastes. In
1990, their protests united when the International Transport Workers'
Federation (ITF) formally spoke out against all trade and shipment of
radioactive waste.

     <P>After growing political pressure, the South African Department of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism today released a statement that discloses
that the governments of Japan, France and the United Kingdom have been
requested via diplomatic channels to ensure that, should the Pacific Pintail
make use of the waters off the coast of South Africa, it does not enter the
Exclusive Economic Zone of South Africa. The statement further reveals that,
should the Pacific Pintail takes the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope,
South African Navy ships and South African Air Force aircraft will be used to
watch the vessel as it approaches the limits of South Africa's Exclusive
Economic Zone.

   <P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's cargo
of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo (phone:
++871-1301166--warning--$10 per minute), or Karen Richardson at Greenpeace UK
(phone: ++44-171-226-3151). Photo, video or other media requests to Blair
Palese or Mark Warford at Greenpeace Communications (phone:

<P><H4>OFF THE URUGUAYAN COAST TOWARDS ARGENTINA;

INCREASING TRADE UNION OPPOSITION</H4>

</head>







<body>

     <P>The position of the nuclear waste ship Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was

36 degrees and 28 minutes south and 45 degrees and 21 minutes west, on a

distance of some 300 miles east of the Uruguayan coast. We are sailing on a

compass course of 202 degrees and at a speed of 12 knots. The Pacific

Pintail is currently 100 miles east of the Uruguayan Economic Exclusion

Zone (EEZ) and 240 miles Northeast of the Argentinean EEZ.



     <P>Today, according to Solo's First Mate, Klas Wihl, the Pintail arrives off the coast of Uruguay. Although the

Uruguayan Government has expressed deep concern over this and future

shipments of radioactive waste, the French plutonium company Cogema has

still not responded with any details about the ship's route or it's cargo

of radioactive death.  Greenpeace crew, aboard the Solo, continue to track the nuclear waste ship's course, which now clearly appears to be heading for Cape Horn, on a South American route.

    <P>The Pacific Pintail has been denied access to Uruguayan

jurisdictional waters.  Previously, Argentina and Chile demanded the vessel

stay outside of their waters. Yesterday Greenpeace's ship Solo was

informed, however, that the Argentinean authorities are in negotiation with

Japan through diplomatic channels over the passage of the shipment around

Cape Horn.



     <P>Trade Unions are increasing their opposition to the transport of

radioactive wastes. In Chile, the National Chilean Federation of small-

scale fishermen (CONAPACH) have made a statement against the traffic of

radioactive materials to and from Japan, and warn of the dangers posed to

marine resources by the transport of radioactive materials. The statement,

issued last Friday in Valparaiso, Chile's main port, also expresses concern

over the "arrogance showed by the governments of Japan, France and England"

and calls on the government of Chile "to prevent the ship from calling in

any of this Nation's ports". 

In addition CONAPACH stated that "freedom of navigation must not be invoked

in order to endanger international security, human health and natural

resources".  



     <P>On March 13th, the Brazilian National Fishers Movement (MONAPE),

released a statement against the shipment. MONAPE called for the rejection

of "these criminal acts against the environment" and condemned governments

that allowed the threat of these nuclear waste shipments to the sea and to

the fisheries and fishers to continue. 



     <P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's

cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo

<H4>RADIOACTIVE WASTE 450 MILES SOUTHEAST OF BUENOS AIRES;
ARGENTINIAN NAVY FLIES OVER PACIFIC PINTAIL
</H4>
     <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 38 degrees and 50
minutes South and 46 degrees and 54 minutes West, at a distance of some 450
miles off the Argentine coast. We are sailing on a compass course of 202
degrees and at a speed of 15 knots.

     <P>Today, the Argentine Navy flew over the Pacific Pintail with a search and
rescue aircraft. They notified the captain of the Pintail that his ship had
entered the search and rescue area under the responsibility of the Argentine
Navy. Over the past days the Pintail has been sailing at much slower speed
than before and only this morning the ship with its cargo of radioactive waste
has increased its speed to 15 knots, for reasons unknown to us on the Solo.

     <P>Countries in Latin-America have expressed their concern and
opposition to the shipment of plutonium wastes traveling through their region. 
Should the Pacific Pintail succeed in rounding Cape Horn, then the operators
and managers of the Pacific Pintail and the plutonium producers Cogema and
BNFL will likely start to use the Cape Horn route for all their future
shipments.  On average every two months highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel
from reactors in Japan is transported for plutonium production to France and
the UK. In addition, regular shipments of highly radioactive plutonium wastes
and separated plutonium are scheduled to make similar transit. 

     <P>Greenpeace calls for a world-wide ban on the production of all
plutonium--whether military or civil--in its campaign to halt nuclear weapons
production and proliferation.  The organization is encouraging countries
around the world to call for a halt to the plutonium industry at the Extension
Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which will be in
April at the United Nations in New York.

<P><H4>430 MILES EAST OF MAR DEL PLATA, ARGENTINA</H4>
</head>
<body>
     <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 40 degrees and 54
minutes south and 48 degrees and 16 minutes west, at a distance of some 430
miles off the Argentine city Mar del Plata. We are sailing on a compass course
of 204 degrees and at a speed of 11.5 knots. Yet again the Pintail has slowed
its approach of Cape Horn for reasons unknown.

     <P>Greenpeace applauds the opposition increasingly expressed by the people
and countries in Latin America to the shipment of radioactive waste through
their coastal waters. It is an absolute outrage that this opposition is not
being listened to by the plutonium industry in France and Japan, nor by the
ship-operators of the Pacific Pintail, Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited
(PNTL) of Barrow in England.  PNTL operates not only the Pacific Pintail, but
a whole fleet of nuclear waste transport vessels, which are:  The Pacific
Pintail, the Pacific Sandpiper, the Pacific Crane, the Pacific Teal and the
Pacific Swan. 

     <P>Greenpeace believes the only way to halt these shipments is by a formal
prohibition of ships carrying nuclear waste, nuclear spent fuel or plutonium
to transit the 200 mile zone around Cape Horn under the jurisdiction of
Argentina and Chile, and to forbid these shipments to pass outside of these
waters out of safety precautions in order to protect Argentina's and Chile's
coastal waters and the Antarctic environment from the threat of radioactive
pollution.  Today, Greenpeace Solo crew members painted a nuclear warning message, to be visible from the air, for any military aircraft, highlighted the danger of seabound nuclear waste transport.

     <P>Should the shipment with the Pacific Pintail succeed in rounding Cape
Horn, then it can be expected that the Cape Horn route will be used for future
shipments of spent fuel, nuclear waste and plutonium. On average, once every
two months a shipment of highly radioactive used nuclear fuel is transported
from Japan to France and the UK, while in the future some 30-50 more return
shipments are expected of nuclear wastes for Japan. In addition to these
shipments, the plutonium industry is looking for a transport route to ship the
weapons-grade plutonium produced in France and the UK. In 1992 a shipment of
plutonium invoked enormous opposition from coastal nations along the transport
route along the coasts of Africa, Australia, New Zealand and
many Pacific Island States.

     <P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's cargo
of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo (phone:
++871-1301166--Warning $10 per minute), or Karen Richardson at Greenpeace UK

Greenpeace today will issue an Internet press release to all technical and communications magazines informing them of Greenpeace's innovative use of the Net.  Greenpeace updates the course of the Pacific Pintail, as shadowed by the Solo, twice daily, with pictures and sounds from the voyage.  Greenpeace believes that by transmitting news, pictures, and sound directly from the site of Greenpeace activity directly into the Internet they will significantly increase the public's awareness of environmental degradation.  "By giving the public direct access to news stories we are able to increase awareness of environmental issues without interference by the traditional, and increasingly conservative, news media.  We are also making a significant contribution to the rapid development of the Internet", says Jim Sweet, Information Technology Manager at Greenpeace Communications.

     <P>The Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was at a position of 43
degrees and 32 minutes South and 49 degrees and 49 minutes West,
or on a distance of some 450 miles off the Argentinean city Mar
del Plata. The continent's nuclear nightmare is sailing on a
compass course of 205 degrees and at a speed of 14 knots. The
Pacific Pintail is slowly making her way towards the Falkland,
or otherwise called the Malvinas Islands.

     <P>Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile have all asked that the
Pacific Pintail not be allowed within their jurisdictional
waters.  Until today, however, Argentina has only sent a Navy
Aircraft to check the position and course of the Pacific Pintail.
Should the ship maintain its course and speed then it will first
come within the 200 miles zone around the Falklands, and
subsequently pass into Argentinean waters around Saturday night
the 18th of March.

     <P>Greenpeace fears that Japan, France and the United Kingdom
are negotiating with the Argentinean authorities to let the
Pintail pass within the Argentinean 200 mile Economic Exclusion
Zone around Cape Horn. Such a decision by Argentina would amount
to giving cart blanche to the plutonium industry to make the
route around Cape Horn the preferred regular route for shipments
of radioactive waste, spent fuel and plutonium now that Caribbean
and Central American nations have successfully objected to such
transports in their region. 

     <P>Greenpeace calls on the Governments of Argentina and Chile
to abide by their statements not to allow the Pacific Pintail
into their Economic Exclusion Zones, and to formally and publicly
announce that no passage will be granted to any radioactive
waste, spent fuel or plutonium ship between Argentina, Chile and
the pristine continent of Antarctica--the most dangerous route
possible.

<P><H4>580 MILES EAST OF PUERTO DESCADO; PINTAIL AIMS FOR PASSAGE OF CAPE HORN OVER WEEKEND</H4>
</head>

<body>

     <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 45

degrees and 58 minutes south and 51 degrees and 32 minutes west,

on a distance of some 580 miles East of the Argentinean city

Puerto Descado. We are sailing on a compass course of 205

degrees and at a speed of 13 knots.



     <P>Today Greenpeace released that it is almost certain that the

Pacific Pintail will attempt to sail around Cape Horn. The ship

will sail around Cape Horn in an attempt to minimize the

effectiveness of Argentinean and Chilean political and public

opposition to the radioactive waste shipment. Around midnight on

Saturday the ship is expected to enter the Argentinean Exclusive

Economic Zone and pass into Chilean waters Sunday evening.  

    

<P>In a letter to the producers of the radioactive plutonium

waste on board the Pacific Pintail and to its captain, Greenpeace

pointed to the inherent dangers of the Cape Horn route--heavy

seas and drift ice, for example--and informed the Captain and the

companies involved of the formal opposition to Pintail's imminent

passage. Both Argentina and Chile have stated not to allow the

Pintail into the waters under their jurisdiction.  Yesterday the

Chilean Senate passed a unanimous resolution asking the Executive

Branch to send ships to make sure that the Pacific Pintail not

sail through Chilean territorial or jurisdictional  waters.



     <P>Greenpeace called further on the companies involved to

immediately halt the dangerous shipment. In South America,

Uruguay, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador,

governments, unions, fishing groups and the people have all

voiced opposition to the dangerous nuclear shipment travelling

through their waters. Rather than trying to force its way through

legitimate opposition and one of the most dangerous seas on

Earth, the Pacific Pintail should end the plutonium trade

altogether. 

 

     <P>Greenpeace is calling for a world-wide ban on the production

of all plutonium--both military and civil--in its campaign to

halt nuclear weapons production and proliferation.  The

organization is encouraging countries around the world to call

for a halt to the plutonium industry at the Nuclear

Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks in April at the United

Nations in New York.

or it's cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas

PINTAIL CONTINUES FOR WEEKEND PASSAGE OF CAPE HORN</h4>



     <p>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 48

degrees and 22 minutes south and 53 degrees and 16 minutes west,

on a distance of some 470 miles East of the Argentinean city

Puerto Descado. We are sailing on a compass course of 210

degrees, at a speed of 13 knots. We are currently some 270 miles

North of the Falklands/Malvinas and expect to reach Argentinean

waters south of these islands by midnight, Saturday.

 

     <p>In an urgent telex from Solo to the Pacific Pintail,

Greenpeace today informed the captain of the Pacific Pintail that

we are gravely concerned that he is attempting to force his way

through the waters of a region where his ship and its radioactive

cargo have been rejected out of safety reasons and public

opposition. We demanded he return his ship to port. 

 

     <p>In South America, Uruguay, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil,

Chile and Ecuador, governments, unions, fishing groups and the

public have all voiced opposition to the dangerous nuclear

shipment travelling through their waters. The captain of the

Pacific Pintail and it's operators the British company Pacific

Nuclear Transport Ltd (PNTL) are acting in flagrant denial of the

democratic self-determination rights of the people of South

America. In Chile the Senate yesterday unanimously passed a

resolution about the Pintail's imminent passage asking its

Executive Branch to send Chilean ships to assure that the ship

not sail through Chilean territorial or jurisdictional waters.

<p><h4>PINTAIL ENTERS EEZ FALKLAND/MALVINAS ISLANDS</h4>
</head>
<body>
<p>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 0700 GMT was 50

degrees and 22 minutes south and 54 degrees and 44 minutes west,

on a distance of some 130 miles northeast of the

Falklands/Malvinas islands. We are sailing on a compass course

of 200 degrees, at a speed of 12 knots. We expect to reach

Argentinean waters South of these islands by midnight, Saturday.

 

     <p>The Argentinean House of Representatives at midnight

Wednesday, passed a resolution urging the Executive Branch of the

Argentinean Government to ban the Pacific Pintail in Argentinean

jurisdictional waters.

 

     <p>The current transport onboard the Pacific Pintail involves

glassified high level nuclear waste generated by plutonium

reprocessing in France for the Japanese. Greenpeace calls for a

world-wide ban on the production of all plutonium --both military

and civil--in its campaign to halt nuclear weapons production and

proliferation.  The organization is encouraging countries around

the world to call for a halt to the plutonium industry at the

Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks in April at the

United Nations in New York.

<P><H4>PINTAIL TO ENTER SATURDAY 0400 GMT INTO ARGENTINEAN EEZ
</H4>
     <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 1900 GMT was 52
degrees and 20 minutes south and 56 degrees and 28 minutes west,
on a distance of some 65 miles southeast of Port Stanley on the
Falklands/Malvinas islands.  The Pacific Pintail changed course
at 1500 GMT and is now steering a compass course of 225 degrees
at a speed of 10.5 knots.

    <P>We will enter the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone of
Argentina around 0400 GMT -- provided the Pintail maintains its
course and speed.  We are currently still some 95 miles away from
the boundary of the EEZ, and the Pintail could decide to follow
this border all the way around Cape Horn.
     
    <P>This afternoon we spoke with a representative from the
Argentinean Navy who inquired about the position of the Pintail.
Asked if Argentina was going to allow the shipment to pass
through its EEZ, he answered that at the very moment a "high
meeting was taking place on the subject."  The Argentinean House
of Representatives passed a resolution late Wednesday night
urging the Executive Branch of the Argentinean Government to ban
the Pacific Pintail out of the waters under Argentinean
jurisdiction.

    <P>In the mean time, the Chilean Government has taken a very
strong position on the looming passage of the Pintail through its
waters.  Chile's Government has banned the shipment from all its
territorial and jurisdictional waters and has entrusted its Navy
with enforcement.  In passing the ban, the Chilean Senate
referred to the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea stating that
maritime activities should not have a negative impact on the
protection and preservation of the marine environment and its
live resources.  The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral
Jorge Martinez Busch has said that naval planes and ships will
start surveillance of the Pacific Pintail as soon as the ship
gets close to Chilean waters.  Greenpeace expects that to happen
around 1100 GMT on Sunday.

     <P>It is unclear if the Argentinean authorities will actually
enforce their decision to prohibit the Pintail from their EEZ.
Should they choose to not enforce the prohibition then a
confrontation could occur between the Pintail and the Chilean
Navy when the ship crosses from Argentinean into Chilean waters. 

    <P>In an urgent telex from Greenpeace's ship Solo to the
Pacific Pintail yesterday, we informed the vessel's captain that
it is of grave concern to Greenpeace that he is attempting to
force his way through the waters of a region where his ship and
its radioactive cargo have been rejected out of safety concerns
and public opposition.

     <P>The current transport onboard the Pacific Pintail involves
glassified high level nuclear waste generated in the course of
plutonium reprocessing in France for the Japanese. Greenpeace
calls for a world-wide ban on the production of all plutonium
--both military and civil--in its campaign to halt nuclear
weapons production and proliferation.  Greenpeace is encouraging
countries around the world to call for a halt to the plutonium

<head><P>From:    Greenpeace vessel MV Solo tracking Pacific Pintail
<br>Date:    WED 22-MAR-95 08:03:25 GMT - DAY 28, PART I

<P><H4>PACIFIC PINTAIL STILL IN CHILE'S EEZ
</H4></head><body>
     <P>
The Pacific Pintail is at 0800 GMT in position latitude 55
degrees and 56 minutes south and longitude 074 degrees and 50
minutes west, on a course of 316 degrees with a speed of 12
knots.

<P>The Chilean authorities this morning have demanded the Pacific
Pintail leave the Chilean 200 mile EEZ provided that this would
not pose a threat to the ship's safe navigation.  The Pacific
Pintail's captain in a message to the Chilean Naval authorities
stated that he expects heavy weather conditions later today, and
that as a consequence he preferred to stay on his current course. 

<P>The Chilean Naval authorities subsequently granted the Pintail
permission to continue on its course out of reasons of safe
navigation, until it had passed the storm front. At that time
they demanded the Pacific Pintail turn west. The Pintail's
captain agreed that after the current storm front passed it would
sail directly out of Chilean's Exclusive Economic Zone.

<P>Yesterday, Chile's Foreign Minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, said
that a "very strong protest" will be delivered to the governments
of Japan, France and the UK over the high level nuclear waste
shipment through Cape Horn. Such steps are necessary he said "in
order to prevent a recurrence of this kind of activity, since we
understand that this took place in the framework of a long-term
programme" of high level nuclear waste shipments. Insulza also
reaffirmed earlier statements by Assistant Secretary of Foreign
Affairs, Mariano Fernandez, to the effect that Chile will "try
to strengthen international rules to prevent this kind of thing".

<P>On March 16th, the Chilean government adopted a resolution
forbidding the Pacific Pintail to sail in its territorial and
jurisdictional waters, (Resolution 12600/67 of March 16th, by the
Chilean Maritime Authority, General Directory for the Maritime
Territory and Merchant Marine, DIRECTEMAR).  What follows is a
preliminary translation of this resolution:

<P>The Chilean Maritime Authority, "considering that:
 
<P>1. It is the duty of the Maritime Authority to foresee the threat
to the marine environment, as well as to human health, life and
security in the seas, posed by the passage through national
sovereign an jurisdictional waters of the British ships Pacific
Pintail or European Shearwater, carrying a shipment of cylinders
with vitrified nuclear wastes containing 16.800.000 Curie units
of radioactivity.
 
<P>2. According to the principles of the new Law of the Sea, the
exercise of the right (to free) navigation should not have a
negative effect on the protection and preservation of the marine
environment and the conservation of live resources, the coastal
State having the duty to take care of the same.

<P>3. That the available international means are neither enough nor
appropriate to address the unforceable consequences of a
radioactive catastrophe.

<P>4. That the above mentioned transport violates the "precautionary
principle", which is embodied in the 1992 Rio Declaration on the
Environment and Development. 

<P>5. The relevant international bodies, the International Maritime
Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
following the recommendations issued by the IMO Committee for the
Protection of the Marine Environment, are carrying, in
association with UNEP, an in-depth study of the transport of
radioactive materials by sea, in order to adopt a Code on the
Safe Transport of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INA).

<P>6. Until the adoption of more stringent international
regulations, to address the actual safety requirements for the
transport of radioactive substances, it is necessary to ban the
passage through waters under national jurisdiction of all those
ships carrying such substances.

<P>7. Particularly severe weather conditions in the far South (of
the Continent) and the Cape Horn route specifically, increase the
ordinary risks of navigation.  
 
<P>In its preamble the Resolution, besides citing relevant national
Chilean legislation, refers to "Article 1 and all other articles
of the 12 November 1981 Lima Convention on the Protection of the
Marine Environment and the Coastal Zone in the Southeastern
Pacific".    

<P>Greenpeace applauds the efforts of the Chilean government in its
commitment to its responsibilities to protect the marine
environment in the waters under its jurisdiction from the
possible effects of an accidental release of highly radioactive
waste, as well as its concern and care for the safe navigation
of the Pacific Pintail. There is no doubt that an accident
involving the Pacific Pintail could result in long term and
possibly irreversible degradation of the delicate environment of
the Antarctic coasts and waters surrounding Cape Horn.   

<P>Greenpeace calls on Chile and Argentina to adopt further national
legislation to prohibit the transit, sailing and stay of
plutonium and nuclear waste shipments in the waters under their
jurisdiction, and to seek the support from the international
community in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to close the
current gap between Chilean jurisdictional waters and the
Antarctic Treaty Area. This gap would allow the nuclear waste
carriers of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd (PNTL), the
owner/managers of the Pintail, to select the Southern route
around Cape Horn for its future transports of spent nuclear fuel,
nuclear waste and plutonium.
     
<P>If additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's
cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas Bruyne
on the Solo (phone: ++871-1301166--$10 per minute), or Karen
Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone: ++44-171-226-3151). Photo,

<H4>CAPTAIN OF PINTAIL SAYS PACIFIC PINTAIL UNABLE TO ALTER COURSE
BECAUSE OF SAFETY OF NAVIGATION;
PINTAIL PREPARES FOR CROSSING OF PACIFIC TOWARDS JAPAN</H4>

<P>At 2100 GMT, the Pacific Pintail is at latitude 54 degrees and
36 minutes south and longitude 078 degrees and 56 minutes west,
on a course of 290 degrees with a speed of 12 knots.

<P>In discussion with the Chilean Navy this morning, the British
flagged freighter Pacific Pintail told Chilean authorities it
would leave the Chilean Exclusive Economic Zone as soon it would
be possible to do so without jeopardizing the ship's safe
navigation.  These concers are an indication of the dangers posed
by weather conditions to these radioactive waste shipments i the
waters around South of Cape Horn.

<P>At 2100 GMT the Pacific Pintail was at a distance of 180 miles
off the Chilean Coast and Greenpeace estimates that the vessel
will leave Chilean jurisdictional waters around 2400 GMT tonight
to start on her journey to cross the Pacific Ocean.

<P>Greenpeace applauds the Chilean government's efforts to protect
the marine environment in its jurisdictional waters from the
possible effects of an accidental release of highly radioactive
waste, as well as its concern and care for the safe navigation
of the Pacific Pintail. There is no doubt that an accident with
the Pacific Pintail could result in long term and irreversible

  <P><H4> PACIFIC PINTAIL IN PACIFIC -- WILL PASS EASTER ISLAND FIRST
</H4>
<P>The Pacific Pintail steamed into the Pacific Ocean this morning.
The present position of the Pintail at 1900GMT is 52 degrees 55
minutes south, and 085 degrees and 50 minutes west.  The ship's
course is 290 degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 12 knots.
The first Pacific Island that the Pacific Pintail will pass on
its journey to Japan will be Easter Island, famous for its
immense statues.

<P>Behind the Moai cult statues of Easter Island goes an amazing and
tragic story of ecological disaster caused by the unawareness of
human society. The island's statues looking South over the waters
where the Pacific Pintail with it's nuclear cargo will sail
towards Japan, gaze also over much overused and depleted lands.
For most of its history Easter Island was forested, while these
days hardly any trees remain. Growing population, and rapid
deforestation for agriculture and the Moai cult accelerated
centuries ago the island's ecological destruction.  The remains
of a vanished culture look down through the eyes of Easter
Island's statues, while Pacific Island states are preparing for
the passage of the most dangerous waste that our society has
produced. 

<P>In the Pacific, already some states have expressed their concern
and opposition to the 14 tons of radioactive waste onboard of the
Pacific Pintail.  On Feb 23, '95, the Government of Fiji formally
contacted the Japanese Government to protest the shipment and
demand that it not be allow it to pass through the waters of the
Fiji Economic Exclusion Zone.  Fiji further called on Japan to
reconsider its policy on the transport of highly radioactive
waste. 

<P>On Jan 17, '95 the Federated States of Micronesia issued a
statement of concern regarding the possibility of Japan making
transports of highly radioactive nuclear waste through the region
which could lead to "catastrophic" accidents.  The FSM voiced its
desire to see the South Pacific Forum put into force an agreement
which will ban the importation or transboundary movement of such
transports through the region. 

<P>On Jan 17, '95, in a letter to the Japanese Embassy in Suva
(Nauru) the Nauru Department of External Affairs conveyed to the
Japanese Government its strong concern regarding highly
radioactive waste shipments sailing through the South Pacific
Islands region. In the letter the Nauru Government opposed the
planned shipment of nuclear waste through their Exclusive
Economic Zone of 200 miles and called upon Japan to respect
Nauru's concerns.  The Department also called on Japan to
postpone the shipment until a full safety and environmental
analysis, to guarantee the elimination of all possible risks, had
been undertaken by the responsible governments and made available
to all concerned.   

<P>Previously, on Dec. 12, '94, US Representative for Hawaii,
Abercrombie, and the Delegate for Guam, Underwood, issued
statements of concern over the shipment of HLW from France to
Japan. The two members of the US House of Representatives stated
that the people of Hawaii and Guam should not be placed in harm's
way, and that the US should make a good-faith, timely effort to
address the unresolved safety questions raised by plans to ship
high-level radioactive wastes by sea through US ports and/or
territorial waters.

<P><H4>PACIFIC ISLAND STATES ALSO IN FUTURE TO BE DENIED INFORMATION
    ABOUT ROUTE PLUTONIUM AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE SHIPMENTS
</H4></head><body>
    <P>The Pacific Pintail's position (0700 GMT) is some 500 miles
straight West of Quarello (Chile), in a position of 51 degrees
21 minutes south, and 089 degrees and 03 minutes west.  The
ship's course is 320 degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 13
knots. The Pacific Pintail is sailing towards Easter Island that
lies some 1,750 miles to the northwest.

    <P>While the Pacific Island states are preparing for the
passage of the Pacific Pintail, the nuclear industry has stated
that essential information concerning the route shipments of
radioactive waste and plutonium will follow also in the future
will be kept secret. British, French and Japanese plutonium
industry officials clearly intend to prevent that a growing
number of nations will condemn these highly dangerous shipments,
and subsequently request at international meetings for the
industry to halt them.  

    <P>The current transport onboard the Pacific Pintail involves
glassified high level nuclear waste generated in the course of
plutonium reprocessing in France for the Japanese. Greenpeace
calls for a world-wide ban on the production of all plutonium
--both military and civil--in its campaign to halt nuclear
weapons production and proliferation.  The organization is
encouraging countries around the world to call for a halt to the
plutonium industry at Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
talks at the United Nations in New York in April. The island
States of the Pacific may well play a crucial role in the voting
that is to take place over the extension of the Treaty.

<P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or
it's cargo of plutonium waste contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo
(phone: ++874-1301166--$10 per minute), or Karen Richardson at
Greenpeace UK (phone: ++44-171-226-3151). Photo, video, or other
media requests to Blair Palese or Mark Warford at Greenpeace
Communications (phone: ++44-171-8330-600).

<P>Media and others interested in tracking the shipment's route
daily should access Greenpeace World Wide Web site at:

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP HEADS TOWARD EASTER ISLAND</H4>

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is some 650 miles west
of the Chilean coast, in a position of 49 degrees 24 minutes
south, and 091 degrees and 50 minutes West.  The ship's course
is 315 degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 13 knots. The
Pacific Pintail is sailing towards Easter Island which lies some
1,600 miles to the northwest.

<P>The Pacific Pintail is carrying glassified high-level nuclear
waste generated by plutonium reprocessing in France for the
Japanese. Greenpeace calls for a world-wide ban on the production
of all plutonium--both military and civil--in its campaign to
halt nuclear weapons production and proliferation. We encourage
countries around the world to call for a halt to the plutonium
industry at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks at
the United Nations in New York in April. The island states, who
have been a strong voice of protest against the nuclear waste
shipment, may well play a crucial role in the NPT extension vote.

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP CONTINUES TOWARD EASTER ISLAND</H4>
</H4></head><body>
    <P>
The Pacific Pintail's position (0700 GMT) is some 1,4000 miles
southeast of Easter Isalnd, in a position of 47 degrees 25
minutes south, and 94 degrees and 25 minutes west.  The ship's
course is 320 degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 13 knots.

 <P>It is expected that outraged Caribbean and Latin American nations
will use next week's OPANAL General Conference to raise the issue
of regional protest to the current and future nuclear waste and
plutonium transports.  OPANAL is the Secretariat for the regional
"Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
and the Caribbean."  The OPANAL General Conference will last from
March 28 to 30 and will be held in Vina del Mar, Chile. While it
is not yet clear which route the Pacific Pintail will now take
to Japan, the transport is likely to continue to violate the
rights of states that have prohibited the shipment of radioactive
waste from the waters under their jurisdiction. 

 <P>This transport of highly radioactive waste with the Pacific
Pintail is, since 1994, an example of the renewed dedication of
the Japanese government to its massive civil plutonium
production, procurement and stockpiling program. As part of this,
and with the help of the United Kingdom and France, Japan is
quietly preparing to make more than one hundred transoceanic
shipments of plutonium, spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste
before the year 2000.  The shipment onboard the Pacific Pintail
consists of 28 radioactive waste glass blocks.  An additional
3,000 shipments of highly radioactive glass blocks to Japan are
expected.  Each unshielded block is so deadly that a person
standing one meter from one would receive a lethal dose of
radiation in less than a minute. A fully loaded PNTL transport
ship could consist of over 140 of these blocks, or in other words
some 10 times the radioactivity released during the Chernobyl
disaster. 

 <P>This transport is legitimised by the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty's (NPT) promotion of nuclear power and plutonium
reprocessing.  Both France and the United Kingdom have been
actively promoting an indefinite extension of the NPT. An
indefinite extension would protect the position both countries
enjoy in the world-order and their special ability to threathen
global security with their nuclear forces. 

 <P>Greenpeace urges en route nations to call for a ban on plutonium
production at talks on the NPT in New York in April and to oppose
indefinite extension of the Treaty, which would amount to a
permanent licence to produce plutonium and other nuclear
bomb-usable material and ship it around the globe.

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP CONTINUES ON COURSE THROUGH THE PACIFIC</H4>
</head><body>
   
<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (0700 GMT) is 43 degrees 30
minutes south, and 98 degrees and 56 minutes west.  The ship's
course is 320 degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 13 knots.

<P>The production of the radioactive waste onboard of the Pintail
is a direct consequence of the weapons-usable, commercial
plutonium production programs of France, the UK and Japan.  These
programs are pose an extreme danger to current non-proliferation
objectives.  France, Japan and the United Kingdom have repeatedly
expressed their resistance to any restraints on their commercial
proliferation activities.  Currently no regime exists that limits
the production of and trade in commercial weapons-usable fissle
materials, while the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),
through its promotion of nuclear power, acts as a stimulus for
commercial plutonium production and trade.  Both France and the
United Kingdom have been actively promoting an indefinite
extension of the NPT.  An indefinite extension would also protect
the position both countries enjoy in the world-order and their
special ability to threathen global security with their nuclear
forces.

<P>Greenpeace urges NPT parties to call for a ban on both civil and
military plutonium production at talks on the Treaty's extension
in New York in April and to oppose indefinite extension. An
indefinite extension of the NPT would amount to a permanent
licence to produce plutonium and high level radioactive waste and
ship it around the globe for the indefinite future.

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is some 960 miles
southeast of Easter Island, in a position of 41 degrees 35
minutes south, and 101 degrees and 5 minutes west. The ship's
course is 320 degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 12 knots.
Both yesterday and today the Pintail stopped in full sea for over
hour--we think for engine maintenance or engine repairs. At 1730
GMT we sailed again at our regular speed in the direction of
Easter Island which we expect to pass on a distance of some 220
miles.

<P>The weather has been fair as we've moved further north away from
Antarctica.  We continue to hear news of additional trouble in
Antarctica where, recently, an iceberg the size of a small
country, dropped off of the continent.  It is ironic that this
and other news about Antarctica being effected by warmer earth
temperatures should occur just as the Berlin Climate meeting is
to start on Monday.  See <a href="http://www.cyberstore.ca/greenpeace/climate/default.html">Greenpeace's Climate Summit section </a>on
this home page for additional information.  Greenpeace urges
those concerned about possible global warming impacts to put
pressure on their governments to commit to strong CO2 emission
cuts for the future.

The Pacific Pintail's position (0700 GMT) is 800 miles southeast
of Easter Island, in a position of 39 degrees 35 minutes south,

 <P>The Climate Summit in Berlin begins today with more than one
hundred countries meeting to discuss one of the most important
issues we now face -- getting the world's global warming gas
emissions under control to prevent global warming.  There is a
strong link between the Climate meeting and our mission tracking
in this nuclear waste ship since pro-nuclear power advocates
insist that nuclear power is the only answer to stabilizing CO2
(global warming gas) emissions.  This argument has been used to
legitimize a power source that is expensive, ultimately linked
to nuclear weapons capability, dangerous and non-sustainable. 
Nuclear waste alone -- thousands of barrels of radioactive
material with a life-span of over 100 thousand years being
produced by nuclear waste states every year -- is enough to
question the viability of nuclear power.  Clearly its time for
something new.  

 <P>At the Berlin summit, Greenpeace will call on nations to commit
to exploring alternative, sustainable and non-polluting energy
sources with the same vigour many of them have pursued oil, coal
and nuclear power.  See our <a href="http://www.cyberstore.ca/greenpeace/climate/default.html"> Climate Summit section</a> for more information.

    <P>
The Pacific Pintail's position (0700 GMT) is 520 miles southeast
of Easter Island, in a position of 35 degrees 50 minutes south,
and 107 degrees and 24 minutes west. The ship's course is 320
degrees and it is sailing at a speed of 12 knots. We expect to
pass Easter Island on a distance of some 220 miles in less than
two days.

<P>Hawaii. We are some 4,500 miles southeast of it, or about 14 days
sailing. Already last December Representative Abercrombie of
Hawaii issued a statement of concern over the shipment of high
level nuclear waste from France to Japan together with his
colleague from Guam, Delegate Underwood.  Upon the release of
Greenpeace's study on safety issues in the sea transport of
vitrified high-level radioactive wastes to Japan (the Lyman
Report), the two members of the US House of Representatives
stated that the people of Hawaii and Guam should not be placed
in harm's way. They further called on the US administration to
make a good-faith, timely effort to address the unresolved safety
questions raised by plans to ship the radioactive waste by sea
through US ports and/or territorial waters. Little has happened
since.  We urge all net users/surfers to demand these shipments
be stopped and that they not be permitted into US waters. 
Contact your elected officials or e-mail President Clinton at the
following address:  XXXXXX.  Let them know the global trade in
plutonium will not be tolerated!

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position as of 1900 GMT is 395 miles south
of Easter Island, in a position of 33 degrees 46 minutes south,
and 109 degrees and 33 minutes west. The ship's course is 320

over a day.

<P>Today the OPANAL General Conference started where Caribbean and
Latin American countries will discuss what measures to take to
limit and restrict shipments of radioactive waste and plutonium
through their region. The conference is being held in Vina del
mar, Chile from March 28 to 30, the country that took the
strongest action to keep the Pacific Pintail out of its waters
in recent weeks. OPANAL is the Secretariat for the regional
"Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
and the Caribbean."  Given recent statements by the plutonium
industry about increased secrecy around future transports of
radioactive waste and plutonium, it is likely that without firm
regional prohibitions, radioactive waste and plutonium shipments
will continue to pose a threat to the delicate environments of
the Caribbean and Latin American states.  

<P>Greenpeace has called on all countries along possible shipping
routes to prohibit these highly dangerous radioactive transports
from the waters under their jurisdiction.  Countries have the
jurisdiction to protect and preserve the marine environment under
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 
In doing so, countries should apply the precautionary principle
as formulated in the 1992 Rio Declaration on the protection of
the sea, to prevent possible damage and irreparable harm to the
marine environment and ecosystems in the waters under their
jurisdiction. 

<P>Greenpeace has prepared a paper that deals with the international
law applicable to the passage of vessels carrying highly
radioactive cargo. The paper, entitled "The Right to Control
Passage of Nuclear Transport Vessels Under International Law" is
available from Greenpeace International. 
  
<P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or

<P>The legal paper on the right to control nuclear transports under
international law is now on the Internet as a hypertext document.

           <P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP NEARS EASTER ISLAND</H4>
</head><body>
    <P>
The Pacific Pintail's position as of 0600 GMT is 290 miles south
of Easter Island, which we expect to pass today on a distance of
some 220 miles. The Pintail is in a position of 31 degrees 56
minutes south, and 111 degrees and 32 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 320 degrees, sailing at a speed of 13 knots. The
Pintail is some 4,180 miles southeast of Hawaii.

<P>Yesterday was the start of the OPANAL General Conference where 
Caribbean and Latin American countries will discuss what measures
to take to limit and restrict shipments of radioactive waste and
plutonium through the region. The conference is held in Vina del
mar, Chile from March 28 to 30.  OPANAL is the Secretariat for
the regional "Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
Latin America and the Caribbean." 

<P>Greenpeace has called on all countries along possible shipping
routes to prohibit these highly dangerous radioactive transports
from the waters under their jurisdiction.  Countries have the
jurisdiction to protect and preserve the marine environment under
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 
In doing so, countries should apply the precautionary principle
as formulated in the 1992 Rio Declaration on the protection of
the sea, to prevent possible damage and unrepairable harm to the
marine environment and ecosystems in the waters under their
jurisdiction. Greenpeace has prepared a paper that deals with the
international law applicable to the passage of vessels carrying
highly radioactive cargo.*

<P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or
it's cargo of plutonium waste, please contact Bas Bruyne on the
Solo (phone: ++874-1301166--Warning $10 per minute), or Karen
Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone: ++44-171-226-3151). Photo,
video, or other media requests to Blair Palese or Mark Warford
at Greenpeace Communications (phone: ++44-171-833-0600).  

<P>The legal paper on the right to control nuclear transports under
international law is now on the Internet as a hypertext document.

       <H4> NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP TO PASS EASTER ISLAND AS OPANAL MEETING BEGINS IN CHILE</H4>

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is 270 miles south of
Easter Island, which we are passing today on a closest distance
of 250 miles.  The Pintail is in a position of 30 degrees 12
minutes south, and 113 degrees and 24 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 317 degrees, sailing at a speed of 12.5 knots.
The Pintail is some 4,050 miles southeast of Hawaii, which lies
straight ahead of the vessel.

<P>At the OPANAL General Conference, which started yesterday, Chile
made a strong declaration conveying to the international
community of nations its opposition to the shipment of
radioactive waste through the South American region. Earlier this
month, the Pacific Pintail carrying 28 canisters of high level
radioactive waste from France to Japan, violated Chile's
prohibition of the ship's passage through its jurisdictional
waters. 

<P>The Chilean Government denied the Pintail passage on the basis
of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Chilean
government passed a resolution denying the nuclear waste ship
entrance to its 200 mile economic zone based on the precautionary
principle of the 1992 Rio Declaration on the protection of the
sea to prevent possible damage and irreparable harm to the marine
environment and ecosystem. The Pacific Pintail was forced out of
the Chilean economic zone by the Chilean Navy.

<P>OPANAL is the Secretariat for the regional "Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the
Caribbean."  Given recent statements by the plutonium industry
about increased secrecy around future transports of radioactive
waste and plutonium, it is likely that without firm regional
prohibitions radioactive waste and plutonium shipments will
continue to pose a threat to the environments of the Caribbean
and Latin American states.  Greenpeace has called on all
countries along possible shipping routes to prohibit these highly
dangerous radioactive transports from the waters under their
jurisdiction, and has prepared a legal paper that evaluates
international law applicable to the passage of vessels carrying
highly radioactive cargo.* 

<P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or
it's cargo of plutonium waste, contact Bas Bruyne on the Solo
(phone: ++874-1301166--WARNING $10 PER MINUTE), or Karen
Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone: ++44-171-226-3151). Photo,

Communications (phone: ++44-171-833-0600).

<br>Date:    THU 30-MAR-95 05:52:19 GMT - DAY 36, PART I

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP STEAMS THROUGH THE PACIFIC EN ROUTE TO JAPAN</H4>
</head><body>
    <P>
The Pacific Pintail's position (0700 GMT) is 28 degrees 34
minutes south, and 115 degrees and 00 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 320 degrees, sailing at a speed of 12 knots
through the Pacific.

<P>We've learned through Greenpeace Pacific that the islands of
Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) has sent a message to the Japanese
Embassy in FIJI protesting the plutonium shipment.  It refers to
Greenpeace's Lymans report which sites safety concerns about the
shipment and its cargo.  The FIJI TIMES and ISLANDS BUSINESS
(main regional magazine) have run full page ads by a group called
Japanese Citizens Concerned About Plutonium, protesting the
Pintail's voyage with clip-off coupons to be sent by readers to
the Japanese Embassy in FIJI.  

<P>This transport of highly radioactive waste is an example of the 
renewed dedication of the Japanese government to its massive
program of civil plutonium production, procurement and
stockpiling.  As part of this program, and supported by the
United Kingdom and France, Japan is quietly preparing to make
more than one hundred trans-oceanic shipments of plutonium, spent
nuclear fuel and radioactive waste before the year 2000. 

<P>These shipments are legitimised by the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty's (NPT) promotion of nuclear power and plutonium
reprocessing.  Ultimately the only solution is to halt the
industry that produces the plutonium waste onboard the Pacific
Pintail. Greenpeace is calling for a world-wide ban on the
production of all plutonium, both military and commercial.  The
organization is encouraging countries around the world to call
for a halt to the plutonium industry at the NPT Extension
Conference in April at the United Nations in New York. 

<P>Greenpeace also calls on the Pacific Island States to stand up
pressure from nuclear weapon states and to oppose indefinite
extension of the Treaty for which Pacific States will play a
crucial role.  An indefinite extension would protect the position
the nuclear weapon states enjoy in the world-order and their
special ability to threaten global security with their nuclear
forces.  France, the United Kingdom, the USA and the other
nuclear weapon states have been actively promoting an indefinite
extension of the NPT.

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP TRAVELS THROUGH PACIFIC EN ROUTE TO JAPAN ISLANDERS WELL-VERSED IN NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE</H4>

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is 26 degrees 34
minutes south, and 116 degrees and 48 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 320 degrees, sailing at a speed of 12.5 knots. 

<P>The Pacific islands have had more than their share of other
nation's nuclear testing and waste dumping.  The French have been
testing nuclear weapons both atmospherically and underground in
the Pacific islands up until their recent acceptance of a
temporary ban on such tests.  The US as well used the Bikini Atol
to test atmospheric nuclear weapons before moving all tests
underground in Nevada.  They too are taking part in the current
nuclear test moratorium for the time being.  

<P>These countries and others have looked to the Pacific for nuclear
waste dumping as well as for chemical weapons storage and
incineration.  Greenpeace's Pacific campaign has been fighting
these practices in the region for almost two decades.

<P>The people of the Pacific have become vocal opponents to their
world being used in this way by the nuclear states--one of the
reasons this nuclear waste shipment now travelling through their
waters is considered so heinous.  In areas where nuclear testing
has been carried out, long-term health impacts have been reported
in high numbers--thyroid cancer, miscarriages, birth defects. 
Greenpeace has released a number of reports along with photo and
video documentation throughout our years of work there and we've
joined Pacific islanders in their fight to prevent the
nuclearization of their islands.

<P>Greenpeace calls on countries in the Pacific and elsewhere along
possible shipping routes to prohibit these highly dangerous
radioactive transports from the waters under their jurisdiction.

can only be countered by a global ban on the separation of
plutonium.  Greenpeace is encouraging countries around the world

<P>Pacific states will play a crucial role during the vote on the

position the nuclear weapon states enjoy in the world-order and
their ability to threathen global security with their nuclear
forces.  France, the United Kingdom, the United States and other
nuclear weapon states have been actively promoting an indefinite

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP STEAMS THROUGH PACIFIC AS OPANAL
MEETING ISSUES STATEMENT AGAINST IT</H4>

The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is 22 degrees 30
minutes south, and 120 degrees and 38 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 320 degrees, sailing at a speed of 14 knots.  

<P>The OPANAL General Conference of 30 Latin American and
Caribbean
states has issued a declaration voicing "deep concern" about the
Japanese/French/British nuclear waste shipment currently being
tracked by Greenpeace in the Pacific.  The regional forum has
called for the enactment of international legislation to "avoid
the high risks inherent to these transports." OPANAL is the
"Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
and the Caribbean" and was established by the 1967 Treaty of
Tlatelolco which was enacted to prohibit nuclear weapons from the
region while calling on the nuclear weapons states to honour the
region's non-nuclear status. 

<P>The important declaration comes days after the British-flagged
ship "Pacific Pintail", carrying an unprecedented shipment of 14
tonnes of highly radioactive nuclear waste from France to Japan,
sailed through waters off of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile
despite the opposition of these Latin American nations.  The
Pintail had already been turned away from its preferred
Caribbean/Panama Canal route after intense political opposition
and condemnation was voiced in that region.  The secretive voyage
has occasioned bitter international opposition and has prompted
over 35 countries to ban the transport from their waters.

<br>Date:    SUN  2-APR-95 06:06:40 GMT - DAY 39, PART I

   <P><H4>RAINBOW WARRIOR TO JOIN SOLO TOMORROW IN THE
PACIFIC</H4>
</head><body>
<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 16 degrees 23
minutes south, and 126 degrees and 11 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 320 degrees, sailing at a speed of 14 knots. For
distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.  We have
heard by radio from the Greenpeace flaghip Rainbow Warrior, that
the ship will meet up with us briefly in the Pacific as we track
the nuclear waste ship.  The RW is on its way from Panama to
Tahiti as part of a Pacific tour addressing marine pollution and
other issues in the region.  We look forward to the contact.

<P>The radioactive waste onboard of the ship Pintail we are
tracking
has been generated by the commercial plutonium production
programs of France, the UK and Japan.  The trade in plutonium is
by many experts regarded as extremely dangerous to current
non-proliferation objectives since commercial plutonium can
directly be used for nuclear weapons purposes.

<P>The plutunium trade is especially dangerous since no
international regime exists that limits the production and trade
in this fissile material. It is expected that at the
Non-Proliferation Treaty Extension Conference (NPT) from April
17 - May 12 at the UN in New York, plutonium trade will be a
hotly discussed topic.  France, Japan and the United Kingdom have
repeatedly expressed their resistance to any restraints on their
commercial proliferation activities. 

<P>France and the United Kingdom have also stated their continued
reliance on nuclear weapons and the concept of nuclear deterrence
as fundamental basis for their own national security. As long as
these countries continue to rely on the use of nuclear weapons
to protect their national interests, others will also aim for
national security objectives along similar lines of thought. 
Since the NPT came into force in 1970, India, Pakistan, Israel,
Iraq, South Africa and North Korea have pursued -- and sadly in
most cases succesfully achieved -- indigenous production of
nuclear weapons. 

<P>France and the United Kingdom actively seek an unaltered,
unconditional and unlimited extension of the outdated and flawed
NPT to protect their priviledged position in the current world
order. Simultaneously these countries engage in the trade and
production of commercial plutonium, a practice that is not in the
interest of global security and that should be condemned by all
states party to the NPT.

<P>Greenpeace urges NPT Parties to call for a ban on both civil
and

From:    Greenpeace vessel MV Solo tracking Pacific Pintail
<br>Date:    SUN  2-APR-95 06:06:40 GMT - DAY 39, PART I

   <P><H4>RAINBOW WARRIOR TO JOIN SOLO TOMORROW IN THE
PACIFIC</H4>
</head><body>
<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 16 degrees 23
minutes south, and 126 degrees and 11 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 320 degrees, sailing at a speed of 14 knots. For
distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.  We have
heard by radio from the Greenpeace flaghip Rainbow Warrior, that
the ship will meet up with us briefly in the Pacific as we track
the nuclear waste ship.  The RW is on its way from Panama to
Tahiti as part of a Pacific tour addressing marine pollution and
other issues in the region.  We look forward to the contact.

<P>The radioactive waste onboard of the ship Pintail we are
tracking
has been generated by the commercial plutonium production
programs of France, the UK and Japan.  The trade in plutonium is
by many experts regarded as extremely dangerous to current
non-proliferation objectives since commercial plutonium can
directly be used for nuclear weapons purposes.

<P>The plutunium trade is especially dangerous since no
international regime exists that limits the production and trade
in this fissile material. It is expected that at the
Non-Proliferation Treaty Extension Conference (NPT) from April
17 - May 12 at the UN in New York, plutonium trade will be a
hotly discussed topic.  France, Japan and the United Kingdom have
repeatedly expressed their resistance to any restraints on their
commercial proliferation activities. 

<P>France and the United Kingdom have also stated their continued
reliance on nuclear weapons and the concept of nuclear deterrence
as fundamental basis for their own national security. As long as
these countries continue to rely on the use of nuclear weapons
to protect their national interests, others will also aim for
national security objectives along similar lines of thought. 
Since the NPT came into force in 1970, India, Pakistan, Israel,
Iraq, South Africa and North Korea have pursued -- and sadly in
most cases succesfully achieved -- indigenous production of
nuclear weapons. 

<P>France and the United Kingdom actively seek an unaltered,
unconditional and unlimited extension of the outdated and flawed
NPT to protect their priviledged position in the current world
order. Simultaneously these countries engage in the trade and
production of commercial plutonium, a practice that is not in the
interest of global security and that should be condemned by all
states party to the NPT.

<P>Greenpeace urges NPT Parties to call for a ban on both civil
and
military plutonium production at talks on the extension of the
NPT in New York in April. The organization furthermore calls on
all Parties to oppose an indefinite extension of the Treaty.

<P><H4>RAINBOW WARRIOR JOINS US TODAY IN TRACKING THE NUCLEAR

</head><body>

<P>

The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 12 degrees 08

minutes south, and 129 degrees and 52 minutes west, and the

ship's course is 322 degrees, sailing at a speed of 13.5 knots.

For distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.



<P>Today the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior joined Solo in
our

tracking of the Pacific Pintail's passage through the Pacific

Ocean. The Rainbow Warrior, on her way from Panama to Tahiti,

previously formed the centre of Greenpeace's anti-plutonium

campaign in the Caribbean. The Pacific Pintail avoided sailing

through the Caribbean after many countries voiced their

opposition against the passage of her radioactive cargo through

their waters.

<P>The Warrior will stay with us only briefly before heading to

Tahiti.  Greenpeace has been campaigning for a clean and nuclear-

free Pacific since the early years of its inception in the 70s

and has worked with local island people, repeatedly protested

French nuclear testing, nuclear and industrial waste dumping and

continues to work throughout the region.  The Rainbow Warrior

will travel from Tahiti to Australia, New Zealand and to a number

of other Pacific islands in the coming months to address marine

pollution and other issues there.



<P>Although our speed will not allow us to go aboard the Warrior
or

have her crew join us on the Solo, we have enjoyed meeting up

with our sister ship and exchanging radio information.  Today.

we were able to take some pictures from both the Solo and the

Rainbow Warrior which were sent back electronically to Greenpeace

Communiations. 



<P>The nuclear weapons states are currently seeking the
indefinite,

unconditional and unamended extension of a badly flawed, outdated

and unjust Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  Greenpeace calls on

the Pacific states to oppose an indefinite extension of the NPT,

and to call for the immediate compliance by the nuclear weapons

states of their (Article VI) obligations under the current

Treaty. In addition, Greenpeace urges Pacific Island States to

call on the NPT parties for negotiations on a global halt to the

production and trade in civil plutonium.

<P><H4>RAINBOW WARRIOR JOINS SOLO IN TRACKING NUCLEAR WASTE
SHIP</H4>
</head><body>

<P>
The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 07 degrees 55
minutes south, and 133 degrees and 34 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 319 degrees, sailing at a speed of 14 knots. 

<P>Yesterday the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior joined Solo
in
tracking the nuclear waste ship Pintail's passage through the
Pacific Ocean. The Rainbow Warrior, on her way from Panama to
Tahiti, previously formed the centre of Greenpeace's
anti-plutonium campaign in the Caribbean. The Pacific Pintail
avoided sailing through the Caribbean after dozens of countries
voiced opposition against the passage of her radioactive cargo
through their waters. 

<P>The Rainbow Warrior will continue to fight the threat of
nuclear
pollution in the Pacific posed by French nuclear testing,
as well as the trans-shipment and disposal of radioactive waste.

<P>The radioactive waste onboard of the Pintail has been
generated
in the course of the production of commercial plutonium for Japan
in the French plutonium plant la Hague.  Many experts regard this
industry as one of the major proliferation threats since the
produced plutonium can be directly used for nuclear weapons. 
While a halt is being negotiated to the production of plutonium
for military purposes at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament,
negotiations for a similar ban on the production of commercial
plutonium are being blocked by France, Japan, Russia and the
United Kingdom. 

<P>France and the United Kingdom have not only been blocking
progress on talks banning plutonium production, the two European
countries have also impeded negotiations for a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) -- a treaty which would ban all nuclear
testing. 

<P>While France has participated in the current moratorium on
nuclear testing, the country's Minister of Defense as well as its
candidates for the May 1995 Presidential elections have stated
the likeliness that France will resume nuclear testing in the
Pacific. 

<P>Nuclear testing and plutonium production are likely to be
substantiative topics of discussion during the April-May 1995
Extension Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in New
York.  The NPT conference will present the Pacific Island States
with an opportunity to not only make known their views on nuclear
pollution, but also to influence the choice our society will make
on nuclear disarmament and the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and materials. 


<P>The NPT divides our world into two classes of nations: those
with
nuclear weapons and those without, and then assigns different
rights and obligations to these countries.  This
institutionalization of nuclear weapons under the NPT has moved
the focus of foreign policy on security issues away from its
global context to a national one. An indefinite extension of the
NPT would protect the position the nuclear weapon states in the
world-order and their ability to threaten global security with
their nuclear forces.
  
<P>The majority of the world would prefer a nuclear-weapon free
world.  The choice of our time is: Do we demand the complete
elimination of all nuclear weapons or do we allow some nations
to have nuclear weapons leaving others, who see the power they
give a nation, to seek them. 
     
<P>The Nuclear Weapons States are seeking the indefinite,
unconditional and unamended extension of this badly flawed,
outdated treaty.  

<P>Greenpeace calls on all States to oppose an indefinite
extension
of the NPT, and to call for the immediate compliance by the
nuclear weapons states of their (Article VI) obligations under
the current Treaty. In addition, Greenpeace calls for
negotiations to start on a global halt to the production and
trade in civil plutonium.

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP CONTINUES THROUGH PACIFIC AS HUNGER
STRIKE
BEGINS IN JAPAN</H4>

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is 05 degrees 35
minutes south, and 135 degrees and 32 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 319 degrees, sailing at a speed of 14 knots. 

<P>We're continuing our journey through the Pacific in fair
weather
and good spirits.  The Rainbow Warrior has departed to continue
it's journey to Tahiti.  In Japan, we've learned through
Greenpeace staff there that a group of villagers began a hunger
strike in Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan, on Monday in protest
against the planned delivery of highly radioactive nuclear waste.

Those living in Aomori Prefecture have become increasingly
critical of their region being used as a nuclear waste dump by
the nuclear industry  We applaud their efforts and hope to join
them in support as the Solo continues to track the nuclear waste
ship into Japan.

<P>In the Pacific, we've heard from Greenpeace there that there
is
growing concern about the shipment of nuclear waste through their
waters and we know that in the US, Hawaii and Guam have made
efforts to keep the ship from their waters.  In Fiji, the
Japanese embassy took out a full page advertisement extolling the
virtues of their nuclear program as environmental to counter
continuous criticism by the public and the media.  We will hear
more what's going on in the region politically in the next week.

<br>Date:    WED  5-APR-95 06:08:21 GMT - DAY 42, PART I

         <P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP SIX DAYS FROM HAWAII
</H4></head><body>
<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 03 degrees 38
minutes south, and 137 degrees and 13 minutes west, and the
ship's course is 319 degrees, sailing at a speed of 14 knots. The
ship is 6 steaming days from Hawaii.  For distances to Pacific
Islands please see enclosed table.

<P>While the Pacific Pintail with its cargo of 14 tonnes of
deadly
radioactive waste is steaming toward Hawaii, the countries
responsible for the shipment of radioactive waste continue to
refuse to reveal over which exact route the ship will continue
its voyage to Japan.  The Pacific Pintail could either go north
or south of Hawaii, or could stop in a Hawaiian port in case of
an emergency, or for repairs.

<P>Given the lack of information about the shipment, and the
severe
consequences of an accident to the environment, the people and
the economy of Hawaii, Greenpeace calls on the government of
Hawaii not to allow the Pacific Pintail to enter the waters under
its jurisdiction--particularly since the companies involved have
refused to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment and to
provide credible emergency plan information.

<P>While the Pacific Pintail is slowly approaching Hawaii, the
US
Department of Energy has brushed aside concerns expressed over
the shipment by US Representative Abercombie from Hawaii.
Representative Abercombie and other US leaders questioned the
safety of the shipment and demanded for a full safety study to
be conducted. Previous demands by the elected US representatives
for independent safety and security studies on plutonium and high
level waste shipments were blocked by the US Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. 

<P>The  high level glassified radioactive waste onboard of the
Pintail has been generated in the course of the production of
commercial plutonium for Japan in the French plutonium plant la
Hague.  The production of commercially available plutonium 
is likely to be a substantiative topic of discussion during the
Extension Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in
New York (April 17). 

<P>Greenpeace calls on all nations not to allow the plutonium
production by a handful of nations to be set in stone by
extending the NPT as it is indefinitely.  Contact your government
officials and ask them not to bow to the will of nuclear nations
but instead to stand firm in supporting a new, stronger NPT that
will work toward eliminating nuclear weapons and nuclear
material--the original mandate of the NPT.

South, and 139 degrees and 09 minutes West, and the ship's course
is 319 degrees, sailing at a speed of 13.5 knots. The ship is 5.5

its voyage to Japan.  The Pacific Pintail could either go North
or South of Hawaii, and could stop in a Hawaiian port in case of
an emergency, or for repairs.

<P>The government of Hawaii should demand that this and future
nuclear waste transports not be made until a comprehensive
Environmental Impact Assessment is completed with full
participation of nations and territories at risk. Such a study
is required under the terms of US National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) since there is no doubt that a serious fire onboard
the Pacific Pintail would severely impact the delicate ecosystems
of Hawaii. 

<P>While the Pacific Pintail is approaching Hawaii, the US
Department of Energy has brushed aside concerns expressed over
the shipment by US Representative Abercombie from Hawaii.

<P>The production of commercially available plutonium has always
been perceived as an grave danger to serious non-proliferation
objectives. The US abandoned its own commercial plutonium
production programs out of-non-proliferation concerns.  Plutonium

course is 307 degrees and the ship's speed is 14.5 knots. For
distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.

<P>While the Pacific Pintail is approaching Hawaii, the Hawaiian
population is starting to speak out against the shipment of
radioactive waste, now some 5 days away from their coasts.  On
March 31, a state-wide meeting of 314 delegates to the Hawaii
State Teachers Association (HSTA) passed a resolution against the
radioactive waste shipment. The teachers union protest, which
follows previous trade union opposition to the shipment of
radioactive waste in Brazil, Chile and South Africa, urges
Pacific officials to oppose the shipment of nuclear waste
through the Pacific U.S. territorial waters. 

<P>Trade unions have long protested against the transport of
radioactive wastes. In 1990, the International Transport Workers'
Federation (ITF) formally spoke out against all trade and
shipment of radioactive waste. Greenpeace encourages national
unions to continue to voice their opposition to plutonium and
radioactive waste shipments, and calls on their international
umbrella organizations to voice their protests at the annual UN
International Labour Organization's meeting (ILO).

<P>The Pacific Pintail is currently allowed to call on Hawaiian
ports in case of emergency or for repairs.  It is still unclear
if the Pacific Pintail will follow a course North or South of the
Hawaiian Islands. 

<P>Ireland is also facing the risk of nuclear pollution posed by the
UK's plutonium reprocessing factory Sellafield as well as 
increasing radioactive waste transports through its waters. The
Irish Minister of State Mr. Eamon Gilmore TD announced on April
5th a number of measures which the Irish Government will be
taking to control the movement of nuclear ships in the Irish Sea. 

<P>Mr. Gilmore announced that he will be actively seeking support
from other countries to strengthen existing international
maritime regulations that govern the transport of radioactive
wastes.  He sited requirements to notify and consult with coastal
states prior to a journey such as that of the Pacific Pintail,
the provision of more specific information in relation to the
journey and cargo, restriction and exclusion of certain routes
for these hazardous shipments and the development of more
effective methods of safety planning and inspection as areas to
pursue.

Countries along possible shipping routes should prohibit these
highly dangerous radioactive transports from their jurisdictional
waters. Greenpeace has prepared a legal paper that evaluates
international law applicable to the passage of vessels carrying
highly radioactive cargo. This paper "The Right to Control
Passage of Nuclear Transport Vessels Under International Law" is
available from Greenpeace International, or via the Internet as
a hypertext document: http://www.xs4all.nl/~duncanc/nuk-law.html

Countries along possible shipping routes should prohibit these
highly dangerous radioactive transports from their jurisdictional
waters. Greenpeace has prepared a legal paper that evaluates
international law applicable to the passage of vessels carrying
highly radioactive cargo. This paper "The Right to Control
Passage of Nuclear Transport Vessels Under International Law" is
available from Greenpeace International, or via the Internet as
a hypertext document: http://www.xs4all.nl/~duncanc/nuk-law.html

<head><P>
From:    Greenpeace vessel MV Solo tracking Pacific Pintail
<br>Date:    FRI  7-APR-95 18:52:43 GMT - DAY 44, PART II

      <P><H4>PLUTONIUM WASTE CONTINUES THROUGH PACIFIC FOR JAPAN</H4></head><body>

<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (1900 GMT) is 06 degrees 23
minutes North, and 148 degrees and 30 minutes West. The Pintail's
course is 310 degrees and the ship's speed is 14 knots. For
distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.

<P>The radioactive waste onboard of the Pintail was generated by the
commercial plutonium production programs of France, the UK and
Japan. The trade in plutonium is extremely dangerous to current
non-proliferation objectives since commercial plutonium can
directly be used for nuclear weapons purposes. No international
regime currently exists to limit the production and trade in this
fissile material.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Extension
Conference (April 17, New York) is expected to debate the subject
of plutonium trade. France, Japan and the United Kingdom have
repeatedly expressed their resistance to any restraints on their
commercial proliferation activities.

<P>Greenpeace is calling for a world-wide ban on the production of
all plutonium, both military and commercial.  The organization
is encouraging countries around the world to call for a halt to
the plutonium industry at the NPT Conference. Greenpeace is also
calling on all Pacific Island States to withstand the pressure
of nuclear weapon states and to oppose an indefinite extension
of the Treaty which is tatamount to maintaining the nuclear
status quo. Pacific States will play a crucial role during the
final vote on the modality of the Treaty's extension. An
indefinite extension would protect the nuclear weapon states and
their ability to threathen global security with their nuclear
forces. France, the United Kingdom as well as the other nuclear
weapon states have actively promoting an indefinite extension of
the NPT.

<P>It's Sunday so no extended messages today.  The crew and I are
looking forward to seeing land again after our extended trip

<br>Date:    TUE 11-APR-95 06:09:44 GMT - DAY 48

                <P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP NEAR HAWAII</H4>
</head><body>
<P>The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 18 degrees 10
minutes North, and 168 degrees and 27 minutes West. The Pintail's
course is 310 degrees and the ship's speed is 14 knots. We are
at the moment some 280 miles southwest of the island Kaula, off
the coast of Kauai. For other distances to Pacific Islands please
see enclosed table.

<P>While The Pacific Pintail carrying 14 tonnes of highly
radioactive waste from the commercial plutonium industry is
making its way to Japan through the waters South of Honolulu
(Hawaii), the commercial plutonium industry in Germany is
planning for an expansion of plutonium programs.  German
utilities are currently negotiating contracts with Belgium,
French and UK plutonium fuel production plants for some 240
tonnes of plutonium.  Greenpeace revealed earlier in April that
German electrical utilities were also holding secret talks with
Britain and France for the production of another 600 tonnes of
plutonium fuel. 

<P>The global plutonium trade is primarily driven by Western
European countries and Japan, and has long been seen by many
nations, including the United States, as a severe threat to
regional and international attempts to curb nuclear
proliferation. The United States halted its own domestic
commercial plutonium program out of similar proliferation
concerns, but has supported Japan's plutonium program. 

<P>These new contracts come while the international community is
preparing to draw up guidelines on nuclear disarmament and
nuclear non-proliferation. Through France, Japan and the UK
commitments to national plutonium plants, the industry thus far
has succeeded avoiding having placed any restraints or
limitations on their production and trading capacity.  Last
month, a mandate for negotiations to start at the Geneva
Conference on Disarmament on a production ban on military fissile
(including plutonium) materials failed to include commercial
plutonium in its scope.  

<P>Greenpeace urges States who are party to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to call for parallel talks on a
similar production ban on commercial plutonium production as one
of the conditions for extension of the Treaty. Preventing nuclear
proliferation while shipping and trading plutonium around the
world to any state that can financially afford to buy, is bound
to fail and jeopardize global security. Commercial plutonium can
be used to produce nuclear weapons, as was demonstrated in 1962
when the US detonated a nuclear explosive made out of
reactor-grade plutonium.

<P>In the mean time Hawaiian Governor Cayetano is believed to have
sent a letter to US President Clinton expressing his grave
concern and the impossibility for Hawaii to deal with any
potential disaster caused by the nearby nuclear waste ship.  The
companies and governments involved in this plutonium trade have
scattered responsibility for the shipment making it unclear who
and/or how much liability coverage would be available should an
accident occur.  The nuclear waste onboard the Pintail consists
of 13 million curies, or about half of the radioactivity that was
released during the Chernobyl disaster on April 26, 1986.

      <P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP PASSES HAWAII EN ROUTE TO JAPAN</H4>
</head><body>
<P>
The Pacific Pintail's position (0600 GMT) is 20 degrees 41
minutes North, and 169 degrees and 35 minutes West. The Pintail's
course is 290 degrees and the ship's speed is 14 knots. We are
currently some 250 miles southwest of French Frigate Shoals. For
other distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.

<P>We continue on our travels to Japan keeping a safe distance from
the nuclear waste ship.  During our 49 day trip so far, the
Pintail has acknowledged no radio contact with us of any kind,
not even when we radioed to warn that they were nearing a site
where nuclear waste barrels were lost at sea of the coast of
Spain.  This refusal to communicate with us is synonymous with
the  companies and governments carrying out the plutonium trade's
refusal to provide the route of the shipment, any safety or
liability details and information about future plans.

<P>Hawaiian Governor Cayetano is believed to have sent a letter to
US President Clinton expressing his grave concern about the
shipment nearing his waters and the impossibility of Hawaii being
able to deal with any potential disaster. The companies and
governments involved in this plutonium trade have scattered
responsibility for the waste shipment and it is unclear how much
liability money would be available if an accident should occur. 
Marine insurers in 1991 refused to accept liability for the costs
of a nuclear accident because they could not afford to pay the
astronomical compensation claims that would result.  At the time,
a nuclear accident in the North Sea was estimated to total at
least $7 billion.  The shipment of nuclear waste onboard the
Pintail consists of 13 million curies, or some half of the
radioactivity that was released during the Chernobyl disaster on
April 26, 1986.

    <P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP NEARS JOHNSTON ATOLL EN ROUTE TO JAPAN</H4>
</head><body>
<P>

The Pacific Pintail with its 14 tonnes of radioactive waste is
in position (0600 GMT) is 22 degrees 08 minutes North, and 175
degrees and 13 minutes West. The Pintail's course is 290 degrees
and the ship's speed is 14 knots. We are now some 460 miles
northwest of Johnston Atoll, and some 1,250 miles northeast of
the Marshall Islands. For other distances to Pacific Islands
please see enclosed table.

<P>No safe solutions to date have been found for the serious issue
of disposing of radioactive waste, not even in industrialized
countries where these wastes are primarily produced. The
seriousness of the problems posed by radioactive contamination
is now tempting other, poorer, countries to alleviate their
national economic hardship by offering disposal sites for
radioactive waste to the richer nations of the industrialized
world.

<P>Today, Greenpeace has released a report which challenges a
proposal by the Marshall Islands to use one of their islands as
a long-term storage and permanent disposal site for nuclear
wastes and materials.  The Marshall Islands is no newcomer to the
disasters of the nuclear age.  During the 1940s and 50s, while
the Marshall Islands was administered as a UN Strategic Trust
Territory, the United States conducted 67 atmospheric nuclear
weapons test there, including one in 1954 (the Bravo Test) that
contaminated many of the inhabited atolls with radioactive
fall-out. As a result of increasing openness in the US about its
nuclear weapons test activities, information was released in 1994
showing how the country deliberately exposed the Marshallese
people to radiation as part of medical experiments. 

<P>The 40-page Greenpeace report details the disastrous history of
nuclear disposal worldwide and argues that in the absence of any
legal and liability framework covering such a repository in the
Marshall Islands, the plan is unlikely to receive international
support. Much of the radioactive waste considered by the report
for disposal remains radioactive for more than ten-thousand years
and combining this with anticipated climate change impacts for
low lying coral atolls the report concludes that the plan is a
recipe for disaster. 

<P>Moreover, given the lack of any proven technology for safe
nuclear waste disposal that will not leak, it will be only a
matter of time before radioactive waste will start to make its
way into the marine environment. US Secretary of Energy, Hazel
O'Leary has already responded to the proposal saying that US laws
alone would prevent the US from participating in such a scheme.

<P>Next week in New York the Review Conference of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) begins.  The radioactive waste
onboard of the Pacific Pintail and that considered for dumping
in the Marshall Islands have been generated in the course of
plutonium separation and nuclear weapons production. Efforts to
prevent nuclear proliferation are bound to fail as long plutonium
remains a commercial commodity and can be freely shipped around
the world.  While the nuclear weapons states are encouraging this
trade out of economic considerations, the non-nuclear weapons
states will hopefully demand steps that will truly forward
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Greenpeace calls on
Pacific nations to demand an end on the production and trade in
commercial plutonium at the NPT Extension Conference.

<P><H4>PINTAIL STEAMS AHEAD AS HAWAIIAN GOVERNOR RAISES OBJECTIONS WITH JAPAN
</H4>

</head><body>
<P>The Pacific Pintail with its 14 tonnes of radioactive waste is in position
(0600 GMT) is 23 degrees 30 minutes North, and 179 degrees and 03 minutes
West. The Pintail's course is 285 degrees and the ship's speed is 13.5 knots.
We are at the moment some 360 miles southwest of the Midway Islands. For other
distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.

<P>While making its way towards Japan to deliver its cargo of 14 tonnes of
radioactive waste, the Pacific Pintail's passage has raised further concerns
with Hawaii legislators.  In a letter to US President Bill Clinton, Hawaii
Governor Cayetano has renewed Hawaii's request for assistance in expediting
an evaluation of Hawaii's emergency plans in the event any shipments of
dangerous levels of radioactive waste and plutonium passing near Hawaii should
result in a nuclear emergency. In addition, the Hawaii Governor stated his
concern about the high level radioactive waste and plutonium shipments passing
Hawaii, to Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama and French President
Eduard Balladur.

<P>The transports of radioactive waste and plutonium find their origin in the
commercial plutonium separation industry in France, the United Kingdom and
Japan.  Through governmental support and encouragement the industry has thus
far avoided in having placed any restraints or limitations on its production
and trading capacity.  Last month, a mandate for negotiations to start at the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament on a production ban on military fissile
(including plutonium) materials failed to include commercial plutonium in its
scope. Since commercial plutonium can be used directly to produce a nuclear
weapon, the continuing production and commerce in this material not only
severely pollutes our planet, it also makes virtually certain that non-
proliferation objectives designed to prevent the spread of atomic weapons are
bound to ultimately fail. 

<P>Next week in New York the Review and Extension Conference of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) begins. The some 170 States Party to the Treaty
will vote how to extend the NPT, and decide what kind of steps need to be
undertaken to assure that nuclear weapons, technology and materials are not
spread all over the globe. While the nuclear weapons states are encouraging
the trade in plutonium out of economic considerations, the non-nuclear weapons
states hopefully will hold on to demands that will truly forward nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation.  

<P>Greenpeace urges all States Party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) to call for an end on the production and trade in commercial plutonium
at the NPT Extension Conference.

<H4>PREPARATIONS OF NPT CONFERENCE START AS PLUTONIUM WASTE APPROACHES JAPAN</H4>

</head><body>


<P>The Pacific Pintail with its 14 tonnes of radioactive waste is in position
(0600 GMT) is 24 degrees 47 minutes North, and 173 degrees and 14 minutes
East. The Pintail's course is 285 degrees and the ship's speed is 14 knots.
We are at the moment some 500 miles northeast of Wake island. For other
distances to Pacific Islands please see enclosed table.

<P>On April 17th one of the most important conferences of this decade will start
in New York. Some 170 countries of our global village will meet to discuss the
prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, weapons technology and materials
in the context of full nuclear disarmament and global security.  These aspects
of our common future will be negotiated at the NPT Extension Conference. The
nuclear non-proliferation treaty, or NPT, was negotiated 25 years ago as a
treaty to prevent the emergence of new nuclear weapons states while obliging
those that had nuclear weapons to dismantle them. The treaty institutionalises
a split in our world of two classes of states --those with and those without
nuclear weapons. 

<P>As a consequence some states without nuclear weapons have pursued methods of
developing the necessary components to produce them, while those that had (and
have) nuclear weapons increased their production and effectiveness as
instruments for genocide. The emergence of Indian, Iraqi, Israeli, Pakistani,
South African and North Korean nuclear weapon programs demonstrate the failure
of the NPT in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology and
materials. What is even worse, countries that have started to develop and
produce nuclear weapons of their own acquired in many cases the necessary
technology and materials from states that were party to the NPT, like France
and the United Kingdom.

<P>In the mean time what is about to become one of the gravest dangers to
security of our planet and our society is not dealt with. The NPT encourages
the commercial use of nuclear technology and under the umbrella of the Treaty,
France, the United Kingdom, and Japan have started programs for the production
of commercial plutonium, and are offering these to any bidder that can afford
their questionable services. In this spirit, the UK offered for example to
produce plutonium for South Korea. The destabilizing effects of plutonium
activities is especially evident in the increased nuclearization of East Asia,
in part as a consequence of Japan's commercial plutonium program.  Both
military-grade as commercial-grade plutonium can be used in the production of
a nuclear weapon as was demonstrated by a US nuclear weapons test using
commercial plutonium as far back as 1962.

 
<P>The selective application of non-proliferation policies by the nuclear-
weapons-states further underscores the discriminatory of the NPT.  While
attempts are being made to ban the production of fissile materials for weapons
purposes, the nuclear-weapons-states are reluctant to also ban  commercial
separation of plutonium by themselves and their allies, as well as to renounce
the availability of plutonium as a commercial commodity. These policies not
only severely undercut the effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime, they
also bind our society to a future of increased radioactive pollution. 

<P>On February 23rd, the Greenpeace ship Solo managed to begin what is soon to
become a 60-day tracking voyage of a shipment of radioactive waste. The waste,
transported by the British flagged Pacific Pintail, is the ultimate back-lash
of the plutonium industry. It has been generated in France in the process of
separating plutonium for Japan, and according to 'the contract' it has to be
transported to Japan for disposal. This while to date no scientific consensus
even exists around the safety of any disposal option for radioactive waste. 
The radioactive pollution of land, air and water around the plutonium
factories in the UK and France, however already has occurred and can be
measured from Ireland to Norway. The voyage of the Pacific Pintail with its
dangerous cargo of high level radioactive waste is an example of the enormous
problem brought onto our society by the plutonium industry. Serious nuclear
proliferation problems, enormous amounts of radioactive pollution dispersed
over land, and through water and air, and increased transports back and forth
from one country to another of radioactive waste so deadly that no country has
found a way or a place to even safely store it. 

<P>The current NPT with its outdated conceptual basis of a two-tiered structure
of nations, with its discriminatory approach to national security and its
sanctioning of the spread of nuclear technology as an inalienable right only
jeopardizes global security. An indefinite and unamended extension of this
treaty will not bring about nuclear disarmament nor will it halt the
proliferation of plutonium over our planet. 

<P>For the 1995 Non-Proliferation Extension Conference this implies that the
focus of discussion should be on strengthening global security by common
agreement on nuclear disarmament and on effective measures that prevent the
spread of nuclear weapon, their technology and the fissile materials to
produce them.  NPT Parties have the obligation to commence a verifiable and
controllable nuclear disarmament process that can genuinely lead towards a
future of nuclear weapons and increasing amounts of nuclear waste. 
 
<P>Greenpeace calls on all States party to the NPT to oppose the  indefinite
extension of the flawed and outdated Treaty.

<H4>REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE OF NPT STARTS TODAY</H4>

</head><body>


<P>The Pacific Pintail is in position (2100 GMT) is 26 degrees 59 minutes North,
and 163 degrees and 54 minutes East. The Pintail's course is 285 degrees and
the ship's speed is 14 Knots. For distances to Pacific Islands please see
enclosed table.

<P>The transports of radioactive waste and plutonium find their origin in the
commercial plutonium separation industry in France, the United Kingdom and
Japan. Through governmental support and encouragement this industry has thus
far avoided in having placed any restraints or limitations on its production
and trading capacity. Last month, a mandate for negotiations to start at the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament on a production ban on military fissile
(including plutonium) materials failed to include commercial plutonium in its
scope. Since commercial plutonium can be used directly to produce a nuclear
weapon, the continuing production and commerce in this material not only
severely pollutes our planet, it also makes virtually certain that non-
proliferation objectives designed to prevent the spread of atomic weapons are
bound to ultimately fail. 

<P>Today, in New York the Review and Extension Conference of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) started. The some 170 States Party to the Treaty
will vote how to extend the NPT after they have met to discuss the prevention
of the spread of nuclear weapons, weapons technology and materials in the
context of full nuclear disarmament and global security. The current,
selective application of non-proliferation policies by the nuclear-weapons-
states further underscores the discriminatory of the NPT.  These policies not
only severely undercut the effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime, they
also bind our society to a future of increased radioactive pollution.

<br>Subject: Solo Update 04/18/95   0600GMT DAY 55 

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP NEARS JAPAN AS NON-PROLIFRATION TREATY
TALKS
BEGIN IN NEW YORK</H4>

</head><body>
<P>Pacific Pintail (at 2200 GMT) is 32 degrees 14 minutes North, and
154 degrees and 54 minutes East. The Pintail's course is 310
degrees at a speed of 8.5 knots. If Pintail maintains this speed
the ship will arrive in Mutsu Ogawara on the 23rd (Sunday)
although Japanese officials have said it will arrive on the 25th.
 
<P>Transports of radioactive waste and plutonium find their origin
in the commercial plutonium separation industry in France, the
United Kingdom and Japan.  Yesterday, in New York the Review and
Extension Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
started, where some 170 States Party to the Treaty meet to
discuss the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, weapons
technology and materials in the context of full nuclear
disarmament and global security.
 
<P>As the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Conference (NPT) began
at the United Nations, Greenpeace activists locked themselves to
the U.S. Mission to the UN in New York, to protest U.S. moves to
indefinitely extend the failed Treaty. The activists, wearing
radiation suits and lengths of chain, attached themselves to the
Mission entrance, opposite the U.N., shortly before the four-week
NPT Conference opened today.
 
<P>Earlier yesterday, more than 350 Greenpeace activists from 15
countries occupied a UK nuclear weapons facility and a plutonium
production plant.  Greenpeace activists from Europe, the US,
Canada, Australia and Korea entered the Aldermaston nuclear
weapons factory in Berkshire and the Sellafield plutonium
production facility in Cumbria attempting to do what the NPT has
so far been unable to do: stop the production of nuclear weapons
and fissile materials.   
 
<P>The NPT with its outdated conceptual basis of a two-tiered
structure of nations and a discriminatory approach to national
security has, in effect, sanctioned the spread of nuclear
technology as an inalienable right jeopardizing global security.
An indefinite and unamended extension of this treaty will not
bring about nuclear disarmament nor will it halt the
proliferation of plutonium over our planet. 
 
<P>Unless the international community seriously commits itself to
nuclear disarmament and an end to the spread of nuclear
technology, the spiral of nuclear proliferation could continue
indefinitely.  Fifty years after the bombing of Hiroshima, this
NPT conference is an opportunity to say, enough is enough.
Greenpeace calls States to oppose an indefinite extension of the
Treaty. Instead NPT Parties should demand for a series of NPT
extension periods linked to a firm and real timetable for nuclear
disarmament, and for an end on the production and trade in
commercial plutonium.

<head>From:    Greenpeace Vessel MV Solo tracking Pacific Pintail
<br>Date:    WED 19-APR-95 06:10:16 GMT - DAY 56
 
      <H4><P>FINAL SOLO MEDIA UPDATE WHILE TRACKING NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP
    
             <P>PACIFIC PINTAIL OFF JAPANESE COAST
          SOLO LEAVES PACIFIC PINTAIL AND STEAMS FOR TOKYO   </H4>
</head><body> 
<P>After the Japanese nuclear industry and government confirmed the
arrival of the Pacific Pintail and its radioactive waste on April
25th in Mutsu Ogawara in the Japanese province of Aomori, the
Greenpeace vessel Solo has changed course and is currently
heading for Tokyo.   Solo is expected to arrive in Tokyo on April
21st, where a press-conference will be held on Saturday April
22nd, on board at 1300 local time in Tokyo Harbour to discuss the
Pintail's controversial journey.  We left the Pacific Pintail
this morning at 1000 GMT after 56 days tracking her at sea.
 
<P>At 11:00 GMT the Pintail was in position 32 degrees and 17
minutes North and 154 degrees and 04 minutes East. The Pintail
is sailing towards Mutsu Ogawara in Aomori Prefecture, on a
course of 310 degrees at a speed of 9.5 knots.  Given this course
and speed, Greenpeace expects the Pacific Pintail to arrive late
on the 23th of April.
 
<P>During the past days it has become clear that the nuclear waste
ship could reach Mutsu Ogawara the morning of the 22nd of April,
should the ship sail at its normal operating speed of 13 knots.
The delay of the Pacific Pintail is most likely to be due to
government fears that the arrival of the radioactive waste could
effect the outcome of the local elections in the region on April
23rd.
 
<P>This final Pacific Pintail position update from the Solo
concludes a long tracking voyage of 56 days.  During this
journey, many countries have spoken out against this particular
and future shipments of radioactive waste and plutonium through
their waters.  Many more will follow if the nuclear industry
continues to ignore public and governmental opposition to its
irresponsible practices. 
 
<P>Greenpeace will continue work with countries and grass-roots
organizations over possible shipping routes of future departures
from Europe and Japan of ships--owned by Pacific Nuclear
Transport Limited (PNTL)--that carry nuclear waste, spent nuclear
fuel and plutonium, as part of our campaign against plutonium
production and radioactive waste generation. 
 
<P>Greenpeace strongly condemns the Japanese nuclear industry in its
reluctance to halt plutonium separation. Japan is jeopardizing
global security by producing and stockpiling enormous amounts of
commercial plutonium since this encourages other countries to
follow Japan's example.  With the radioactive pollution caused
by the separation of plutonium the nuclear industry is gambling
with the lives of people not only in Japan but also in France and
the United Kingdom.  The industry also deliberately exposes the
public in coastal nations to the effects of a possible nuclear
waste ship accident.  Furthermore, it should be noted that
shipments of commercial plutonium and radioactive waste
constitute prime targets for terrorist attacks.
 
<P>In New York this week the Review and Extension Conference of the-
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has begun. The 170 States party
to the Treaty will vote on extending the NPT after discussing the
prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, weapons technology
and materials in the context of full nuclear disarmament and
global security.  Unless the international community seriously
commits itself to nuclear disarmament and an end to the spread
of nuclear technology, the spiral of nuclear proliferation could
continue indefinitely.  
 
<P>Fifty years after the bombing of Hiroshima, this NPT conference
is an opportunity to say, enough is enough.  Greenpeace calls on
states to oppose an indefinite extension of the Treaty and to
demand for a series of NPT extension periods linked to a firm and
real timetable for nuclear disarmament.     Instead of following
a policy of encouragement of weapons-usable, commercial plutonium
production, Japan should take the leadership role in the
international community to end the production and stockpiling of
this dangerous material.  
   
<P>If information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage or it's cargo of
plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas Bruyne on the
Solo (phone:++ 872-1301166--Warning, $10 per minute). Photo,
video, or other media requests to Greenpeace Communications
(phone: ++44-171-8330-600). 
 
<P>For information in Japan, and on the Solo's press conference

            <P><H4>GREENPEACE SHIP SOLO ARRIVES IN TOKYO AS NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP NEARS DESTINATION IN NORTHERN JAPAN</H4>
 </head><body><P>
The Solo, which ended its tracking of the nucler waste ship
Pacific Pintail after 56 days at sea, will arrive in Tokyo early
today and will host a press conference on Earth Day, today, and
open boat for the Japanese public next weekend.
 
<P>ampaigner Bas Bruyne, ship's Captain Ulf Birgander and Japanese
Anti-Nuclear Campaigner Emi Ueno will talk to Japanese press on
board the Solo about their voyage with the Pintail from France
to Japan and about the country's flawed plutonium reprocessing
policy.  Last night, Bas filed his final over view of the Solo's
voyage which follows this update.  The 14-person staff of the
Japanese office, has been working long-hours and every weekend
since the nuclear waste ship left Cherbourg, France sending
updates to an estimated 100 Japanese and international
journalists based in Japan and preparing for the arrival of the
Pintail.
 
<P>Yesterday, Greenpeace Anti-plutonium Campaigner Damon Moglen from
France joined victims of the plutonium industry from France (La
Hague) and Britain (Sellafield in Cumbria) in meeting with local
people from the region of Aomori in northern Japan to discuss
their similar situations.  All of these communties face severe
health threats from radioactive discharges into their water
and/or air and the possibility of a nuclear accident near their
homes.  They have come together this week for the first time to
protest the ongoing trade in dangerous plutonium as the Nuclear-
Non-Proliforation Treaty (NPT) talks continue at the United
Nations in New York to discuss this and other proliforation threats.
 
 
<P>To these local communities directly effected by this dangerous
trade, these talks hold the potential to outlaw plutonium
proliforation and end the threat they face every day.  We urge
those concerned with the outcome of the NPT to contact their
government leaders and demand they do more than just maintain the
status quo of the NPT by passing an indefinite extension but that
they take real action to end the nuclear age.
 
<P>More next week as the
shipment arrives in Aomori, Japan.

<P> 
TOKYO, 22 April, 1995 -- (GP) The Greenpeace ship MV Solo arrived
in Tokyo today after tracking a controversial nuclear waste
shipment for 56 days from France to Japan.  The environmental
organization called on the Japanese government to halt its
plutonium program and transports to ensure environmental
protection and nuclear non-proliferation.

 or <a href="conf1.jpg">20KB JPG</a>  Press conference on board MV Solo, Tokyo. ©Greenpeace/Simms 
<P>"This is one of the most controversial shipments in history,"
said on-board Greenpeace campaigner Bas Bruyne.  "Dozens of
enroute nations banned or protested this deadly transport. 
Japan, with the support of France and Britain, has acted with
arrogant disregard for the legitimate concerns and rights of
nations around the planet." 
 
<P>Surprisingly, this week Japan's Foreign Minister Kono raised the
issue of international criticism against the recent nuclear waste
shipment in his speech at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) talks at the UN in New York. 
 
<P>The Pacific Pintail left Cherbourg, France with its 14-ton cargo
of highly radioactive plutonium waste on February 23, 1995. 
Greenpeace, which protested the loading and departure of the
shipment, accompanied the Pintail to provide information to
enroute nations threatened by the otherwise secret transport.  
 
<P>The nuclear freighter was turned aside from its intended route
through the Panama Canal by intense opposition in the Caribbean
and Central America. The Pintail then forced its way through the
coastal waters of South America and Cape Horn despite the formal
opposition of South American governments. After skirting the
dangerous waters off Cape Horn the ship sailed for over four
weeks across the Pacific.  Ultimately, the Pintail and its cargo
was banned by over 35 nations and denounced by numerous others.
 
<P>The Pacific Pintail is due to arrive at the Japanese port of
Mutsu Ogawara on the morning of Tuesday, 25 April.  Japanese
government policy is to ship spent nuclear fuel to Europe, where
weapons-grade plutonium is separated and purified.  This
~reprocessing~ multiplies the original volume of radioactive
waste by approximately 140 times.
 
<P>In Japan, the reprocessing policy has been badly undermined by
the realisation that the Pintail~s cargo is only the first of
over one hundred shipments of plutonium and nuclear waste which
will eventually arrive in Japan.   The country has no long-term
storage or disposal facility for radwaste, and since most of
Japan is prone to earthquakes, there is concern that a solution
may never be found.
 
<P>"There are two obvious reasons why Japan~s reprocessing policy
should be ended immediately,~ said Greenpeace Japan campaigner
Emi Ueno.  ~First, it produces tens of tonnes of weapons-usable
plutonium directly undermining global non-proliferation efforts;
and secondly because of the total lack of any means to safely
store or dispose of the overwhelming volumes of radioactive
waste~, she said.
 


<P>"Japan should prove its commitment to non-proliferation by
terminating the production, use and stockpiling of weapons-usable
plutonium."

<H4>CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS
 <P>GREENPEACE VESSEL SOLO'S JOURNEY TRACKING THE JAPANESE RADIOACTIVE WASTE SHIPMENT ON BOARD THE PACIFIC PINTAIL FROM FRANCE TO JAPAN</H4>
 
<P>FEBRUARY 23, 1995:  The Pacific Pintail with the first ever on-
board sea-shipment of high-level, vitrified radioactive waste
leaves the port of Cherbourg, France while Greenpeace protests
the shipment with its vessel Moby Dick. Moby Dick's crew is
arrested and later released by the French authorities. Solo picks
the Pintail up on radar and follows at a safe distance of three
miles. The Pintail steams South past the French and British coast
and enters the Bay of Biscay on her way to Portuguese waters.  
 
<P>FROM FRANCE TO PORTUGAL  Heavy seas, bad weather and a French
Navy plane escort the 14-tonnes of radioactive waste on-board the
Pacific Pintail on its first part of its journey to Japan. On
February 25th the Spanish Navy vessel Serviola appears off the
port bow of the Pacific Pintail. The Spanish Navy orders the
Pintail to stay more than 100 miles away from the Spanish coast.
 
<P>THE PORTUGUESE COAST   Feb 26.  Weather conditions are bad for
two days and a strong North Westerly wind blows at force 6/7. 
The Portuguese warship (Frigate F 489) the "Oliveira E Carmo"
joins the Pintail on February 26th and accompanies the ship. The
Spanish Navy patrol vessel "Serviola," however, leaves at
daybreak. Solo then receives a message from Monsanto Radio -- a
shipping radio station that issues navigational and security
warnings to ships -- that 12 boxes of ammunition previously lost
at sea have been reported washed ashore on the Portuguese Coast.
Monsanto Radio warns all ships of the possibility that more boxes
are drifting and could be dangerous to navigation.  
 
<P>The ammunition boxes were lost at sea during an attempt on 25th
October, 1994 to scuttle (intentionally sink) the Portuguese ship
"Sao Miguel" and its cargo old ammunition.  Reportedly the
scuttling failed, the ship exploded, and some 80 boxes were lost. 
The Sao Miguel was sunk some 190 miles West of Lisbon, and on
February 27th, the Pacific Pintail passes as close as 140 miles
northeast of this spot refusing to acknowledge radio warnings
from the Solo.
 
<P>MADEIRA  Feb 27.  On Monday, Solo approaches the 200 mile
Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around Madeira. Upon
entering this EEZ around Madeira, the Portuguese Frigate
"Oliveira E Carmo" contacts the Pacific Pintail, and notifies it
that they have entered the Portuguese EEZ and requests the ship
to stay at least 100 miles away from Madeira.  The Pacific
Pintail confirms and replies that her current course would not
bring her closer than 120 miles from Madeira. At the end of the
conversation the captain of the "Oliveira E Carmo" asks the
Pacific Pintail what route she will take and if she intends to
travel the South African or South American route.  The Pacific
Pintail replies that she does not know yet. 
  
<P>CANARY ISLANDS    On March 1st, the Pacific Pintail passes the
Canary Islands at a distance of 265 miles and the Spanish Navy
Patrol Boat the "Centinella" leaves the Pacific Pintail.  While
the Pintail approaches the Cape Verde Islands on March 2nd,
people in the Virgin Islands gather in a vigil against the
continued threat these radioactive waste shipments between
France, the UK and Japan pose to their islands.  On March 3, the
Pacific Pintail passes West of the Cape Verde Islands on a
distance of 260 nautical miles, without the Cape Verde Government
taking much notice of the danger that this shipment poses. 
 
<P>BETWEEN AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA   March 5th brings the Pacific
Pintail almost exactly between the African and South American
continents at a distance of 730 miles northeast of the Brazilian
city of Natal, and 860 miles southwest of the West African
country Guine-Bissau. In previous days the Pacific Pintail passes
Cape Verde, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.  On March 6th, the 
nuclear waste ship continues due South and is less than 500 miles
northeast of Natal.  At a press conference on board the Rainbow
Warrior near the Panama Canal, Greenpeace reveals that the
Pacific Pintail will not make use of the Panama Canal for this
transit towards Japan. The organization applauds the action taken
by the Caribbean Community that has prevented the ship from
sailing through the region, and calls on CARICOM--the Caribbean
Community's regional forum--to formally adopt a zone that would
prohibit shipments of nuclear waste and plutonium through the
Caribbean Sea. At midnight the Pacific Pintail sails into the
Brazilian 200 mile Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) around the
islands "Fernando de Noronha." 
 
<P>THE BRAZILIAN COAST   On March 7, the Pacific Pintail is 300
miles northeast of Natal, Brazil and comes as much as 50 miles
within the EEZ around the "Fernando de Noronha" Islands.
Greenpeace notifies the Brazilian authorities that the Pacific
Pintail is violating a February 24th declaration of the Brazilian
Government stating that Brazilian coast and waters "mustn't be
exposed to eventual risks of accidents involving such cargoes." 
On March 8, the Brazilian Air Force repeatedly flies closely over
the Pacific Pintail and engages the vessel in radio-
communication. The Brazilian Air Force asks the captain of the
Pintail all navigational details necessary for Brazil to prevent
the ship from entering its 200 mile zone. In addition the Air
Force inquires into the nature of the Pintail's cargo, which the
captain of the Pacific Pintail twice refuses to answer while
pointing out that the Pintail is still in international waters.
"We are on a normal sea-trade", responds the captain of the
Pintail to the Brazilian Air Force.  In radio and press
interviews, Greenpeace accuses the Captain of the Pacific Pintail
of flatly lying about the nature of his trade which, as the first
shipment of highly radioactive glassified plutonium waste ever
to be made, can hardly be called "a normal sea-trade."  
 
<P>In Brasilia, Brazil's capital, three National Workers Federations
of port workers adopt a motion that states: (1) Strong opposition
to the passage of the Pacific Pintail through Brazilian waters,
(2) Their decision to deny any help and assistance to the ship
should it ask to stop in a Brazilian port. The National Workers
Federation's further announces that its message will be
circulated throughout Brazil to all ports.  Following the passage
by the Pacific Pintail on March 10 through the jurisdictional
waters of Brazil adjacent to the Penedos de Sao Pedro and Sao
Paulo and of Fernando de Noronha islands, the Brazilian
Government restates its concern over the risk of pollution by
nuclear waste transports. Brazil further calls for a re-
evaluation of International Maritime Organization (IMO) and
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations on the
basis of the goals expressed in the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea. 
 
<P>In Chile, the National Chilean Federation of small-scale
fishermen (CONAPACH) on March 10 states its opposition against
the continuation of the traffic of radioactive materials to and
from Japan, and warns of the dangers posed to marine resources
by the Pacific Pintail. CONAPACH also states that "freedom of
navigation must not be invoked in order to endanger international
security, human health and natural resources". In South Africa,
the National Union of Mine Workers (NUM), the biggest union in
South Africa, at its March 11th national meeting passes a
declaration demanding that the waste transport be banned from
South Africa's EEZ--which they hold to be 250 miles. 
 
<P>While the Pacific Pintail passes Rio de Janeiro on March 12th,
Chile's House of Representatives unanimously adopts a resolution
asking the Chilean Executive branch to take a tougher stance on
the issue of radioactive waste shipments. The Chilean Ministry
of Foreign Affairs is asked to deliver Chile's strong protest and
to request the French, Japanese and British Governments terminate
plans to continue to ship radioactive wastes, since they present
a grave risk to the environment, human health and international
security. Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle is asked to
forbid the Pacific Pintail to sail in Chilean territorial waters.
 
 
<P>THE URUGUAYAN COAST   Just prior to passing Uruguay's coast on
March 14th, Uruguay's Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Carlos
Perez del Castillo, issues a formal statement denying the Pacific
Pintail entry to Uruguayan jurisdictional waters.  After growing
political pressure, the South African Department of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism discloses on March 13th that it has
diplomatically requested the governments of Japan, France and the
United Kingdom have ensure that, should the Pacific Pintail make
use of the waters off the coast of South Africa, it does not
enter its EEZ.  South Africa's statement further reveals that,
should the Pacific Pintail take the Cape of Good Hope route, its
Navy ships and Air Force aircraft will be used to watch the
vessel as it approaches the limits of South Africa's EEZ.
 
<P>THE ARGENTINE COAST   On March 14, the Argentine Navy flies over
the Pacific Pintail with a Search and Rescue operation aircraft
while the ship is approximately 450 miles of the Argentine coast.
The Navy notifies the Captain of the Pintail that his ship had
entered the search and rescue area under the responsibility of
the Argentine Navy. The Argentine House of Representatives by a
March 15th resolution had already prohibited the Pintail from
passing into the waters under Argentine jurisdiction. 
 
<P>While Argentine authorities are deliberating over the Pintail,
the Chilean Senate adopts a resolution that prohibits the nuclear
waste ship from entering Chile's EEZ and instructs the Chilean
Navy to enforce the prohibition. Chile bases its resolution on
its obligations under the Declaration of the U.N. Conference on
Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 (the
Rio Declaration). The declaration deals with the protection of
the sea and coastal areas and the protection, rational use and
development of its living resources. Through the declaration,
Chile has committed itself in accordance with the U.N. Law of the
Sea, to prevent, reduce and control degradation of the marine
environment. 
 
<P>In an urgent March 17 telex from Solo to the Pacific Pintail,
Greenpeace notifies the ship's captain of the Chilean prohibition
against his ship, and of the organization's grave concern over
the Pintail's attempt to force its way through the waters of a
region where the ship and its radioactive cargo have been banned
due to safety concerns and public opposition. When the Pacific
Pintail on March 18th is some 50 miles southeast of the
Argentinean Isla de los Estados, Chile attempts to prohibit the
ship from its waters but fails to contact the vessel by telex.
On March 19, the Chilean Navy approaches the Pacific Pintail with
a Navy aircraft and warns the captain that his ship will not be
allowed to enter the Chilean EEZ. Responding to the Chilean Navy
the Pintail's captain communicates that he is under instructions
from his owners to continue his course, by which he knowingly
will violate the Chilean jurisdictional waters.
 
<P>IN CHILEAN JURISDICTIONAL WATERS  In a 2-hour confrontation with
the Chilean Navy inside the Chilean EEZ on March 20th, the
Pacific Pintail's captain repeatedly ignores Chilean requests to
alter course and leave Chilean waters.  Finally, the Chilean Navy
warns the Pintail's captain that he is exposing his vessel to the
use of Naval force. The Pintail's captain ultimately agrees to
change course to the South, a course which will lead the ship and
radioactive waste cargo towards pristine Antarctica.
 
<P>On the morning of March 21st, the Pacific Pintail--still 80 miles
within Chile's EEZ and 130 miles North of the Antarctic protected
Treaty Area, changes course from due south to northwest. This
course will bring the ship as close as 75 miles from the Chilean
coast.  After Chile inquires as to why the Pintail is not leaving
Chile's EEZ, the captain of the Pintail responds that he is under
instructions from the ship's owners to continue to violate
Chile's prohibition for the next 48 hours while setting course
towards Japan.  On March 22nd, the Chilean authorities again
request the Pintail leave the Chilean 200 mile EEZ. The Pintail's
captain refers to an approaching storm front and says that he
prefers to maintain ship's course.  Subsequently, Chile permits
the Pintail to pass but only on the condition that the ship turns
West after the storm passes. Later that day, the Pacific Pintail
alters course to the West and, shortly after, finally sails out
of Chile's jurisdictional waters. 
 
<P>ACROSS THE PACIFIC    On March 23rd, the Pacific Pintail,
steaming through the Pacific Ocean toward Japan, is on a course
in the general direction of Easter Island.  In the Pacific,
already some states have expressed their concern and opposition
to the 14 tons of radioactive waste onboard of the Pacific
Pintail.  On Feb 23, '95, the Government of Fiji formally
contacts the Japanese Government to protest the shipment and
demands that it does not allow it to pass through the waters of
the Fijian EEZ.  On Jan 17, '95 the Federated States of
Micronesia issue a statement of concern regarding the possibility
of Japan making transports of highly radioactive nuclear waste
through the region which could lead to "catastrophic" accidents. 
The FSM voice their desire to see the South Pacific Forum put
into force an agreement which will ban the importation or
transboundary movement of such transports through the region. 
On Jan 17, '95, in a letter to the Japanese Embassy in Suva
(Nauru) the Nauru Department of External Affairs conveys to the
Japanese Government its strong concern regarding the possibility
of highly radioactive waste shipments sailing through the South
Pacific Islands region. In the letter the Nauru Government
opposes the shipment in its 200 mile EEZ and calls upon Japan to
respect Nauru's concerns. 
 
<P>Previously, on Dec. 12, '94, US Representative for Hawaii,
Abercrombie, and the Delegate of Guam, Underwood, issued
statements of concern over the shipment of high level waste from
France to Japan. The two members of the US House of
Representatives state that the people of Hawaii and Guam should
not be placed in harms way, and that the US should make a good-
faith, timely effort to address the unresolved safety questions
raised by plans to ship high-level radioactive waste by sea
through US ports and/or territorial waters. 
 
<P>While the Pacific Island states are prepare for the passage of
the Pacific Pintail, Press Secretary Terusuke Terada of Japan's
Foreign Ministry, tells "Nucleonics Week" that routing
information will not be disclosed for dozens of future nuclear
waste shipments despite previous promises to do so. Terada also
says "This time, the British are responsible for the shipment,
and they said they would take entire responsibility.  And they
believe, in mid- to longer-term, it is not desirable to release
the routes to those antagonists who, they say, naturally may
obstruct the shipment."
 
<P>PASSING EASTER ISLAND    On March 31, the OPANAL General
Conference is held in Chile. OPANAL is the "Agency for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the
Caribbean" established by the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco to
prohibit nuclear weapons from the region while demanding nuclear
weapons states honour the region's non-nuclear status.  The
OPANAL General Conference, made up of 30 Latin American and
Caribbean states, issues a declaration voicing "deep concern"
about the Japanese/French/British nuclear waste shipment being
tracked by Greenpeace in the Pacific.  The regional forum calls
for the enactment of international legislation to "avoid the high
risks inherent to these transports." 
 
<P>MEETING THE RAINBOW WARRIOR   On April 3, the Greenpeace flagship
Rainbow Warrior joins the Solo in her demonstrative tracking of
the Pacific Pintail's passage through the Pacific Ocean. The
Rainbow Warrior, on her way from Panama to Tahiti, previously
formed the centre of Greenpeace's anti-plutonium campaign in the
Caribbean. The Pacific Pintail avoided sailing through the
Caribbean after countries there voiced opposition against the
radioactive cargo in their waters. The Rainbow Warrior continues
to advocate an end to the nuclear pollution posed by French
nuclear testing in the Pacific, and to shipments and disposal of
radioactive waste there.   
 
<P>CROSSING THE EQUATOR SAILING TOWARDS HAWAII  On April 5, the
Pacific Pintail crosses the equator for a second time and
Greenpeace announces that the vessel is 5 days from Hawaii. 
Greenpeace calls on the Government of Hawaii not to allow the
ship to enter its waters, given the lack of information about the
shipment, and the consequences of a possible accident to the
environment, people and economy of Hawaii.  Such a passage would
violate the US National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) since no
comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment has been undertaken
with the participation of territories and communities at risk.
Such a study is required under the terms of US NEPA since there
is no doubt that a serious accident, like a fire onboard the
Pacific Pintail, would severely impact the state's delicate
ecosystem. On March 31, a state-wide meeting of 314 delegates to
the Hawaii State Teachers Association (HSTA) passes a resolution
against the radioactive waste shipment. The teachers union's
protest, follows previous trade union opposition to the shipment
of radioactive waste in Brazil, Chile and South Africa urging
Pacific officials to oppose the shipment of nuclear waste through
Pacific U.S. territorial waters. 
 
<P>While off the Hawaiian coasts on April 11, the Pacific Pintail's
passage raises further concerns with Hawaii legislators. In a
letter to US President Bill Clinton, Hawaii Governor Cayetano
renews Hawaii's request for assistance in expediting an
evaluation of Hawaii's emergency plans in the event any shipments
of dangerous levels of radioactive waste and plutonium passing
near Hawaii should result in a nuclear emergency. In addition,
the Hawaiian Governor states his concern about the high level
radioactive waste and plutonium shipments passing Hawaii, to
Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama and to French President
Eduard Balladur.
 
<P>OFF THE JAPANESE COAST  After the Japanese nuclear industry
confirms on April 18th that the arrival of the Pacific Pintail
and its radioactive waste will be on April 25th in Mutsu Ogawara
in the Japanese province of Aomori, the Greenpeace vessel Solo
changes course and heads for Tokyo. The Pacific Pintail's last
tracked position reported by Solo at 23:00 GMT on April 18th, is
32 degrees and 17 minutes North and 154 degrees and 04 minutes
East. The Pintail then sails towards Mutsu Ogawara in Aomori
Prefecture at a speed of 9.5 knots.  Greenpeace concludes that
the controversial shipment is intentionally being delayed from
arriving in Mutsu since the Pintail could easily arrive on April
22rd at current speed. The delay is most likely caused by
government fears that the arrival of the radioactive waste could
effect the outcome of the local elections to be held on April
23rd.
 
<P>After leaving the Pacific Pintail, Greenpeace announces it will
continue to inform countries and grass-roots organizations along
possible shipping routes on future plutonium, nuclear waste, and
spent fuel departures from Europe and Japan as part of its
campaign to end plutonium production and radioactive waste
generation. 
 
<P>SOLO ARRIVES IN TOKYO    After a non-stop journey of 58 days, the
Greenpeace vessel Solo arrives in Tokyo.
 
<P>In New York on April 17th the Review and Extension Conference of
the-Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has started. The 170 States
party to the Treaty will vote on whether to extend the NPT
indefinitely after discussing the prevention of the spread of
nuclear weapons, weapons technology and materials in the context
of full nuclear disarmament and global security.  It is obvious
that unless the international community seriously commits to
nuclear disarmament and an end to the spread of nuclear
technology, the spiral of nuclear proliferation could continue
indefinitely.  Fifty years after the bombing of Hiroshima, this
NPT conference is an opportunity to say, enough is enough. 
Greenpeace calls on States to oppose an indefinite extension of
the Treaty and instead to demand for a series of NPT extension
periods linked to a firm and real timetable for nuclear
disarmament.  
 
<P>Greenpeace believes that instead of following a policy of
encouraging weapons-usable, commercial plutonium production,
Japan should take a leadership role in ending the production and
stockpiling of this dangerous material. Greenpeace calls on all
NPT Parties to demand immediate negotiations on a commercial
plutonium cut-off as one of the necessary steps to curb the
proliferation of weapons-usable materials and technology world-
wide.

<br>Date:   April 23, 1995  5:45 PM, Japan time
 
                <P><H4>GREENPEACE PREPARES TO PROTEST ARRIVAL OF NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP TO JAPAN</H4>
 
</head><body><P> Yesterday we held a press conference on board the Solo after it
arrived.  It was attended by about 36 press outlets including
most of the major Japanese press and a number of international
press outlets based in Tokyo.
 
<P>The press conference room on board the Solo was standing room
only with TV cameras everywhere.  The 18 member international
crew was a bit overwhelmed by all the people swarming onto the
boat after more than 60 days at sea with no other human contact
but each other.  
 
<P>Afterward, we held a crew update meeting attended by the staff
of Greenpeace Japan, the boat crew and those of us who are here
from Greenpeace international.
 
<P>This morning, a number of Greenpeace staff boarded trains to go
north to Aomori, Japan where the dump ship is to arrive early
Tuesday.
 
<P>Last night, however, those who already there, a campaigner and
a number of local activists from near Sellafield nuclear facility
in Britain and COGEMA in France were told by their hotel, the
only one near the arrival harbour, that they could not stay there
after that night.  When asked why, the owner said it was because
the Japanese plutonium company told them not to allow Greenpeace
or others opposed to their plutonium trade to stay there.  We've
been fighting with them, the government and the company ever
since.   Fortunately, we have been working quite closely with
local Japanese people opposed to their home being used as a
nuclear storage site and they have been quite helpful and
supportive. 
 
<P>There have been a number of local and regional protests around
the arrival of the nuclear waste shipment up in Aomori, Japan and
more are expected.  Today is a national election day and it is
believed that the nuclear waste ship, which could easily have
arrived in port before today, was held offshore to try to protect
elected officials from being unseated by angry local people.
 
<P>The crew of the Solo will finally be able to get off the boat and
spend some shore leave time on land.  They are eager for a change
of scenery after such a long voyage.
 
<P>More later from Japan.  Sayonara.  Blair.

<br>Date:  May 25, 1995.  Day 62
<P><H4>ARRIVAL OF PINTAIL</H4>
</head><body> 
<P>Early this morning, the nuclear waste ship Pacific Pintail is
expected to arrive in the port of Mutsu Ogawara in Rokkasho,
Northern Japan.  We have a number of staff from the Japan office
and from the international campaign who have worked for months
now tracking the shipment in Rokkasho to take part in the
protest.  

<P>Mid-morning we got word that the local governor of Rokkosho
announced that he would not allow the Pintail into port to off-
load its waste without confirmation that the waste would not end
up in Rokkosho permanently.  Below is the release we sent out in
support of his right to refuse the waste.

<P>Protests at the site continued throughout the day with over 1,000
Japanese people from the locality, region and country joining
together to say no to the waste shipment.  We joined in as
international protesters over the global shipment and the trade
in plutonium as well as the siting of a waste site in a small
Japanese fishing community.  

<P>More as the day unfolds.   

<P>Best Wishes and No Nukes!  Blair Palese


<P><H4>PACIFIC PINTAIL DELAYED BY LOCAL JAPANESE GOVERNMENT PROTESTS 
 </H4>
<P>Mutsu Ogawara, Japan, April 25, 1995 -- (GP) Greenpeace today
said that the 24 hour delay of the Pacific Pintail's docking in
Japan, because of its deadly cargo of 14 tonnes of highly
radioactive waste, was yet another sign of growing international
opposition to the plutonium industry. 

<P>Damon Moglen, Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner said
from Rokkasho in northern Japan today that there could not be any
guarantees for the safe storage of the waste at its destination
- a storage facility in the Aomori prefecture in Northern Japan. 
Indeed, there was a severe earthquake last year where cracks
appeared in the road outside the storage facility.  

<P>As Greenpeace and an estimated one thousand regional and national
Japanese people gathered earlier today in the port to protest the
arrival of the Pacific Pintail, the local Governor refused to
admit the British-owned ship, demanding a promise by the nuclear
industry that the Aomori Prefecture would not be the final
storage site for this waste.  

<P>The Japanese authorities turned the small fishing village of
Rokkasho into a heavy fortified area, with riot police, road
blocks, several naval vessels and some 40 police vehicles.
 
<P>The last-minute delay was due to strong local opposition to
heavy-handed tactics and secrecy surrounding the plutonium
program and waste storage policy.  As of 7 pm Japan time, the
Pacific Pintail was waiting just off shore to enter the port, and
it is now understood that it will dock and unload at first light
tomorrow.

<P>"The plutonium industry makes three things:  plutonium, nuclear
waste and victims. The victimisation by this irresponsible and
militaristic industry has been seen throughout the voyage of the
Pintail -- the most controversial shipment ever made," said
Moglen. 

<P>"Like the 35 nations who protested the shipping of this waste
around the world, the local people -- apple growers and fishermen
-- have every right to refuse this nuclear waste," he said. 

<P>"Since there is no safe way to deal with nuclear waste and since
no community wants to be left with a legacy of radioactive
contamination, the only real solution is to end its production
altogether."

<P>Greenpeace's ship Solo tracked the voyage of the Pintail from
France to Japan over a period of 56 days to warn enroute states
of its dangerous cargo.  The Solo arrived in Tokyo on Saturday
where a press conference was held to call for an end to any
future shipments and to plutonium reprocessing.
 
<P>The highly radioactive waste arriving today is expected to be
dumped in a new repository.  Japan, however, has no real or long-
term way to deal with its nuclear waste in a country prone to
earthquakes and tidal waves.  With its persisting plutonium
utilization program, an ever-growing amount of waste and dozens
of plutonium and waste shipments to and from Japan will take
place in the next 15 years.
 
<P>"That this shipment and its arrival in Japan should take place
in the middle of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks
at the United Nations in New York points to the dire need for a
stronger treaty that will end plutonium proliferation once and
for all," said Greenpeace International's Damon Moglen. 
 
<P>The Pacific Pintail left Cherbourg, France with its 14-ton cargo
of highly radioactive plutonium waste on February 23, 1995. 
Greenpeace accompanied the Pintail to provide information to
enroute nations threatened by the otherwise secret transport. 
The nuclear freighter was turned aside from its intended route
through the Panama Canal by intense opposition in the Caribbean
and Central America. The Pintail then forced its way through the
coastal waters of South America and Cape Horn despite the formal
opposition of South American governments. After skirting the
dangerous waters off Cape Horn the ship sailed for over four
weeks across the Pacific.  Ultimately, the Pintail and its cargo
was banned by over 35 nations and denounced by numerous others.

<H4>NUCLEAR WASTE OFF-LOADED IN ROKKOSHO</H4></head><body> 
<P>
The highlevel nuclear waste on board the Pacific Pintail was off-
loaded late yesterday and early today in Rokkosho, northern Japan
amidst continued protest at the port of Mutsu Ogawara.  The
governor of Rokkosho relented in his stand-off with the Japanese
government and the plutonium company but local protesters who are
adamant that their community should not become a nuclear dump
continued to voice their opposition.  

<P>Greenpeace has learned that, already, two ships are being
prepared to receive more spent nuclear fuel to be transported
around the world for reprocessing.  Japan, France and the UK, by
continuing to take part in the plutonium reprocessing trade,
intend to send more than one hundred shipments of spent fuel,
plutonium and waste around the globe between now and 2010.  

<P>Below is Greenpeace's final release from Mutsu Ogawara about the
off-loading of the waste.  Additional updates from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty talks at the UN in New York will follow
this.  That remains the world's best hope for ending this trade
and the environmental threats it presents. 

<P>Best Wishes and No Nukes! Blair Palese
<HR>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P><H4>NUCLEAR WASTE ARRIVES IN JAPAN TO CONTINUED CONTROVERSY</H4>
 
<P>Mutsu Ogawara, 26 April 1995--Despite continued protest, the
Pacific Pintail unloaded its deadly cargo of 14 tonnes of highly
radioactive waste in the Northern Japanese port of Mutsu Ogawara.

<P>Greenpeace has called on the Japanese government to stop its
plutonium program in response to international controversy and
condemnation.
 
<P>The environmental organisation today warned that two ships, the
Pacific Sandpiper and the Pacific Pintail, both operated by
Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited (PNTL) of the UK, would be
leaving Japan in the coming days with cargoes of highly
radioactive irradiated nuclear fuel bound for plutonium factories
in France and Britain.  The "reprocessing" of Japanese irradiated
fuel in Europe will generate hundreds of tonnes of nuclear waste
and tens of tonnes of weapons-usable plutonium.  

<P>The imminent transports by the Sandpiper and Pintail are expected
to attempt to transit the Panama Canal and Caribbean Sea in some
40 days time.  The transit of these shipments through the
Caribbean will be in direct conflict with a regional declaration
of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) demanding that the Caribbean
be bypassed by such nuclear waste and plutonium transports.

<P>The British-flagged Pacific Pintail was delayed from unloading
for 24 hours when the Governor of the Aomori Prefecture refused
to allow the shipment into port until he had been given
assurances that the waste's final resting place would not be in
the region. 
 
<P>"This 14 tonne shipment is only the first of some 1500 tonnes of
waste due for transport from France and Britain to Japan.  The
spent fuel which will leave Japan in the next few weeks will
create even more waste and weapons-usable plutonium which will
be retransported around the globe," said Damon Moglen of
Greenpeace International in Tokyo.  

<P>"These transports have mobilized countries around the planet to
protest the international plutonium trade.  In a sense, the
industry has sown the seeds of its own demise with these reckless
and secretive shipments."
 
<P>Moglen said this week is the third week of the Non Proliferation
Treaty negotiations in New York, where countries have an
opportunity to put a stop to the plutonium economy.  
 
<P>"The militaristic plutonium industry creates three things: 
plutonium, radioactive waste and victims.  Somewhere this madness
has to stop and the NPT negotiators have the opportunity to do
so," said Moglen. 
 
<P>The Pacific Pintail left Cherbourg, France with its 14-tonne
cargo of highly radioactive plutonium waste on February 23, 1995.

<P>The Greenpeace ship Solo accompanied the Pintail to provide
information to enroute nations threatened by the otherwise secret
transport.  The nuclear freighter was turned aside from its
intended route through the Panama Canal by intense opposition in
the Caribbean and Central America. 
 
<P>The Pintail then forced its way through the coastal waters of
South America and Cape Horn despite the formal opposition of
South American governments. After skirting the dangerous waters
off Cape Horn the ship sailed for over four weeks across the
Pacific.  Ultimately, the Pintail and its cargo was banned by
over 35 nations and denounced by numerous others.

have voiced opposition or taken action to prevent the high level nuclear waste shipment from passing through their territorial waters and/or Exclusive Economic Zones.  They include: Uraguay, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Portugal, Equador, Fiji, Dutch Antilles, Jamaica, Philippines, Chile, Spain, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Commonwealth of Dominica, Dominican Republic, Federated States of Micronesia, British and US Virgin Islands, Honduras, Aruba, Hawaii, Ethiopia, South Africa, Republic of Nauru, Mauritius, Antigua and Barbuda and Chile.

The paper begins 
with a brief discussion of innocent passage, transit passage and the passage of hazardous cargoes. The paper then 
discusses various international legal provisions applicable to the transit of vessels carrying highly radioactive nuclear 
cargo, through territorial seas, international straits and Exclusive Economic Zones.<P>
Several countries have specifically banned the nuclear carrier <I>Pacific Pintail </I>from navigating through their 
EEZs on the basis of the highly radioactive nature of the cargo and a greater number have generally banned the 
vessel from navigating through their territorial waters. Chile in particular has cited the precautionary principle as 
enunciated in the Rio Declaration as the basis for banning the highly radioactive shipment from its EEZ. 
Additionally, a coastal state certainly may consider that the passage of a vessel, an accident involving which could have catastrophic consequences for that state, is prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the state.<P>
This paper is updated periodically to include reports from countries along the 
 <A HREF = "http://www.greenpeace.org/~comms/route.gif">route</A> of the

A vessel, the <I>Pacific Pintail</I>, registered in Great Britain is currently transporting from France to Japan 14 
tonnes of high level vitrified nuclear waste.  Each block of the glassified waste weighs 1,000 pounds. Exposure to 
one block a yard away for one minute can give a lethal dose of radiation.<A NAME = textf1></A><A NAME = textf1></A> <A HREF = "#notef1"> [1]</A> Plutonium

The proposal has angered countries along several possible routes, including South Africa, Brazil, Chile and 
Argentina, who have reportedly barred the ship from their exclusive economic zones and who barred the vessel from 
territorial waters when a similar shipment occurred in 1992.<A NAME = textf3></A><A NAME = textf3></A> <A HREF = "#notef3"> [3]</A> The Japanese government 
has refused to reveal the intended route of the vessel, citing security reasons and has stated that the Japanese and

</A>International Law Applying to The Transit 
of Hazardous Cargoes:  Innocent Passage,  
Transit Passage, and Passage through EEZs 
</H2>
The relevant areas of sea under national state jurisdiction are internal waters, territorial seas and the Exclusive 
Economic Zone. Internal waters are those enclosed by the country's baselines<A NAME = textf6></A><A NAME = textf6></A> <A HREF = "#notef6"> [6]</A> and 
include rivers, harbours and bays. Territorial seas extend up to twelve miles from a country's baselines,<A NAME =textf7></A><A NAME = textf7></A> <A HREF = "#notef7"> [7]</A> and the EEZ extends up to 200 miles from the baselines.<A NAME = textf8></A><A NAME = textf8></A> <A HREF = "#notef8"> [8]</A><P>
The applicable law is dominated primarily by the  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) <A NAME = textf9></A><A NAME = textf9></A> <A HREF = "#notef9"> [9]</A>,
<li><A HREF="lsconts.html"> Click here to go to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</A><P>
by the Geneva Conventions and subsidiarily by customary international law, including in 
particular the precautionary principle. UNCLOS is now in force, having entered into force on November 16, 1994 
and while some states, most notably the United States, have not ratified UNCLOS, and thus the applicable law strictly 
speaking may derive from the 1958 Geneva Conventions, including in particular the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone (CTS), <A NAME = textf10></A><A NAME = textf10></A> <A HREF = "#notef10"> [10]</A> the UNCLOS provisions are widely held to 
represent customary international law,  and indeed, EEZs derive not from the CTS but from UNCLOS and, to the 
extent that UNCLOS does not apply, from customary international law. UNCLOS prevails over the earlier Geneva 
Conventions as between states Parties to UNCLOS.<A NAME = textf11></A><A NAME = textf11></A> <A HREF = "#notef11"> [11]</A><P>
There is no specific provision in either CTS or UNCLOS allowing States to impose the requirement of prior 
permission of civilian vessels to begin innocent passage. Nor is there any support in State practice for such a practice.  
States may not hamper<A NAME = textf12></A><A NAME = textf12></A> <A HREF = "#notef12"> [12]</A> or levy charges<A NAME = textf13></A><A NAME = textf13></A> <A HREF = "#notef13"> [13]</A> on innocent

States may take, impose and enforce conditions for admission to internal waters<A NAME = textf18></A><A NAME = textf18></A> <A HREF = "#notef18"> [18]</A> but

Under the CTS<A NAME = textf20></A><A NAME = textf20></A> <A HREF = "#notef20"> [20]</A> and UNCLOS ships of all States enjoy the right of innocent passage 
through the territorial sea. Passage includes not only actual passage through the territorial sea but also stopping and 
anchoring, insofar as this is incidental to ordinary navigation or rendered necessary by force majeure or distress.<A

sea except in accordance with UNCLOS.<A NAME = textf22></A><A NAME = textf22></A> <A HREF = "#notef22"> [22]</A> However it may take steps in its territorial

Coastal states may in the exercise of their sovereignty within their territorial sea, adopt laws and regulations for the 
prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution from foreign vessels, including vessels exercising the right of 
innocent passage provided that such laws and regulations shall not hamper the innocent passage of foreign vessels 
under Part II, Section 3 of UNCLOS.<A NAME = textf32></A><A NAME = textf32></A> <A HREF = "#notef32"> [32]</A><P>
<H2>2.2.	Transit Passage</H2>
The right of passage through international straits is somewhat more problematic than the right of innocent passage 
through territorial waters. UNCLOS makes significant changes to the law relating to transit passage through 
international straits, so it is necessary to examine transit passage before UNCLOS and as provided in UNCLOS.<P>
<H3>2.2.1.	<A NAME =H_Transit_Passage_Under_Customary_Intern></A>Transit 
Passage Under Customary International Law and the 1958 
Conventions</H3>
The 1958 conventions treated straits according to the waters they comprise: if they are high seas then rights of high 
seas navigation are awarded, and if straits comprise territorial waters, then the rights of innocent passage apply, with 
one important distinction: innocent passage may not be suspended.<A NAME = textf33></A><A NAME = textf33></A> <A HREF = "#notef33"> [33]</A> Note that the TSC 
test, as in <I>Corfu Channel</I>, is practical: the geographical situation connecting two parts of the high seas and 
the fact of the strait being used for international navigation, rather than the extent of traffic or international 
importance as a route.<P>
Some states, particularly littoral States such as states bordering the Malacca Straits,<A NAME = textf34></A><A NAME = textf34></A> <A HREF = "#notef34"> [34]</A> 
and some jurists<A NAME = textf35></A><A NAME = textf35></A> <A HREF = "#notef35"> [35]</A> hold that the right of passage under customary international law is a 
non-suspensible right of innocent passage. When considered with Article 16(4) of TSC<A NAME =textf36></A><A NAME = textf36></A> <A HREF = "#notef36"> [36]</A> which embodies this rule, this can be fairly stated to be the rule at least prior to the entry into force 
of UNCLOS.<P>
However the prohibition on suspension is not to say that regulation is prohibited nor that the right of passage is 
unlimited. Given the requirement of innocence, the normal interests of littoral states, including the protection from 
threats to their security still apply.<P>

passage outside 'transit passage'. <P>
UNCLOS would, furthermore, allow States bordering straits to adopt laws and regulations in respect of the

and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels or laws and regulations of that State 
conforming to and giving effect to such rules and standards.<A NAME = textf82></A><A NAME = textf82></A> <A HREF = "#notef82"> [82]</A> That State may require 
the vessel to give information regarding its identity and port of registry, its last and next port of call and other 
relevant information required to establish whether a violation has occurred. It would not be unreasonable to require 
the vessel to give details of its past and intended route for this reason.<P>
Where such a violation results in a substantial discharge causing or threatening significant pollution of the marine

at rules of international law applicable to the navigation of nuclear goods. There is a question as to whether the Basel Convention applies to radioactive waste. While Article 1(3) excludes from the scope of the Convention "[w]astes 
which, as a result of being radioactive, are subject to other international control systems, including international 
instruments, applying specifically to radioactive materials", the closest approximation to such a control system in 
place is the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) which has not in fact instituted a code of practice and not 
an international instrument. There therefore is a good argument that radioactive wastes can be included in Basel 
under Article 1(b), as wastes that are hazardous wastes by the domestic legislation of the Party of export, import or 
transit. During the preparatory meetings, representatives of the IAEA argued that the Agency intended to institute 
binding control mechanisms. However arguably no such mechanism has been implemented and Basel Convention 
Working Groups have stated that nuclear waste can be interpreted to be included under the Convention. <P>

<H3>3.3.1.	<A NAME =H_The_Precautionary_Principle_Under_Cust></A>The 
Precautionary Principle Under Customary International 
Law</H3>
Article 38 of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) defines customary law as "evidence of a general practice 
accepted as law". Customary law by nature is in fact dynamic. It evolves not necessarily slowly; in new areas of law, 
such as the emerging legal responses to the growing environmental crisis, state practice as evidence of <I>opinio 
juris</I> can quickly establish customary law.<A NAME = textf96></A><A NAME = textf96></A> <A HREF = "#notef96"> [96]</A> It may be asked whether the 
precautionary principle has already achieved the status of being a principle of customary law. The increasing use of  
precautionary legal rules in international environmental conventions, declarations and resolutions indicates clearly 
that the precautionary approach has left its formative stages and is on the way to evolve into a practice of sufficient 
uniformity, generality or legal force to qualify under the traditional definition of international custom. The increasing 
number of references to the precautionary principle in recent international environmental conventions is strong 
evidence that there is indeed such a principle to which reference is made in those conventions: in other words, the 
principle exists outside of the conventions in which it is cited. Thus the principle does in fact exist under customary 
international law and recent conventions appeal to that principle.<P>
To this it may be added that it is increasingly difficult to find examples of states publicly denouncing the 
precautionary principle or citing scientific uncertainty as a legitimate basis for action or inaction. Thus at the very 
least, the <I>opinio juris</I> is well established and the state practice as evidenced in the conclusion of international 
conventions and practice within those conventions strongly supports the existence of the principle.<P>
<H3>3.3.2.	<A NAME =H_The_Meaning_of_the_Precautionary_Princ></A>The 
Meaning of the Precautionary Principle</H3>
Impacts on the environment can only be detected after they have taken place. The precautionary approach means that 
in case of doubt as to the effects on the marine environment, preventive or remedial action is to be taken if scientific 
evidence makes it plausible that detrimental effects for the marine environment <I>may</I> result,<A NAME =textf97></A><A NAME = textf97></A> <A HREF = "#notef97"> [97]</A> i.e. a decision to err on the safe side.<A NAME = textf98></A><A NAME = textf98></A> <A HREF = "#notef98"> [98]</A> The precautionary approach is 
a way of handling and considering something whereas the precautionary principle takes this approach up and 
establishes it as a general principle adopted as a guide to action.<A NAME = textf99></A><A NAME = textf99></A> <A HREF = "#notef99"> [99]</A> The starting point of 
both is the lack of scientific certainty, or in other words the problem that perfect knowledge cannot be guaranteed 
before serious or even irreversible consequences become avoidable. <P>
The precautionary approach is a template for policy, demanding foresight and planning from decision-makers.<A 
NAME = textf100></A><A NAME = textf100></A> <A HREF = "#notef100"> [100]</A> It requires that once environmental damage threatens<A NAME =textf101></A><A NAME = textf101></A> <A HREF = "#notef101"> [101]</A> action should be taken to abate possible environmental interference even though there may still 
be scientific uncertainty as to the effects of the activities.<A NAME = textf102></A><A NAME = textf102></A> <A HREF = "#notef102"> [102]</A> As such, it moves 
forward the time for making a decision: procrastination or delay predicated upon uncertainty is not permitted. The 
argument of uncertainty as a reason for postponing or not making a decision is no longer available to states. As noted 
in a recent Dutch discussion paper<A NAME = textf103></A><A NAME = textf103></A> <A HREF = "#notef103"> [103]</A>, in essence, two aspects can be distinguished to 
implementing a precautionary approach, that is the adoption of norms and standards which are precautionary on one 
hand and the adoption and implementation of procedures which will foster precaution on the other. The latter relates 
to the question of time: the implementation of precautionary measures excludes a 'waiting for scientific proof before 
acting'-approach but requires immediate action instead. Thus it moves forward the time for taking preventive 
measures if scientific uncertainty on environmental effects remains.<P>
It has been said for instance in the context of the London Dumping Convention<A NAME = textf104></A><A NAME = textf104></A> <A HREF = "#notef104"> [104]</A> 
that the precautionary principle has led to the reversal of the burden of proof,<A NAME = textf105></A><A NAME = textf105></A> <A HREF = "#notef105"> [105]</A> so 
that in cases of scientific uncertainty as the to possible effect of certain activities, the burden of proof is passed on to 
the potential actor (polluter), who must prove that his activities will not damage the environment. However insofar as 
the burden of proof is a procedural concept and the precautionary principle is a substantive concept which removes 
the ability to cite uncertainty as a reason for procrastination, it may be better to think of the concepts as separate, at 
least for present purposes.<P>

Coastal States have the specific right to adopt and enforce non-discriminatory laws and regulations for the 
prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution from vessels in ice-covered areas within the EEZ, where 
particularly severe climatic conditions and the presence of ice covering such areas for most of the year create 
obstructions or exceptional hazards to navigation, and pollution of the marine environment could cause major harm 
to or irreversible disturbance of the ecological balance.<A NAME = textf111></A><A NAME = textf111></A> <A HREF = "#notef111"> [111]</A> This would certainly apply 
in arctic areas in EEZs such as those of Canada and Russia, and given the possible presence of icebergs around Cape 
Horn, could strengthen Chile and Argentina's claim to ban highly radioactive nuclear carriers from their EEZs.<P>

<H2>4.1.	<A NAME =H_Specific_Rights_to_Ban_and_Control_Nuc></A>
Specific Rights to Ban and Control Nuclear Powered 
Vessels and Nuclear Carriers</H2>
Spain in 1964 passed legislation differentiating passage of nuclear powered ships through territorial waters from 
innocent passage.<A NAME = textf112></A><A NAME = textf112></A> <A HREF = "#notef112"> [112]</A> At the same time, the United States concluded treaties with 
States to ensure passage of the nuclear vessel Savannah.<A NAME = textf113></A><A NAME = textf113></A> <A HREF = "#notef113"> [113]</A><P>
Nuclear powered vessels and vessels carrying radioactive material must, in exercising innocent passage through the 
territorial sea, carry documents and observe special precautionary measures established for such ships by 
international agreements, and must use designated sea lanes, under Articles 22 and 23 of UNCLOS.<A NAME =textf114></A><A NAME = textf114></A> <A HREF = "#notef114"> [114]</A> While this provision falls short of a mandate to require authorization of nuclear ships prior to 
innocent passage, it is common for flag States to request permission prior to entry into ports, and such permission 
could be premised upon the observance of certain conditions.<P>
<H2>4.2.	<A NAME =H_Control_of_Nuclear_Vessels_for_Reasons></A>
Control of Nuclear Vessels for Reasons of State 
Security and Protection</H2>
A State may suspend the passage of vessels where essential for the protection of its security.<A NAME =textf115></A><A NAME = textf115></A> <A HREF = "#notef115"> [115]</A><P>
Even if a State has not publicized a suspension, the mere passage of an unusually dangerous cargo could be 
prevented<A NAME = textf116></A><A NAME = textf116></A> <A HREF = "#notef116"> [116]</A> as non-innocent where such passage is prejudicial to the peace, good 
order or security of the coastal State or such passage does not take place in conformity with the law of the sea and 
with other rules of international law, including, in this case, the Basel Convention.<A NAME = textf117></A><A NAME = textf117></A> <A HREF = "#notef117"> [117]</A> 
Under UNCLOS, passage is specifically considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the 
coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in specified activities.<A NAME = textf118></A><A NAME = textf118></A> <A HREF = "#notef118"> [118]</A> The list is not 
necessarily exclusive and it therefore is a good argument that an extraordinarily dangerous cargo which could have 
disastrous consequences on a coastal State is itself prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal 
State.<P>
Canada in 1970 made a similar argument with respect to regulating tanker traffic 100 miles from its coastline in the 
arctic. Its Canadian Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act of 1970.<A NAME = textf119></A><A NAME = textf119></A> <A HREF = "#notef119"> [119]</A> The Canadian 
government claimed the "overriding right of self-defence of coastal states to protect themselves against grave threats 
to their environment".<A NAME = textf120></A><A NAME = textf120></A> <A HREF = "#notef120"> [120]</A> The protest continued:<P>
Traditional principles of international law concerning pollution of the sea are based in the main 
on ensuring freedom of navigation to shipping states which are now engaged in the large scale 
carriage of oil and other potential pollutants. Such traditional concepts are of little or no 
relevance anywhere in the world if they can be cited as precluding action by a coastal state to 
protect its environment.<P>
<H2>4.3A	<A NAME =H_Construction></A>Rules on the Construction and Operation of Nuclear Transport Vessels</H2>
On 4 November 1993 the 18th Assembly of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the "Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INF), Plutonium (Pu) and High-Level Radioactive Wastes (HLW) in Flasks on Board Ships" (INF Code). 
<A NAME = textf120a></A> <A HREF = "#notef120a"> [120a]</A> 

The INF Code regulates the construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of INF, Pu and HLW. Pursuant to the Code all ships carrying these materials should comply with the requirements of SOLAS 1974<A NAME = textf120b></A> <A HREF = "#notef120b"> [120b]</A> 
and additional requirements concerning damage stability, fire protection, temperature control of cargo spaces, structural considerations, cargo securing arrangements, electrical supplies, radiological protection equipment and management, training and shipboard emergency plan.<A NAME = textf120c></A> <A HREF = "#notef120c"> [120c]</A> 
The INF Code restricts the carriage on passenger ships of INF or HLW with an aggregate radioactivity less than 2,000,000 TBq and Pu with an aggregate radioactivity less than 200,000 Tbq.<A NAME = textf120d></A> <A HREF = "#notef120d"> [120d]</A> <p>
The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Mr Eamon Gilmore TD, on April 5th announced a number of measures which the Irish Government is taking with respect to nuclear ships in the Irish Sea. Mr Gilmore stated that<p>
<ul>
In our view the INF Code is deficient in a number of respects. We have decided therefore to present papers to the next meetings of the Maritime Safety Committee (May) and Marine Environment Protection Committee (September) of the IMO, so that the Code can be placed on the agenda for the next IMP Assembly in November. The  papers will identify deficiencies in  the  safety and environmental aspects of the Code and will press for expansion to make the Code more effective. Among the measures which we will be seeking will be:<p>
<li>the  restriction and exclusion of certain routes for these shipments;<br>
<li>a requirement to notify and consult with coastal states prior to journey;<br>
<li>more information in relation to journey and cargoes;<br>
<li>more effective methods of safety planning and inspection.<p>
We will be seeking the support of the other members of the International Maritime Organisation to support us to secure those necessary changes to the INF Code." <p>
</ul>
Due to the IMO Resolution accompanying the adoption of the INF Code the Marine Safety Committee and the Marine Environment Committee, both bodies of the IMO, are requested "to keep the INF Code under regular review and to amend it, as necessary"<A NAME = textf120e></A> <A HREF = "#notef120e"> [120e]</A>
 and "take into account ... the objectives of paragraph 17.22 of Agenda 21 of UNCED."
<A NAME = textf120f></A> <A HREF = "#notef120f"> [120f]</A>
 The exclusion of certain routes for the sea carriage of INC, Pu and HLW is presently under consideration of the Marine Safety Committee.
Furthermore, an international convention on liability and compensation for damage in connection with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea (HNS) is still under consideration of the Legal Committee of the IMO. It has not yet been decided whether the new convention would include damage by radioactive substances in transport.

practice is to be taken into account<A NAME = textf122></A><A NAME = textf122></A> <A HREF = "#notef122"> [122]</A> in interpreting UNCLOS.<P>
That practice provides strong support for the right to ban the <I>Pacific Pintail</I> from EEZs. Chile, Brazil and 
Argentina have all expressly banned the vessel from their EEZs.<P>

*	Voicing concern for human life and the environment, the Chilean government has firstly expressed its 
concern, stating that it would be unsuitable for the ship <I>Pacific Pintail</I> to venture into Chilean 
territorial waters with its cargo of highly radioactive plutonium.<A NAME = textf125></A><A NAME = textf125></A> <A HREF = "#notef125"> [125]</A> Likewise, 
in a statement released by the foreign ministry, the government of President Eduardo Frei said it had "notified 
the countries involved of the inappropriateness of including the territorial waters of Chile in its route." <A

resolution, the resolution provided that<P>
The Chilean Maritime Authority, considering that: <P>
1.	It is the duty of the Maritime Authority to foresee the threat to the marine environment, as well as to 
human health, life and security in the seas, posed by the passage through national sovereign and 
jurisdictional waters of the British ships Pacific Pintail or European Shearwater, carrying a shipment of 
cylinders with vitrified nuclear wastes containing 16.800.000 Curie units of radioactivity. <P>
2.	According to the principles of the new Law of the Sea, the exercise of the right [to free] navigation 
should not have a negative effect on the protection and preservation of the marine environment and the 
conservation of live resources, the coastal State having the duty to take care of the same. <P>
3.	The available international means are neither enough nor appropriate to address the unforceable 
consequences of a radioactive catastrophe. <P>
4.	The above mentioned transport violates the "precautionary principle", which is embodied in the 1992 
Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development. <P>
5.	The relevant international bodies, the International Maritime Organization and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, following the recommendations issued by the IMO Committee for the Protection of 
the Marine Environment, are carrying out, in association with UNEP, an in-depth study of the transport 
of radioactive materials by sea, in order to adopt a Code on the Safe Transport of Irradiated Nuclear 
Fuel (INA), <P>
6.	Until the adoption of more stringent international regulations, to address the actual safety requirements 
for the transport of radioactive substances, it is necessary to ban the passage through waters under 
national jurisdiction of all those ships carrying such substances. <P>
7.	Particularly severe weather conditions in the far South (of the Continent) and the Cape Horn route 
specifically, increase the ordinary risks of navigation. <P>
In its preamble the Resolution, besides citing relevant national Chilean legislation, referred to Article 1 and all other 
articles of the 12 November 1981 Lima Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal 
Zone in the Southeastern Pacific. <P>
 According to reports, <P>
"Warning of the possibility of a "radioactive catastrophe," Chile on Thursday banned the 
British ship Pacific Pintail from its 200-mile coastal waters as the freighter headed for the 
treacherous Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica. "This vessel will not enter 
Chilean waters. It will have to navigate through international waters," said the navy 
commander-in-chief Admiral Juan Martinez Busch.<P>
Navy vessels and planes will track the ship's movement "from the moment it approaches our 
longitudes," he told reporters. A navy statement said the Pacific Pintail, loaded with 
reprocessed nuclear fuel and barred from a long list of coastal nations, must stay out of Chilean 
waters "as long as it carries nuclear or radioactive materials."...<P>
"We've got enough legal arguments and arguments to protect human health, ecology and the 
environment in the area to demand that this boat not pass through Chilean territorial waters,"  
acting Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said on Thursday.<P>
Chile later sent a naval vessel which warned the <I>Pacific Pintail</I> that it had been banned from its EEZ under 
the precautionary principle. After some discussion, in which the <I>Pacific Pintail</I> claimed the right of passage,  
the <I>Pacific Pintail</I> subsequently changed course south. <A NAME = textf131></A><A NAME = textf131></A> <A HREF = "#notef131"> [131]</A> The captain of the

Chile's Foreign Minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, said  that a "very strong protest" will be delivered to the governments  
of Japan, France and the UK over the high level nuclear waste shipment through Cape Horn. Such steps are necessary 
he said "in order to prevent a recurrence of this kind of activity, since we understand that this took place in the

SANTIAGO, March 17 (Reuter) - Chile will send ships and planes to stormy<P>
seas off the southern tip of South America to ensure a Japan-bound freighter<P>
loaded with radioactive plutonium stays out of Chilean waters, the navy<P>
commander said on Friday.<P>
     Warning of the possibility of a "radioactive catastrophe," Chile on<P>
Thursday banned the British ship Pacific Pintail from its 200-mile coastal<P>
waters as the freighter headed for the treacherous Drake Passage between South<P>
America and Antarctica.<P>
     "This vessel will not enter Chilean waters. It will have to navigate<P>
through international waters," said the navy commander-in-chief Admiral Juan<P>
Martinez Busch.<P>
     Navy vessels and planes will track the ship's movement "from the moment it<P>
approaches our longitudes," he told reporters.<P>
     A navy statement said the Pacific Pintail, loaded with reprocessed nuclear<P>
fuel and barred from a long list of coastal nations, must stay out of Chilean<P>
waters "as long as it carries nuclear or radioactive materials."<P>
     The ban followed demands by the Chilean Senate, the country's largest<P>
labour union confederation and a dozen ecology groups that the freighter be<P>
prohibited from coming anywhere near Chile.<P>
     "We want to have the most absolute certainty there will be no accidents in<P>
Chile's territorial waters because it would be a catastrophe of extraordinary<P>
proportions," said Martinez. "Perhaps nothing will happen, but the question is<P>
what happens if it does."<P>
     Late on Thursday the cargo ship was reported heading southwest in<P>
international waters off the coast of southern Argentina on its route to Japan,<P>
Chilean officials said.<P>
     Barring a sudden veer east toward Africa, it would pass this weekend<P>
through the Drake Passage, known to centuries of ship captains for its stormy<P>
weather, wild currents and stray icebergs.<P>
     Ships stationed at the port of Puerto Williams, on Navarino Island just<P>
north of Cape Horn, will sail toward the area where the Pacific Pintail is<P>
likely to pass, said Martinez.<P>
     But if the freighter suffered any kind of distress, "there is technically<P>
very little we can do, and that in a sense is even more serious," he said.<P>
     The British naval chief, Admiral Sir Benjamin Bathurst, happened to be<P>
visiting Chile this week and said he believed the British-flagged ship's safety<P>
measures were fully adequate.<P>
     "Personally I am convinced that all precautions are being taken, and that<P>
all necessary measures have been taken for the shipment's safety," Bathurst,<P>
visiting the port of Talcahuano, was quoted as saying in the Santiago newspaper<P>
El Mercurio.<P>
     Officials of President Eduardo Frei's government hardened their stand<P>
against letting the ship into Chilean waters, as ecological groups said<P>
anything less might turn Chile into an east-west transshipment point for<P>
hazardous wastes.<P>
     "We've got enough legal arguments and arguments to protect human health,<P>
ecology and the environment in the area to demand that this boat not pass<P>
through Chilean territorial waters," acting Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez<P>
said on Thursday.<P>
     The freighter left the French port of Cherbourg last month amid protests<P>

Art. 22 of UNCLOS empowers coastal States to regulate passage of various vessels, providing that<P>
1.	The coastal State may, where necessary having regard to safety of navigation, require 
foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage through its territorial sea to use such sea 
lanes and traffic separation schemes as it may designate or prescribe for the regulation of the 
passage of ships.<P>
2.	In particular, tankers, nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently 
dangerous or noxious substances or materials may be required to confine their passage to such 
sea lanes.<P>
3.	In the designation of sea lanes and the prescription of traffic separation schemes under this 
Art., the coastal State may take into account:<P>
(a) the recommendations of the competent international organization;<P>
(b) any channels customarily used for international navigation;<P>
(c) the special characteristics of particular ships and channels; and<P>
(d) the density of traffic.<P>
4.	The coastal State shall clearly indicate such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes on 
charts to which due publicity shall be given.<P>
Art. 23 imposes the obligation on vessels, stating that<P>
Foreign nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances shall, 
when exercising the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, carry documents and observe special 
precautionary measures established for such ships by international agreements.<P>

<H4>RAINBOW WARRIOR FREED 
      AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF FRENCH MILITARY DETENTION                  
</H4>
       

<P>PAPEETE, March 19th 1996

<P>The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior 
sailed from Hao atoll into international waters today, five months 
after being seized by the French military during protests against 
nuclear testing at Moruroa last year.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior is the fourth Greenpeace ship to be freed
from French custody in the last two weeks.  The Rainbow Warrior and 
the MV Greenpeace, due to depart Hao in the next few days, were both 
detained at the Hao military base, while the Vega, La Ribaude and 
Manutea were released from captivity at Moruroa last week.

<P>The captains of both the Rainbow Warrior and the MV Greenpeace have 
been under pressure from the French authorities to leave Hao as soon 
as possible.  The skipper of the Rainbow Warrior, Andy Troia, said 
that once the MV Greenpeace was released, the two ships would sail 
together for safety reasons for the next few days.

<P>"Our ships are in bad disrepair and we have not had adequate time
to check all the systems on board," he said.  "Both ships will require 
extensive repairs before returning to campaign work, and Greenpeace 
will be able to decide their destinations only after seeing how they 
handle at sea."

<P>The release of the Rainbow Warrior comes a week before France, Britain 
and the United States sign the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty 
on March 25th.  Greenpeace's Bunny McDiarmid said the three nuclear 
powers now had an urgent responsibility to ensure a Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty (CTBT) is signed this year.  China is the only nation 
planning to carry out nuclear tests this year prior to the conclusion 
of the CTBT.

<P>"Chinese Premier Li Peng must hear from the international community in 
the same way that France did, that continued testing is unacceptable 
and is jeopardising the conclusion of an international test ban 
treaty," McDiarmid said.

<P>Greenpeace is calling on its members globally to write to Chinese 
Premier Li Peng to ensure that the Chinese authorities are aware of 
citizens' opposition to nuclear testing world-wide.

<H4> GREENPEACE WELCOMES END TO FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING;
     CALLS IT "ANOTHER BARRIER TO GLOBAL TEST BAN REMOVED"                                 
</H4>


<p>PARIS, 29 January, 1996 -- With today's announcement by French
President Jaques Chirac that the sixth French nuclear test
conducted Saturday will be the last, Greenpeace welcomed the news
saying that a global ban on nuclear testing is now that much more
possible.

<p>"After provoking worldwide outrage over the resumption of nuclear
testing, France has finally bowed to international pressure and
stopped its testing at six tests rather than the originally
planned eight," said Greenpeace Disarmament Coordinator Josh
Handler. "The onus is now on France to ensure the passage of a
zero-yield nuclear test ban (CTBT) currently being negotiated."

<p>On Saturday France set of its sixth nuclear test at Fangataufa
atoll which measured 120 kilotonnes.  This was the largest test
carried out by France since it broke a testing moratorium in
September 1995.  

<p>Last week, a controversy arose when France admitted a release of
radioactive iodine 131 was detected after one of its South
Pacific tests.  A number of nations have registered protests and
asked for clarification about this radioactive release as well
as about what other information France has withheld about its
nuclear tests.

<p>"These reports raise great concern about the environmental
aftermath of global nuclear testing," Handler said.  "France and
all other nuclear weapons states must now stop testing and close
their test sites to show support for a CTBT.  

<p>The United Nations Conference on Disarmament (CD) began CTBT
negotiations last week in Geneva.  A treaty text must be agreed
upon by the end of June if it is to be ready for signing in
1996.*  With France halting its nuclear testing, several major
obstacles must be overcome before a CTBT can be achieved.

<p>"China and Russia now pose the biggest threat to achieving a CTBT
in 1996," said Handler.  "Both must agree to a zero-yield test
ban, or one where no tests of any size are acceptable, and China
must immediately halt its ongoing nuclear testing programme if
a ban is to be achieved."

<p>Greenpeace is calling for all nuclear test sites to be open to
independent, international monitoring.  Greenpeace also calling
for the immediate release of its vessels still being detained in
Polynesia by the French navy after peaceful protests  against the
resumption  of French nuclear testing in the South  Pacific - and
for full compensation for damages to them.

<br>Manuel Pinto, Greenpeace Tahiti: +689-433282 or 689-454328

<p>Notes to Editors:

<p>The CTBT treaty is still being negotiated. There are a number of
issues of importance that need to be resolved, including:
<p>     1.  Preamble:  A commitment to nuclear disarmament and
     reference to specific steps which lead to the elimination
     of nuclear weapons should be contained in the preamble.
<p>     2.  Scope:  The treaty must ban nuclear explosions of any
     size, no matter how small, for any purpose.  China and
     Russia have not formally committed to a zero-yield treaty
     in the Geneva negotiations as yet.  In addition, China is
     seeking to exclude so-called "peaceful nuclear explosions"
     from the treaty.
<p>     3.  Verification:  the treaty needs to include a package of
     methods to ensure compliance with its provisions. An
     essential element of the package is on-site inspection.
<p>     4.  Entry Into Force of the CTBT: there should be no
     barrier to achieving rapid entry into force of the treaty,
     following its signature in 1996.

      <H3> GREENPEACE DEMONSTRATORS CALL FOR IMMEDIATE CTBT
                AS NEGOTIATIONS OPEN IN GENEVA</H3>
 
<p>GENEVA, 22 January, 1996 -- (GP) Greenpeace activists held up national flags and banners along with a 5-meter mock nuclear bomb in front of the Palais de Nacion where the United Nations Conference on Disarmament takes up negotiations for a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) today. Some 50 people took part in the demonstration to demand delegates stop nuclear testing and agree a Test Ban immediately.
 
<p>In addition, Greenpeace handed out green Swiss Army knives to delegates entering the building with the words "NUCLEAR TESTING--CUT IT OUT" written on each.
 
<p>"The massive protests around the world against French and Chinese nuclear testing show the public want a nuclear test ban this year," said greenpeace's Simon Carroll in Geneva.  "We urge UN delegates to work diligently over the next six months to ensure this treaty is agreed."
 
<p>In all, the United States, Russia, France, Britain, China and India have conducted 2,043 nuclear tests since 1945. France and China are still testing nuclear weapons, and the threat remains that other nations may resume nuclear tests.  There are still over 20,000 nuclear weapons in the world today, with new ones still being produced.
 
<p>"Despite the end of the Cold, a nuclear arms race continues.  The public remains concerned about nuclear weapons.  Daily we read stories about nuclear proliferation and nuclear safety.  A test ban treaty is needed now as next step towards nuclear disarmament and curbing proliferation," said Carroll.
 
<p>The number one priority for Greenpeace is to see a CTBT agreed ready for signing in 1996.  Greenpeace said it will be watching the negotiations closely and pushing to achieve a zero-yield nuclear test ban treaty this year.
 
<p>Greenpeace Position on the CTBT
<ul>
    <li>The CTBT needs to be ready for signing in 1996.
    <li>The CTBT must ban all nuclear explosions -- it must be  a zero-yield treaty.</ul>

            <h3>CTBT NEGOTIATIONS OPEN NEXT WEEK;GREENPEACE SAYS WORLD WANTS A NUCLEAR TEST BAN IN 1996</h3>
 
<p>GENEVA January, 1996 -- (GP) On 22 January, the latest round
of talks to obtain a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) open
in Geneva when the Conference on Disarmament resumes
negotiations.  Greenpeace says the overwhelming international
outcry against French and Chinese nuclear tests in 1995 shows
clearly that the world's wants an international ban to stop
nuclear weapons testing this year.
 
<p>France conducted it's fifth nuclear test of 1995 on 27 December
and is expected to explode at least one more test early this year
in the South Pacific.  China also tested two nuclear weapons at
its Lop Nor test site in 1995 and is also expected to continue
testing in 1996.  According to news reports, suspicions have been
raised that India may conduct a nuclear test before a treaty goes
into effect.  

<p>In all, the United States, Russia, France, Britain, China and 
India have conducted 2,043 nuclear tests since 1945. France and
China are still testing nuclear weapons, and the threat remains
that other nations may resume nuclear tests.  

<p>"The massive outrage expressed against French and Chinese testing
shows the world public is demanding a treaty to end nuclear tests
be negotiated now," said Greenpeace Disarmament Coordinator
Joshua Handler.  "The clock is ticking.  The Geneva delegations
have six months to reach agreement if a treaty is to be ready for
signing in 1996."

<p>A comprehensive test ban has been on the international
disarmament agenda since the 1950s.  In 1994, the Conference on
Disarmament began negotiations on this treaty.  At the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) extension conference in May 1995,
nuclear and non-nuclear weapons states agreed that obtaining a
CTBT as soon as possible was a high priority.

<p>"There are still over 20,000 nuclear weapons in the world today,
and new ones still being produced.  A test ban treaty is needednow to end nuclear testing and as the critical next step toward
further nuclear disarmament," said Handler.

<p>At the end of the last negotiating session key issues that
remained unresolved were:  the lack of Russian and Chinese 
support for a zero-yield treaty, (one that would not allow
nuclear explosions of any size), China's insistence on permitting
nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes, and opposition by
nuclear weapons states for further specific disarmament steps to
be addressed in the treaty.

<p>Greenpeace's priority for 1996, it's 25th anniversary year, is
to see that a CTBT is signed this year.  Greenpeace was founded
in 1971 when a group of activists set sail for Alaska from
Vancouver, Canada, to try to stop a U.S. nuclear weapons test on
the Aleutian Islands.
 
<p>Over the years, Greenpeace has held protests at the French, U.S.,
British, and Soviet nuclear test-sites, worked with the victims
of U.S. nuclear testing in the South Pacific, sponsored
scientific investigations on the environmental damage from
nuclear testing, and attended NPT review conferences.  During
1995, Greenpeace was a leader in the fight to stop French and
Chinese nuclear testing.
 
<p>Greenpeace's demands for the CTBT talks include:
<ul>
<li>The CTBT needs to be ready for signing in 1996.
<li> The CTBT must ban all nuclear explosions -- it must be
zero-yield treaty</ul>.

<h3>December 27th 1995</h3>
<h4>FIFTH 
NUCLEAR TEST;</h4>
	
<p>PARIS, 27 December, 1995 -- (GP) With Christmas just two days 
before, France ignored global tidings of peace on earth and 
conducted its fifth nuclear test at Muroroa atoll in the South 
Pacific.  The nuclear weapons test comes on the heels of a 
United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for the 
immediate cessation of all nuclear tests which Greenpeace called 
yet another international rogue act on the part of France.
<p>
"As 1996 approaches, it is difficult to tell if the French 
government is more unpopular at home or abroad," said Damon 
Moglen of Greenpeace.  "It is an outrage that President Chirac 
has turned a deaf ear to international outcry against nuclear 
testing and allow testing two days after Christmas."
<p>
The French nuclear test today measured some 30 kilotonnes.  The 
nuclear explosion took place under Morora atoll which has 
already been seriously damaged by past French weapons tests.  
The test is France's fifth since it broke a nuclear testing 
moratorium with a first test in September, 1995.
<p>
The test comes just days after 85 nations forced a resolution
through the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) which calls 
for the "immediate cessation of all nuclear testing."  The 
resolution, which French officials strenuously fought, noted 
that nations "deplored the current testing and urged the nuclear 
weapons states observing moratoria to continue these moratoria 
pending the entry into force of a comprehensive test ban 
treaty".  
<p>While French President Chirac has stated that he supports a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT), it is widely
recognized that the French tests have seriously undermined the
ongoing CTBT negotiations.  Chirac has shown further contempt 
for
the CTBT talks by stating that Frence's curret test series will
only end towards the end of the February 1996--weeks after the
January 1996 resumption of CTBT negotations in Geneva.  

<P>"Each and every one of these nuclear tests poses an immense 
short
and long-term threat to the environment and human health," said
Moglen.  "While people around the planet are hoping for a safe 
and peaceful new year, President Chirac is instead guaranteeing 
that nuclear testing and nuclear weapons development will be as 
much a part of 1996 as it was of 1995."

<p>Greenpeace is calling on the French government to immediately 
cease its nuclear tests and start 1996 with a pledge to work 
toward the immediate negotiation of a CTBT.

<h3>Occasional missives from the Master</h3>
<a><IMG SRC="jcastle.gif" alt="John Castle"></a>
<P>August 17, 1995
 
<P>     I'm Jon Castle, new captain of the Rainbow Warrior II,
taking over from Dave Enever.
<P>    I flew over from Europe to Fiji around the 8th of August.
Not an ecological way to travel, but one of the compromises we
have to make sometimes, I guess.  Still getting over jet lag.  I
haven't been out in the Pacific for 10 years or so, and it's good
to meet some old friends, even be in the same hemisphere as some
other old friends.  Before flying out I met up with Steve Sawyer
and Dave McTaggart for a half hour, worthwhile.  The solidarity
you only get from personal humor connections and feelings is
often what you are left with, and need, at the end of the day,
when doubts may in - steal.  Remember the other side are often
good talkers.  They have all the money and can pay professional
script writers and PR folk to write and mouth elegant speeches
justifying everything from ethnic cleansing to clear cutting
forests; selling milk powder to healthy mums; having 5 plastic 
wrappers on a loaf of bread to treating animals as economic units 
and keeping them in cages all their lives.  So sometimes the 
slick talk gets you fuddled, but your heart still says no, hang 
on a minute, something smells wrong here.
<P>     Then the solidarity of friends helps to remind you where the 
straight track is - obscured by the smoke of PR maybe, but still 
there if you look hard enough.
 <P>    To get to Tahiti for August 23rd we have to motor against 
Easterly head winds.  It's uncomfortable, a moderate swell, the 
ship pitching and rolling day after day.  Every evening we hear 
of other boats joining the Peace fleet, setting off.  It's 
encouraging, touching.  It seems down to a few individuals 
always.  All the official bodies make tentative announcements.  
And to be honest the mass of people just go along with whatever 
the current establishment says.
 <P>    The great ecological battle of the future must be to take 
power back to smaller groups of individuals.  To empower people 
so they have self respect enough to be responsible for their 
communities and their descendants.
 <P>    At present it's still all rushing the other way.  Everything 
down to "economics", the non-science Power to the GATT, a world 
tyranny designed to mash the last vertigoes of communal links. 
human ties, turns us all into passive little frightened 
individual consumers, lost and alone in this dark universe.  
Instead of the alternative - all small parts of this wonderful 
community of nature and minerals on this living planet with a 
past and a future.  A home where we belong, together.
 <P>   From the pilot book I see the European discoverer of Moruroa 
was a Guernsey man like me, Philip Carteret.  Lots of 
'coincidences' all the way.
  <P>   12 Nationalities out of 19 crew members - pretty good, but <br>
still only 4 women to 15 men - more ladies please apply to 
Greenpeace.
  <P>   So China did do a nuke test after all.  Bad news. Glad to 
see some Greenpeace directors relinquished their desks for a 
banner protest in Tienmen Square beforehand.  Well done ladies 
and gents!  A good example.
 
  <P>   Ok, good wishes, one and all.  Prayers and good vibes 
welcome out here.
 
     <P>                                   Jon Castle

<HR>
<P>SUGGESTION FOR A LETTER TO AMBASSADORS 

<br>
<P>Your Excellency,

<P>I want to protest strongly against the nuclear test China held
in Lop Nor on 17 August. This is the second time your country
has set off a nuclear test since the signing of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty in May of this year. 

<P>At the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) conference in
May, your country promised to "excercise utmost restraint" in
the field of nuclear testing. Three days later your government
tested a nuclear weapon in Lop Nor. By continuing to test
nuclear weapons, your country blatantly defies the spirit of
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aims to put a stop to
the spread of nuclear weapons. 

<P>It also sets back the current negotiations about the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, by provoking other countries to
develop and test nuclear weapons because you do. You cannot
ask other countries to hold back on aquiring their own nuclear
arsenal unless the states which currently hold nuclear weapons
show they are prepared not to use them. Your country, as well
as France, must set an example for world peace and stop
testing nuclear weapons, instead of actively continuing
the nuclear threat. 

<P>I urge you to reconsider any further plans for nuclear tests
immediately, and start working towards eliminating all nuclear
weapons by adopting a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now.

<P>Yours Sincerely,

<br><br><br><br>

 <body>
<H4>Dear Fellow Scientists,</H4>
<P>                      As   you  are  no doubt  aware,  the  French 
Government   intends  to resume the testing of nuclear weapons  in 
the  S. Pacific at Moruroa Atoll  in September. We are writing  to 
you  because we believe that such testing poses  an   unacceptable  
risk,  both  now and in the future to human health   and  to   the  
wider environment. In addition, it poses a threat to nuclear  non-
proliferation.   
 
<P>The  implications of the planned  testing  programme have not been 
examined  in relation to the current condition of the test   site. 
Previous  scientific missions, even with access to  limited  data, 
have  raised  serious questions about the safety  of  the  testing 
programme. We, therefore, believe that there is an urgent need  to 
carry  out a thorough  geological,  hydrological, biological   and  
radiological  assessment  of  the  site in order to have  a   more  
comprehensive understanding  of the effects of past tests and  the 
likely   impact of  a  resumption  of the testing programme.  This 
needs to be carried out prior to any further testing.
 
<P>Accordingly   we   are circulating  with  this  letter  the  broad 
outline of  an  independent work  programme  which  we believe  to 
be   a  minimum  required  to establish  the  true  situation.  We 
hope  that  you will be  able  to lend  your   support   to   this  
programme  and  join  the  list  of signatories  that believe this 
work  to be essential. We intend  to  forward this to  the  French 
Authorities in due course.
 
<P>In addition, we are in the process of constructing a more detailed 
work  programme based around the general outline. If you have  any 
detailed suggestions for work which would improve the scope of the 
proposed  study or any additions or refinements to it we would  be 
very  grateful to hear from you on this also. Again, the  detailed 
proposal will be submitted to the French Authorities.
 
<P>We hope that  you will  feel  able  to lend us  your  support   or  
to  contribute expertise  to  construct the detailed programme  of  
study. In addition, if you know of any other colleagues who  would 
also be prepared to lend their support, we would be very happy  to 
hear from them.   Please contact  Paul Johnston or David  Santillo 
at  the address above,  or alternatively through the  Internet  at 
address: Exeter.lab@Green2.greenpeace.org
 
 
 
<head>RATIONALE FOR A PROGRAMME OF STUDY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF  FRENCH 
NUCLEAR TESTING AT MORUROA AND FANGATAUFA</head>
<P>The president of France, M. Jacques Chirac has recently  announced 
that  France intends to resume the testing of nuclear  weapons  at 
Moruroa   and  Fangataufa  Atolls  in  the  South  Pacific  during 
September.  At   the  same time  he has stated  that  the  testing 
programme carried out  by  France had  no  ecological consequences 
and that  independent  scientists would be invited to observe  the 
tests to prove their safety. 
 
<P>Nonetheless,   observation  of  the  tests  alone  is  simply  not 
adequate as an overall assessment of the possible consequences  of  
resuming  the testing regime. Very few data exist  concerning  the 
impact upon the  atolls  and their environs of  previous   testing  
programmes  carried  out  at the sites. The  data  that  do  exist 
indicate    grounds  for   serious   concerns,   both  about   the  
integrity   of  the  atoll structure  and the containment  of  the 
radioactive products of  the weapons testing. 
 
<P>To  date there have been more than 120 underground tests in  these 
locations. The degree to which the fission products from these 
tests will be  contained within the structure of the atoll in  the 
long term is highly uncertain. Effectively, the two sites comprise 
an unregulated dump for radioactive wastes from these  explosions. 
This  has never been subjected to a full, independent  evaluation. 
Several scientific missions to the atolls, all of which have  been 
described as "exploratory" by the scientists concerned, have taken 
place. A common theme to the conclusions reached in these  studies 
is  a call for greater openness and constant vigilance at the  test 
sites.  Moreover,  the  data produced by at  least  two  of  these 
missions  raise  serious questions about the short and  long  term 
containment of radioactivity within the atoll. 
 
<P>The  scientists taking part in these missions were  well  respected 
and  of  international stature. They were led by  Haroun  Tazieff, 
Prof.   H.  Atkinson  and  Cmdr  Jacques  Cousteau   respectively. 
Nonetheless,  time constraints and logistic  restrictions  severely 
limited  the scope of these studies and the  information  obtained 
was, thus, in each case only of a preliminary nature. Very  little 
substantial information, therefore, has made its way to the public 
or   scientific  communities as a result of  the  work.   Further, 
despite  their limited and hence inconclusive nature,  the  French 
Government  has  used these studies to  justify  continuing  their 
testing  programme  and  to assert that the  tests  are  safe  and 
contained.
 
<P>Considering  this,  there is clearly a need  for  a  comprehensive 
exhaustive  and independent scientific study prior to any  further 
tests. It is important  to recognise  that  such a study does  not 
require  the  disclosure  of militarily   sensitive    information   
concerning    the     weapons  themselves.   Hence   there  is  no 
conflict  between the  needs  of  a robust  scientific   programme 
of work and the  perceived  need  to preserve militarily sensitive 
information.  Obviously,  however, the authorities  will  need  to 
grant  access to both sites but it must be emphasised   that   the 
nature  of  the required  programme  does  not conflict  with  the 
interests of national security. 
 
<P>An environmental assessment of the atolls should apply, as a basic 
minimum,  the  same  criteria  as applied  to  civilian  sites  in 
relation to the short and long term possibilities of environmental 
damage, radioactive escapes and needs for radiological protection. 
In  addition, this assessment should fully acknowledge that  there 
are  inherent  uncertainties in any predictive exercise  and  that 
gaps  exist in the data. Accordingly, a precautionary approach  to 
future  environmental  protection  of the  atolls  and  the  wider 
environment  is required where full weight is given to  scientific 
uncertainty  and  ignorance of the long term consequences  of  the 
tests. 
 
<P>It  must  be  recognised by the French Government  that  the  time 
required for a genuine, comprehensive environmental assessment  is 
considerably greater than would be required for simple observation 
of  the  tests  at  the  time  that  they  are  carried  out.  The 
comprehensive nature of the work required implies not only a  long 
lead time for preparation and logistics but also sufficient time to 
execute the actual fieldwork.
 
<P>It must also be recognised that a genuine environmental assessment 
can  only take place if there is no restriction on access  to  the 
study  areas. This must be facilitated by the  French  Government. 
Additionally, the Authorities must be prepared to provide the most 
detailed   and  recent  data  available  on  the   structure   and 
geomorphology  of the atolls together with the best data  available 
concerning  the  radioactive inventory present.  Such  information 
would  pose  no threat to the national security of France  but  is 
indispensable to the conduct of the study.
 
<P>Finally,  a multidisciplinary approach will be required.  This  is 
likely to be a cost intensive process, a judgment supported by the 
large sums of money required to conduct surveys of nuclear weapons 
production  sites  in the United States. The  resourcing  for  the 
programme  will  need to be supported with  substantial  financing  
and logistic support from the French Government.
 
<P>The  following  programme of work suggested in  this  document  is 
designed to take into account various of the concerns attached  to 
past  and planned future weapons testing. It is designed to  be  a 
repeatable  exercise so that the effect of future testing  can  be 
gauged  against present environmental conditions. Central  to  the 
concerns are the possibility of leakage of radionuclides from  the 
test  sites.  Hence  the programme should address  in  detail  the 
possibility that leakage has already occurred and the  possibility 
that  it might do so in the future bearing in mind  the  extremely 
long  half-life  of many of the radioactive  isotopes  involved.It 
must  be recognised by the French Government that  the  scientific 
integrity  of any programme based solely upon observation  at  the 
time of testing is highly suspect.
 
<P>The    programme   should  include  inter  alia  the     following  
elements  and a decision on whether to recommence testing or   not 
should  be  based  on  consideration  of  the  results  of    this 
programme,   notwithstanding   other   political   aspects    (ie. 
nuclear proliferation and related issues): 
 
<P>1)  A full survey of the topography of the atoll using  side  scan 
sonar  and a remotely operated vehicle equipped with  cameras  and 
testing instruments. This will establish the nature and occurrence 
of  any externally visible fissures. These may be  present in  the 
basaltic  parent  material  laid  down  by  aerial  and  submarine 
volcanic  activity  in  which  tests  are  conducted,  or  in  the 
overlying transition zone, dolomite and limestone strata. In  turn 
this   will  allow  an  evaluation,  supplemented   by   empirical 
measurement  of  actual concentrations of  radionuclides,  of  the 
potential   for  release  of  nucliides  from  the  internal   reef 
structure.
 
<P>2) A shallow seismic testing programme to establish the degree  to 
which  the  internal  integrity of the atoll  structure  has  been 
compromised  by previous testing. Such a programme  would  provide 
some information on the degree of internal fissuring of the parent 
and  overlying materials and also contribute substantially  to  an 
evaluation of the potential for radioactive leakage to occur  from 
the  atoll  structure.  Together  with  data  produced  from   the 
visual/sonar  inspection  an evaluation is then  possible  of  the 
potential for serious structural changes in the atoll produced  by 
future weapons testing.
 
<P>3)   A   comprehensive  sampling  campaign  to   investigate   the 
concentrations  of  radionuclides in fish,  planktonic  organisms, 
sediments  and coralline structures. Where feasible, samples  will 
also be taken from various locations outside the atoll to  provide 
data  on existing background levels. This exercise will  help  to 
establish  whether  radioactive materials have been  released.  It 
will  also  give some indications of the quantities  of  radiation 
released.   By  using  coralline  materials  and   analysing   the 
radionuclides  present in the skeletal matrix, it may be  possible 
to  establish the timing and approximate magnitude of releases  of 
radionuclides in the past.
 
<P>4)  An exhaustive determination of the hydrology of the atoll  and 
reef  structure. This should determine the general water  movement 
through  the  various  strata of the  atoll.  Knowledge  of  water 
movements  through the system, the interaction between  fresh  and 
salt water in the reef system, the presence and size of freshwater 
lens  systems will allow a more precise estimate of the  speed  at 
which radionuclides may be carried to the outside environment as a 
result  of failure of these substances to be contained within  the 
reef  structure. In particular the hydrological  relationships  of 
fissures and faults identified by 1 & 2 above and the remnant test 
chambers and the boreholes leading to them is a high priority.
 
<P>5)   Following   these  evaluations,  an   epidemiological   study 
integrating  retrospective  and  prospective  elements  should  be 
initiated  to assess the local and regional health impacts of  the 
testing regime, past and present.2 above and
 
<P>6) A comparison of the potential for radionuclide release from the 
testing sites should be made with standards routinely enforced for
initiated civil nuclear installations.
 
<P>Should  a  decision  to  resume  testing    be  taken  after  this 
programme is  carried out and its results  fully  considered,   it  
should be agreed that the programme  be repeated immediately  after 
the test series has taken place.

<H2>GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS CONFRONT AMERICAN PLAN TO DUMP
SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL NEAR U.S. / MEXICAN BORDER</H2>
<blockquote> 
<p><B>Mexico City, August 6th, 1996.</B>

<P>Activists from the environmental
pressure group Greenpeace chained themselves to the entrance of
the
US Embassy, to protest the constuction of a low-level radioactive
waste dump in Sierra Blanca, Texas, to be sited a mere 32
kilometers from the Mexican border.  At the same time, 2 more
activists hung a banner from the roof of the building reading:
MEXICO IS NOT A WASTE DUMP, STOP SIERRA BLANCA.


<P><a href="../pics/gpmex04.jpg"><img align=top src="../thumbs/gpmex04t.jpg" alt="GP Mexico action" width=150 height=100></a>

   <p>  While the 8 activists blocked the doors of the Embassy,
another group from Greenpeace marched down the central Avenida
Paseo de la Reforma, with a parody of the famous "Statue of
Liberty".  With its right arm held high, the statue carried a bag
of garbage, while covering its nose with its left hand in a
gesture
of repugnance at waste dumped onto Mexican territory.


<P><a href="../pics/gpmex05.jpg"><img align=top src="../thumbs/gpmex05t.jpg" alt="GP Mexico action" width=150 height=100></a>



<p>"Today in Texas, the process of public hearings with regard to
the
permit for the construction of the low-level radioactive waste
facility in Sierra Blanca begins", said Monique Mitastein,
Executive Director of Greenpeace Mexico.

<P><a href="../pics/gpmex06.jpg"><img align=top src="../thumbs/gpmex06t.jpg" alt="GP Mexico action" width=150 height=100></a>


   <p>  "With this peaceful protest we want to express to the US
government our opposition to the construction of the dump, which
represents an environmental risk to the border region in the
north
of Mexico and for the millons of people who live there", she
added.

<p>According to the Texas Low Level Radioactive Waste Authority, 70%
of the waste going to Sierra Blanca would come from nuclear power
plants.  Thus, the Sierra Blanca dump would contain radioactive
elements with half-lives of hundreds, thousands and millions of
years.

  <p>  In the US there are 109 nuclear reactors that have
accumulated
an enormous quantity of radioactive waste which is currently
stored
on-site.  If approved, Sierra Blanca could become the principal 
receiving facility for radioactive waste stored in US nuclear
plants, at only 32 kilometers from the Mexican border.

<p>Requirements for the construction of a dump such as the proposed
Sierra Blanca facility, according to Texas regulations, prohibit
construction in areas of seismic activity, geological faults and
wind or rain erosion.  However, an independent study carried out
by
Radioactive Waste Management Associates (RWMA) recognizes that
the
proposed site suffers erosion problems, seismic instability,
geological faults, and a high risk of radioactive contamination
of
the subsurface due to the porousness of the soil.  In addition,
the
study identifies the proximity of the the dump to the Rio Bravo
as
a grave threat to the millions of people living in the border
zone.

<p>     On April 13th, 1995, the strongest earthquake to hit Texas
in
60 years (5.6 on the Richter scale) occurred, precisely in the
western part of the state, in Sierra Blanca.  In 1931, in the
same

region, the largest earthquake in Texan history took place.  RWMA
specialists warn that an earthquake could result in radioactive
contamination of the subsoil due to filtration.  Between  1923
and
1993 64 earthquakes registering 3 or more on the Richter scale
were
recorded, within a 220 mile radius around the proposed site of
the
Sierra Blanca nuclear waste dump.

   <p>  Greenpeace  said "that the Sierra Blanca nuclear waste dump
confirms yet again the practices of environmental racism of the
US
government against minority populations, in this case, against
the
poor Mexican-american communities that live in the area". The
project furthermore violates the spirit of the Peace Resolution
signed between the US and Mexican governments which was designed
the protect the border environment.

   <p> Finally, Greenpeace called upon the Mexican government to,
through the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of
Foreign
Affairs, play a more active role in opposing the Sierra Blanca
dump.

   <p>  Along with Greenpeace, the town councils of Ciudad Juarez,
Chih. and Cuidad Acu$a, Coah., the Local Congresses of Chihuahua
and Coahuila and the Senate Commissions on Border Issues and
Ecology participated in the public hearings taking place in
Texas.

<H2>GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS HALT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PIER ON
PROTECTED REEF OF PLAYA PARAISO.</H2>
 
<p>COZUMEL, QUINTANA ROO, 20 February 1996 -- Greenpeace activists
today chained themselves to cranes and hung a banner reading
"Stop the Pier, save the coral" to halt the construction of a new
pier on the Playa Paraiso.  The activists are protesting against
the destruction of the coral reef within a Refuge Zone for the
Protection of Marine Wildlife.
 
<p>"It is unacceptable to sacrifice this fragile and important
ecosystem and to break the environmental regulations for the sake
of financial gain," said Fernando Bejarano of Greenpeace Mexico.
"Greenpeace supports the local and national groups that oppose
the construction of a pier in a protected zone."

<p>The pier project does not have a license for commercial use and
has strong opposition from local people and other environmental
groups.  However the environmental authorities have permitted the
construction of the pier. The plans include a terminal building
for passengers, the access to the pier terminal of tourist
cruises, a parking area, a golf course, a shopping centre and a
Club Resort.  
     
<p>Environmentalists and divers of Cozumel have witnessed the damage
caused by the construction of the pier and the destruction of the
coral reef of El Paraiso with the traffic of a large number of
tourist cruiseliners.
 
<p>The local groups propose that the construction of the pier should
be near the Centre of Cozumel where there would be a lower risk
of destroying the fragile coral reef.
 
<p>The Greenpeace flagship, Moby Dick is in the third week of her
tour "In Defense of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, having
made stops at Veracruz State and the State of Tabasco. The next
leg of the tour is expected to take the Moby Dick to Central
America.

<H2>GREENPEACE TOUR "FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE
CARIBBEAN"</H2>

<P>Greenpeace flagship Moby Dick is touring the Gulf of Mexico and
the Caribbean highlighting the plights of the local communities
facing the effects of environmental destruction.

<p>14 February 1996: Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz State

<p>Tour of the oil and chemical facilities on three Greenpeace
inflatables and three fishing boats. There was a large outfall
pipe spilling into what was once an expansive mangrove habitat.
It has destroyed a very rich fishing industry.

<p>In Pajaritos Lagoon, where there is a high concentration of 
refinery and chemical factories, the fisherman and press have
been denied access. 
 
<p>Greenpeace held a press conference next to the pipes which
discharge chlorine based chemicals produced at the facility.
Petroleos Mexicana (Pemex), the government owned oil company,
denied any pollution in spite of overwhelming  evidence to the
contrary.
 
<p>15 February 1996: Barra de Santa Ana, state of Tabasco 

<p>Greenpeace met with concerned fishermen, oyster gatherers and 
campesinos who have lost their livelihoods due to the
environmental destruction from  the Pemex facility.   Greenpeace
held a rally in the public square where 300 people attended,
voicing their anger at Pemex.  There is a growing civil
resistance movement in Tabasco, which is  spreading to Campeche
and Veracruz, against the oil companies and their  rampant
destruction of fragile ecosystems.
 
<p>19 February 1996: Expected in Cozumel at 0800   

<p>Greenpeace will highlight the protection of the coral reefs,
particularly from the plans to  build a dock  over the Paradise
Reef for oceanliners and cruise  ships.
 
<p>22 February 1996: Expected arrival in Puerto Barrios, Saint Tomas
de Castilla, Livingston

<p>Greenpeace will highlight the manatee habitat protection.

<center><H3> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<p>GREENPEACE PROTESTS MEXICO'S LAGUNA VERDE NUCLEAR PLANT ABOARD VESSEL MOBY DICK</H3></center><p>

VERACRUZ, Mexico, 8 February 1996 -- (GP) The Greenpeace vessel Moby Dick arrived at the port of the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant today flying a banner calling for a true account of the plant's cost and safety record.<p>

As the Moby Dick approached the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, three Greenpeace inflatible boats were launched, landed on the beach near the plant and displayed a banner reading "Laguna Verde, Nuclear Backyard."  The banner remained for over two hours.  The Moby Dick was joined by two Mexican fishing boats from Villa Rica in the protest and all the boats flew nuclear warning flags throughout the protest.<p>

The Moby Dick arrived at Veracruz's Port on February 5th as part of its "Defending the Gulf and the Caribbean" tour.  <p>

<p>Greenpeace is calling on the Mexican government to allow an independent inspection of the Laguna Verde nuclear plant and to make public financial information about the true costs of the plant, its waste disposal and eventual dismantling.  Greenpeace has proposed that independent experts be allowed access to the plant to carry out safety inspections and that environmental NGOs and other authorities be allowed access to their findings. <p>

"Mexican people do not have to live under the risk of a nuclear accident and we don't have the right to force our current energy problems on future generations," said Greenpeace's Alejandro Calvillo.  "The Mexican government must first provide honest information about the true costs and environmental problems posed by the Laguna Verde plant and to seek long-term, safe energy solutions for the future."<p>

<P>Laguna Verde, a General Electric boiling water reactor (BWR) is the only Nuclear Plant in Mexico and has been plagued with technical problems during construction and since it first went on line in 1989.  A series of emergencies have been reported at the plant which have led to plant being shut downs and to the release of radioactivity into the environment.  <p>

In addition, there have been reports of corruption at the Laguna Verde plant as well as harassment and intimidation of plant employees who have divulged information about safety problems.  Similar General Electric BWR reactors have also reported safety problems implying that design flaws could lead to accidents at the Laguna Verde plant in the future.<p>

<P>This nuclear plant has been an economical failure for Mexico.  Expected to cost an estimated US$ 128 million for an output of 500 megawatts, Laguna Verde has now cost more than US$ 7 billion without factoring in the costs of dismantling the plant and storing radioactive waste which are expected to cost billions of dollars more.<p>

There is no safe way of disposing of the mounting radiative waste accumulating at Laguna Verde.  There have been reports since 1995 that the Laguna Verde waste is being incinerated which would allow radioactive particles to be released into the atmosphere. <p>

"It is high time to leave the path pursued in the use of nuclear energy in the past, to develop new, alternative and clean sources of energy supply and, during the transition period, devote all efforts to ensure maximum safety.  This is the price to pay to enable life to continue on this planet" <p>

--Peter Jankowissch, then Austrian Foreign Minister, addressing the First Special Session of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in September 1986 four months after the Chernobyl nuclear accident had contaminated Austria and the rest of Europe with radioactive fallout.<p>
<HR>

Greenpeace opposes all aspects of the nuclear power industry.  Nuclear power is unsafe, is economically unsound and is unnecessary.<p>

The whole nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining and enrichment to the use of nuclear reactors and reprocessing of reactor fuel, creates radioactive wastes and routinely releases radioactive gas and water into the environment.<p>

Nuclear power technology is also inherently linked to nuclear weapons technology and thus fuels global nuclear proliferation.<p>

Greenpeace actively works to promote alternatives to nuclear power such as renewable electricity production and energy efficiency and conservation.<p>


THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY<p>

The nuclear industry is now facing eventual extinction from the global energy marketplace due to environmental and economic concerns.  There were 421 commercial nuclear plants in operation at the beginning of 1996, ten fewer than there were at the industry's peak in December 1988.  Between the end of 1990 and 1991, the total installed nuclear generating capacity actually declined for the first time since commercial nuclear power was put to use in the 1950s.  <p>

In the United States, all reactor orders made over the past 20 years have subsequently been cancelled.  Between 1972 and 1990 there were 119 nuclear plants cancelled by United States utilities.  In Canada, the nuclear industry has not placed an order for a reactor since 1974.  In Latin America, only four reactors are now in operation: one in Mexico, one in Brazil and two in Argentina.  In Cuba, the construction of two Soviet- designed reactors was halted in 1992 for economic reasons.<p>

A number of European countries have made formal commitments to shut down their nuclear programmes.  Austria abandoned its only nuclear plant at Zwentendorf, Greece scrapped plans to build its first nuclear plant and Italian voters decided in November 1987 to block the expansion of the country's nuclear programme.  In June 1990, the Italian parliament approved a measure to dismantle the country's three existing reactors.<p>

In February 1992, the Belgium government reaffirmed an indefinite moratorium on new reactors.  In 1990, Switzerland voted for a moratorium on reactor construction for 10 years.  In April 1991, the Spanish government reaffirmed its 1983 moratorium on nuclear construction.  In September 1993, the Finnish parliament voted against government plans for a fifth nuclear reactor.  In Germany no new nuclear plants have been ordered since the mid 1970s and there are no plants under construction.  In addition, in 1989 - 1991, three of the major nuclear projects under way were abandoned.<p>

In 1989, the British government abandoned its plans for expansion when attempted privatisation showed the true costs of the nuclear industry.  Now there is only one reactor under construction at an estimated cost of US$ 5.7 billion.  Sweden decided in 1980 referendum to phase out all nuclear power by 2010 despite using more nuclear energy per person than any other country in the world.<p>

In France, long held as the Western nation most committed to nuclear power for energy, the state electricity utility in 1992 had built up a dept of US$ 38 billion.  Growing technical problems have led to extensive maintenance and repairs, costing the public billions of francs.<p>

The nuclear industry is desperate.  The lack of orders for new reactors in North America and Western Europe has forced the industry to look elsewhere for a substitute market -- namely Asia and Eastern Europe.  Nuclear power is being promoted in both regions by Western nuclear companies with the help of their respective governments.  They are being aided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United Nations-backed organization whose primary aim is to promote dangerous nuclear power.<p>

The world has experienced a number of perilous nuclear accidents.  The explosion at the Soviet-built Chernobyl Reactor Four released 190 tonnes of highly radioactivity materials into the environment ten years ago.  According to some estimates, at least 9 million people have been effected directly or indirectly.  Over 70 percent of the radiation fell on the population of Belarus and the entire zone has become a zone of international ecological disaster. <p>

The near-melt down at America's Three Mile Island facility in 1979, only 200 miles from New York City, is known as the worst commercial nuclear accident in United States history.  A sequence of equipment malfunctions and operator errors lead to the accident and industry officials attempted to cover up the full extent of the accident, and the amount of radioactivity released into the environment has never been ascertained.  The reactor was permanently shutdown.  <p>

Other accidents at the Sosnovy Bor reactor in Russia, Japan's Monju fast breeder reactor, Argentina's Atucha reactor, Spain's Vandellos reactor, and France's Superphenix fast breeder reactor all demonstrate the potential for future nuclear accidents with catastrophic human and environmental costs.<p>

Given the safety risk of nuclear reactors, the fact that nuclear power is more expensive than other forms of energy and the immediate need for a global commitment to alternative forms of energy for the future, Greenpeace is campaigning to end the nuclear power threat.  Please join us in this effort.<p>

"TEST-BAN SIGNING: IT SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS TREATY:", Greenpeace says.</H3>
 

<P><B> The organisation celebrates the end of 25 years campaigning against nuclear testing.
<P>NEW YORK, September 24th 1996:</B>
 

<P>The signing of the treaty banning all
nuclear tests (CTBT) was hailed today by Greenpeace as opening up the
way to a world free of the threat of nuclear weapons. Greenpeace
however stressed that the achievement of a nuclear free future hinged
on the willingness of the nuclear weapons states (Russia, China,
United Kingdom, United States, France) to now make systematic efforts
to reduce and eliminate their stocks of nuclear weapons.

<P>"This is an important day for nuclear disarmament and for Greenpeace "
said Bruce Hall, Greenpeace US Disarmament Campaigner. " We are here
today to celebrate an end to nuclear testing forever. It is 25 years
since Greenpeace was founded in Vancouver by a group of people who
wanted to halt the planned US nuclear tests on Amchitka Island (1).
But our efforts are not at an end. We will be working hard in the

future to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons."

<P>Greenpeace considers that the overwhelming public opposition to
nuclear testing and the almost universal support for the treaty in the
United Nations means that, even before the treaty officially enters
into force, it will prevent any resumption of testing. However, the
organisation is calling on the nuclear weapons states to guarantee
that the end to testing is irrevocable. These countries should rapidly
ratify the treaty and demonstrate in this way their good faith to
the commitments they have made to pursue nuclear disarmament.

<P>"The best way to ensure that the few countries critical of the CTBT,
especially India, see the benefits of joining the near consensus in
favour of the treaty, is for the nuclear weapons states to lead by
example", said Tom Clements, Greenpeace International Nuclear Campaigner. "That means affirming that they have finished testing, and
implementing further measures to get rid of the nuclear weapons they
have accumulated over the last fifty years".

<P>(1) In 1971 the US announced plans for a nuclear test at Amichtka,
near the tip of the Aleutian  Island in the North Pacific. Greenpeace
chartered the Phyllis Cormack to take their protest directly to the
test site.

   <H2>The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)</H2>



<b> 
<p>The nuclear weapons age began on 16 July 1945 when the United
States exploded the first nuclear bomb, codenamed 'Trinity' at

Alamogordo, New Mexico. The Soviet Union was next to explode a
bomb, in August 1949. Other countries followed:  Britain's first

test was in October 1952; France's in February 1960; China's in
October 1964 and India's in 1974.
 
<p>Since 1945, there have been 2,046 tests worldwide, about one
nuclear test every nine days for the last fifty-one years. The
U.S. has carried out 1,030 nuclear weapon tests; the former
Soviet Union has done 715; France, 210; Britain, 45 and China
also 45. India has exploded one nuclear device, which it claimed
was for peaceful purposes.
 
<p>Nuclear weapon test explosions have been carried out in the
atmosphere, underground, and underwater. They have occurred on
top of towers, onboard barges, suspended from balloons, on the
earth's surface, deep underwater, deep underground and in
horizontal tunnels bored into the sides of mountains. Nuclear
bombs also have been dropped by aircraft and fired by rockets up
to 200 miles into the atmosphere.
 
<p>Wherever nuclear weapons testing has occurred there have been
environmental problems. Large areas of land are contaminated as
a result of atmospheric tests and the long-term consequences of
underground nuclear testing are unknown. Fallout from the peak
years of atmospheric nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s,
contaminated food, milk and water around the globe.
 
<p>In 1954, India made the first proposal calling for an agreement

to ban nuclear weapons tests. In 1958, the U.S., Soviet Union,
and the U.K. began a Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear
Tests in Geneva and the U.S. and the Soviet Union also agreed to
a nuclear test moratorium. Agreement was all but reached on
banning all atmospheric and underwater tests, tests in space, and
underground testing above a set explosive power with a moratorium
on explosions below that level. The unresolved issues were
expected to be settled at a summit in May 1960. But the scandal
following the shooting down by the Soviet Union of a U.S. U-2 spy
plane over Russia, lead to the cancellation of the summit. During
1961, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union started testing again.
 
<p>Some progress was made towards limiting nuclear testing during
the remainder of the Cold War. However, despite an end to nuclear
testing in the atmosphere and temporary halts to nuclear testing
for some periods of months by one or more of the nuclear powers,
the nuclear arms race ground inexorably onwards and nuclear
testing continued.
 
<p>But nuclear testing was never without controversy. Greenpeace was
founded in 1971, in response to nuclear weapons testing by the
U.S. at Amchitka in the Aleutian Islands of the coast of Alaska
in 1971 and, in the following year, conducted its first protest
against French testing at Moruroa in the South Pacific. 
 
<p>Finally, in 1991, hopes for an end to nuclear testing started to
rise again. The U.S., U.K., Soviet Union and France agreed to
self-imposed moratoria in their nuclear testing programmes (only
China refused to join) and in November 1993, the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva finally received a strong mandate to
negotiate a legally-binding Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty. Work formally began on a CTBT in Geneva in early 1994.
 
<p>During 1994, talks got bogged down on details and several
fundamental issues. France and the U.K. wanted to continue
carrying out 'safety tests', China wanted to be allowed to carry
out 'Peaceful Nuclear Explosions', and the U.S., Russia, the
U.K., and France all wanted to be allowed to do small nuclear
explosions. 
 
<p>In 1995, nuclear tests by China and the announcement of a
resumption of testing by France, lead to increased pressure on
the negotiations. In August, France, the U.S., and the U.K.
committed themselves to a so-called '0-yield' CTBT which would
ban all types of nuclear tests for any purpose, irrespective of
how small the explosion. Nonetheless, by the end of 1995, there
were still many disagreements - and France and China continued
to plan further tests. France ended its test programme in January
1996 and announced the closure of its test site in the Pacific.
China announced a moratorium on its testing at the end of July
after its 45th, and perhaps the world's last ever, nuclear test
explosion.
 
<p>Today - the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki - the
outcome of the talks hangs in balance and the final result is
deeply uncertain. Perhaps in the next few days, after more than
51 years of nuclear tests and forty years of effort, the goal of
a treaty prohibiting all nuclear tests, forever, anywhere may
finally be attained. Or, as has happened before, the opportunity
could slip away once again. The draft text is far from perfect,
but it would be adequate to end all testing.
 
<p>Ironically, the original proponent of a test ban - India - is
today the strongest critic of the draft treaty because it feels
that it does not do enough to spur on nuclear disarmament. With
some 21,000 operational nuclear weapons in the world at the
beginning of this year, India is right to call for greater
efforts. But this treaty, even with its flaws, is the first and
essential step towards getting rid of those weapons. It should
and must be agreed too. Now.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>

<P><B> 16th August 1996 
</B> 
 
 <P>   <B> On Friday evening, the ad hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test
Ban adopted its report to the Conference on Disarmament. The
report will be formally presented to the Conference at a special
Plenary meeting on Tuesday morning, 20 August.
     This update also considers what might happen at the Plenary
meeting and subsequently.
</B>
 
<P> <B>The Report of the Committee
</B> 
<P> As indicated earlier, the report from the Committee was largely
technical in that it described the mandate of the Committee,
organization of work, documents received, and the substantive
work during the 1996 session. In addition, the report contained
the conclusions of the Chairman on his consultations. These have
been previously described. The report adopted on Friday evening
contained two 'new' sections: national statements of position,
and the conclusions and recommendations.
 
<P> The National Statements of Position section (Section VI)
contained a number of statements by individual countries or
groups of countries, detailing their concerns. The statements are
as follows:
 
<P><B> 1.   Egypt - </B>while noting that the text 'offers a better balance
and an improvement', Egypt expressed a number of criticisms on
Preamble (with respect to elimination of nuclear weapons), Scope,
OSI, NTMs and Executive Council. It reaffirmed the Chairman's
conclusions that 'measures' did not refer to action by the UN
Security Council. It did NOT express a view as to whether or not
it accepts the text.
 
<P> <B>2.   Mexico - </B>despite making a number of critical observations
on the text, stated its opinion that the treaty will help
establish the norm that bans nuclear testing, and to strengthen
the legal opinion regarding the obligation to eliminate nuclear
weapons. It stated that the treaty satisfies the intention which,
in 1985, led Mexico to propose an amendment to the Partial Test
Ban Treaty. Mexico concluded that the Committee should approve
sending the draft text of the CTBT to the Conference.
  <P>    Mexico emphasized entry-into-force as the draft treaty's
most serious short-coming. Other concerns were: Preamble - with
respect to elimination of nuclear weapons, and Scope.
 
<P><B> 3.   India -</B> reiterated that it cannot and does not accept the
draft CTBT as the CTBT the Committee was mandated to negotiate
and that it opposes any transmission of the text in any form to
the Conference from the ad hoc Committee.
 
 <P>     India criticised the Scope, the Preamble, but saved its
strongest criticism for the provisions related to the entry into
force of the treaty.
 
<P> <B>4.   Brazil -</B> indicated that it supported the draft treaty and
that, while it would have preferred to see further adjustments,
further modifications might imperial the attainment of a CTBT in
the required time-frame. Brazil sees the Scope article as
contributing to a treaty which constitutes a significant step
towards a nuclear weapon-free world. It supported the use of NTMs
and the implications for the Executive Council, but expressed its
concern about the financial burden of implementing the treaty.
 
<P><B> 5.   China - </B>is ready to agree to the transmission of the draft
treaty text to the Conference on Disarmament especially in light
of the strong international call for a CTBT and the time frame
for its completion.
   <P>   China expressed concern on the lack of provisions on no-
first-use and reference to prohibition of nuclear weapons,
particularly as they were not reflected in the Preamble. China
still has concerns about the use of NTMs, OSI, international
monitoring system and criteria for membership of the Executive
Council.
 
<P><B> 6.   Algeria -</B> did not oppose the transmission of the text to the
Conference on Disarmament.
     It did express concern on the balance of non-proliferation
and disarmament objectives, verification especially NTMs, entry-
into-force, and Executive Council.
 
<P><B> 7.   Cuba - </B>stated that it will not oppose the [transmission of]
the draft treaty.
     Cuba expressed concern on the Scope, NTMs, Executive
Council, financial burden of the treaty, and entry-into-force.
 
<P><B> 8.   Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,
Kazakstan, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the
Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United
States - </B>while none of them are fully satisfied with the text,
support it and consider that it should be forwarded to the
Conference for its consideration and adoption.
 
<P> <B>9.   The United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Italy, Spain,
France and Belgium - </B>did not accept that national statements had
any authoritative status at the level of interpretation or
otherwise.
 
<P><B> 10.  Colombia - </B>expressed its willingness to sign a CTBT which
contributes to the elimination of nuclear weapons, but hopes that
outstanding difficulties can be resolved as quickly as possible.
  <P>    Colombia expressed concern on the Preamble, Scope, and entry
into force.
 
 
<P> <B>11.  Iran - </B>stated that it was prevented from 'lending our
support' to the draft because of its outstanding concerns.
     The concerns were: Preamble (on nuclear disarmament), NTMs,
the composition of the Executive Council.
 
<P> <B>12.  Viet Nam - </B>did not state specifically whether or not it
accepted the current text, but did note that the present treaty
would greatly enhance international co-operation for peace and
nuclear disarmament.
 <P>     It expressed concern on the Preamble and the financial
burden of the treaty.
     
<P> <B>13.  Pakistan - </B>is prepared to accept the treaty text as the
basis for consensus on a CTBT and agree to its transmission to
the Conference.
     Pakistan expressed some concern on Scope, OSI and NTMs, and
the Executive Council. It reaffirmed the importance it attached
to the requirement of the list of 44 countries for entry-into-
force.
 
<P> <B>14.  Kenya - </B>reaffirmed its support for a CTBT.
 
<P> <B>15.  Nigeria - </B>expressed a number of criticisms on Scope and
Preamble, the financial implications, entry-into-force and the
composition of the Executive Council, however - without it being
explicit - appeared to accept the treaty as a first step.
 
<P> <B>16.  Peru -</B> is prepared to accept the draft text as the best
prospect for a CTBT.
  <P>    It emphasized however that the Preamble and the financial
burdens of the treaty as the two main deficiencies in the text.
 
<P><B> 17.  Canada -</B> despite its serious reservations is prepared to
accept the text and forward it to the Conference for
consideration and adoption. Canada also stressed the importance
of meeting the deadline of signing this year.
   <P>   The key reservations are Preamble, verification and - most
importantly - entry into force.
 
<P><B> 18.  Belgium -</B> while it considers that text to be far from
perfect, is ready to accept the text and recommend that it be
sent to New York for endorsement by the General Assembly of the
United Nations. It therefore wishes the text to be sent to the
Conference for consideration and adoption.
    <P>  Belgium expressed concern on Preamble, verification and
entry-into-force.
 
<P> <B>The Conclusions and Recommendations section reads as follows:
</B> 
   <P>   As this report indicates, despite the assessments of
     CD/NTB/WP.330/Rev.2 contained in section VI above and
     support for a proposal to transmit it to the Conference on
     Disarmament for its consideration, no consensus could be
     reached either on the text or on the action proposed. The
     Ad Hoc Committee refers this report to the Conference on
     Disarmament. 
 
 
<P> <B>Next Stop - New York ?</B>
 
<P><B> On Tuesday, at the Plenary, the report of the ad hoc Committee
will be formally introduced by the Chairman. It is as yet unclear
how the discussion in the Plenary will proceed.
 
<P>      Perhaps the most likely scenario is that, on Tuesday, the
Conference will take note of the report from the Committee,
confirm that there is no consensus, and refer its report to the
United Nations General Assembly. There would be no actual
referral of the text of the treaty to New York by the Conference.
However, there may be a delay in reaching this point, with the
decision perhaps being taken at Thursday's regular Plenary
meeting.
 <P>     In this scenario, the next question is whether or not a
country or group of countries will announce a decision to take
the treaty text to New York for consideration by the United
Nations General Assembly. There are a number of possibilities as
to how, who, when and where such an announcement will be made,
but the general approach itself now looks inevitable.
 
<P> It is also possible, given the public nature of the Plenary
meetings, that countries use the opportunity to make public
statements on their positions concerning the treaty.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>

<P><B> 12th August 1996 
</B> 
 
<P><B>Summary</B>
 
  <P>   Work is proceeding slowly on drafting the report of the ad
hoc Committee on the Nuclear Test Ban to the Conference on
Disarmament and finalising the draft text of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty text.
  <P>   On Monday Ambassador Ramaker presented the ad hoc Committee
with a summary, for inclusion in the report, of his statement of
last Friday informing the Committee on his informal consultations
and the conclusions he had drawn (see below). 
  <P>   The Chairman also presented delegates with three pages of -
- mainly minor -- modifications to the text of draft treaty. The
only notable change to the text, as expected, is the inclusion
of the specific change to the voting requirement for decisions
in the Executive Committee, from a simple majority vote to a
minimum of thirty votes as insisted by China and agreed last week
(see below).
 
  <P>   Uncertainty continues to reign over if and when a veto might
be used to block adoption of the treaty, with Iran also now
indicating to reporters that, unless its concerns were met (the
Preamble, the use of NTM's, and the inclusion of Israel in the
Middle East region for seats on the Executive Council), it could
not allow the text of the treaty to go further and that it might
veto. India continues to insist that it cannot sign the treaty
as it stands and that a veto is possible unless the text is
changed further to accommodate its concerns (entry-into-force). 
  <P>   This situation is further complicated by the repercussions
of the decision by and willingness of delegations -- especially
the Nuclear Weapon States -- to include the change to the text
of the treaty as insisted by China, while maintaining their
insistence that no further changes are possible at all to
accommodate other concerns, especially those of India.
    <P> While the stated goal -- and oft cited final deadline for
completion and forwarding the text to New York -- is by the end
of this week, there was some speculation on Monday that the final
decision on the fate of the treaty within the Conference might
not come until next week.
 
    <P> Away from the Conference itself: on Wednesday the Australian
government's Canberra Commission will issue its report on the
elimination of nuclear weapons; the United Kingdom's defence
minister - Malcom Rifkind - will visit India, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, and Japan; the US Secretary of State will visit Geneva
beginning Tuesday evening (although it is unclear if he will be
involved in the CTBT discussions); and French Foreign Minister -
Herve de Charette - has written to his counterparts in Cuba, Sri
Lanka, Egypt, Mexico, Kenya and Indonesia urging their support
for the draft treaty.
 
 
<P><B>Future Programme of Work</B>
 
<P>  On Tuesday afternoon, the ad hoc Committee will meet again,
and is expected to hear statements of national positions for
inclusion in the report of the Committee also. There is also the
possibility of a further ad hoc Committee meeting on Wednesday,
prior to the next scheduled Plenary of the Conference on Thursday
morning.
  <P>   Procedurally, there is uncertainty as to whether or not it
will be possible to adopt the report of the ad hoc Committee and
have the final decision taken by the Plenary of the Conference -
- both steps require consensus. Although it is hoped that
countries will not veto the decision at either stage, it is
considered preferable by some that -- if a veto must come -- it
should be in the public Plenary of the Conference itself, rather
than in the closed-door Committee meetings.
  <P>   It may be possible to adopt the report of the Committee by
including the Chairman's comments and critical National
statements in the report AND by formulating the report in such
a way as to NOT have the Committee give explicit support or
endorsement to the treaty itself. Another possibility may exist
for getting a report containing the text to the Plenary of the
Conference itself in the event that it cannot be adopted by
consensus in the Committee, whereby the Chairman reports himself

directly to the President of the Conference. 
    <P> Finally, in the event of a veto being used in either the
Committee or the Conference, it still appears to be likely that
a country or group of countries will take the text directly to
the United Nations General Assembly. However the limitations and
potential problems with this approach are being increasingly
realized.
 
<P><B>Report of the ad hoc Committee</B>
 
   <P>  The Chairman's statement of Friday is largely reproduced for
inclusion in the draft report of the ad hoc Committee. The main
elements of the statement are:
<ul>
 <li>there was a general realisation of the time constraints for
     concluding work on the CTBT if it is to be signed by the
     outset of the fifty-first session of the United Nations
     General Assembly;
<li>a confirmation that continued negotiations would not be
     likely to lead to further improvements and, if they
     continued, the treaty almost certainly would not be ready
     on time for signature;
<li>support for or acceptance of the draft treaty had being
     expressed - while there were concerns on different aspects
     of the text the margins for changing it were widely
     recognized to be extremely small;
<li>the main areas of concern identified were: the issue of
     nuclear disarmament and the Preamble; the composition of
     the Executive Council; entry-into-force; and some aspects
     of verification;
<li>the Chairman concluded it was possible to amend the text on
     the issue of the voting requirement for decisions by the
     Executive Council from a simple majority to at least 30
     votes (as insisted by China);
 
<li>the Chairman concluded it was NOT possible to change the
     text to take into account the concerns over nuclear
     disarmament and the Preamble; and the composition of the
     Executive Council;
<li>on the issue of entry-into-force, while not explicitly
     rejecting the possibility of changing the text, the
     Chairman stated that his "consultations had not produced
     any indication on how to move the Treaty further towards
     convergence on this issue".
          The Chairman also stressed that, on the basis of his
     consultations, he was "of the firm conviction" that the EIF
     provisions did not impinge on sovereignty or impose any
     legally-binding obligations on a State not Party to the
     Treaty even if that State's ratification was a pre-
     requisite for entry-into-force of the treaty. He also
     expressed his "understanding" that (in referring to
     'measures' that might be taken in the situation that the
     treaty did not come into force three years after being
     opened for signature) the EIF article was not referring to
     certain UN Security Council measures (i.e. sanctions);
<li>on the issues related to verification, the Chairman
     "recalled" that there were a number of safeguards,
     including procedures to be followed by the Executive
     Council, to prevent abuse and that submission of any
     abusive or frivolous on-site inspection would account to a
     violation of a State Party's rights under the Treaty;
<li>finally, the Chairman expressed his view that "under the
     present circumstances" the current text was the "best
     attainable outcome".
 </ul>
<P>Modifications to the Treaty Text
 
  <P>   The three pages of modifications (n.b. this is the word used
in the title of the Chairman's paper) to the text of the draft

CTBT are primarily 'technical' in nature -- that is they largely
involve harmonisation of language and usage, grammatical and
spelling corrections, and corrections to the co-ordinates of
stations in the international monitoring system (IMS).
   <P>  The one exception is the modification to replace "a majority
of all" by "at least thirty affirmative votes of" in the section
concerning decisions of the Executive Council, in order to
implement the agreement reached last week with China in order to
accommodate its concerns about decisions on On-Site Inspection
(OSI).
  <P>   No modifications were proposed by the Chairman to the text
on the question of the use and control of National Technical
Means of verification (NTMs) indicating that, as widely expected,
any agreement reached with or assurances received by China on
this issue remain in a 'side-bar' agreement.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>

<P><B> 9th August 1996 
</B> 


<P>Today's meeting of the ad hoc Committee ended without a clear
decision on the future conduct of work. Meetings of the ad hoc
Committee are scheduled for both Monday and Tuesday. It looks
increasingly that India will veto the adoption of the report
containing the draft CTBT text, but this still remains unclear.
 
<P>There were two central documents on today's agenda: the draft
'technical' report of the Committee, and the Chairman's own
statement. The former was not problematic as it was purely
factual, the latter was highly problematic as it dealt with the
core issues confronting the Committee.
 
<P>The Chairman's statement was proposed for inclusion in the report
of the Committee. This suggestion did not meet with approval. The
statement addressed a number of the outstanding concerns of
certain countries, but presented these as conclusions of the
Chair, rather than as conclusions of the Committee. For example,
the Chairman's statement indicated that 'I understand' that
Security Council sanctions are not envisaged by article XIV(2)
but did not say outright that such sanctions are excluded. 
 
<P>The Chairman also excluded changes to the most controversial
parts of the treaty, despite the widely acknowledged concerns,
on the basis that the draft text could not be changed without
risking the treaty. But, in contradiction, he went on to stress
that the on-site inspection vote requirement be modified in
article IV, paragraph 46 to require "at least 30 affirmative
votes".

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>

<P><B> 8th August 1996 
</B> 
          
 
 
 
 <P>    India made an important speech at today's Plenary meeting
of the Conference on Disarmament, reiterating their primary
concerns about the existing draft CTBT text. It was emphasized
that India would not sign the existing text and might even block
its adoption in the Conference.
 
   <P>   Perhaps the only achievable solution to India's concerns is
to present assurances that sanctions will not be used against
India in the event that it does not sign the treaty. Failing
this, it is indeed possible that India might veto adoption of the
treaty by the Conference on Disarmament.
 
   <P>   The Plenary meeting was also addressed by the Ukraine,
Ireland (who introduced a Declaration on behalf of the EU and a
number of related countries on the CTBT), Morocco, Egypt (who
introduced a programme of action for the elimination of nuclear
weapons on behalf of 28 out of the 29 members of the G-21),
Mexico, and South Africa.
 
 
<P> <B>India
</B><P>      Ambassador Ghose began by reiterating the concern of India
that the scope of the CTBT should end the future development of
nuclear weapons and be placed within a nuclear disarmament
process including a time-bound frame-work for the elimination of
nuclear weapons.
  <P>    India stressed that, in its view, the draft Chairman's text
of 28 June did not differ significantly from the earlier
Chairman's working paper. Thus, as it had said it could not sign
the earlier working paper, therefore it could also not sign the
Chairman's draft of the end of June. 
  <P>    In addition, and most importantly, India drew attention to
the Entry-into-Force (EIF) provisions of the Chairman's draft.
It drew attention, in particular, to the measures incorporated
in the treaty which it sees as seeking "to enforce our signature
by means unprecedented in treaty negotiating practice". This is
a clear reference to India's stated concern that it might be
subject to unilateral or multilateral sanctions in the event that
it does not sign the treaty.
   <P>   India went on to say that the EIF provisions should be
changed. It also views the resistance to a change in the EIF
provisions comes from only a small number of delegations whom,
it considers, clearly do not wish the treaty to come into force.
 
 
 
   <P>   India still feels that the EIF article can and ought to be
modified. Indeed the Ambassador stressed that:
 <blockquote>
     If, however, the present text is sought to be retained, I
     am instructed to inform the Conference that India would be
     reluctantly obliged to oppose such efforts.
 </blockquote>  
<P>    India did stress that it did not want to prevent other
countries from exercising their sovereign right to adopt a Treaty
to which they wish to accede, but that it could accept that its

own rights could be constrained.
 
 
<P> <B>The Ukraine</B>
  <P>   The Ukraine endorses the Chairman's draft text despite its
manifest deficiencies, and believes that it should be adopted
without further delay.
 

<P><B> Ireland</B>
 <P>     Ireland informed the Conference of a Declaration by the
Presidency on behalf of the European Union issued yesterday in
Dublin and Brussels. The EFTA countries members of the EEA, the
Central and Eastern European countries associated with the
European Union, and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta
aligned themselves with the Declaration.
     Despite its deficiencies, the spirit of compromise must
prevail. The Declaration calls on the text of the CTBT to be
forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly without delay
and in time so that it may be opened for signature at the outset
of the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA-
51). 
 
 
<P> <B>Morocco</B>
   <P>   Morocco also expressed the view that the Chairman's text of
the end of June was not ideal, but that it had no opposition in

principle to the text. It stressed that it is essential that the
text is ready for signature at the outset of UNGA-51.
    <P>  Morocco emphasized however that delegations' concerns needed
to be taken into account, and that it hoped that sufficient
flexibility to this end would be shown.
 
 
<P> <B>Egypt</B>
<P> Egypt presented on behalf of members of the 29 members of
the G-21, a document containing a "Programme of Action for the
Elimination of Nuclear Weapons" (one member of the G-21, South
Africa, did not support the statement).
  <P>    The core of the proposed Programme is a recognition for a
requirement for active multilateral measures to identify,
negotiate and implement specific, step-by-step measures for the
complete elimination of nuclear weapons. It is a three phase
programme, the last phase of which continues until the year 2020
[N.B. a full copy of the Programme is available upon request].
 
 
 
 
 
<P> <B>Mexico
</B><P>      Mexico, as one of those that supported the 'Programme of
Action' underlined some of the motivations for the Programme. 
 
 
<P> <B>South Africa</B>
  <P>    South Africa informed the Conference on a Joint New
Zealand/South African Communique signed this morning by Prime
Minister Bolger and President Mandela, in which a passage refers
to Disarmament and Arms Control. Both countries noted that they
will sign the CTBT at the earliest opportunity, and the need for
further arms control and disarmament measures.
   <P>   South Africa also noted that it did not accept the G-21
Programme because of what it saw as linkages between the various
steps. Mexico replied that it saw no such linkages.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>

<P><B> 7th August 1996 
</B> 
            <H3>UNITED STATES -- CHINA AGREEMENT REACHED
</H3> 
 
<P>It has been confirmed that an agreement has been reached between
China and the United States. The announcement is expected to be
confirmed at Friday's meeting of the ad hoc Committee, and
presumably will be followed by an announcement from China that
it accepts the treaty text.
 
<P>Reportedly, the agreement is a 'package' dealing with BOTH
Chinese concerns - the use of National Technical Means (NTMs) and
the voting for On-Site Inspection (OSI). Details remain rather
vague, but the 'package' is believed to be along the following
lines:
 
<UL>
<LI>On the issue of NTM's, it is believed that the US has or
     will offer assurances that it will not include espionage
     ('spying') as a basis for making a request for an on-site
     inspection. This will not require any changes to the text. 
 
<LI>On the issue of voting for on-site inspections, agreement
     has been reached that a minimum of thirty votes of the 51-
     member Executive Council will be needed to launch an
     inspection. It is as yet unclear whether or not this will
     require an alteration to the text, but a minor alteration
     looks likely to be needed.
</UL>


<P>While hints and rumours of an agreement were spreading yesterday,
it was only this morning reported 'in confidence' to a meeting
of the Western Group of countries. The Washington Post also
reported the broad outlines of the agreement in this morning's
edition. It is understood that formal endorsement for the
'package' is being sought from all five declared nuclear weapons
states, and is expected imminently.
 
<P>With China on board, attention would then shift to India in
particular, but also to the outstanding concerns of Pakistan and
Iran. In addition, process issues remain for adopting the text
and transmitting it to New York, particularly in the event of one
or more countries vetoing adoption of the text.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>
<P> <B>6th August 1996
</B>    
 
 
<P>For several days now there have been no breakthroughs in reaching
formal agreement in Geneva on the CTBT. Discussions are
continuing largely bilaterally and informally between a small
number of delegations.
 
<P>The issue that is holding up progress is essentially a bilateral
discussion between China and the United States. The hold-up is
commonly described as being 'Washington deciding on what to offer
Beijing', in order to gain Chinese support for the treaty. 
 
<P>China has focused its concern on two issues - the use of
information gathered by a country on its own initiative (NTMs)
and the extent it can use this to start an on-site inspection
(OSI) and the voting mechanism to decide on an on-site
inspection. 
 
<P>Washington (and most delegations) do not want to amend the text
presented at the end of June, which would prevent a resolution
of the Chinese concern over OSI voting. Instead it is expected
that the US will offer some assurances that it will not include
espionage ('spying') as a basis for making a request for an on-
site inspection. With this assurance, it is then hoped that China
will then announce that, with the assurances it has received, it
could accept the draft treaty presented at the end of June. The
timing and status of the expected US offer is unclear, but a US
inter-agency meeting in Washington was expected either on the 6
or 7 August. 
 
<P>The next Plenary meeting of the Conference is on Thursday, and
the next meeting of the ad hoc Committee is scheduled for Friday.
It is hoped that at one of these two occasions that China will
announce it can accept the treaty.
 
<P>With China on board, attention would then shift to India. India
is continuing to emphasize the issue of entry-into-force as its
primary concern, especially the possibility of sanctions if it
does not sign and then ratify the treaty.
 
<P>Delegations are increasingly pointing to August 15, instead of
August 9, as the end date for negotiations.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations<BR>from the Conference on Disarmament
<BR> 1st August 1996</H3>
    

<P>Little is being reported of the outcomes of the ongoing informal
negotiations being conducted by Amb. Jaap Ramaker -- the Chair
of the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear Test Ban -- indicating
that substantive breakthroughs have yet to be attained.
 
<P>However, Thursday's Plenary session of the Conference on
Disarmament gave some further insight into some delegation's
national positions. The United States, China, Pakistan, New
Zealand, Australia, Belgium, Japan, Switzerland, Colombia, Iran,
Sri Lanka and Brazil made formal statements (summaries below).
On specific matters of detail, the key-note speeches on Thursday
were those of the United States, China and Pakistan. 
 
<P>During the course of this week, it was notable that an increasing
majority of delegations are indicating support to the text of the
draft treaty proposed by Ambassador Ramaker at the end of June.
On Monday, 20 states reportedly indicated support of the text
during a meeting of the Committee negotiating the test-ban.
Spain, Slovakia, and New Zealand did so on Wednesday. A number
of the states who spoke on Thursday, either indicated or
reiterated in the public session that they accept the Chairman's
text as drafted. Few, if any, of these countries think that the
Chairman's text is ideal -- they support it because they are
concerned that if negotiations reopen, then the entire treaty
could be greatly weakened, if not lost entirely.
 
<P>The strongest and most common concern amongst the supporters of
the existing draft text, is the inflexibility of the provisions
concerning the Entry-into-Force (article XIV) of the treaty.
Supporters of a CTBT are stressing that there is an especial
responsibility to ensure that the rigid requirements of this
article are met falls squarely on the shoulders of those that
have insisted on the formula: the United Kingdom, Russia and
China, strongly supported by Pakistan.
 
<P>Despite the specific concerns on the text which were expressed
in Thursday's Plenary, it seems that the emerging view of the
majority of delegations is that there should not be renegotiation
of the text proposed by Ambassador Ramaker at the end of June.
At best, minor adjustments are possible, but broad renegotiation
could scuttle the treaty. Some concerns expressed by China and
Pakistan, for example, could be accommodated outside of the text
of the treaty itself. 
 
<P>India is being profiled by some as the big problem. But if
conclusion of the treaty is not possible, it will be at least as
much a result of the inflexibility on the part of the Nuclear
Weapon States (NWS) - the United States on On-Site Inspection;
China as the only NWS not to accept the draft treaty text as yet;
the United Kingdom, Russia and China on Entry-into-Force; and all
NWS positions on nuclear disarmament.
 
<P><B>Summaries of Plenary Statements</B>

 
<P><B>JOHN HOLUM (United States)</B> stated that, on 26 July, the United
States President called on all Conference participants to forward
the Chairman's text without change to the Assembly for approval
and opening for signature. The US view is that the result of a
further negotiation on the text is to weaken or lose the treaty.
    <P> Holum did acknowledge that throughout the 1980s his
Government had not been ready to move swiftly on a comprehensive
nuclear test-ban treaty, but that the US was finally ready for
a CTBT.
    <P> The US statement rejected the claim that the draft did not
contribute to nuclear disarmament because it did not contain a
commitment to a specific time when nuclear disarmament would be
completed. But the US could only say that the draft treaty was
CONSISTENT with the nuclear disarmament process, rather than
further it.
<P>     Similar to the stance taken by China later, the US
emphasized the 'concessions' it had already made, and that it
could scarcely be expected to do more. Holum's speech even
dredged up the US dropping of the almost universally criticised
10-year opt-out proposal as a noble act ! It is abundantly clear
that the US obsession with details of the verification package
related to on-site inspection (OSI) is the real basis for their
not wanting negotiations to resume. This concern must have been
reinforced by the Chinese comments on this subject, in
particular.
  <P>   In summary, the US considers that is has made a difficult
decision -- to accept the treaty as drafted.
 
<P><B>SHA ZUKANG (China)</B> maintained that China had shown flexibility
and a willingness to compromise on almost all important issues
in the treaty. 
     <P>However, while a quick conclusion would be desirable, China
considered that the basic objective of negotiations should be to
conclude a treaty that could stand the test of time. 
<P>     China's had two serious concerns with the Chairman's text.
First, the possibility of the use of human intelligence or
espionage information to trigger on-site inspections through the
allowance of the use of "national technical means" (NTMs).
Second, China considered that the requirement for a 'simple
majority' vote for on-site inspection (OSI) is susceptible to
abuse, and that the a minimum requirement should be for an

on-site inspection request be approved by a fixed 30 affirmative
votes out of its 51 members when NTMs were involved.
<P>     It remains to be seen what agreement could be reached on
decision-making for OSI, but the question of NTMs could be
resolved outside of the treaty text.
 
<P><B>MUNIR AKRAM (Pakistan)</B> essentially reiterated the concerns of
China on verification involving on-site inspection -- the use of
NTMs and the voting requirement. Pakistan endorsed the specific
demands of China on both issues.
     <P>In addition, Pakistan reiterated its demand that the entry-
into-force provisions remain unchanged.
 
<P><B>LUCY DUNCAN (New Zealand)</B> informed the Conference of its firm
protest against China's conduct of a nuclear test on 29 July, she
continued. It had condemned the test and had conveyed to China
its expectation that it would go further than its new moratorium
on nuclear testing and join other countries in bringing to a
prompt conclusion the negotiations on a test-ban treaty.
 
<P><B>RICHARD STARR (Australia) </B>stressed that, in some respects, the
text did not match Australia's preferred positions, notably in
its entry-into-force formula. Australia, however, is confident
that the treaty would have significant value even prior to its
entry into force. 
   <P>  Australia supports the text test-ban treaty text as it is.
     Australia regretted China's 29 July nuclear test, and
expressed the hope that test would be the last conducted by any
State, ever. Australia supported New Zealand's position that
China should support the successful conclusion of the test-ban
treaty negotiations. 
 
<P><B>ALAIN GUILLAUME (Belgium) </B> stated that Belgium could support the
text of the draft treaty, even if it was not ideal.
   <P>  Belgium stressed its concern on the Preamble on the question
of nuclear disarmament and the provisions on entry into force.
Belgium, however, was in favour of a test-ban treaty without
delay, and today it accepted the
compromise text.
  
  <P> Belgium regretted the recent Chinese nuclear test, and hoped
that it would be the last ever conducted by any State. 
 
<P><B>HISAMI KUROKOCHI (Japan)</B> repeated her Government's response to
the Chinese test. 
     <P>Japan has decided to accept the Chairman's proposed test-ban
treaty text although it was not entirely satisfactory and
appealed to other countries to accept the text as well, so that
it could be opened for signature in September.
 
<P><B>BERNARD JEANTY (Switzerland)</B> also reiterated that his Government
regretted the nuclear test conducted by China but welcomed the
Chinese moratorium. 
   <P>  Switzerland supports the draft treaty text.
 
<P><B>MARIA FRANCISCA ARIAS (Colombia)</B> expressed concern on the
Preamble especially, but stressed that it was ready to sign a
treaty that would contribute to the elimination of nuclear
weapons.
 
<P><B>SIROUS NASSERI (Iran)</B> referred to the Chemical Weapons Convention
process to underline his country's concerns that striving to
accommodate the interests of the NWS in a treaty negotiation may
not mean that those countries join a treaty regime largely
tailored for them.
   <P>  Iran emphasized its concerns about inadequate guarantees on
nuclear disarmament.

<P><B>BERNARD A.B. GOONETILLEKE (Sri Lanka)</B>, in a speech that
apparently reflected a number of Indian concerns, emphasized
deficiencies in the treaty, especially that the Preamble needed
strengthening on nuclear disarmament and that the entry-into-
force provisions were problematic.
 
 
<P><B>GILBERTO VERGNE SABOIA (Brazil)</B> stated that, despite the fact the
draft treaty had many deficiencies, it would accept the
Chairman's draft text as it is.
 <P>  Brazil's concerns included the lack of any real commitment
for nuclear disarmament; the absence of clear criteria regarding
NTMs; and the financial burden when it remains unclear if the
treaty would enter-into-force.

   <H3>Greenpeace Update on CTBT Negotiations
<BR> 29th July 1996</H3>                              

<p>On Monday the third and final part of the 1996 session of the
Conference on Disarmament resumed. While the session is scheduled
to run until 13 September, agreement on a CTBT must  be obtained
in the first one or two weeks and the treaty adopted, if it is
to be ready for signature at the outset of the 51st session of
the United Nations General Assembly.
 
<p>It still remains unclear when the CTBT might be able to be
adopted by the ad hoc Committee and then by the Conference. Some
delegations seem to believe that this could be completed in the
opening week, others say at least two weeks will be needed. The
likely time-frame should be further clarified after the next
meeting of the Committee, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The
time-frame will be determined primarily on whether delegations
wish to formally re-open negotiations on the text or not.
 
<p>There was only one formal (closed door) session today, a meeting
of the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear Test Ban -- the body
negotiating the CTBT -- on Monday afternoon. A total of 26
countries spoke on the subject of the CTBT negotiations -- twenty
supporting adoption of the Chairman's text as currently drafted
despite their reservations about details of the text (mainly on
the Entry-into-Force criteria), and six expressing the need for
further changes to the text to be made before it could be
adopted. The six opponents to adopting the text as drafted are:
India, China, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and Cuba.
 
<p><B>The morning was taken up by meetings of the various political and
regional groups participating in the Conference.</B>
 
<H3>Country Positions</H3>

 
<B>China </B>emphasized its concerns with the verification package in
the current Chairman's draft text, particularly on the issue of
on-site inspections. 

<p><B>There are two issues on which China has particular concerns:</B>
 <OL>
 <LI>whether or not information gathered by so-called National
     Technical Means (NTMs) may be used on its own to trigger an
     On-Site Inspection (OSI) -- i.e. without support from
     information obtained from the International Monitoring
     System (IMS); 
 <BR> <BR>
 <LI>that the requirement for only a simple majority vote of
     members of the Executive Council to initiate an OSI is
     inadequate, and that a two-thirds majority of all Executive
     Council members is needed to prevent abuse.
     China did NOT however explicitly demand resumption of
negotiations, but did express its firm opposition to a 'take it
or leave it' text. This suggests that China's concerns might be
addressed in informal consultations.
 
</OL>
<P><B>India </B>expressed its major concerns with the draft treaty. However
rather than stress the disarmament concerns it has, India
reportedly centred its opposition to the current text on the
Entry-into-Force (EIF) provisions. These currently require that
India be one of 44 countries that must sign and ratify the CTBT
before it can enter into force. 
 <P>   There are indications that the Indian position is becoming
more hard-line. The official position remains that India will NOT
sign the treaty in its current form (but not actually block its
adoption). However, reportedly, India implied that unless the EIF
provisions were altered, India might employ its veto and block
adoption of the treaty. It should be stressed that India did NOT
state that it would veto, but only that it might do so. 
 
<P><B>Pakistan </B>raised similar concerns as to those put forward by
China, with emphasis especially on NTMs.
 
<P><B>Iran</B> raised three specific concerns about the current Chairman's
draft, again without explicitly calling for a formal resumption
of negotiations. Iran wished to see stronger disarmament language
in the Preamble and expressed concerns on the use of NTMs.
However, its major political concern is the inclusion of Israel
in the list of Middle East countries for the composition of the
Executive Council.
 
<P><B>Egypt </B>and <B>Cuba</B> also expressed a range of concerns, but Cuba at
least urged a rapid conclusion of the CTBT. 
 
<P><B>Russia </B>reiterated the content of the US-Russia Jakarta statement,
whereby both countries indicated that they are prepared to accept
the treaty as it is, despite that it fails to fully meet either
country's concerns fully. Russia noted, at the end of its speech,
that 'if the draft is "opened up" by someone we of course would
reserve the right to make efforts to improve its elements which,
in our opinion, do not reach the optimum'.
 
<P><B>The United States</B> emphasized that it could not accept a reopening
of negotiations and pressed for the adoption of the current text
without changes.
 
<P>As noted above, of the twenty speakers who supported adoption of
the current text, most identified the Entry-into-Force provisions
as the major shortcoming of the text.
 

<H3>Remainder of the Week</H3>

 
<P>All of Tuesday and Wednesday morning will be taken up by informal
consultations by the Chair of the test-ban negotiations.
 
<P>The next formal meeting of the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear
Test Ban is planned for Wednesday afternoon (a meeting of the
Bureau, followed by a meeting of the full Committee). 
 
<P>Also on Wednesday, John Holum, Director of the United States'
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) will hold a Press
Conference in Geneva.
 
<P>A Plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament is tentatively
scheduled for Thursday morning, but may be rescheduled.
 
<P><B>N.B.:     The next Greenpeace CTBT Update will be written
          following the discussions on Wednesday afternoon.

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
           Entry-into-Force,<BR> 2nd July 1996</H3>                              
 
            
 <P>Entry-into-Force of the treaty has emerged as possibly the most
contentious issue in the last few weeks of the Conference.  
One group of countries, such as the United Kingdom, Russia, China
and Pakistan, have insisted that all 5 Nuclear Weapon States as
well as Israel, Pakistan and India must ratify before the treaty
could take effect (the United Kingdom and Russia have been
especially insistent on this and have reportedly actively lobbied
other States in the closing days of the Conference). On the other
hand, India has firmly indicated that it could not accept such
a requirement as a condition of entry-into-force, and went so far
as to remove its International Monitoring System (IMS) stations
from the appropriate lists when possession of certain IMS
stations was linked to EIF.
 

<P>The middle ground -- shared by many delegations -- has been that
while it is best that all 5 Nuclear Weapon States as well as
Israel, Pakistan and India ratify the treaty, the treaty's
eventual entry into force should not be held hostage to a
decision by one or more of these countries to join. These
countries - with intermittent support from the United States -
have called for some measure that would allow the treaty to enter
into force even if the formal requirements are not met. This
would involve, for example, a 'waiver' or an option for
'provisional entry into force' to be included in the EIF article. 

<P><B>1. Revised EIF Formula</B>
<P>
The new EIF formula included in the Chairman's revised draft of
28 June is based on a combination of membership of the Conference
on Disarmament and on nuclear technology-related capability.
Before the treaty can take effect, the treaty must be ratified
by all the States listed in Annex 2 of the treaty (see below).
No exceptions are provided for.
 
<P>A proposal for a 'positive conference' to be held in order to
consider and decide on measures to accelerate the ratification
process in order to facility early entry-into-force has been
incorporated. The first such Conference can take place three
years after the treaty is opened for signature and then can be
repeated annually until such time as the treaty enters into
force. However, this provision does not provide for any decision
to be taken to amend the requirements for EIF, or any provisional
EIF of the treaty.
 
<P>The complete list of countries required for ratification is:  
     Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh,
     Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, 
    Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Egypt, Finland,     
France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic     
Republic of), Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands,     
Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Romania, Republic of Korea,    
 Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,    
 Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great     
Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America,      Viet
Nam, Zaire.
 
<P><B>2. Negotiating History and Options</B>
<P>
As the concerns over EIF came to a head earlier in the
negotiations, in addition to the "positive conference" concept,
two other suggestions were been made to get around the problem
of the treaty being held hostage (see also CTBT Update No. 12,
9 June): 
<B> <UL>
<LI> 1.  a "waiver" provision, whereby even if one or more of the  
   required States did not ratify within a given time-frame,   
  those States which have ratified could bring the treaty     
into force anyway;
 
 <LI>2.  a "provisional" entry into force for those Parties who have 
    ratified, pending ratification by all those on the list.  
However, the United Kingdom, Russia and China, objected
strenuously to both these options and the only agreement that
could be reached by all was on the idea of a  "positive
conference" of the Parties. 
</UL> </B>

<P>In agreeing that such a Conference could be held, it was
explicitly recognized that this could only discuss and decide on
measures to help accelerate the ratification process to enable
the treaty to enter into force. The positive Conference would not
have the possibility of waiving the EIF provisions to allow the
treaty to enter-into-force or allowing provisional EIF. It should
be noted that the Amendment procedure of the treaty can only be
used AFTER the treaty has entered into force, so this offers no
solution.
 
<P><B>3. The Positive Conference</B>

<P>Although the "positive" Conference cannot take decisions to get
around the blockage caused by a failure to ratify by one or more
countries included in the EIF list (and thus is insufficient to
address the fundamental concern), it still is a useful
contribution to the treaty.
 
<P>By providing an explicit platform for multilateral discussion of
and decisions on initiatives to speed-up the ratification
process, the need for ratification by key countries can be
addressed in a structured fashion. This can be contrasted with
the CWC, for example, which has no formal mechanism to deal with
the reality that it is still struggling to get the requisite
number of ratifications five years after being opened for
signature. The CTBT ratification discussions themselves, as well
as any decisions agreed to (the requirement is for consensus),
will have a significant political impact.
 
<P>The fundamental obstacle remains, however, if the EIF formula
remains as it is, the "positive" Conference offers no solution
to allow the treaty to enter into force until such time as all
the listed countries ratify.
 
<P><B>4. Comment</B>

 
<P>The position of the United Kingdom and Russia (especially) are
difficult to fathom. Together with the United States, these
countries are the depositaries of the NPT, which entered into
force with only three of the five Nuclear Weapon States (France
and China did not join the NPT until much later). Despite the
treaty's manifold weaknesses and that of the regime it helped
foster (especially on specific progress towards nuclear
disarmament), the NPT's swelling membership did help build an
international norm against nuclear non-proliferation in a way
that could never have been achieved had the treaty not entered
into force for many years.
 
<P>The EIF formula included in the final draft CTBT, creates the
possibility that the treaty may not enter into force for many
years, if ever. If the concern is really related to India's
nuclear capability and the possibility for it to test, surely
this is best addressed through bringing a CTBT into force as soon
as possible with a broad a membership as possible ? The positions
of the United Kingdom and Russia on this point must surely beg
the question of whether or not they really do want a CTBT, or
whether they just wish to blame a 'failure' to secure one on
someone else...

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
            Special Update,<BR> 30th June 1996</H3>

 

<P>This update summarizes developments on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at the Conference on Disarmament at the end of the second part of its 1996 session. It includes key passages from the revised Chairman's text of a CTBT
(CD/NTB/WP.330/Rev.1) and considers the procedure to be followed now and at the opening of the third part of the 1996 session on 29 July.
 
<P>In particular, the following components of the revised Chairman's text are considered below:-
<UL> 
 <LI>Scope;
<LI>Preamble and Review;
<LI> Verification (including On-Site Inspection);
<LI> Entry-into-Force.
 </UL>
 
<P><B>1. Scope</B>

 
<P>The provisions on the scope of the CTBT are presented in Article I entitled 'Basic Obligations'. This article remains unchanged from the Chairman's draft text (CD/NTB/WP.330), and encapsulates the "zero-yield" CTBT option -- banning all nuclear explosions whether for military or peaceful purposes and irrespective of the size of the detonation -- through the original Australian proposal. This is the 'heart' of a CTBT, and with this article the treaty would bring an end to all nuclear testing.
 
<P>In full, the Article reads as follows:
 

<P>                        <B>ARTICLE I:
                    BASIC OBLIGATIONS</B>
 

<P>     1.   Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any      nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear
     explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control.  
<P>     2.   Each State Party undertakes, furthermore, to refrain      from causing, encouraging, or in any way participating in      the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion or      any other nuclear explosion.
 
<P>Despite concerns expressed at the limited scope of the
prohibition (i.e. because it does not address activities like laboratory testing), no-one has recommended specific changes to this article, but have tended to concentrate on the Preamble.  


<P><B>2. Preamble and Review</B>

 
<P>The Preamble and provisions for the Review of the CTBT were changed from those presented in the original Chairman's draft text of 28 May. 
 
<P>In the Preamble, the changes essentially reflect those included in the Amendments to the Chairman's draft text (CD/NTB/WP.335). The Preamble includes: a 'declaration' of the intention to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament; an expression of the need for 'continued systematic and progressive efforts' to reduce nuclear weapons, including the goal of their elimination; a recognition that a ban on nuclear weapon test explosion and other nuclear explosions (i.e. including PNEs) will constrain 'the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons' and end 'the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons'; an acknowledgement that the CTBT will be a meaningful step towards nuclear disarmament; a reference to the Partial Test-Ban Treaty (PTBT); and to the need for universality of adherence to a CTBT. In addition, it includes a -- weak --reference to the environmental protection obtained from
prohibiting nuclear testing (stronger references to the
environment were blocked by Germany and France).
 
<P>In the Review article (Article VIII), changes are included from the Chairman's Amendments which emphasize the Preamble in the context of the Review of the CTBT. The Review is thus required to consider if 'the objectives and purposes in the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty are being realized'. This goes some way in incorporating the concerns of - for example - India and Pakistan.
 
<P>In addition, upon China's insistence and other's acquiesence, a reference is included relating to Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs). The reference to PNEs included in the Chairman's
Amendments has been altered to reflect the changes proposed by Canada and supported by many States. These explicitly require that for PNEs to be considered, a State Party has to propose their review (i.e. a review of PNEs is no longer automatic) and that the Conference has to agree to the proposal for a review by consensus. Any subsequent proposed amendment to the treaty would require application of the formal amendment procedure.
 
<P>On PNEs, the relevant section of the Review article would now read:
 
 <P> <blockquote>  <B> On the basis of a request from any State Party, the Review      Conference shall decide by consensus whether to consider      the possibility of permitting the conduct of underground      nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. If the Review      Conference so decides, it shall direct the Conference to      commence work without delay, with a view to recommending to      States Parties an appropriate amendment to this Treaty that      shall preclude any military benefits of such nuclear      explosions. Any such proposed amendment shall be
     communicated to the Director-General by any State Party and      dealt with in accordance of the provisions of Article VII      of this Treaty.
 
<P>Lastly, it should be noted that while there will be an annual Conference of the Parties, the Review Conferences shall take place only every ten years, provided that a preceding Conference of the Parties so decides. </B></blockquote>
 
 
<P><B>3. Verification</B>
<P>
 
The verification 'package' consists of the International
Monitoring System (IMS), the International Data Centre (IDC) and national initiatives, together with the related administrative and decision-making provisions, assigned tasks and procedures of the Treaty.
 
<P>The IMS consists of the four monitoring networks (seismic, hydroacoustic, radionuclide and infrasound). Some technical changes have been made (including the addition of Italy and New Zealand to the list of radionuclide laboratories). The main development though relates to the previous link between IMS stations and the entry-into-force provisions (no longer a component of the revised draft CTBT), and the consequent
withdrawal by India of all its IMS stations. These are now reflected by "to be determined" in the lists annexed to the IMS protocol to the treaty.
 
<P>The IDC will produce standard reports based on IMS data. These will include: unscreened data lists and bulletins; standard screened event bulletins; summaries; and special in-depth studies for individual States Parties.
 
<P>With respect to On-Site Inspections (OSI), the Chairman's text addresses the use of national technical means of verification (NTMs) and the decision-making procedure to be followed. An OSI request may be based on: IMS data; 'any relevant technical information obtained by national technical means of verification in a manner consistent with generally recognized principles of international law'; or any combination of the two. Decisions on initiating and continuing an OSI are required to be taken by a simple majority vote of all members of the 51 state Executive Council.
 
 
<P><B>4. Entry-into-Force</B>
<P>
 
The Entry-into-Force provisions are completely different to those of the earlier version of the Chairman's draft Treaty. Instead of being based upon IMS-related criteria, the new EIF formula is based on a combination of membership of the Conference on Disarmament and on nuclear technology-related capability.   
 
<P>Very unfortunately any State whose ratification is required for the Treaty to take effect has a complete veto on if and when the Treaty might enter-into-force. No exceptions are provided for.  
The 'new' EIF criterion is that the Treaty shall enter-into-force 180 days after the deposit of all countries listed in Annex 3 of the treaty with no exceptions. This list includes the five Nuclear Weapon States (NWS) and Israel, Pakistan and India. The complete list is:
 
<P><B>     Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh,
     Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia,      Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Egypt, Finland,      France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic      Republic of), Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands,      Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Romania, Republic of Korea,      Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,      Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great      Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America,      Viet Nam, Zaire.</B>
 
 
<P><B>5. Process</B>
<P>
 
The third part of the 1996 session of the Conference on
Disarmament begins on July 29, and the decision on what to do with the Chairman's text will be taken there. Between now and the end of July therefore, it is essential that any remaining differences of opinion on the draft CTBT provisions be resolved between members of the Conference on Disarmament.
 
<P>The process to be followed is, first, the adoption of a treaty text by the ad hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban, second, the adoption of the text by the entire Conference on Disarmament, and the subsequent forwarding of the text to the United Nations Secretary-General in New York. Then the draft treaty will be put to the United Nations General Assembly for endorsement, before being opened up for signature at the outset of the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly.
 
<P>Even when the draft Chairman's text was laid down on Friday there was dissent and discussion as to whether or not the negotiations were over. The reality is that unless the Conference on
Disarmament reconvenes on July 29 with ALL issues resolved, the fate of the treaty is in doubt.

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
            Special Update,<BR> 26th June 1996</H3>


<P>The main issues on today's agenda were the two principal barriers
to completion of the CTBT on schedule: On-Site Inspection and
Entry-into-Force. There were no breakthroughs on either issue,
and these remain these remain the main obstacles to completion

of a CTBT.
 
<P>While there has been an expectation that the full revised
Chairman's Text will be presented on Thursday, it may need to be
delayed until Friday morning because of the lack of progress on
the key issues. 
 
<P>Thursday's Plenary will be addressed by FRANCE, VIETNAM and
NIGERIA - with both France and Nigeria speaking on the subject
of the CTBT.
 
 
<P><B>1. Entry-into-Force</B>

 
<P>Discussions continued past midnight, with what amounts to little
or no progress being made. 
 
<P>The positions fall roughly into three groupings:
 
<UL>
<LI> The UNITED KINGDOM, RUSSIA AND PAKISTAN, supported by CHINA
     remain absolutely insistent that any Entry-into-Force
     criteria must include all 5 Nuclear Weapon States together
     with Israel, India and Pakistan. While CHINA appears to be
     less insistent on this issue, the other three countries are
     showing no flexibility whatsoever on their demand.
     Basically, these countries want an explicit list of
     countries who are required to ratify before the treaty can
     enter into force, with NO exceptions for the 5 NWS and
     Israel, India and Pakistan.
 
<LI> A group including the UNITED STATES, FRANCE and GERMANY
     who, while favouring a solution that does NOT allow the
     treaty's Entry-into-Force to be held hostage by the
     ratification of any one country, are 'flexible' and thus
     could support a solution that would break the deadlock.
 
 
 
 
<LI> A group including CANADA, AUSTRALIA, INDONESIA and others
     who, more out of concern for the viability of the treaty
     than sympathy for INDIA, strongly argue for Entry-into-
     Force criteria that will not allow the treaty to be blocked
     by the failure to ratify of any one particular State. These
     countries prefer a requirement of a simple number of
     ratifications by any State for the treaty to enter into
     force, or they could accept a list of specific countries
     provided there was included some sort of waiver or method
     of bringing the treaty into force if one or more countries
     on the list did not ratify.
</UL>
 
<P>The only area of progress is that the concept of a 'positive'
Conference which could meet and discuss what to do in order to
bring the treaty into force is acceptable to all. However, as
this Conference would not have the right to amend or waive any
of the Entry-into-Force criteria, the main question remains -
what criteria for Entry-into-Force will it be combined with.
 
<P>Thus, Entry-into- Force remains the single-biggest area of
disagreement.
 
 
<P><B>2. On-Site Inspection</B>

<P>Today's discussion on OSI centred primarily on the use of
National Technical Means (NTMs). While some participants
indicated a 'slight convergence' of views (with the UNITED STATES
accepting that espionage and other intelligence gathering
activities not in accord with general international law will not
be acceptable), the general feeling was that the discussion "had
just gone around in circles" and "that there had been no movement
at all". There remains a considerable gulf between the position
of the UNITED STATES on the one hand, and CHINA and RUSSIA on the
other.
 
<P>Discussion on OSI will resume after Thursday's Plenary meeting,
and attention will be focused on the decision-making (i.e.
voting) on initiating an OSI.
 
 
<P><B>3. Preamble</B>

 
<P>It had been hoped to resume discussion of the Preamble following
the G-21 meeting this morning. However the G-21 did not discuss
the issue, and it is unlikely that there will be a further
discussion of this within the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear
Test Ban.

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
            Special Update,<BR> 25th June 1996</H3>


<P>The main developments of the day were: 


<P>the strongly-worded speech by PAKISTAN in which it  highlighted why it considers it essential               that all 5 NWS and India, Pakistan and Israel must ratify the treaty before it can enter-into-force;
 

<P>movement on Entry-into-Force by the UNITED STATES and, possibly, also CHINA;
 

<P> a new compromise proposal by CANADA, amending the Chairman's revised Review article as it relates to PNEs.
 

<P><B>1. Ad Hoc Committee</B>

 

<P><B>1.1 Entry-into-Force</B>


<P>The UNITED STATES indicated that it could accept a number of proposals on EIF - a simple number including the 5 Nuclear Weapons States; a formula with a simple waiver; a formula with a complex waiver. Most importantly, the UNITED STATES stressed that it could NOT support the formula contained in the original Chairman's text which explicitly required a list of 37 countries (now 39 after the Chairman's Amendments) including the 5 NWS and Israel, Pakistan and India to ratify before the treaty could enter-into-force. This was explicitly related to the Indian speech from June 20, and confirms that the UNITED STATES does not want to see the Treaty's entry-into-force to be held hostage by a failure of one or more of the 'threshold' States to ratify.
 
<P>Reportedly Ambassador Sha of CHINA indicated to journalists that CHINA could "reluctantly" accept the complex EIF proposal presented by Ambassador Ramaker on June 20. This would be a major shift in position, although no such statement was made to the ad hoc Committee itself.
 
<P>PAKISTAN, the UNITED KINGDOM and RUSSIA have not changed their positions, continuing to insist on a rigid formula requiring all 5 NWS and Pakistan, India and Israel to ratify before the treaty
could enter-into-force. 
 
<P>In its Plenary speech, INDONESIA indicated that, while it was aware of the need for all nuclear  weapon and nuclear capable states to become Parties in order for the CTBT to be effective, a mechanism should be developed OUTSIDE of the treaty to deal with this to prevent the treaty being "taken hostage by a small number of states".
 
<P><B>1.2 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions</B>

<P>CANADA, in a statement supported by EGYPT, SOUTH AFRICA, JAPAN, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and ARGENTINA, reiterated its "deeply-held opposition" to PNEs and expressed its deep regret at the inclusion in the Chairman's Amendments of PNEs in the Review article of the CTBT. 
	
<P>Apart from Canada's general opposition to PNEs, three fundamental problems were identified with the  Chairman's amended Review article.  That it presumes that the Review Conference SHALL consider the possibility of permitting PNEs in 10 years time; that the Review Conference will 'automatically' consider PNEs "unless it decides otherwise" without defining how this could be decided; and, most importantly, its reference to obligations of States Parties under other international instruments that create uncertainty and perhaps even a legal loophole for States could conduct PNEs. Mindful of the insistence of China and the short time left to conclude the CTBT, rather than insist on  deletion of the entire reference to PNEs, Canada "reluctantly" proposed amendments to the Review Article to take into account its main concerns. With Canada's changes, the relevant section would now read:
 

<P><blockquote>
	On the basis of a request from any State Party, the Review  Conference shall decide by                                                    	consensus whether to consider the possibility of permitting the conduct of underground 	 	nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. If the Review Conference so decides, it shall direct	the Conference to commence work without delay, with a view to recommending to States 	Parties an appropriate amendment to this Treaty that shall preclude any military benefits of 	such nuclear explosions. Any such proposed amendment shall be communicated to the 	Director-General by any State Party and dealt with in accordance of the provisions of Article 	II of this Treaty.
 </blockquote> 

<P>The significance of these changes is that: a State must make a specific request for PNEs to be addressed by the Review Conference; PNEs will only be addressed by the Review Conference if the Conference agrees by consensus; and any amendment must then be formally submitted by a State and go through the formal (and complex) amendment procedure [art. VII].


<P><B>CHINA did not respond to this proposal.</B>
 
<P>It would preferable that the CTBT contained no explicit reference to the possibility of PNEs  whatsoever. Given the lack of support for China's proposal, the earlier Canadian suggestion that it
should be sufficient for CHINA to make a declaration outside of the Treaty seems more appropriate. However, the Canadian amendments would reduce the emphasis given to PNEs and the hurdles to their consideration by the Review Conference are not inconsiderable. In addition, the formal amendment procedure would require a decision to convene an Amendment Conference (something which can only be convened if a majority of the States Parties agree to hold such a Conference within 30 days of being notified of a proposal). Amendments can then only be adopted by a majority vote in support the  amendment AND provided that NO State casts a negative vote against the amendment.
	
<P>In its Plenary statement, INDONESIA reiterated its opposition to allowing PNEs under the CTBT. Pointing to the lack of necessity for any specific mention of PNEs, it indicated that any State Party can put forward any relevant issue to the Review Conference.
 
<P><B>1.3 On-Site Inspection</B>

<P>CHINA essentially reiterated its concerns, including the timelines for OSI, the use of National  Technical Means (NTMs), and the voting on triggering an OSI.

<P> 	The UNITED STATES reiterated many of its concerns also. For example, on NTMs, it proposed  amendments which would reinstate the original wording of the Chairman's draft, to replace the amended version which was more sensitive to the concerns expressed by China, India and Pakistan. It proposed that an OSI request could be based on any relevant information, including that obtained by NTMs. It reiterated its view that a decision on OSI should be taken by a simple majority of members of the Executive Council present and voting. New proposals include a provision for a "quorum" of two- thirds of the Executive Council to be present for a decision to be made; and a proposal that, for an OSI request, the State requesting an OSI and the State sought to be inspected may vote on the decision if  they are members of the Executive Council.
<P>	In its Plenary speech PAKISTAN stated its position on OSI as requiring a minimum two-thirds  majority vote to trigger an OSI; that NTMs can only be used with severe restraints and conditions; and that security concerns not related to the CTBT must be respected.
<P>	INDONESIA, in its Plenary speech, indicated that while it agreed that OSI should be based solely on  IMS data, that a compromise could lie in a simple majority vote for an OSI requested purely on IMS data and in a two-thirds majority vote for a request based on NTMs and not corroborated by the IMS. It also stressed that decisions should be taken collectively, that initiating an inspection should be done  expeditiously so that time-sensitive data would not be lost, and that it considered that concerns about  possible abuse had been taken care of adequately.
 

<P><B>1.4 Preamble</B>

<P>BRAZIL, CUBA, INDONESIA, IRAN, KENYA, MEXICO, MONGOLIA, PAKISTAN, PERU, SRI LANKA, NIGERIA, MYANMAR and VENEZUELA proposed a number of additions to the  Preamble, mainly concerning references to ending the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons, further steps towards nuclear disarmament, and describing elements of the  Preamble as 'purposes and objectives' of the CTBT. Reference was also made to the aspirations of the
Parties to the PTBT to end all nuclear test explosions and the desire to end radioactive contamination. 
<P>	The discussion on preventing environmental contamination was raised again in connection with the proposal referring to the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), with Germany objecting to the phrase used, reportedly "because  Greenpeace will use this to protest about peaceful uses of nuclear energy". It was suggested to refer back to the original proposal from the Rolling Text on environment, but France continues to oppose  this.
<P> 	In its Plenary statement, PAKISTAN referred to its proposal for a 'purposes and objectives' section to  be included in the Preamble, and urged that this be considered again as a way to address the  “shortcoming's" of the Scope article and to respond to the aspiration for nuclear disarmament.
 <P>	In its Plenary statement, INDONESIA stressed that the preambular part of the treaty should at the least encompass two fundamental objectives: to curb any form of nuclear weapons proliferation in all its aspects, and to serve as a basis for the pursuit of the objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons. It also suggested that a solemn declaration by the nuclear weapon states not to engage in the further, qualitative improvement of their nuclear weapons and that this could help ratification.
 
 
<P><B>2. Plenary Presentations</B>

<P>In addition to the points noted in the various sections above, INDONESIA described the "CTBT  constitutes the litmus test for the willingness of states to halt the nuclear arms race and to pursue
nuclear disarmament". It described the situation now as "we are now racing against time" and called for increased flexibility on critical issues. It questioned whether "the maintenance of [the NWS] individual and strategic postures as well as their status as NWS has taken precedence over their commitment to total abstention from nuclear weapon tests." It also stressed the importance of meeting the deadline of the end of June.
 <P>	In addition to the points noted above, PAKISTAN highlighted what it saw as the limitations of the CTBT likely to emerge from the negotiations. These included: the continuation of sub-critical and laboratory tests and the possibility to use these to improve existing nuclear weapons; the possibility of conducting very low-yield tests or hydronuclear tests in breach of the treaty because of the verification limitations; the lack of commitment from the NWS to halt qualitative improvement and make specific disarmament commitments; the possible abuse of OSIs; and NTMs. The actual recent conduct of the negotiations - with the 5 NWS meeting in private - was also cause for concern. It expressed, however, that it would NOT give up on the treaty, and that it would NOT say 'no' to the CTBT. This is because it  saw a CTBT banning all  nuclear explosions as being to valuable to lose both from a perspective of constraining further development of nuclear weapons and preventing non-proliferation. It expressed that it was 'extremely disturbed' by India's declaration that it could not sign unless its concerns were  met - describing this as premature  and as a possible 'death-knell' for the treaty. It expressed opposition to a role of the UN Security Council in enforcement of compliance with the CTBT.
 
<P><B>3. Other Issues</B>

<P>Declaration - at least two more countries, in addition to the 18 listed yesterday, have signed on to the declaration urging compromise so that the CTBT can be completed on schedule. These are: IRELAND, FINLAND.

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
            Special Update,<BR> 24th June 1996</H3>



       
 

<P><B>There were two important developments arising from Monday's meeting of the ad hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban (NTB):
</B>
 
<P> 1. Presentation by the Chair of the NTB Committee, Amb. Ramaker, of a paper containing                                                amendments to the Chairman's draft CTBT text [CD/NTB/WP.335] (the original Chairman's draft text was presented on May 28 [CD/NTB/WP.330]);
 

<P>  2. A joint declaration by 18 States, calling for  the negotiations to be concluded by June 28.
 

<P><B>1. Chairman's "Amendments Paper"</B>

<P>Instead of presenting a complete revised draft Chairman's text as some had expected, Ambassador Ramaker tabled a paper containing only Amendments to his original draft text. While this paper indicates progress in refining or agreeing certain provisions of the draft CTBT, it also highlights the
failure to reach accord on several key provisions.
 
<P>Most significantly, there has been no agreement yet on the formula for Entry-into-Force (EIF), nor on the decision-making procedure for triggering an On-Site Inspection (OSI). Neither of these two issues are therefore covered in the Amendments paper, and negotiations on these provisions continue, based on the provisions of the original Chairman's draft CTBT text.
 
<P><UL><B>The Amendments paper included changes to:</B>
<LI> the Preamble;
<LI> the Organisation, including the Executive Council composition and functions;
<LI> Verification; 
<LI> some measures related to On-Site Inspection (OSI),  including provisions related to frivolous or                abusive OSI requests;
<LI> the Review of the CTBT, in particular as related to Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs);
<LI> the International Monitoring System (IMS) and the functions of the International Data Centre (IDC)
<LI> the detailed tables concerning the IMS stations.
 </UL>

<P><UL>Below, the following issues are addressed:
 
<LI> Entry-into-Force (EIF);
<LI> On-Site Inspection (OSI);
<LI>Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs);
<LI> the Preamble.
 </UL>

<P><B>1.1 Entry-into-Force (EIF)</B>

<P>The Amendment's paper contained nothing on Entry-into-Force, as there has been no agreement on this issue and it remains one of the two most divisive problems confronting completion of the CTBT. 
 
<P>The EIF provision included in the Chairman's draft CTBT, required ratification by ALL 37 States who had a primary seismic monitoring station or a radionuclide laboratory on their territory as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) BEFORE the CTBT could enter into force -- with NO exceptions. This list of 37 was designed to include the five official Nuclear Weapon States and India, Pakistan and Israel.
 

<P>The lack of any 'safety' provision for bringing the Treaty into force if any one country on the list of 37 fails to ratify, has created considerable concern that the Treaty might never enter into force, or at least could be considerably delayed. Effectively, all 37 countries have an open-ended veto on whether
there will ever be a CTBT. Attention has increasingly focused on India, especially following its  statement to the Plenary on Thursday (20 June), where it said that it "would not accept any language in the Treaty text which would affect our sovereign right to decide, in the light of our supreme national interest, whether we should or should not accede to such a treaty".
 
<P>The solution to this problem is clear: ensure that no one country or group of countries could ever block entry into force. The best way to do this - and the "normal" mechanism used in multilateral treaties, is for a treaty to enter into force once a certain number of countries have ratified, while using political
mechanisms (rather than legal ones) to ensure that states considered critical to the viability of the regime also join. Other common 'safety' mechanisms, include provisional entry into force or some form of waiver. The vast majority of participants in the CTBT negotiations favour such an approach.
 
<P>However, four countries continue to resist any and all initiatives to introduce any flexibility into the EIF formula, that could allow the CTBT to come into force if one country listed does not ratify - these countries are: the UNITED KINGDOM, RUSSIA, CHINA, and PAKISTAN. Their stance on EIF brings into question whether or not these countries really want a CTBT at all.
 
<P>Last week, Ambassador Ramaker presented a paper containing a new EIF proposal. This - rather complex - formula seeks to find a compromise from the irreconcilable positions of the two camps.
Essentially, Ramaker's proposal would place 'a premium' on ratification by ALL 37 countries on the list (with no exceptions), by making this the 'fast track' for entry into force. However, there is a 'safety mechanism' whereby, after five years, the treaty can be brought into force anyway, either if a sufficient
number of countries (75) ratify, or if a decision is reached to waive some of the EIF requirements. <P>There is an additional concession - any country particularly concerned about ratification by any one or more countries in the list of 37, can be exempted from the CTBT up until the original requirements of
all 37 ratifications are met. This compromise proposal -- although eminently sensible - was not  included as an amendment to the original proposal because it was rejected outright by the United Kingdom, Russia, China and Pakistan.
 
<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
<P>The hard-line positions of the UNITED KINGDOM, RUSSIA,  CHINA, and PAKISTAN, brings into question whether or not  these countries really want a CTBT at all. Unless these countries modify their stance now, it may be impossible to agree a CTBT by the end of June. Ramaker's proposal from last week is the basis of a sensible compromise. This, or any other formula which would  allow the treaty to enter into force without necessarily  having ALL the NWS and ALL 'threshold' States having    ratified, is the only way out that will ensure a CTBT enters into force. 

<P>Such an approach is also consistent with Greenpeace's objective to have a truly comprehensive test-ban    treaty enter into force at the earliest opportunity.
 
<P><B>1.2 On-Site Inspection (OSI)
</B>
<P>Similarly, nothing is included in the Amendments Paper on the decision-making mechanism for triggering an OSI. The provisions included in the original Chairman's text thus still stand as the
basis for negotiations, but are not acceptable to the United States on the one hand, and China, India and Pakistan (in particular) on the other.
 
<P>Reportedly, over the weekend, informal and private discussions amongst the five Nuclear Weapon States have lead to a suggestion that an acceptable formula for the 'trigger' could be a three-fifths majority vote in favour of an OSI (i.e. a Green light procedure) of the Executive Council present and voting.
 


<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
Such a compromise proposal should be acceptable in  that it takes into account the concerns of the United States that procedural barriers should create a stumbling block for the initiation of an OSI, and those of other countries who do not want to be subjected to frivolous or abusive challenges for inspections. 
 
<P><B>1.3 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs)</B>

<P>Last week, China has proposed including a new Article 2 on PNEs that Russia has supported, but that  most countries rejected. The Chairman's compromise, included in the Amendments Paper was to incorporate elements of the Chinese proposal in the general Review article.
 
<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
<P>It is a positive step that China's proposal for inclusion of a specific PNE article as Article 2 has not been taken up. The inclusion of the Chinese proposal in the review article as proposed in the Amendments Paper has some good  and some bad aspects.  

<P>On the 'good' side, in addition to there being no separate article, it is made clear that there is also no    exception to the Scope article (article 1) and that PNEs are completely prohibited. In addition, there is a two-step process: firstly, agreement in the Review Conference must be reached by consensus only, and then any proposal would have to go through the complex amendment procedure.

<P>However, on the bad side, the explicit reference to PNEs and the 'automatic' nature of the review of PNEs at the Review Conference is unnecessary given the broad scope of the Review envisaged anyway. Moreover, the explicit reference to possible amendment of the CTBT to allow for PNEs is likely to encourage continued research into this area. Further amendments to this passage are highly    desirable to reflect the opposition of almost all participants to any possibility of PNEs.
 
<P><B>1.4 The Preamble</B>

<P>Some minor changes were made to the Preamble, apparently primarily aimed at amending or deleting passages with a view to recognising changes caused by, on the one hand, the Chinese opposition to prohibiting PNEs and, on the other, India's concerns.
 
<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
These amendments do not appear to significantly alter  the Preamble. By failing to add better disarmament language, the primary concerns of India (and others) are still unlikely to have been adequately addressed.
 
<P><B>2. Declaration</B>

<P>The Declaration presented on Monday expressed the "deep concern" of a significant group of delegations that "there exist fundamental challenges to the successful conclusion by June 28"
of the CTBT negotiations.  The delegations called on all participants to "take the necessary political decisions" to enable the negotiations to reach conclusion and emphasised that "no one state or group of states should seek to thwart that conclusion". The delegations regretted that "many delegations have to date not been willing to make the compromises vital to success" and called upon all delegations for co-operation and compromise. They affirmed their commitment to work with the Chairman so as to ensure that the negotiations produce an effective CTBT by June 28.
 
<P>The Declaration was signed by Chile, Switzerland, Canada, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria, Denmark, Hungary, New Zealand, Australia, Slovakia, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Japan, Spain, and Belgium.

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
            Special Update,<BR> 21st June 1996</H3>



 

<P><B>There were three developments of special significance emerging from Thursday's meetings in Geneva. These were:</B>
 <DL>
<DT>  1. a statement by India to the Plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament;
 
<DT>  2. a discussion in the open-ended Bureau meeting of the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion (PNE) proposal presented by China on 18 June;
 
 <DT> 3. the presentation to the open-ended Bureau meeting of a new proposal on Entry-into-Force (EIF) from the Chairman of the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear Test Ban (Ambassador Jaap Ramaker).
</DL> 

<P>Although some delegates considered that Ambassador Ramaker might introduce a revised Chairman's text this week, this no longer appears likely. Expectation is growing that this new text will be introduced Monday.
 

<P><B>1. Statement by India</B>

<P>In its speech, India was highly critical of what it sees as weaknesses in the present draft treaty, particularly with respect to nuclear disarmament and entry-into-force. However, India did
NOT give a final position on whether it would sign a CTBT or not, merely that it could not be expected to accept the current package and that it "cannot subscribe to it in its present form". India gave no indication that it would 'walk-out' of the negotiations.
 

<P>The main thrust of the speech was that "India cannot accept any restraints on its [nuclear] capability if other countries remain unwilling to accept the obligation to eliminate their nuclear weapons". India frequently referred to the continued reliance on nuclear weapons by the Nuclear Weapon States, ongoing nuclear weapons co-operation, and the resources being spent on R&D and refinement and further development of arsenals. India noted that the Nuclear Weapon States had worked so that the CTBT seems to be "shaped more by [their] technological preferences... rather than the imperatives of nuclear disarmament".
 

<P>India appeared to dismiss the notion of taking up its concerns on nuclear disarmament by strengthening the Preamble (i.e. "Weak and woefully inadequate preambular references to nuclear disarmament such as those contained in Working Paper 330 cannot meet our concerns. We are only too aware that non-binding references in other treaties have been treated with complete disregard."). However, the  possibility of strengthening the Preamble is left open. In this respect, it is interesting to note
that some of the same themes concerning nuclear disarmament were also taken up by Iran later in the Plenary, although in a somewhat less emphatic manner. Thus Iran specifically pointed to more precise and stronger provisions of the Preamble as being a possible solution to its concerns.
 

<P>Ambassador Ghose also addressed the question of Entry-into-Force and the emphasis placed by some countries (United Kingdom, China, Russia and Pakistan) on India's ratification as a prerequisite for  EIF. India said that it "would not accept any language in the Treaty text which would affect our sovereign right to decide, in the light of our supreme national interest, whether we should  or should not accede to such a treaty". 


 


<P><B>Evaluation:</B>


<P>While India's statement reinforces the already strong  concerns about whether or India will ultimately  sign and ratify the CTBT, it does not seem to erect any fundamental  barriers to completion of the CTBT per se. A final decision on signature of the CTBT by India would not appear to have      been taken yet by New Delhi. 
India will continue to participate in the talks, and strengthening of the Preambular references to disarmament could go some way towards addressing India's concerns. 
The need to have a CTBT that WILL enter into force quickly and as broadly as possible, reiterates the importance of an EIF provision that is flexible and cannot  be held hostage by the failure of one State or group of States to sign and ratify the Treaty.
 
<P><B>2. Entry-into-Force (EIF)</B>

<P>The 'Moderator' on EIF (Amb. de Icaza of Mexico) submitted his report on the afternoon of June 18th. This did not highlight one EIF option that might attain consensus, but presented a range of options that essentially provided for everything from a simple requirement of ratification by any 65 States, to a range of lists with or without waivers or some means of seeking to achieve EIF even if the EIF requirements had not been met.
 
<P>At the open-ended Bureau meeting on Thursday afternoon, Ambassador Ramaker presented a paper containing a new EIF proposal. This - extremely complex - formula takes elements from a number of the competing proposals identified by the Moderator on June 18th and combines them.
 
<P>The proposal consists of several stages and is quite complex. My understanding is that the proposal is as follows:
<DL> 
<DT><B>1.</B>  After at least two years has elapsed from the treaty being
     made open for signature, it may enter into force provided
     that it has been ratified by the 37 States having the
     primary seismic stations or radionuclide laboratories as
     originally proposed in the Chair's draft CTBT text (this
     includes the 5 NWS and Pakistan, India, and Israel).
 
<DT><B> 2.  </B>However, after five years have elapsed and if all members
     of the 37 have not yet ratified, new possibilities for EIF
     are provided. Namely: 
 
    <DD><B> (a) </B> that if a total of 75 States have ratified, the CTBT
          could automatically enter into force;
 
   <DD> <B> (b) </B> one or more States which have ratified may call for a
          conference on EIF. This conference can decide by
          two-thirds of those States who have ratified to allow
          the CTBT to enter into force, even if the requirements
          in '1' and '2(a)' have not been met. In this
          situation, a State that has already ratified but voted
          against EIF at the conference, or a State that
          ratifies after the conference, can opt out with a
          national declaration, until some or all of the 37
          States identified in '1' have ratified.
</DL> 

<P>Russia and the United Kingdom were highly critical of the proposal and did not wish to discuss it. Other countries believe that, while not ideal, it may be a workable compromise, perhaps with a few refinements.


 

<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
<P>This proposal would allow the treaty to enter into force without all the NWS and threshold States having ratified. While it places a  premium on the membership of the 5 NWS and the three      'threshold' States, it would not allow any of these to  'hold the treaty hostage'.
As such, it is consistent with Greenpeace's objective,  that is to have a truly comprehensive test-ban treaty  enter into force at the earliest opportunity.
 

<P><B>3. Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs)</B>

<P>The open-ended Bureau meeting also discussed the Chinese proposal for a new Article 2 on PNEs  that it had presented on Tuesday (see earlier update for details).
 
<P>China's proposal reportedly received support from Russia and, to a lesser extent, from Iran. Western delegations and Mexico were opposed to the proposal with varying degrees of firmness, quite
a few saying that any inclusion of a specific reference to PNEs in the treaty was unnecessary or dangerous. Some countries, including Germany, held out the prospect of a amended text being
included within the Article on Review. China insisted that there be a specific reference to PNEs in the Treaty as a condition of its signing the CTBT, but appears to be flexible on wording and location of the provision.
 
<P><B>Evaluation:</B>
China's proposal for inclusion of a specific PNE article as Article 2 and with the 'automatic' review provision it included, appears to be unacceptable to almost everyone. 
Apart from China, Russia and to some extent Iran, the preferred option remains that the issue is not addressed at all, or that China takes the issue up as a declaration separate from the Treaty.
A  reluctant compromise by some countries, may be to concede inclusion of a much amended proposal in the Review Article, but only as a last resort in order to ensure that China joins the Treaty.

   <H3>Greenpeace Briefing on CTBT Negotiations<BR>
           China and Peaceful Nuclear Explosions<BR> 19th June 1996</H3>





<P><B> 1.</B>   China originally insisted that a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) permit Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs).  All other countries in the Geneva negotiations for a CTBT opposed China's position, because allowing PNEs in a CTBT would create a major loophole in the treaty.  A PNE program can be used to develop nuclear weapons, e.g.  India describes its only nuclear test as a PNE.


<P>	On 6 June 1996, China modified its position on PNEs and proposed that it would accept a zero-yield CTBT but ONLY IF the other negotiating parties accepted that PNEs would be specially examined in the review of the treaty.


<P>	Already, some countries are voicing objections to China's latest proposal.  On 13 June, both Canada and Japan criticized China's new position.  To allow even a specific mention of PNEs in the review could provide countries with an excuse to pursue PNE research and development programs during the next ten years.  Such PNE programs could serve as cover for nuclear weapons development programs.  The record of the U.S. and Soviet Union demonstrates that PNEs are an unnecessary and dangerous technology.  It is obvious that there is no room in a truly comprehensive test ban treaty for PNEs.


<P><B>2.</B>   China says that as a developing country it cannot afford to rule out any opportunity to make use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  Three ideas for PNEs have emerged from China so far:  deflecting asteroids from hitting the earth with nuclear missiles, generating electricity in underground cavities with a series of nuclear explosions and creating a canal for diverting waters from Tibetan mountains to irrigate the Taklimakan desert in northwest China.  All projects are rather fantastic, and the latter two promise much radioactive contamination (as well as unknown environmental consequences from such a major environmental engineering project).


<P>	A significant reason for China's attraction to PNEs seemingly comes from quiet urgings by weapons scientists in Russia and the United States.  Unable to pursue PNEs in their countries due to environmental and cost reasons, reportedly Russian PNE experts have been providing advice and encouragement to their Chinese colleagues.  Similarly, many of the U.S. Energy Department scientists involved in recent weapons laboratory-to-laboratory exchanges with China reportedly worked on the U.S. PNE program, Project Plowshare.


<P>	PNEs and the U.S.:  The U.S. began investigating non-military uses of nuclear explosives in 1957, when the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) established  "Project Plowshare".  The name was derived from a passage in the Old Testament: "And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more".  In total, 27 PNEs were conducted between 1961 and 1973.  The Plowshare program itself officially came to an end in 1977.


<P>	Excavation projects were considered to be the most important application of the technology.  In 1961, the AEC entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to investigate nuclear excavation for the construction of a new sea-level canal through the Central American Isthmus.  The project was abandoned in 1970 and the Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Commission concluded that the effects of nuclear excavations on the water saturated rock at the Isthmus were unknown.

<P>	Between 1965 and 1976 the U.S. Government entered into agreements with private companies to undertake in-depth feasibility studies on specific projects such as excavations, oil exploration and underground gas storage.  Many other uses for PNEs were suggested but did not reach the feasibility study stage for lack of industrial sponsorship.

<P>	In the mid 1970s, the U.S. teamed up with two non-nuclear weapons states, Thailand  and Egypt, to carry out preliminary feasibility studies into nuclear excavations.  The Kra Canal project in Thailand proposed to link the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea using 139 explosives ranging from 100 to 1000kt.  This project was scrapped because the Thai Government was uncertain whether the nuclear option was practical "in the light of current world perspectives".

<P>	Another proposal to channel Mediterranean Sea water 54 79 km into the Qattara Depression in Egypt and use the difference in elevation to generate hydro-electric power, called for the use of at least 181 explosives in the 150 500kt range or 439 explosives of 140kt.  Signing of the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET), between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in 1976, placed a 150kt ceiling on these detonations and the proposal went no further.

<P>	The Plowshare program was terminated in 1977 due to waning industrial interest and mounting public concern about the environmental consequences of PNEs.   The largest excavation experiment, the so-called Sedan test of 1962 at the Nevada Test Site, displaced 12 million tons of earth, and the fallout from the test drifted beyond Nevada and over Utah.  Every effort was made during project Plowshare to assess the costs associated with commercial use of PNEs -- but public objections to the use of PNEs because of possible radiation releases and contamination added new and unknown dimensions to cost estimates.

<P>	PNEs and the Soviet Union:  The Soviet Union conducted 124 PNEs between 1965 and 1988 in various parts of the Soviet Union.  PNEs were conducted for seismic sounding, increasing oil and gas production, creating underground reservoirs, shutting down oil gushers, digging a canal, building dams and water reservoirs, crushing ore deposits, burying biologically hazardous industrial waste, and stopping gas escaping from a coal mine.

<P>	The PNE program caused radioactive contamination around the Soviet Union and even exterior to its borders.  The largest experiment, called "1004" with an estimated yield of 125kt, was detonated in a river and produced two lakes.  Radioactive debris from the large "1004" experiment and another, the Pechora-Kova canal experiment, was detected in northern Europe and elsewhere.

<P>	Although the Soviet PNE program ended in 1988, Soviet and now Russian weapons scientists continue to advocate the use of PNEs for civilian purposes.  Soviet weapons scientists feel they perfected PNE technology by solving two key problems for PNEs devices:  making a thin device so that bore holes can be smaller and so less expensive to drill and creating a device that can withstand great pressures and temperatures without a large and expensive exterior cooling apparatus.  In 1991-1992, a Russian company Chetek with connections to Russian nuclear weapons laboratories proposed that dozens of PNEs be used for the destruction of nuclear and hazardous wastes: however, the project did not receive any government support, no commercial financial backing could be found for the proposal, and a market demand did not materialize.


<P><B>3.</B>   PNEs and Nuclear Weapons Development:  The main objection to allowing PNEs in a CTBT is the problem they pose for two main goals of a CTBT:  stopping nuclear weapons development and hindering proliferation.

	PNEs can be part of a nuclear weapons research and development program.  For example, a PNE for an excavation could use a nuclear device that is a nuclear weapons design being developed or perfected.  At minimum, such a PNE would verify that a nuclear weapons design worked.  Also, a PNE research and development program can double as a nuclear weapons development program even if a PNE never takes place.  If China, Lybia, Pakistan, North Korea, or Iran pursued a PNE research program during the next ten years on the excuse the PNE question will come up at the CTBT review, they could gain valuable information about nuclear weapons design and performance.

<P>	China has tried to address the verification problem by offering to allow international monitoring and verification with prior approval of the treaty organization.  But, clearly, if China (or another country) pursued a PNE program on the scale of the U.S. or the Soviet Union, it would involve enough people, tests, monitoring, research and development, etc., to provide critical expertise and information for developing or perfecting nuclear weapons.

   <H3>Greenpeace CTBT Updates<BR>
           Special Update from the Conference on Disarmament<BR> 19th June 1996</H3>


<P>Yesterday (Tuesday June 18) in a 'closed-door' meeting, China formally introduced its proposal on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions. In addition to Greenpeace's general criticisms against any proposal to
specifically make reference to PNEs in the CTBT, the specific wording of the Chinese proposal also presents some new and additional problems.
 

<P><B>1. Description and Specific Critique</B>

 
<P>The Chinese proposal is to amend the draft Chairman's CTBT text (CD/NTB/WP.330) by introducing a new Article 2 entitled 'Peaceful Nuclear Explosions' immediately after Article 1 (Scope or Basic
Obligations). 
 

<P>The core of the proposal is that the Review Conference (the first of which is to take place 10 years after the CTBT enters into force) should consider the issue of PNEs and, if it agrees to the concept, it should make recommendations on amending the CTBT. The Conference of States Parties should then begin work 'without delay' on arrangements for the approval and conduct of PNEs.
 

<P><B>In addition to the entire notion of PNEs, the proposal contains three further specific problems:</B>
 <UL>
<LI> the possibility of conducting PNEs is required to be 
     considered by the Review Conference AUTOMATICALLY unless
     the Parties decide against this (the burden is on the
     opponents of PNEs to exclude them from the agenda of the
     Review Conference);
 
<LI> one of the Treaty amendments which would be required is an
     amendment to the Scope article, which could completely
     reopen the entire debate on zero-yield;
 
<LI> by stating that the 'arrangements... shall be consistent
     with the obligations of States under other international
     agreements', the proposal would allow PNEs to be CONDUCTED
     only by the 5 official Nuclear Weapon States and the three
     threshold States (India, Pakistan and Israel). This is
     because the actual conduct of PNEs is prohibited to Non-
     Nuclear Weapon States by the NPT.
 </UL>

<BR><B>Moreover, China's proposal to place this article as Article 2 of the CTBT would give absurdly great prominence to PNEs.</B>
 




<P><B>2. Complete Text of Chinese Proposal:</B>

  <TT> 
<P>   
<B>18th June 1996
<BR> China                                        
 
                         <BR>Article 2
              <BR> Peaceful Nuclear Explosions
 
         <P> Notwithstanding the provision of Article 1, the
     possibility of permitting the conduct of underground
     nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes shall, unless
     otherwise decided, be considered by the Review Conference
     of States Parties.  In the event of a Review Conference
     decision by consensus that such nuclear explosions may be
     permitted, the Review Conference shall recommend any
     appropriate amendment to the Treaty, and the Conference of
     States Parties shall, without delay, commence work with a
     view to agreeing arrangements for the possible approval and
     conduct of such nuclear explosions.  The arrangements shall
     preclude any military benefits and shall be consistent with
     the obligations of States under other international
     agreements.</B>
</TT>
 

<P><B>3. Country Reactions to Chinese Proposal:</B>


<P>The Chinese proposal was completely rejected by the following States:   
<B> <UL>
<LI>Mexico, 
<LI>Canada, 
<LI>Japan, and 
<LI>Australia.
</UL> </B>

<P>The proposal was PARTIALLY opposed by Germany, who 'left the door open' for PNEs to be explicitly included in the Review provisions of the Treaty.
<BR>We have no information on any positions taken by other States.
 

<P><B>4. General Greenpeace Position on PNEs</B>

 
<P>    Greenpeace does not agree with the concept of so-called  peaceful nuclear explosions. We oppose completely any  EXPLICIT incorporation of this concept in a CTBT in whatever form. 
 

<P>     Even explicit incorporation of PNEs in the CTBT - even if  restricted to the article on Review provision would, at the least, give the concept renewed and updated formal recognition and, at the most, might well encourage ongoing interest in, if not research and development of this concept in order to undermine a CTBT. A specific  mention of PNEs in the review is unnecessary, as the review
explicitly provides the basis for any relevant topic to be introduced by any State Party.

   <H3>Greenpeace CTBT Updates<BR>
            Updates from the Conference on Disarmament<BR> 9th June 1996</H3>


  
<P>   An important address at Thursday's Plenary meeting was the
statement by Ambassador Sha Zukang of China in which he set 
out his country's current position on scope and peaceful nuclear 
explosions, entry-into-force, aspects of the preamble and the 
trigger mechanism for on-site inspections.
 
<P>    Meanwhile, the work of the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear
Test Ban has proceeded largely through a new mechanism of
'Moderator Groups' dealing with the major outstanding issues 
such as composition of the Executive Council, international 
monitoring system and international data centre, preamble and 
review, entry into force and on-site inspections. Depending on 
the issue, work has variously utilised the Chairman's draft CTBT 
text and also the Rolling Text.
 
 <P>    The five Nuclear Weapon States continue with their private
discussions on the major issues, but have not yet reached
agreement amongst themselves.
 
<P><H3>1. Scope</H3>

<BR>The only significant new development on scope this week came 
on Thursday in China's statement to the Plenary, where they 
suggested a compromise related to so-called 'peaceful nuclear
explosions' (PNEs). China had been discussing the proposal
informally for some time, but had not made any formal proposal.
Although variously interpreted as major development, the
statement did NOT commit China to the true zero-yield option,
originally formulated by Australia and included in the Chairman's
draft CTBT text.
 
<P>China’s indication that it could accept a temporary ban on
PNEs provided that a specific provision is included in the treaty
to require the possibility of permitting these in future,  is to
be considered by a Review Conference of the Parties (provision
is made for a first conference to review the treaty ten years
after it enters-into-force, with further review conferences at
ten-yearly intervals thereafter).
 
<P>It is important to note that China stated that only AFTER
consensus was reached on its proposal for reviewing PNEs,
would China be in a position to "favourably consider" the
Australian proposal on scope.
 
<P>While China's proposal is regarded by many as a 'face-saver',
opposition to a specific reference to PNEs in the review remains
strong, especially in the absence of a formal commitment yet to
the Australian  scope proposal. As review article in the
Chairman's draft CTBT text, would allow any aspect of the treaty
to be raised at a review conference, there seems to be no need
for a specific provision for PNEs for China, and by including
such a provision, PNEs would be given a too prominent status in
the treaty.
 
<P><H3>2. Preamble and Review</H3>

<BR>The Moderator Group's discussion on Preamble and Review has 
seen vehement exchanges on the use of the Chairman's draft 
CTBT text and the Rolling Text. 
 
<P><H3>2.1 Preamble</H3>
    <BR> China, Pakistan and India are reportedly unhappy with the
     extent to which disarmament issues are reflected in the
     Chairman's draft text. Ambassador Ludwik Dembinski of
     Poland also mentioned in Thursday's Plenary that the
     Chairman's draft CTBT text could be improved by
     "...Preamble language that is perhaps less timid about the
     non-proliferation content of the CTBT".
 
    <P>China has indicated on Thursday that it agrees to withdraw
     its proposal for an article on negative security
     assurances, but "insists" that this idea be reflected in
     the Preamble.
 <H3>
<P></H3>2.2 Review
    <BR> Reportedly, there is a lack of willingness to discuss the
     provisions of the review article until there is more
     clarity in what will be included in the preamble.
 
     <P>As noted above, China's proposal in Plenary was to have a
     special provision included in the review on the question of
     PNEs. However, the exact nature of the provision it is
     proposing remains unclear. From China's speech, it would
     appear to be proposing that a decision on PNEs would be
     taken by consensus and that some details on developing
     procedures for PNEs would need to be incorporated.
 

<P><H3>3. Verification</H3>
<BR>
The Moderator Group discussions on the international monitoring
system and the international data centre (IMS/IDC) are being 
based on the Chairman's text with minor details being worked 
upon.
 
<P>The triggering mechanism for on-site inspection (OSI), especially
the role of national technical means (NTMs) of verification
remain problematic. Although Pakistan, India and China have
accepted that technical data obtained through NTMs can be
introduced in support of an OSI, they wish to see agreement
needed by a two-thirds majority of the Executive Council before
an OSI could be initiated. The United States is equally opposed
to having to get a simple majority go-ahead from the Executive
Could before initiating an OSI. Something along the lines of the
provisions contained in the Chairman's draft CTBT text appear to
be an appropriate middle-way.
 
<P>Some outstanding difficulties remain with the provisions on
managed access and overflights which could result in further
weakening from the Chairman's draft CTBT text.
 
<P><H3>4. Entry-into-Force</H3>

<BR>This remains a deeply problematic issue. The United Kingdom,
Russia and China continue to insist that whatever formula is
used, there needs to be an explicit requirement for ratification
by all 5 nuclear weapons states and the three 'threshold states'
before the treaty can enter-into-force.  Other countries, are 
concerned about having the treaty "held hostage" to the 
ratification of a state or group of states and also in formally 
recognising threshold states as such in an international 
instrument. These countries still favour a simple numerical 
formula.
 
<P>With the basic provisions remaining deeply divided, the 37 states
identified in the Chairman's draft text continues to be explored
in the hope of some compromise. Three suggestions have been 
made to get around the problem of the treaty being held hostage: 
 
 <P>1.  a waiver provision, whereby even if one or more of the 37
     states did not ratify within a given time-frame, those
     States which have ratified could bring the treaty into
     force anyway;
 
 <P>2.  a provisional entry into force for those Parties who have
     ratified after a certain interval (necessary for the
     establishment of the IMS/IDC etc.);
 
<P> 3.  a "positive conference" of the Parties, again after a
     period has elapsed after the treaty is opened for
     signature, which would discuss and decide on measures to
     help enable the treaty to enter into force (but without the
     possibility of amending the EIF provisions to allow the
     treaty to enter-into-force).
 
<P>China and Russia strongly oppose a waiver provision, and the
provisional entry into force has no gained much support. The
third option appears to offer some hope for a compromise, but
still leaves the problem of having the treaty's entry-into-force
being blocked by one or more of the 37 states listed in the
Chairman's draft.
 
<P><H3>5. Adoption of the CTBT</H3>
<BR>
Support appears to be growing for a determined effort to conclude
the CTBT by the end of June - something that appears now to be
eminently achievable. China's speech also indicated its support
for completion of the CTBT by the end of June (a position that
had been stated previously outside of the formal negotiations). 
 
<P>With work on the composition of the Executive Council 
continuing
to address details of the number and distribution of seats, the
key outstanding problems appear to remain:
 
<BR>China's position on scope (incl. PNEs);
<BR>the division between the USA on the one-hand, and Pakistan,
     China and India on the other, on the triggering of an on-
     site inspection;
<BR> managed access and overflights;
<BR>entry-into-force.
 
<P>This latter issue is the one where agreement seems furthest away.
 
<P>Away from the Conference a number of events that could impact 
on the concluding weeks of work include: China's latest nuclear 
test - its 44th (and just one fewer than the United Kingdom) 
which has provoked protests around the world; whether or not 
the United States will proceed to conduct the first of its 'sub-
critical experiments' and the vote of confidence in the new Indian
government.

<H3>Special Update, 28 May 1996
Chairman's CTBT Text<BR>
<HR><P>

                       Greenpeace CTBT Updates
            Updates from the Conference on Disarmament</H3>
<HR>
 <P>
     This update describes briefly some of the key features of the draft CTBT text presented this afternoon by the Chairman of the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear Test Ban, H.E. Mr. Jaap Ramaker of the Netherlands. A more complete update - including
reactions of various delegations to the text - will be issued at
the end of the week.
 <P>
     The Chairman has proposed a treaty that would ban ALL nuclear explosions completely - including so-called peaceful nuclear explosions - and that is firmly rooted in the context of systematic and progressive further efforts to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons and constrain the further development
of the weapons which exist already.
 <P>
     The verification networks are as expected, with some of the details being changed to take into account concerns of, for example, Russia. A reasonable compromise is put forward on the question of On-Site Inspections, that would allow the  introduction of non-International Monitoring System Data in
support of a request for an inspection. The International Data
Centre may provide raw data or specialised assessments for States Parties.
 <P>
     Entry-into-Force would be based on ratification of a specific 37 identified States on whose territories the primary seismic monitoring stations or radionuclide laboratories are located. There is no waiver clause for this provision.
 <P>
     In the view of Greenpeace, this text creates a suitable
basis for working towards completing the treaty by the end of
June, and - as such - it should be welcomed. 
 <P>





<H3>1. Scope</H3>

The Scope article (Article I) provides for a complete prohibition
on nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion,
as originally proposed by Australia and supported by many
delegations. This Scope article provides for a zero-yield CTBT,
and would encompass a ban on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs).
 <P><DL>

<DT>The article states:
 
 <DD>    1.   Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any
     nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear
     explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear
     explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control.
<P> 
<DD>     2.   Each State Party undertakes, furthermore, to refrain
     from causing, encouraging, or in any way participating in
     the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion or
     any other nuclear explosion.
 </DL>
<P>
It should be noted that there is no special provision for PNEs in any other article.
 <P>
<H3>2. Preamble</H3>

The Preamble includes clear references to both nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation objectives. In addition, it
refers to continued reduction and elimination of nuclear  weapons; the restrictions that will be imposed by a zero-yield CTBT on further developments in nuclear weapons; and an affirmation of the zero-yield CTBT concept itself.
 <P>
The Preamble reads, 'inter alia':
 <P>

 
          CONVINCED that the present international situation
     provides an opportunity to take further effective measures
     towards nuclear disarmament and against the proliferation
     of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, and declaring their
     intention to take such measures,<P>
 
          STRESSING therefore the need for continued systematic
     and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally,
     with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and of
     general and complete disarmament under strict and effective
     international control, <P>
 
          CONVINCED that the cessation of all nuclear weapon
     test explosions, by constraining the development and
     qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the
     development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons,
     constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and
     non-proliferation in all its aspects,<P>
 
          RECOGNISING that an end to all such nuclear explosions
     will thus constitute a meaningful step in the realisation
     of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament,<P>
 

 
          AFFIRMING that this Treaty seeks to achieve the
     discontinuance of all nuclear weapon test explosions and
     all other nuclear explosions for all time,<P>
<P> 
In addition, Article VIII of the draft CTBT provides that every
10 years a conference shall be held to review the operation and
effectiveness of the CTBT. These reviews are to include the
Preamble, in order to ensure that its object and purpose are
being realised.
 
<H3>3. Verification</H3>

The International Monitoring System (IMS) will be based around
the four networks: seismic, hydroacoustic, radionuclide, and
infrasound. The International Data Centre (IDC) is to provide raw
or processed data to States Parties. It shall provide standard
screened event bulletins, based on standardised characterisation
parameters. Additional national screening criteria may be applied
on the request of a State Party. (Article IV(B) and Protocol,
Part I)
 <P>
The On-Site Inspection (SO) regime provides for consideration
of information amassed from both the IMS and from non-IMS
sources, where the latter is 'relevant technical information
obtained by any national technical means of verification in a
manner consistent with generally recognised principles of
international law'. Regardless of the source of the information
supporting a request, a decision is required of the Executive
Council within 72 hours on whether an SO is to be initiated.
This decision may be taken by a simple majority decision of the
Executive Council. 
 <P>
After 30 days of the SO has elapsed, it may be terminated by a
simple majority vote of the Executive Council.
 
<H3>4. Entry-into-Force</H3>

The Chairman's text proposes that Entry-into-Force would be based on ratification of a specific 37 identified States on whose
territories the primary seismic monitoring stations or
radionuclide laboratories are located. This appears to be based
on a very recent compromise proposal from Canada.
<P> 
This list includes all the 5 declared Nuclear Weapon States and
the 3 threshold States.
 <P>
These States are:
 <DL>
     <DD>Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada,
     Central Africa Republic, China, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire,
     Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel,
     Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mongolia, Niger, Norway,
     Pakistan, Paraguay, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation,
     Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia,
     Turkey, Turkmensistan, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United
     States of America.
 </DL><P>
There is no waiver clause for this provision or a provision that
would allow entry-into-force if any one member of the list of 37
fails to ratify.

   <H3>Greenpeace CTBT Updates<BR>
            Updates from the Conference on Disarmament<BR> 24 May 1996</H3>
         
  

          
 	There are just five weeks of negotiations remaining if the CTBT is to be completed on schedule by the end of June.<P>
     It is now widely expected that the 'Chairman's text' of a
draft CTBT will be presented next week. The actual content of the
Chairman's text remains to be seen, because of disagreement
that persists on a number of key issues. It is clear though, that
the Chairman will need to present 'compromise' formulations that
are likely to gain the broadest support and form the basis of
consensus compromises in the remaining weeks of the Conference.
Below, some guesses at possible 'compromises' are indicated.
<P>
     There was little progress of note in the formal negotiations
of the CTBT text in the ad hoc Committee on the Nuclear Test Ban,
despite the restructuring of the negotiating process initiated
last week (see Update No. 9). Most delegates described the
discussions as 'reiterating established positions' rather than
'negotiations'.<P>
     Away from the negotiations, reports continue to mount that
China's preparations for a nuclear test are nearing completion
and that a blast could be imminent.<P>
     For this and future 'CTBT updates' relevant issues
raised in Plenary meetings will be incorporated in the relevant
section on progress in the negotiations, so there will be no summary of Plenary speeches.
 
<H3>Progress on Negotiations and Key Issues</H3>

 
<H3>1. Scope</H3>

     In the formal discussions, there was no specific progress
to report on Scope. In the ad hoc Committee discussion on Scope,
there were very few speakers, and those that spoke merely
reiterated existing positions.<P>
     There are, however, some indications emerging from
discussions amongst the five nuclear weapons powers (P-5) that
China may support the Australian formulation on scope for the
'Scope' article, but ONLY provided that there is a special
provision included in the treaty to provide for peaceful Nuclear
Explosions (PNEs). In other words, China still insists that PNEs
should not be prohibited outright by a CTBT. Opposition to a
special treatment for PNEs is strong.<P>
     India has given no indication that it is prepared to
withdraw its Scope proposal in favour of the text suggested by
Australia.<P>
     Pakistan has indicated it may support the Australian
formulation for Scope, provided that 5 key elements are
specifically included in the Preamble.<P>
 
     <B>Possible CTBT draft outcome:</B><P>
<DL>
<DD>      1.   It would appear that the Chairman's draft almost
          certainly will be based on the Australian Scope
          proposal. <P>
 
<DD>     2.   It is possible - although highly undesirable - that a
          separate article may include a special provision for
          PNEs.
</DL> 
<H3>2. Preamble</H3>

     In the formal discussions, there was no significant progress
was made on the Preamble. The ad hoc Committee discussion on
Preamble yielded no shift in positions.<P>
     Pakistan has withdrawn its proposal for a separate 'Purposes
and Objectives' article for the treaty, and instead has now
proposed to include this as a section of the Preamble. It
considers this essential to place the CTBT in a disarmament
context and to provide reassurance regarding the Scope of the
CTBT. The five points it identifies under purposes and objectives
are: (1) prevent the qualitative development of nuclear weapons
and nuclear weapons systems; (2) prevent the development of new
kinds of nuclear weapons and systems; (3) contribute to the
promotion of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its
aspects; (4) promote the realisation of nuclear disarmament and
the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons within a specific
time-frame; (5) promote international peace and security.
<P> 
    <B> Possible CTBT draft outcome:</B><P>
<DL> 
<DD>     1.   In order for the CTBT to address both disarmament and
          non-proliferation and to reassure those delegations
          concerns about Scope, the Preamble will need to
          include some sort of reference to the five topics
          raised by Pakistan (and in similar forms by other
          delegations earlier). However, it is highly unlikely
          that there will be any reference to elimination of
          nuclear weapons 'within a specific time-frame'. It is
          possible that the qualitative development and new
          weapons development references may be included but
          presented in such a way that it is 'recognized' that
          this will be the effect of a CTBT.<P>
 
<DD>     2.   The section on 'Review' of the CTBT, is likely to be
          formulated in such a way that the review will be of
          the treaty in its entirety (i.e. including the
          Preamble).
</DL> 
<H3>3. Verification</H3>

     There was no significant progress to report on this issue.
     Pakistan indicated in its Plenary speech, that it could
accept the introduction of data generated by national technical
means (NTMs), however it would insist that the information would
need to be sourced and that it would be evaluated by the
International Data Centre (IDC) prior to being considered.
Pakistan also stated that regardless of whether the information
was generated by the International Monitoring System (IMS) or
NTMs, explicit approval for an On-Site Inspection (OSI) would be
needed by the Executive Council before it could be launched (the
'green light' procedure).<P>
     Indications are emerging that India and China are also more
flexible on the use of NTMs, but perhaps with similar concerns
and restrictions as identified by Pakistan.<P>
 
     <B>Possible draft CTBT outcome:</B><P>
<DL> 
<DD>     1.   The IMS will be based around the four networks as
          elaborated earlier. The IDC is likely to provide a
          standard screening service for IMS data, with
          individual states being allowed to request either raw,
          unprocessed data or customised assessments. <P>
 
<DD>      2.   It is quite likely that OSI will be based on a
          two-tier system by which an on-site inspection could
          be triggered by IMS data unless the Executive Council
          objects (i.e. the 'red light' procedure) and by non-
          IMS data (i.e. based on national technical means) only
          on the basis of prior approval from the Executive
          Council ('green light'). The procedures to be followed
          will balance the need for speed and effectiveness for
          OSI with controls to prevent abuses.
</DL><P> 
<B>4. Entry-into-Force</B><P>

     No progress has been made on this issue.
     The fundamental - and critical - division remains whether
the five declared nuclear powers and the three threshold states
should be explicitly required to ratify before the treaty could
enter into force, or whether a more flexible system should be
provided for in the treaty (i.e. by requiring ratification by a
simple number of States or by providing for some sort of waiver).
 
 <P>    A possible compromise on EIF remains unclear.
 
<H3>5. Adoption of the CTBT</H3>

 
     Most attention is now centred on the tabling of a formal
'Chairman's text' - a "clean" (i.e. unbracketed) treaty text. It
is expected that this will be tabled in the coming week.<P>
     Once the text is presented, it will be sent back to capitals
for their consideration. In the interim, the ad hoc Committee
will focus on two issues: (1) the Preparatory Commission, which
will be responsible for work prior to the Entry-into-Force of the
treaty, including the preparation of the IMS and IDC; and (2) a
discussion on working arrangements for the remaining weeks of
this part of the session.<P>
     Intensive negotiations on the CTBT text are expected to
resume in real earnest as of June 3rd.<P>

<B>Kiora, My name is Tanya and I'm a 29 year old New Zealander.</B>
 <P>
The MV Greenpeace and the Rainbow Warrior were released by French
authorities in mid March, after being siezed at Mururoa Atoll
last September. Six weeks of repairs later and the MV Greenpeace
is looking like you would too if you had received a good dose of
TLC{Tender Loving Care} and attention.
 <P>
On Wednesday we left Auckland, heading for Sydney, Manila and
then onto China where we will take a peaceful message on behalf
of the millions of people around the world who are calling for
an end to nuclear testing. Messages like the one we have been
asked to deliver by young New Zealanders, Adam and Hannah
Johnson, who wrote to the Chinese leaders: "Dear Sir, Please
write to us. We want to know why you hurt our planet with your
bombs. Please stop testing the bombs. Please don't make any more.
Please make China nuclear free like N.Z. We are proud but you
cannot be proud of what you are doing. Please answer us. Yours
sincerely Adam and Hannah Johnson."
 <P>
We hear reports that the Chinese are planning their 44th nuclear
test soon and are blocking agreement of a CTBT, because they want
a clause allowing `peaceful nuclear explosions'.
 <P>
Nuclear weapons are designed to wipe out life and peaceful
explosions cannot be justified as any better. Radiation knows no
boundries   or the difference between violent and peaceful.
 <P>
As we steam on two engines heading for the Nth. Cape before 
heading west to Sydney, I stand on deck on a starry, calm evening
and ponder how we will be received. So far the Chinese
authorities have not granted us permission to visit.

When travelling vast distances across the earth, time zones
change and so every now and again all the clocks on board are
moved an hour forward or backwards, depending on what
direction we are moving, east or west of the Greenwich
meridian. A concept I always have difficulty understanding,
but through some mysterious means the captain seems to have a
handle on it.<P>
My clock reads 11.45 as I'm woken for watch. Thinking I have
15 minutes, I dress quickly, grab a coffee and am on the
bridge bang on midnight, only to discover I have another 20
minutes before my watch begins! Then at 0100 my crewmate
Jeannette puts the clock back and it is 2400 again....
But at 0340 the next watch takes over.<P>
After my morning sleep, I awake at 1030 old time ( forgot to
put my clock back) and marvel at how I cheated myself of the
extra 40 minutes sleep we all gained. But next time I will not
be fooled. I'm leaving myself a note beside the light switch,`
Dear Tanya, you have 20 mins. extra sleep, 20 mins. extra
watch, 20 mins. extra sleep. Enjoy it.'<P>

10 minutes into the watch when there was a sickening sound of
clunking metal followed. Mark, with coffee in hand was
swaggering down the walkway,between Esperanza and Betty Blue.
ticka boom shsss, they sounded as their huge pistons went up and
down. Suddenly,  Marks'well tuned ears that had spent hundreds
of
hours listening to these engines, knew something was radically
wrong. There was the sickening sound of clunking metal.
In a couple of strides he was at the control panel and the
engines stopped.<P>
A shock to Jeannette and I on the bridge quietly chatting and all of a
sudden an eiree silence. Jeannette phones down to the engine room, the
reply,"Can't talk, in a hurry." Uh oh.... Strangely some bolts had
worked loose and the rocker arm shaft was about to break free. As Mark
put it later,`blimen scarey, your first reaction is something is about
to explode.' A situation that can happen,engine rooms are a maze of
pipes, motors,switchboards and huge lunps of metal spinning and moving
up and down at incredible speeds, basically created by  constant minor
explosions.(No nukes involved) So when something does go wrong it can
be dramatic. But luckily, within an hour the problem was solved and
were back on two engines. Talking of hours...... When travelling vast
distances across the earth, time zones change and so every now and
again all the clocks on board are moved an hour forward or backwards,
depending on what direction we are moving, east or west of the
Greenwich meridian. A concept I always have difficulty understanding,
but through some mysterious

means the captain seems to have a handle on it.<P>
My clock reads 11.45 as I'm woken for watch. Thinking I have 15 
minutes, quickly dress, grab a coffee and on the bridge bang on 
midnight, only to discover I have another 20 minutes before my 
watch begins!
<P>
Then 0100 Jeannette puts the clock back and it is 2400 again....
But at 0340 the next watch takes over.<P>

<H3>Day 5 <BR>  
19th May</H3></A>
<P>
Sunday today, so life on board is a little more laid back.
Watchkeepers still do 8 hours watch, Linda still cooks, Frank our
bosun and Sam, who has been a volunteer deckhand from N.Z. to
Australia( and made a great improvement with painting on the poopdeck)
do a few little jobs on deck and Neil our radio operater still has to
send and receive ship communications. But he did seem very pleased
with himself at having finally given his cabin a spring clean. First
chance since arriving on the ship at Hao atoll 2 months ago. Even
though our ships were handed  back to us,from the French, that long
ago and we have just come out of 6 weeks maintainence, still the
strangest discoveries are made. Today Rob came across important,
technical papers of the Rainbow Warrior, buried in a draw in his cabin
and Shaun discovered the seamans' papers of a crew member who was
deported from Moruroa, way under his bunk, only seen when the draw was
pulled right out.
<P>
Many crew fom that trip have lost personal effects and also ships

log books and important papers seem to of disapeered forever.
Tomorrow morning, around 07.30 we will be passing through the 
heads of Sydney harbour.<P>
As far away as 100 nautical miles off the coast, the glow of 
Sydneys' lights has intruded on the night sky.<P>
From the information we have received on board, the 29 hours we 
will be in port will be busy. Press  conferences,open boat, many
visitors and catching up with some of the people who have been working
hard for many months already, preparing for this visit to China and
the aim to have all the nuclear weapons states sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty. For the past few weeks, Jeannette has spent many
hours doing chart corrections and the last few afternoons plotting our
course

to Manilla, 4000 miles from Sydney. Safely weaving our way around


the reefs of Papua New Guinea and through the islands of the 
Philipines some of the most pirate infested waters in the world.
So, we have decided a celebratory glass of Port after our watch, will
go down well.<P>

<H3>Sydney  Harbour. Noon (our time) DD05-21<BR>20th May<BR> Day 6 </H3></A>
 
As we passed through the heads of Sydney harbour, a passing
squall gave a dramatic backdrop to our entrance. A T.V.
helicopter filming from above, staunch G.P. Australia staff (who
had been up in the wee hours of the morning, preparing
inflatables) were braving the wet, cold conditions and giving us
a energetic welcome, other supporters on small sail and motor
boats. Passing under the Sydney harbour bridge and beautiful,
rocky outcrops on the shore, the weather cleared. The mooring
lines snaked out on the decks, fore and aft, the crew take up
their positions to tie the ship alongside as a rowdy bunch of
Australians on the quay cheer us in. Some, old friends and many
new.<P>
The gangway down, cleared by customs then it is all on! A quick
burst of`housekeeping' by the crew and a press conference
follows.<P>
Then time to yarn and show around G.P. Australia staff and
supporters, early in the evening a party for some G.P. donars.
Later in the night, those of us not required to stay on board for
watch, wandered up to `The Dry Dock' a local bar, to relax and
yarn with many of the people we have met today,and by the look
of things, a few will be feeling a bit `rough' tomorrow. I'm sure
most of the crew would agree that our short stay has been fun.
A friendly,vibrant bunch of people. Many have worked years with
G.P., a lot volunteer and this is their first chance to visit a
G.P. vessel. A reminder to the crew how fortunate we are to sail
on them.<P>
It seems we have been receiving good media coverage about our 
impending visit to China. A difference can be made, when masses
of people pull together on a common goal and that can only happen
when information is spread  around.<P>
As we head to sea tommorrow, many of us will have fond memories 
and  a few good laughs of a brief visit to Sydney.

<H3>MV Greenpeace / PC 8023<BR>     Departing Sydney Harbour DD05-22<BR>
May 22nd<BR>Day 7
</H3></A>
I sleep down in the`dungeons'. Aptly named because it is the
lower deck, down by the waterline. Therefore, there are no
portholes and it is dark and dingey. Also the Red Fox Room is
down here (a nice way of saying the sewage treatment plant) but
that is not a problem... unless something goes wrong,and
honestly, I'm not down here because the rest of the crew think
it is the best place for me, it's just that someone had too.
This morning I awoke a little confused,at first realising the
ship was not moving and for a brief moment trying to recall what port
I was in. Because my cabin is pitch black it took another few moments
to unravel what time of day it was. But a smile came to my face as I
looked at the clock. It was 6.30 in the morning and I'd just had a
full nights unbroken sleep, thanks to the people of the Australian
office who stayed up during the night to do our dock watches. A few of
us pottered around on the poopdeck, sorting out the recyclable garbage
to take ashore and then I took the opportunity to walk barefoot on the
grass and lay in the gentle sunshine of the small park we were tied
alongside, the last chance for a couple of weeks to touch the earth.


<P>

Around midday we had brunch, organised by the Aussie G.P ers.
A picnic of pita bread,felafels,hummus ect... Sitting out in the 
park looking back at the ship.It was great and Linda appreciated 
the bonus of a meal she did not cook. <P>
As we enjoyed our picnic the news came that we would not be 
departing today, due to newly discovered information on documents 
required before entering Manilla. <P>
Apart from Bob our captain and a few others filling in papers and 
sorting out the problem, the rest of the crew greatfully accepted 
the unexpected change of events (to put it mildly). Later in the 
evening a woman called joy and her nearly four year old daughter 
Jasmin offered to take some crew for a cruise around Sydney 
harbour in the 31 foot sailing boat that they live on which was 
eagerly accepted by nine of the crew. <P>
From what I hear, to sit back and admire the city lights and 
sights, was a pleasent way to draw to an end an enjoyable day.

Awoke this morning to a gentle orange , dawn sky. A quietness in the harbour before the hustle and bustle of the city waking up, a cool nip in the air but the promise of sunshine. It was a normal working day, preparing  for departure at noon and trying to finish jobs easier down alongside than at sea. `Smoko' time at 10 o'clock and as I sat and drank my coffee, I thought to myself that Bob and Mark (2 of our engineers) looked rather grumpy.<P>
Being such a brave deckhand that I am, I enquired if my observations were correct. Bob, who is very eloquent in his descriptive, cynical way, feigned surprise, but had to admit the morning before (for obvious reasons) his brain cells were not connecting and this had reflected in his cable work. The job in question had been to weave a couple of cables from the salt water filter (that carries a electrical charge to help stop corrosion) to the switchboard, through a labyrinth of pipes and other cables in the deckhead of the engine room. Balancing precariosly on a stepladder a few metres above a multitude of machinery you wouldn't want to fall on. Only to discover this morning as he went to connect them up he had put the wrong cables through! And had to repeat the whole episode again this morning. 
<P>
As planned we steamed out of Sydney harbour today under a sunny  Sydney sky and good wishes of many friends. A gentle swell rocked the ship as we passed out through  the rusty orange, pancake layered cliffs of Sydney heads. Altering course to north, the sea and sky already having a tropical look about it. Onto Manilla and still unsure what our reception from China will be.

All on board have slotted back into the sea routine.Since
departing Sydney we have been moving through the water
comfortably and averaging 12.5 nautical miles per hour.
Travelling on a ship you are constantly changing climates. Only a
couple of months ago I was bringing in my winter wood supply,then
in the space of a day had landed into the humid, tropical heat of
Tahit and within a couple of weeks was back in wintery  N.Z.. Sailing to Austrlalia I put two blankets on my bed and now today, approx 300miles Nth. of Sydney everyone is back into
shortst.<P>
Occasionally at sea we can be fortunate to observe some
forms of atmospheric phenomena.<P>
One of these is the `Green Flash'. The controversy over this is 
like discussing religion, there are the believers and the 
disbelievers. Bob and Bora who do the 4-8 watch, saw the green flash. 
It occurs as the last slice of sun, sets below the horizon and a 
pale green burst appears where the sun just dropped.
There is quite a complicated scientific explanation for all this, 
to do with the refraction of light.... but I won't bore you with that.
This afternoon I painted more of the poopdeck. Finally finished 
the deckhead. Only the bollards, stantions and bulwarks to go.
Also, a sperm whale cruised by, only 5 metres off the portside, 
probably hitching a ride on the strong current that runs down 
this coast.<P>
Later this afternoon we had our weekly fire drill. Just before dinner I sat out on the heli. deck, enjoying the last dusky shades of the evening, before night fall. Cape Byron the 
most eastern point of the Australian mainland, a dark outline on 
the horizon.<P>

Day 10</H3></A>

Events took on an unexpected turn of events when our ship’s cook Linda was taken ill. Yesterday evening while eating dinner, Linda was telling a few of
us about sharp pains she had been experiencing most of the day in
the side of her belly and asked what apendicitis symptoms were.
Of course, we all  had a story to tell and our own personal
medical opinions to give on the subject, coming to the reassuring
conclusion that she didn't have appendicitis.
But as the night wore on the pain got worse and by the early
hours of this morning, Bora our doctor was giving treatment and
all day assesing the situation.
<P>
There is only so much that can be done in a medical situation at 
sea. A diagnosis is even more difficult to confirm, without the 
techology that is available to help on shore. 
At 1600hrs Bora made telephone contact Via INMARSAT medical 
assistance with a Sydney Navy Physician and it was agreed it would 
be safest to get Lynda ashore,so at 1630hrs we altered our course 
west towards Gladstone, in Queensland, Australia. A decision had to be made quickly as within a few more hours the Great Barrier Reef would be between us and the 
mainland.<P>
Unfortunately, Lyndas' illness also effects the crossing of the 
equater as this involves those who've crossed it dressing as 
pirates, King Neptune etc... and giving a initiation ceremony for 
those who haven't. Lynda was to be our only victim.
I wonder.........is there a connection. <P>

Day 11</H3>

Most of the crew have not slept much in the past 24 hrs. due to
the movement of the ship. So this morning there was a little bit
of grumpiness in the air, but it dissipated as the day moved on.
Apart from the frustration you can sometimes feel at constantly moving, there is a lot beauty that comes with it too.
<P>
This afternoon Ken (our 1st mate) said I should come and look at
something. Thinking he was going to point out some spots I'd
missed priming, I followed him up to the foredeck. Where upon
Rob, him and I stood, hanging our heads over the bow, with a
moderate gale in our faces we watched `Bow Rainbows'. As the ship
moved steadily through the deep blue water, white caps all
around, we rose and fell into the waves. One moment it would be
white and foamy then from the misty spray, rainbows would be 
arching from our bow. Mesmerising staring down into the water and 
exhilerating in the wind. The three of us would not of been 
surprised if dolphins had came riding on the bow wave to complete 
the picture.
<P>
In less than a day we will be passing through the Jomard entrance 
going around the Sth. eastern tip of Papua New Guinea, getting 
closer to China and still no news if we have permission to enter.
<P>
Last night I read a article in a National Geographic about the 
Xinjiang province (pronounced sheen- jee- ang) where Lop Nor, 
Chinas' testing ground is situated. I found it interesting that 
in this vast province of China, the majority of people are 
Turkic-speaking Muslims and only here and in Tibet, Chinese are 
the minority. As with the French it seems more appealing to 
test your bombs in someone elses `backyard' and not that of your 
ethnic people. I wonder why this is?
<P>
The chef of today was Bora, who managed to put out a tasty meal 
of pork chops( in a secret marinade sauce), fluffy smashed 
potatoes, broccilli, a Serbian salad and a very creativly designed 
fruit salad.All the while enjoying singing along to his native 
Yugoslav music. <P>

Day 12</H3></A>

It has been another day of rolling around.
Three o'clock this morning Jeannette and I stood outside the
bridge and chanted a `sea calming spell' but as of yet it doesn’t
seem to have taken effect.
<P>
It seemed a very ho hum kind of day today. Most of the crew have
stopped talking with me. I guess they're uneasy about how I may
interpret what they say, then repeat it in the daily diary.
<P>
A hardcase aspect  of writing this diary is I have suddenly had
to learn how to use a computer. Something up until now I have
successfully avoided.
<P>
The office where I type the diary every morning is next door to 
the radio room where Neil works. Fortunately for me, Neil has been 
extremely patient in trying to impart some basic computer skills. 
Unfortunately for Neil, computers are not something I catch onto 
quickly.
<P>
Many people rave on about what wonderful technology they are, but 
I get no joy from a machine that purposely tries to upset me. 
First of all, instead of the pleasure of words flowing from a 
pen, there is a horrible key board. I seem to only be able to co-
ordinate two fingers for typing and that is after I've searched a 
few seconds for the letter I want.
<P>
At least once in every `computer battle', something absolutely 
bizarre will happen. Suddenly all my words will disappear or they 
all scrunch together, sometimes a trick question jumps on the 
screen.<P>
`Are you sure you want these modifications made?' Y/N
I frown in disbelief,` What modifications!!!'
If I say yes something really dramatic may happen, if I say no it 
will probably give me another ten trick questions. Weird beeps 
have started emitting from where the disk is, the printer can 
sometimes gobble the paper or keep on whirring it out.
<P>
This morning everything was going well, not once did I need help 
from Neil. Then just like magic the screen went blank! This 
happened twice until I realised my leg was knocking the key that  
disappeared things. I hear you ask......what is my leg doing up 
by the keyboard? I was resting it there, braced against a book 
shelf, to hold myself in the chair, in front of the computer, so 
as the ship rolled I would not go flying out the door. 
The good side is, that each day that goes by I do become a little 
more computer friendly.

Day13</H3></A>

I find being at sea a love/hate relationship. One day it
can seem like the pits and the next it is great and I wouldn't
miss it for anything. Today was pretty good.
<P>
By the morning watch the sea had calmed. Phosphorescence was in
the water( the seas' version of glow worms) and it was a starry,
balmy morning. A lovely way to start the day, especially on your 50th
birthday, which it was for Bob, our captain.
<P>
On a ship you can be quite aware of other peoples' moods and it
seemed Bob was not too rapt about having a birthday. But you
can't let 50 years  go by and anyway the rest of the crew needed
an excuse for a party
<P>
Scattered over the day preparations were made. Rob built an 
excellent barbecue from a recycled 44 gallon drum. (We are 
expecting them out in the next G.P. catologue) Amongst the crew 
some great dishes were prepared and all day the fax machine was 
running hot  with messages for Bob , and by the afternoon he had 
accepted his fate.
<P>
Early evening we gathered on the heli-deck. (Of course still 
watches on the bridge and engine room) In the more comfortable 
evening tropical heat cruising at 13 knots through the Solomon 
sea.  A good time was had by all, finishing off with a chocolate 
coated, banana cake and a card from all the crew. It was hard to 
imagine that only yesterday we were rocking and rolling, sick of 
hanging on.
<P>
As the sun went down I was thinking. Ten months after the first 
nuclear explosion was made, Bob was born. Lets hope he is still 
50 when the last one is done.

Day 14</H3></A>

Early this morning, for most of the watch, lightening flashes were
making electric blue / white snapshots of the surrounding sea and sky.
A brown footed booby that had been hitching a ride with us all the day
before, was sleeping under a starboard liferaft and a half hour
downpour washed away the gritty, salt layer that had gathered
everywhere after our couple of days rough weather.
<P>
It is getting really hot now. Down in the engine room today it
was 39.5 degrees celsius. Whenever a engineer comes up from
below, I feel I should wring them out, the sweat is just dripping off
them.
<P>
We received a message from our cook Lynda today. She is out of
hospital and if she can get a visa will meet the ship in Manila. So
thats great.
<P>
Frank, our bosun set up the salt water shower on deck, a nice way to
cool off at the end of work. It is enjoyable to work beside him too as
he seems to have a huge reportoire of sea shanties and romantic
ballards.
<P>
As we get closer to Manila, more and more computer mail arrives 
every day. A lot of information to read up on about China and the
issue we are dealing with there.
<P>
Also soon the ship will be home to 21 more people, so the 
dynamics on board will change completly, exciting and daunting at the
same time. Nearly all of us have been here two and a half months now
and looking foward to being involved in actual Greenpeace work,
instead of just being ship / housekeepers. Also hoping  our
contingency of new `flatmates' are house trained as well.
<P>
I think all the crew were on deck this evening, it was beautiful and I
wished I were a painter. Steaming along 5 miles off the coast of 
Papua New Guinea through the Bismarck Sea. Karker Is. (an active
volcano) and Bagabag Is. off to starboard. The sea was smooth and it
faded into a sky of many textured greys. The mountainous islands
looked like mirages, layered tones of smokey blues floating on the
water. On the mainland wisps of smoke rising from the cooking fires.
<P>
On the subject of cooking, todays meals were yesterdays 
leftovers. Complimented at dinner by a pizza that Rob made. He 
seemed really impressed at how kneading the dough removed the 
ingrained, engine room grease and oil from his hands. 
Mmmmm.......all I know is it tasted pretty good! <P>

Day 15</H3></A>

On this morning’s watch, our course took us past the Schouten
Islands, strange names like Blupblup Is., Motmot islet and Bam
Is., appropriatly named as it is an active volcano that last
errupted in 1956.<P>
Also we had to be extra alert for floating logs, that I presumed
flow down the Sepik river into the sea.<P>
On the chart the river looks like a worm that is wriggling its'
way over the land. It is the largest river on the northern coast
of PNG. Seven hundred miles long from the mouth to its' source
and up to depths of 60 ft.
<P>
Later in the morning when I'd woken again, I was at the computer
when Shaun came in from the deck and said to take a look outside.
It was pouring with rain, waterfalls cascading from the deck 
above, the sea a pale stormy blue colour, but so smooth that as 
the raindrops landed you could see them bounce. Shauns' 
description that it looked like crushed velvet, described it 
well.
<P>
All in all it was a pretty wet day so could get no painting done. 
But there is always something to do. The M.V. is a beautiful old 
ship, built in 1959. It is constant work to keep any ship running 
and maintained and also it is our lifeline on this `world' of 
water. The ship relies on us, as we do on her.
<P>
On the 8-12 this morning there were many tuna fishing boats in 
the vicinity. They attach radio signal beacons to floating logs 
or rafts. the fish gather around these for shade and then the 
food chain cycle begins. Soon large schools of tuna have 
gathered, around which the fishing boats set their nets.
<P>
Bob, our 2nd engineer was the chef today. A good traditional 
english meal of chops, mashed potatoe, peas, carrots and gravy. 
The galley had a peaceful air about it as he cooked to `the 
Dublins' , ballads that he sings and plays just as beautifully 
himself,when he picks up a guitar.
<P>
Jeannette and I are the only women on board at the moment and are 
very impressed with this crew of competent, male cooks. Which 
proves the myth that `women are genectically superior' in the 
kitchen, a total fallacy.
<P>
I think the most happy person yesterday was Ken,on finding a 3kg tin
of baked beans. He seems to have some weird addiction to them 
which he prefers to call a predilection. Never before have I 
heard someone speak so fervently on the virtues of baked beans 
and their goodness per spoonful. If all scientist had spoken as 
passionatly against  nuclear testing, I'm sure it would never of 
begun.<P>

Day 16</H3></A>

Sleeping is one of the joys in life and the way you are woken
can determine your mood for the rest of the day.
There are many methods used to wake someone and on the ships I've
seen a few. There is the `foot stomping, door slamming, yeller',
the  `shake the shit out of your senses' style, the ` torch in
your face shiner', and the gentle `good morning please turn your
light on' waker upper.
<P>
Jeannette and I are lucky, our watch waker is of the last kind.
But we seem to have both successfully aquired the bad habit of
pretending we are awake, turning on our lights without missing a
beat of our dreams.
<P>
The sea has been calm and a nearly full moon is keeping us 
company at night.
<P>
This morning at 02.25 hrs we crossed the equator at longitude 
140 15.8'E. So now we are in the northern hemisphere.
Since all of us have crossed before we just had a quiet barbeque 
on deck this evening. Pity Lynda was not here with us, we had no 
excuse to dress up and act like idiots.
<P>
Later this afternoon we had a emergency drill. This time going 
through the liferaft launching procedure followed by a first aid 
course from Bora. Explaining the ABC's on first 
finding a injured or unconcious person, CPR,being shown how to 
operate the oxygen masks and bottles then finishing off with the 
a scenario of someone with a broken spine and putting them onto a 
special stretcher designed so that it can air lifted from the 
ship by helicopter.<P>
I was the patient and it felt a little unerving to lay on this 
stretcher with straps crossing all over me to hold me in then the 
final layer over the top. I felt like Houdini in a body bag. Once 
firmly strapped in and the crew felt they had taunted me enough, 
I was then carefully carried out to the heli deck for evacuation.
While trapped,there was talk of seeing whether the stretcher 
floated.....I  knew they wouldn't really.<P>
It was an interesting exercise that we all take seriously as it 
could happen to any of us and as in any emergency we all have to 
trust and rely on eachother and work as a team.<P>

Day 17</H3></A>

It has been an oppressivly hot, humid day. the kind of weather
that can send people `troppo'. (out of character, strange)
The first signs of what the day was to bring was when I noticed
some of the crew walking around in flippers and aprons.
<P>
Just before lunch  it was a state of emergency, everyone mustered
on the bridge deck with survival suits, watching in horror as
enormous octopus tentacle's were wrapping themselves around the
ship. But we all breathed a sigh of relief as the `octopus
deflecting zapper switch' was activated (luckily we had just had
it overhauled in maintainence) and the giant disapeered back into
the depths of 4000 metres.
We all needed a good strong cuppa tea after that.
<P>
A few hours later as we were all getting on with our work, it was 
presumed Jeannette was practising a Williamson Turn, a steering 
procedure for man overboard. But shouts of alarm went through the 
ship, we were being dragged into a giant whirlpool!<P>
All four engineers shot down into the engine (in matching hand painted, 
flowery boiler suits) and for five minutes gave the engines full 
throttle and we managed to pull out of it. It seemed an eternity.
We all had another strong cuppa,this time with a tot of rum. Usually 
only kept for medicinal purposes.
<P>
It seemed we had only just got our wits together again when it 
was noticed we were doing 30 knots and getting faster (average 
speed is 12 knots) a hard turn to Starboard was made on realising 
we were in the strong current that would take us over the edge.
<P>
Finally, after a enjoyable meal of seaweed pie with a thick 
vegemite sauce we all sat around the table sipping on a glass of 
rum with a tot of tea, discussing the days bizzare events. 
Coming to the conclusion; If the earth is flat, maybe nuclear 
power is safe.  <P>

<P>

It is a busy life on a Greenpeace ship and at the moment quite a 
small crew. So never enough hours in the day.
<P>
And now as we get closer to our destination, apprehension is 
building of what these next few weeks will bring. Still we have 
no idea if China will welcome us or rather the opposite. You can 
play many scenarios in your head. We are looking foward to catching up with the campaigners who have been working on the CTBT for a long time and who join the ship in Manila.
They will give us a clearer and more detailed picture of how we will be involved.
<P>
Working as a Greenpeace sailor you often feel like a fish in a
fish bowl, being watched, ambassadors of your country and public
property. Something we accept as we know we are fortunate to play our role and only because of the millions of people who support us in many ways.
<P>
But we are all 100% homo sapians here. We have other lives outside Greenpeace that are being constantly juggled. Many of us miss the people we love, we have our insecurities and uncertainties just like anyone else. We have our good days and our bad. We have only been to sea for two weeks, not long at all. But still everyone is looking foward to going for a walk and 
hopefully a big pile of mail will arrive, and each one of us will 
go and find a quiet spot and catch up on our` other life'.<P>

Noon Pos:<BR>
June 4, 1996<BR>
Day 19</H3>

It was full moon on the 2nd but we have hardly seen it as most of
the time the sky has been overcast. But that is O.K., as during
the day it is so hot I tell myself it would be worse without the
cloud cover. <P>
From this evening we are in pirate watch mode, as now we approach
the Phillipine Islands the chances are higher. We take a few
extra safty precautions. Lock all doors that give access into the
ship. Have spot lights on hand. An alarm system to alert the
crew, if need be. But the reality is, if we do get boarded there
is not too much we can do, except give them what they want and 
hope no one gets injured. Greenpeace ships do not carry weapons 
and I find it hard to imagine anyone prepared to use 
them if we did.
<P>
This evening the first glimpse of land was sighted.
Looking up in the Pilot book I read that the Phillipines together 
with the Sulu Archipelago are comprised of more than 7000 
islands. Mostly mountainous. The people are predominantly of 
Malay origin. In 1521 the Phillipine Islands were `discovered 
again' by Magellen (a portuguese navigator employed by spain) and 
for 350 years Spain had a strong influence on the culture and 
customs. Over 80% of the people follow the Roman Catholic 
religion. In 1898 the islands were then under american control 
and by 1941 the Phillipines again gained complete independence. 
The peso is the monetary unit.
<P>
Only two days to go and we are preparing for civilization. The 
washing machine has been busy. A few of us have been exchanging 
hair cuts, some better than others. Very soon life on board and 
what we are doing is going to take on a whole different 
perspective.<P>

MV Greenpeace / PC 8023<BR>     
Position: Entering Manila harbour. 09.30hrs<BR>
June 5th, 1996<BR>
Day 20</H3>

In the early morning hours we entered the San Bernadino strait,
the beginning of our passage through the Phillipine islands.
We had moonlight all our watch and many small fishing boats.
Echoes on the radar that did not visibly show lights and lights
that did not show as echoes on the radar. This lead to a touch of pirate paranoia and spending some time checking out the surrounding waters with the night vision binoculars (donated by an  Australian supporter when we were
last there). Later during watch I was unaware that Jeannette was
turning on the second radar and it sounded just like a fast boat
coming alongside, another jumpy moment!
All in all it was an interesting but uneventful watch. The
surrounding land silhouetted in the moonlight and many boats to
keep an eye on.
<P>
I'm told it was a spectacular sunrise, mirror calm water with a 
large flock of birds, volcanic islands that looked as if they had 
set the sky on fire.
<P>
It has been nice to look up from your work during the day and be 
passing by land, with the added bonus of a school of  spinner dolphins  
off the stern this afternoon. So graceful and fast, flying out of 
the water and spinning two or three times in the air before 
landing again. They are so full of energy I wish I could have some
of it, as I think would most of the crew. The heat really saps it 
out of you, it is hot enough on deck, let alone the engine room 
where it is now 43 degrees celsius.
<P>
Lynda - our cook - will meet us in Manila, probably expecting a guant 
looking crew with our clothes all baggy. We did O.K. but look foward 
to her coming back.
<P>
By 10 o'clock tomorrow morning we will be throwing the heaving 
lines onto the pier in Manila.
Then it will be all on.<P>

MV Greenpeace / PC 8023<BR>     
Position: At anchor in Manila harbour.<BR>
June 6th, 1996<BR>
Day 21</H3>

<P>On anchor watch and it is Thursday morning.
Yesterday was pretty confused and hectic. We never got to throw
the heaving lines ashore, as our berth had been taken by the time we arrived.

<P>At 0900 hrs as we steamed into Manila harbour, preparing the
mooring lines, anchor etc... the bow wave coming off the ship was
a greenish, yellow colour.(no kidding!) The harbour a foggy haze
of pollution, plastic and crap floating everywhere, the air
smells bad. There are many ships at anchor, dark eiree hulks in
the haze.

<P>Once the anchor was dropped we were swamped with officials 
customs, immigration and quarantine. I met four quarintine guys in one of the alley ways, asking for the chief cook and food.(I presumed to check it) Explained we had no 
cook then realised they wanted me to prepare them a meal. I pointed to the fruit bowls.

<P>Meanwhile our captain, Bob, was signing reams of paper work. In an hour we managed to clear 
the ship and catch our breath.

<P>During the day, ferrying people from shore to ship, the spray from 
the toxic cesspool (called a harbour) tasted foul and stung my 
eyes while  I drove an inflatable. 

<P>The VHF radio is a constant chatter, many people speaking at 
once nearly impossible to make contact with port 
authorities. Everything seems so crazy it is hard to believe it is real.
