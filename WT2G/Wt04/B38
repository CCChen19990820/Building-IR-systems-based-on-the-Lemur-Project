<title>Government Financial Assistance Programs</title><H1>Government Financial Assistance Programs</H1><dl><dt><b>VIRGINIA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING AUTHORITY  (VSBFA)</b><p><dd>The VSBFA offers two financing programs for businesses in Virginia: a loan guaranty program for small businesses and industrial development bond (IDB) financing for manufacturing businesses . More than 98 percent of Virginia's businesses are considered eligible for these programs. To qualify, a business must have either 250 or fewer employees, or less than $10 million in annual gross revenues for each of the last three years, or less than $2 million in net worth. Fees are required with all applications. The approval process can be relatively quick once the applicant provides the required documents.<p><dd>LOAN GUARANTY PROGRAM.  This is specifically aimed at small businesses which need short term capital to expand or finance current operations. The VSBFA guarantees a portion of a loan made by a bank to an eligible borrower. The maximum guarantee is 50 percent of the loan amount or $150,000, whichever is less, with a term of one to three years, generally. The maximum interest rate is two points over the lender's prime rate. The program enables banks to make loans which they otherwise might not make or to increase the amount of the loan. Applicants for the loan guaranty must submit VSBFA's loan application to their bank. <p><dd>INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS (IDB's).  The Authority issues tax-exempt IDB's for eligible manufacturing businesses to finance development of fixed assets, which includes land, building and capital equipment. IDB's, issued in compliance with federal regulations, provide effective annual financing costs at approximately 80 to 90 percent of the prime interest rate and terms of up to 30 years. The minimum feasible project size is $250,000.<p><dd>The VSBFA also has an "Umbrella IDB Program" which makes IDB financing available to manufacturing firms whose borrowing needs are too small to qualify for regular IDB financing. These tax exempt bonds also offer attractive interest rates and terms to finance fixed assets. This is done by pooling together the financing of many small businesses under one "umbrella" bond which is sold on the public capital market. <p><dd>To obtain application forms or additional information, contact:<dd>Virginia Small Business Financing Authority<dd>1021 E. Cary Street, P. O. Box 798, Richmond, VA 23206-0798<dd>(804) 371-8254<p><dt><b>SBA 504 LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM</b><p><dd>The SBA 504 program provides long term, fixed rate financing to small and medium sized businesses for financing construction, acquisition, and renovation of buildings and for purchasing major equipment.<p><dd>The program is generally intended to assist established, profitable, growing businesses by offering low down payment, long-term financing at a fixed interest rate. Working capital and refinancing are ineligible purposes.<p><dd>A borrower needs to provide no more than 10 percent equity in the project. The borrower's commercial lender provides up to 50 percent of the financing, usually in the form of a first trust or mortgage. The balance of the financing, which cannot exceed 40% or $750,000, is provided through an SBA guarantee of a subordinated loan. The maximum project size is approximately $1,900,000.<p><dd>The SBA's participation is in the form of a guarantee of a debenture (bond) which has an interest rate fixed at usually two points above treasury bonds of similar maturity and has a term of 10 or 20 years. Projects involving passive investment, speculation or extensive leased space are ineligible. The creation or preservation of jobs must be evidenced in the application.<p><dd>The program is administered in Arlington County and surrounding areas by the Virginia Asset Financing Corporation (VAFC). Staff of the VAFC and the Arlington County Economic Development Division will work closely with the business owner to determine eligibility and assist in the preparation of the loan application. For further information, contact either the Economic Development Division at (703) 358-3520 or:<p><dd>Virginia Asset Financing Corporation<dd>12020 Sunrise Valley Dr., Suite 260, Reston, VA  22091<dd>(703) 476-0504<p><dt><b>SBA 7A LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM</b><p><dd>The SBA 7A program guarantees loans made by commercial lenders to small businesses. Loans can be used for business or property acquisition, expansion, equipment purchase, working capital and debt consolidation. The SBA will guarantee up to 90 percent of a loan of $155,000 or less and up to 85% for loans over this amount. The maximum loan amount is $750,000. Loans up to $1 million can be guaranteed if used for the purchase of plant and equipment for the production of goods and services in international trade.<p><dd>To use the program, applicants must go through a bank or other lending institution, obtain and submit application forms to the bank. If the guarantee is approved by the SBA, the lender disburses the funds and services the loan. Note, however, that not all banks elect to use the program. Thus it may be helpful to talk to more than one lender.<p><dd>Good credit and a strong financial condition are important to qualify for a loan; the SBA's guarantee may enable a lender to make a loan where collateral is otherwise inadequate.<dd>The loan term depends on the purpose of the loan. Interest rates are set by the lender within SBA limits. <p><dd>The Virginia Asset Financing Corporation (see address above) will also help a qualified borrower to obtain financing through this program. In certain cases a SBA 7A Loan can be combined with the SBA 504 program (see above) to increase the financing available for a single project.<p><dt><b>OTHER SBA LOAN PROGRAMS</b><p><dd>Space does permit descriptions of other SBA programs to assist small business. The SBA operates loan guarantee programs to assist specific groups. These include:<p><ul><li>small general contractor loan guarantee<li>seasonal line of credit guarantee<li>contract line of credit<li>export revolving line of credit<li>international trade loan program<li>pollution control financing<li>surety bonds for small contractors</ul><p><dd>The SBA operates direct loan programs, when funds are available, for Vietnam-era veterans, disabled veterans and physically handicapped persons.<p><dd>Special provisions govern eligibility for each of these programs. For further information, contact the U.S. Small Business Administration either directly or through the:<p><dl><dd>Small Business Administration, Washington District Office<dd>1111 18th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20036<dd>(202) 634-1500</dl><p><dt><b>SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES (SBIC)</b><p><dd>SBIC's provide equity capital and subordinated loans to small businesses. SBIC's are privately owned and capitalized companies that are licensed and regulated by the U. S. Small Business Administration. SBIC's invest in small businesses according to their own investment criteria.<p><dd>A specialized type of SBIC is the "Section 301(d) SBIC" (often called MESBIC for Minority Enterprise SBIC) which restricts its funding to businesses owned or operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons. Women-owned and Vietnam veteran-owned firms may qualify. A MESBIC can also provide management assistance to companies that it finances.<p><dd>Contact the SBA office identified above for a current list of SBIC's and MESBIC's in the Washington area. Also, see Appendix I for resource information.<p><dt><b>SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM (SBIR)</b><p><dd>The SBIR Program provides grants for research and development in order to stimulate technological innovation in the United States. Under the program, qualified U.S. small businesses propose innovative concepts which will meet the research and development needs of the federal government. Awards are granted through a three-phase evaluation, development and commercialization process. Eleven federal agencies participate in this program. The SBA publishes quarterly a pre-solicitation announcement (PSA) to inform businesses of the SBIR solicitations of the various federal agencies. For more information, contact:<p><dl><dd>Office of Innovation, Research & Technology<dd>Small Business Administration<dd>409 3rd Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20416<dd>(202) 205-7777</dl><p><dt><b>VIRGINIA NEIGHBORHOOD   ASSISTANCE ACT</b><p><dd>The Virginia Neighborhood Assistance Act offers a state income tax credit for businesses which invest in impoverished areas or people of the state. The tax credit equals 50 percent of the amount invested not to exceed $175,000 annually. Investment by a business may take the form of financial assistance, material, labor, job training, counseling, emergency assistance, medical care, and crime reduction activities. To participate in the program, businesses should contact:<p><dl><dd>Neighborhood Assistance Program<dd>Office of Executive Assistance, Department of Social Services<dd>8007 Discovery Drive, Richmond, VA  23229<dd>(804) 281-9204</dl></dl><p>

<title>ROSSLYN</title>
<H1>Rosslyn</h1>

<img src=Rosslyn.gif> Rosslyn is entering its third period of redevelopment.  Until 1960 the area was the site of a motley collection of oil storage tanks, industrial buildings and pawn shops.  With the advent of Arlington's then new site plan process, a wave of intensive redevelopment began resulting in the construction of 27 new office buildings and hotels by 1970.  Rosslyn saw its second development boom in the early 1980's with the construction of such signature buildings as 1525 Wilson, Potomac Tower and the Arland Towers complex, most commonly known as the home of the Freedom Forum and USA Today.<p>

Now in the mid-90's Rosslyn is again on the verge of substantial change.  Although considerable construction and renovation activity will occur as outmoded buildings from Rosslyn's early years are either substantially renovated or redeveloped, the hallmark of this new era will be the creation a more user friendly Rosslyn.  This will occur as streetscape, public art and beautification projects either currently being developed or called for in the County's 1992 Rosslyn Station Area Plan Addendum are completed; with the construction of the Freedom Forum's Newseum; introduction of new retail development which expands Rosslyn's already considerable base of restaurants and shops; and by the architectural quality and sensitive urbanity of Rosslyn's next generation of buildings, as exemplified by the Commonwealth Tower project.  All of these activities will enable Rosslyn to further capitalize upon its strengths which include:<p>

<b>ROSSLYN FACTS AT A GLANCE</b><p>
<ul><li>8 million square feet of office space much of it with unparalleled views at very competitive lease rates
<li>One of the most accessible locations in the region whether by train, plane, bike, car or foot
<li>Close proximity to such National Landmarks as Roosevelt Island and the Iwo Jima Memorial
<li>6,000 housing units within a 10 minute walk of the Metro offering a wide variety of styles and prices
<li>50+ restaurants and 500,000 square feet of retail development including jewelers, grocery stores, furniture and a complete array of business support services</ul>

<title>COURTHOUSE</title><h1>Courthouse</h1><img src="ctplaz2.gif">Convenience, compact development and outstanding views have attracted businesses and residents alike to Courthouse.  Since 1983, eight highrise residential buildings have been constructed in the area along with several new townhouse projects and the renovation of historical Colonial Village.  Nine office buildings have been built during the same period, as has the County's new court house and detention center.  The area is currently home to an estimated 7,500 people and has an employment base of 12,500.  Over the next 15 years, residential growth in Courthouse is projected to exceed 50 percent and employment is expected to increase by 32 percent.<p>Like most of the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, the development pattern in Courthouse is highrise residential and office development around the Metro station with townhomes, garden apartments and single-family residences on the periphery.  The center of the neighborhood is Courthouse Plaza, a joint development between Arlington County and the Charles E. Smith Company.  Surrounding the outdoor plaza's fountains and landscaping are retail, restaurants and an eight-screen movie theater.  The development's office and apartment buildings frame the plaza on the north and south.  On the west end is a hotel site which the county is actively marketing.<p>Long the center of Arlington County government, Courthouse is home the county's administrative offices, its police headquarters and its court system.  It is also home to numerous high-technology businesses and associations, such as Bell Atlantic, SRA, LCC Communications and the Electronic Industries Association.  More information-based companies are expected to move to Courthouse when office development picks up, taking advantage of the area's synergy and the fiber optics running throughout the corridor.<p>The residential population of Courthouse is mostly young, single professionals.  Sixty-seven percent of the people are under 35 years old and 54 percent are single.  The median income is $38,100 and 74 percent of all people live in apartments.  Catering to these demographics are a number of successful retail and restaurant establishments, including Arlington's first brew pub, Bardo Rodeo, and the acclaimed Go! Compact Discs.<p>Filling the niche between the established residential neighborhoods and the new apartment buildings will be new townhouse developments.  Plans have been filed recently for a 126-unit townhome project one block from Metro and more plans may be on the way.<p>Office townhouses may also be on the horizon for Courthouse.  Several companies and associations have expressed interest in smaller buildings that could be built just outside the higher-density core of the area.

<title>BALLSTON</title><H1>Ballston</h1><img src="Blst-loc.gif"> Ballston, a major new real estate submarket in the Washington Metropolitan area, is located in Arlington at the western end of the Orange Line Metro corridor.  Within the central area of Ballston are the highest density mixed-use developments found within Arlington.<p>Since 1985, an impressive amount of office, residential, retail and hotel development has been completed.  With 3.9 million square feet of office development built, Ballston presently maintains a three percent vacancy rate, and its multi-family residential buildings exhibit strong market attraction with an average 85 percent occupancy.  Indeed, the Windsor Plaza luxury condominium project sold out the first phase of development within four months.  Presently under construction in Ballston is the new headquarters building for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (246,639 sq ft), phase two of Windsor Plaza condominiums (92 units), and Ballston Park apartments (145 units).  By late summer of 1994, it is anticipated that the Richmond Square residential project (324 units) will start construction.<p>The success of the Ballston Sector Plan in achieving "Arlington's New Downtown" character is noteworthy.  Today, approximately 54 percent of Ballston's site-plan-approved residential development is completed,  including townhouses, condominiums, and rental units. Fifty-two percent of office development is completed or under construction and 69 percent of retail space has or is being developed.<p>The retail focus of Ballston is the Ballston Common Mall, but other destination retail includes Rio Grande Cafe, Staples and American Service Center.

Ballston's legal firms include Haley, Bader & Potts and Nixon & Vanderhye, P.C.  The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), the Shipbuilders Council of America and the American Anthropological Association are but several of the national associations that are located in Ballston.

Ballston is flanked on the east by George Mason University's Arlington Campus and on the west by Marymount University's school of business.  In addition,  George Mason University's International Institute occupies space in the heart of Ballston.<p>Adding to the livability of Ballston are amenities such as the recently enlarged Arlington Central Library, the seven-acre Quincy Park, jogging and bicycle paths and the to-be-developed Stuart Park.  The Ellipse Art Center, the Ballston Pops/Arlington Symphony, the Arlington Arts Center and the 10,000-square-foot multi-purpose space being provided by NRECA all add to the quality of life in the "new" Ballston.

<title>ROSSLYN</title>
<H1>Rosslyn</h1>

<img src=Rosslyn.gif> Rosslyn is entering its third period of redevelopment.  Until 1960 the area was the site of a motley collection of oil storage tanks, industrial buildings and pawn shops.  With the advent of Arlington's then new site plan process, a wave of intensive redevelopment began resulting in the construction of 27 new office buildings and hotels by 1970.  Rosslyn saw its second development boom in the early 1980's with the construction of such signature buildings as 1525 Wilson, Potomac Tower and the Arland Towers complex, most commonly known as the home of the Freedom Forum and USA Today.<p>

Now in the mid-90's Rosslyn is again on the verge of substantial change.  Although considerable construction and renovation activity will occur as outmoded buildings from Rosslyn's early years are either substantially renovated or redeveloped, the hallmark of this new era will be the creation a more user friendly Rosslyn.  This will occur as streetscape, public art and beautification projects either currently being developed or called for in the County's 1992 Rosslyn Station Area Plan Addendum are completed; with the construction of the Freedom Forum's Newseum; introduction of new retail development which expands Rosslyn's already considerable base of restaurants and shops; and by the architectural quality and sensitive urbanity of Rosslyn's next generation of buildings, as exemplified by the Commonwealth Tower project.  All of these activities will enable Rosslyn to further capitalize upon its strengths which include:<p>

<b>ROSSLYN FACTS AT A GLANCE</b><p>
<ul><li>8 million square feet of office space much of it with unparalleled views at very competitive lease rates
<li>One of the most accessible locations in the region whether by train, plane, bike, car or foot
<li>Close proximity to such National Landmarks as Roosevelt Island and the Iwo Jima Memorial
<li>6,000 housing units within a 10 minute walk of the Metro offering a wide variety of styles and prices
<li>50+ restaurants and 500,000 square feet of retail development including jewelers, grocery stores, furniture and a complete array of business support services</ul>

<title>COURTHOUSE</title><h1>Courthouse</h1><img src="ctplaz2.gif">Convenience, compact development and outstanding views have attracted businesses and residents alike to Courthouse.  Since 1983, eight highrise residential buildings have been constructed in the area along with several new townhouse projects and the renovation of historical Colonial Village.  Nine office buildings have been built during the same period, as has the County's new court house and detention center.  The area is currently home to an estimated 7,500 people and has an employment base of 12,500.  Over the next 15 years, residential growth in Courthouse is projected to exceed 50 percent and employment is expected to increase by 32 percent.<p>Like most of the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, the development pattern in Courthouse is highrise residential and office development around the Metro station with townhomes, garden apartments and single-family residences on the periphery.  The center of the neighborhood is Courthouse Plaza, a joint development between Arlington County and the Charles E. Smith Company.  Surrounding the outdoor plaza's fountains and landscaping are retail, restaurants and an eight-screen movie theater.  The development's office and apartment buildings frame the plaza on the north and south.  On the west end is a hotel site which the county is actively marketing.<p>Long the center of Arlington County government, Courthouse is home the county's administrative offices, its police headquarters and its court system.  It is also home to numerous high-technology businesses and associations, such as Bell Atlantic, SRA, LCC Communications and the Electronic Industries Association.  More information-based companies are expected to move to Courthouse when office development picks up, taking advantage of the area's synergy and the fiber optics running throughout the corridor.<p>The residential population of Courthouse is mostly young, single professionals.  Sixty-seven percent of the people are under 35 years old and 54 percent are single.  The median income is $38,100 and 74 percent of all people live in apartments.  Catering to these demographics are a number of successful retail and restaurant establishments, including Arlington's first brew pub, Bardo Rodeo, and the acclaimed Go! Compact Discs.<p>Filling the niche between the established residential neighborhoods and the new apartment buildings will be new townhouse developments.  Plans have been filed recently for a 126-unit townhome project one block from Metro and more plans may be on the way.<p>Office townhouses may also be on the horizon for Courthouse.  Several companies and associations have expressed interest in smaller buildings that could be built just outside the higher-density core of the area.

The Ellipse Art Center, the Ballston Pops/Arlington Symphony, the Arlington Arts Center and the 10,000-square-foot multi-purpose space being provided by NRECA all add to the quality of life in the "new" Ballston.

<h3 align=center>Steptoe & Johnson <font size=-1>LLP</font><p>Recruiting</h3>
<h2 align=center>Phoenix Office</h2>



 		Steptoe &amp; Johnson<B>
 </B>LLP's office in Phoenix, Arizona is both an integral part of the firm's national practice and the focal point for its expanding local and regional representations in Arizona and the Southwest.  Since opening in January, 1987, the Phoenix office has grown to twenty-five attorneys, and its practice has expanded significantly.<P>

<P>

		The Phoenix office has a broad-based practice, including business transactions, commercial and employment litigation, media and communications law, intellectual property, water rights and environmental law, and real estate development and finance.  Its work extends to other areas in which the firm also has a national reputation, such as government contracts law and sophisticated insurance coverage disputes.  In addition to Arizona matters, Phoenix office attorneys are involved in regional and national cases as well, often working closely with their Washington, DC office colleagues.<P>

<P>

		Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> in Phoenix  is neither a free-standing branch operation nor merely an extension of the firm's original Washington, DC base.  The office manages its own representations and staffing requirements, but also is intimately involved in the work of the firm as a whole.  It is committed to maintaining the informal cooperative working relationships that characterize the Washington, DC office, and in particular promoting familiarity and collegiality between attorneys based in Phoenix and in Washington.<P>

<P>

		Associates joining the firm in Phoenix can expect to deal with a variety of transactional, counseling and litigation matters.  Given the office's relatively small size, associates have the opportunity to work on a wide range of matters and rapidly assume substantial responsibilities.  They have access to the firm's extensive research and in-house training resources, and receive detailed annual evaluations to assist them in understanding their strengths as well as areas that require additional attention.<P>

<P>

		Phoenix summer associates work on a variety of matters involving various aspects of the firm's practice.  We believe it is essential that the summer associate program provide a comprehensive exposure to the work of the firm as a whole and a thorough sense of what it is like to be a Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> attorney.<P>

<P>

		We consider our hiring decisions -- both for associates and for summer associates -- critical to our ability to maintain both the practice and the practice environment to which we are committed.  We consequently seek applicants who have demonstrated excellence in the skills required by the practice of law and who have personal qualities and interests that broaden the firm as a whole.  The goal of the Phoenix office is to continue the firm's hiring of diverse, interesting individuals who are excellent lawyers as well.<P>

<h3 align=center>Steptoe & Johnson <font size=-1>LLP</font><p>Recruiting</h3>
<h2 align=center>International Associates Program</h2>
<CENTER>
<strong>
Introduction</strong><P>

</CENTER><P>

		For many years, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> has had an international associate program that allows an attorney from outside the United States to spend nine to twelve months as an associate of the firm.  The purpose of the program is to assist Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> in the preparation of cases with both international and domestic dimensions; to add to the firm's diversity; and to expose talented foreign lawyers to the practice of law at Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>.  The firm's program so far has included international associates from Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, England, Ethiopia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Scotland, Sri Lanka and Switzerland.<P>

<P>



<CENTER>
<strong>
The International Associate's Role</strong><P>

</CENTER><P>

		During his or her period with the firm, the international associate is expected to perform a wide variety of legal tasks.  Like all associates, the international associate must carry out legal research and prepare drafts of memoranda, opinions, congressional testimony, articles, speeches, and the like.  Some work will be non-billable; most will be done on behalf of the firm's clients.  The international associate's early work is reviewed carefully and discussed with the associate to ease the transition to American legal practice.<P>

<P>

		The substantive legal experience of the international associate is not solely confined to international matters.  Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> believes that its international associates should be exposed to all facets of the typical Washington practice; therefore, they can expect to be involved in a full range of domestic issues.  Although legal research and the preparation of memoranda occupy a significant amount of the associate's schedule,  contact with clients, opposing counsel, government officials and outside experts is encouraged.  Special steps have also been taken to give the international associate exposure to a broad range of lawyers within the firm.<P>

<CENTER>
<STRONG>
Duration of the Program</STRONG><P>

</CENTER><P>

		The international associate program is designed for foreign lawyers who wish to experience American legal practice before returning to their countries of origin.  It is not designed for lawyers seeking a permanent position in the United States.  Accordingly, international associates are not expected to take a U.S. bar examination, and the period of the associateship will be limited to nine to twelve months; extensions of this period will not ordinarily be granted.<P>

<P>



<CENTER>
<STRONG>
Salary</STRONG><P>

</CENTER><P>

		The international associate salary is currently $51,100 a year.  Salaries are adjusted in January of each year.  In many cases, the foreign lawyer may be able to mitigate tax burdens significantly as a result of agreements entered into between the United States and other nations.<P>

<P>


<CENTER>
<strong>
Qualifications</strong><P>

</CENTER><P>

		Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> seeks foreign lawyers of the highest caliber.  Candidates should demonstrate a high level of academic achievement both at home and in the United States.  It is not necessary for candidates to be admitted to the bar of their home countries, but such a qualification will be viewed favorably.  All international associates must hold a law degree (typically an LL.M. or equivalent) from an American law school.  Grades achieved while studying for this degree will play a large role in the selection process.<P>

<P>

		Selection for the program will be carried out on the basis of merit.  A preexisting business or personal relationship with Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> is not a prerequisite.  Some special consideration will be given to candidates from countries that have not yet been represented in the firm's program.<P>

<P>

		Participants in the program must have a United States social security number when they begin work.  The firm is required to provide this number to the Internal Revenue Service for identification purposes when reporting an employee's income, although international associates may frequently pay reduced federal income and state taxes.<P>

<P>



<CENTER>
<STRONG>
Applications</STRONG><P>

</CENTER><P>

		Candidates should send a full personal resume detailing academic and career achievements to Rosemary Kelly Morgan, Director of Recruiting.  The application should include a transcript of grades achieved at the candidate's U.S. law school and the names of two professors at that same school  who can serve as references.  Candidates should also submit a writing sample in English.  The sample should demonstrate the candidate's legal analytical skills in the context of practical problems.  Law review articles or research papers produced over several weeks are helpful.  Class work and examination papers produced under tight deadlines are acceptable but are less likely to show the candidate in the best light.<P>

<P>

		Applications should be submitted by the end of February.  Highly qualified candidates will be selected for interviews in March with the expectation that the international associate program will begin in the fall.<P>

<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/sbw.htm">Legislation Limits Environmental Liability for Lenders and Trustees</a>: One of the last acts of the 104th Congress was to
 limit the environmental liability of lenders and trustees under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
 Liability Act (CERCLA)  (frequently called Superfund).  The changes to the Superfund law are significant because they more clearly
 define the actions that lenders or trustees may undertake without risking CERCLA liability.  Courts have varied in their interpreta- tions of the activities that create CERCLA liability and the amendment provides increased certainty and uniformity.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<H2 align=center><font size=+4>re:</font> IRS Reverses Itself and Allows Deduction of Environmental Clean-Up Related Costs</H2>

<hr>
<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P>
<hr>
<P>

		On January 17, 1996, the Internal Revenue Service revoked a controversial technical advice memorandum (&quot;TAM&quot;) in which it had denied current deductions for certain environmental clean-up related costs.  The Service's action ended a long and contentious process in which the taxpayer, represented by <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/silver.htm">Mark J. Silverman</a> and <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/serling.htm">Susan H. Serling</a> of Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP, disputed the Service's conclusion that such costs were subject to capitalization.  The outcome in this case was a victory for the particular taxpayer involved -- the company will be able to deduct millions of dollars in clean-up costs -- and may also be part of a trend to liberalize the deductibility of environmental clean-up related costs.    <P>

		The TAM involved a company that acquired land and conducted activities on it that caused the land to become contaminated with industrial wastes.  Later, the company contributed the land to a local municipality, which first discovered the contamination.  The gift was rescinded.  The company regained ownership of the land and is responsible for all clean-up related costs.  In the years under review the company deducted the costs of an environmental study mandated by a consent order with the EPA and associated consulting and legal fees (collectively, the &quot;Costs&quot;).   <P>

 		Revenue Ruling 94-38, 1994-1 C.B. 35, allows a current deduction under Code section 162 for soil remediation and groundwater treatment costs (while requiring capitalization of costs attributable to the construction of groundwater treatment facilities, which were determined to be capital expenditures under Code section 263).  However, the Service refused to apply Revenue Ruling 94-38 to the company's situation on the basis that, in the ruling, the taxpayer owned the contaminated property continuously (<U>
i.e.</U>, when the property was contaminated through the time when clean-up costs were incurred).  The Service concluded, in TAM 9541005, dated September 27, 1995, that Revenue Ruling 94-38 was inapplicable solely because of the later-rescinded gift and held that the company's Costs must be capitalized.  <P>

		On January 17, 1996, the Service released to the taxpayer a new TAM that revokes and supersedes TAM 9541005.  The new TAM manifests a significant change in the Service's view of the applicability of Revenue Ruling 94-38.  The Service holds that an interim break in ownership does not disallow a deduction when the same taxpayer contaminated the property and incurred the Costs.  The Service proceeds to determine that the specific Costs at issue are deductible under Code section 162.<P>

<h2 align=center>Arizona turns Brownfields into Greenfields</h2>

<p>The sale and purchase of contaminated land in Arizona will soon become easier as a result of a recently enacted law.  The law (Senate Bill 1410; Chapter 177, Laws of 1996) contains provisions which, if carefully followed, mean that the following persons can <I>avoid</I> environmental cleanup liability:  (1) new purchasers of contaminated property; (2) lenders that hold a security interest in contaminated property; and (3) trustees who manage contaminated property.  When the law becomes effective in July 1996, contaminated property will become more marketable in Arizona.<P>
<P>



<B><font size=+1>THE PROBLEM</font></B>.<P>
The concern about environmental cleanup liability arises from two laws, one federal and one state.  Both the federal Superfund law (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or "CERCLA") and the Arizona Superfund law (the Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund or "WQARF") impose cleanup liability on owners and operators of contaminated property without regard to whether they caused the contamination.  If property is contaminated, the owners and operators of the property must remediate it.  Liability extends to new purchasers of the property, to lenders who acquire possession of the property through default, and even to trustees who manage the property.  This liability has caused the value of even nominally contaminated property to plummet.  The resulting challenge is twofold:  to restore value to such property while still providing for its remediation.<P>
<P>

	
<B><font size=+1>THE FEDERAL SOLUTION</font></B>.
<P>On the national level, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has undertaken a "Brownfields" initiative under which it will issue "comfort letters" to potential buyers of contaminated property (commonly referred to as "Prospective Purchasers") specifying what liability, if any, the purchaser will have with respect to the property.  Under certain circumstances, EPA will even enter into a formal "Prospective Purchaser Agreement" with the new buyer.  Because the Brownfields initiative is relatively new, and because EPA is decentralized into ten administrative regions, obtaining liability clarifications from EPA is not an exact science and requires skill and experience.  The important fact, however, is that EPA has now acknowledged the existence of the problem and that it is both a cause of the problem as well as a vital part of its resolution.<P>
<P>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1>THE STATE SOLUTION</FONT></B><P>
After CERCLA was enacted in 1980, approximately 45 states adopted their own mini-Superfund laws.  Arizona adopted WQARF in 1986.  Within the last few years, however, more than 20 states have also adopted their own "Brownfields" initiatives to fix the glaring problem of having, unwittingly, devalued thousands of commercial and industrial properties.  States that have adopted Brownfields laws include:  Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.  And, in July, Arizona will join the list when Senate Bill 1410 becomes effective.<P>
<P>


<B><font size=+1>THE ARIZONA SOLUTION</font></B><P>
Senate Bill 1410 contains liability relief for three separate categories of persons: <P>
(1) prospective purchasers of contaminated property; (2) lenders that hold a security interest in contaminated property; and (3) trustees who manage contaminated property.  The primary focus of this article is on how SB 1410 affects prospective purchasers of contaminated property.<P>
<P>


<B><font size=+1>PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER LIABILITY; PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER AGREEMENTS</font></B><P>
A purchaser of contaminated property bargains for whatever information, representations, warranties and indemnifications it can obtain from the seller.  Sometimes, however, a seller will provide only information about its property and will require, without any further inducement (such as representations, warranties and indemnifications), that the purchaser do its own due diligence and use its own judgment as to whether to buy the property.  This is a matter of negotiation between the buyer and seller and differs from case to case.<P>
<P>

Under SB 1410, however, the buyer may obtain the following <I>written</I> protections from the <I>State of Arizona</I> against liability arising out of the ownership of contaminated property:<P>
<P>
<ul type=disk>
<li>	a release from the state so that the purchaser is not liable to the state for cleanup of the property;<P>
<P>
<li>	a covenant-not-to-sue from the state so that the state cannot sue the buyer for cleanup of the property; and <P>
<P>
<li>	a grant of immunity (i.e., "contribution protection") from the state so that third parties cannot sue the purchaser for cleanup of any hazardous substances on the property as of the date of closing.<P>
<P>
</ul>
To obtain the foregoing protections, a buyer must negotiate a <I>written</I> Prospective Purchaser Agreement ("PPA") with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality ("ADEQ") <I>before</I> purchasing the property.  Senate Bill 1410 provides that <I>all</I> of the following conditions must be met before ADEQ can enter into a PPA:<P>
<P>
<ul type=disk>
<li>	The facility must either be identified on the WQARF priority list maintained by ADEQ <I>or</I> ADEQ must be provided sufficient information to reasonably identify the extent of contamination at the facility.<P>
<P>
<li>	The prospective purchaser cannot be actually liable for the contamination at the facility.<P>
<P>
<li>	The proposed redevelopment or reuse of the facility <I>must not:</I>  (a) contribute to or exacerbate existing known contamination; (b) unreasonably interfere with remedial measures necessary at the facility; or (c) cause the contamination to present a substantial health risk to the public.<P>
<P>
<li>	The PPA must provide a substantial public benefit.  [See discussion below about what constitutes a "substantial public benefit."]<P>
<P>
<li>	The department must consult with local planning and zoning authorities with jurisdiction over the facility and consider reasonably anticipated future land uses at the facility and surrounding properties.<P>
<P>
<li>	The prospective purchaser cannot be associated, through any familial relationship or any corporate or contractual relationship other than a contract to protect a security interest, with a person who is responsible for contamination on the property.<P>
<P>
</ul>
In addition to the foregoing, SB 1410 requires that a PPA must include all provisions "deemed necessary" by ADEQ such as the following:<P>
<P>
<ul type=disk>
<li>	The prospective purchaser must represent that it did not cause or contribute to the contamination on the property.<P>
<P>
<li>	If the prospective purchaser does not undertake remedial action, it must agree that it will not exacerbate or contribute to the existing contamination or create additional contamination by an act or omission.<P>
 <P>
<li>	The prospective purchaser must agree that any activity that it will conduct or direct on the contaminated property will not unreasonably interfere with any ongoing remedial actions that are being performed by a responsible party or ADEQ, and that the purchaser will cooperate with those activities.<P>
<P>
<li>	The prospective purchaser must agree to undertake measures that constitute a substantial public benefit.  A substantial public benefit is defined as including, but is not necessarily limited to, <I>any of</I> the following:  (a) an agreement by the prospective purchaser to provide substantial funding or other resources to perform or facilitate remedial measures at the facility; (b) an agreement by the prospective purchaser to perform substantial remedial measures at the facility; (c) <I>productive reuse of a vacant or abandoned industrial or commercial facility</I>; (d) development of a facility by a governmental entity or nonprofit organization to address an important public purpose; <I>or </I>(e) creation of conservation or recreation areas.<P>
<P>
<li>	If the prospective purchaser is to perform remedial measures under the PPA, it must agree to perform those measures in compliance with applicable statutes and rules under ADEQ's supervision.<P>
<P>
<li>	Unless the contamination was caused by the state, the prospective purchaser must waive any claim or cause of action against the state that arises from contamination that exists as of the date of purchase.<P>
<P>
<li>	The prospective purchaser must grant an easement to ADEQ and its authorized representatives for purposes of ensuring compliance with the agreement or for remedial measures in connection with contamination at the facility as of the date of purchase.<P>
<P>
<li>	ADEQ and the prospective purchase will reserve their rights as to any person who is not a party to the PPA.<P>
<P>
</ul>
If the purchaser fails to perform any of its PPA obligations, ADEQ may void the agreement.  In addition to the foregoing, the state may, as a condition of entering into a PPA, impose a lien on property on which it has conducted a remedial action for which it has not been reimbursed.<P>
<P>
Another significant benefit of the new law is that a landowner may assign a PPA by providing written notice to ADEQ of any sale, assignment or other transfer of the property at least fifteen (15) business days before the date of any transfer.  On assignment, the assignee assumes the obligations and the benefits of the PPA.  And unless the assignor has breached the agreement, it will retain the benefits conferred by the PPA.<P>
<P>
<B><font size=+1>LENDER LIABILITY</font></B>.<P>
Senate Bill 1410 also provides relief to lenders that hold a security interest in contaminated property.  Under the new law, holding a security interest does not, by itself, make the lender liable for cleaning up the property<I>
provided that</I> the lender does not participate in the management of the property and does not cause, contribute to or aggravate the contamination through intentional misconduct or gross negligence.  The lender can lose its exemption from liability, however, by failing to take certain actions spelled out in SB 1410.<p>
<P>

<B><font size=+1>TRUSTEE LIABILITY</font></B>.<P>
Senate Bill 1410 also provides that a trustee, as specifically defined in the bill, is not itself liable for cleanup costs. The immunity does not preclude claims against the trust assets themselves, and the trustee can lose its immunity <I>if:</I>  (a) the trustee, itself, actually caused the contamination; (b) the trustee, through intentional misconduct or gross negligence, aggravates or contributes to the contamination or permits others to do so; or (c) the trustee's appointment is for the purpose of avoiding liability.  With respect to the last exemption, it is <I>prima facie</I> evidence that a fiduciary was appointed to avoid liability if the facility is the only substantial asset in the fiduciary estate.  A person cannot qualify for the exemption from environmental liability if the person is both the grantor and the fiduciary of the same estate.<P>
<P>

<B><font size=+1>THE NET RESULT</font></B>.<P>
Environmental liability laws pose a severe economic threat to those who are involved with contaminated property, and the issues surrounding such liability are as complex, confusing and contentious as ever.  Regardless, the time has never been better to sell, buy, manage or finance such property.  A party can now determine <I>before</I> a decision is made to purchase a property exactly what remedial action, if any, will be required <I>and</I>, in addition, whether a particular state (or, in certain circumstances, EPA) will agree in writing that the new owner will not have any liability for such remediation.  Further, as a result of clearer liability provisions, it should become easier to finance and manage activities on contaminated property. q <P>

<p><center>March 15, 1996</center>
<P>

<h2 align=center>New EPA Audit and Disclosure Policy</h2>

<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has implemented a new "Policy on Discovery, Disclosure, Correction and Prevention of  Violations" effective January 22, 1996.  While restating the EPA's long-standing opposition to an evidentiary privilege for information generated by environmental audits, the policy creates new incentives for use of audits and voluntary disclosure of violations, particularly by companies concerned about a risk of criminal prosecution.<P>



<B><font size=+1>BACKGROUND</font></B>.  The new EPA policy recognizes that overly stringent enforcement against companies that report their own violations may actually discourage compliance with environmental regulations.  While companies frequently have no practical alternative to reporting a <I>
known</I> incident of noncompliance, they may decline to conduct voluntary audits that might reveal <I>
unknown</I> violations.<P>

	Industry has worked to eliminate such disincentives to voluntary reporting.  Numerous states have enacted statutes recognizing an evidentiary privilege for environmental audits.  Congress and several other states are currently considering audit legislation. The Arizona legislature is considering a bill that would provide a privilege against prosecution to those who conduct self-audits.  Governor Symington vetoed similar legislation last year, but he and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality back this session's version.  <P>

	The EPA has consistently opposed legislation creating either an evidentiary audit privilege or formal immunity for violators who voluntarily report.  The agency's new policy, published at 60 Federal Register 66,706 (Dec. 22, 1995), reflects significant improvement of its position after extensive public comment.<P>



<B><font size=+1>INCENTIVES FOR DISCLOSURE</font></B>.  Qualifying organizations are eligible for several benefits under the new EPA policy.  First, the policy fully eliminates "gravity-based" penalties if the organization detected the violation through a formal environmental "audit" or an "objective, documented systematic practice or procedure" reflecting "due diligence" by the company.  The penalties are reduced 75 percent if the violation was detected by less exacting means that otherwise satisfy the policy's conditions.  The EPA reserves the right, however, to collect a fine in the amount of any economic benefit that the organization may have realized by noncompliance.<P>

	Second, the EPA commits not to recommend criminal prosecution of an organization that uncovers violations through an audit or due diligence, promptly discloses and expeditiously corrects those violations, and meets all other conditions of the EPA policy.<P>

	Third, the EPA commits not to request production of audit results, absent independent knowledge of a violation.<P>

	<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>QUALIFYING FOR BENEFIT</FONT></B>S.  The EPA imposes a number of conditions on such benefits, including the following:<P>

  &#149;  The violation must be discovered through an "audit" or "due diligence," rather than through spontaneous employee confessions or other fortuities; <P>

  &#149;  The discovery of the violation must be "voluntary," and not the result of routine monitoring of emissions (as required in most NPDES permits) or an audit mandated under a prior consent order or settlement agreement;<P>

  &#149;  The violation must be disclosed promptly, i.e., no later than <I>
10 days</I> after the company "discovered" it;<P>

  &#149;  Discovery and disclosure must be independent of any government or third-party action, and not an attempt to ward off imminent government action;<P>

  &#149;  The company must promptly correct the violation;<P>

  &#149;  The violation must not have resulted in "serious actual harm" to human health or the environment; and <P>

  &#149;  The company must cooperate fully with any subsequent EPA investigation. <P>

<P>

<B><font size=+1>CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS</font></B>.  The policy's benefits must be viewed in light of its limitations.  First, as the policy states, it "is intended as guidance," and does not legally bind the EPA.<P>

	The EPA's policy also does not bind the Department of Justice.  Although the EPA states that it will not refer qualifying cases to the DOJ for criminal prosecution, other agencies involved in environmental enforcement (including the FBI) may do so.  Moreover, the DOJ ultimately decides whether to file criminal charges, and it has published its own set of nonbinding and considerably less specific prosecutorial guidelines in this area.<P>

	In addition, the EPA policy applies only to the regulated "entity," not its employees.  Under the policy's "cooperation" condition, an entity seeking to qualify probably will be required to provide prosecutors with any available information regarding individuals.<P>

	The new policy also does not apply to cases resulting in "serious" harm.  Thus, companies suffering true environmental disasters (like the grounding of the <I>
Exxon Valdez</I>) will find no safe harbor.<P>

	Finally, the EPA policy applies primarily to reports generated by audits or due diligence.  A company that voluntarily reports violations detected by pure serendipity, anonymous reports, or similar means should not expect to benefit from the new policy.<P>

	<P>

<B><font size=+1>CONCLUSION</font></B>.  The new EPA policy will not fundamentally alter the balance of factors that a company should weigh in deciding whether to report a violation <I>
once knowledge of the violation exists</I>.  The new policy is so heavily qualified and vulnerable to subjective interpretation that few companies should report solely because of the policy.  <P>

	In fact, most companies <I>
already</I> have overwhelming incentives to report violations once known.  If a violation is subject to mandatory reporting requirements, such as those found in CERCLA and most permits, failure to report is itself a crime.  Moreover, under the federal sentencing guidelines, a company that elects not to report voluntarily may receive a stiffer sentence or probation.  Regardless of the guidelines, lenient treatment is unlikely if regulators detect the violation after the company chooses not to report it.  Finally, many companies consider voluntary reporting a necessary part of being a "good corporate citizen."<P>

	In certain cases, the new EPA policy may give a company comfort that it may conduct voluntary auditing or due diligence to acquire knowledge regarding a potential violation without exposing itself to an unnecessarily high risk of criminal prosecution.  Much will depend, however, on the EPA's actual practices in implementing its new policy. <P>

<hr>
<P><center>March 25, 1996</center>

<P>On March 19, 1996, as part of its budget proposal to Congress, the Administration proposed an amendment to the rules governing tax-free spinoffs that would largely eliminate so-called <I>
Morris Trust</I> spinoffs.  The Administration also proposed an amendment aimed, in part, at eliminating the disappearing basis problem that may arise in certain section 304 transactions.  <P>

<P>

<B>
MORRIS TRUST ELIMINATED.  </B>The <I>
Morris Trust</I> structure is generally used when an acquiring corporation seeks to acquire some but not all of a target corporation's business assets in a tax-free acquisition.  To facilitate the acquisition, the target corporation transfers the unwanted assets to a newly formed subsidiary and then distributes the stock of the controlled corporation to the target corporation's shareholders in a tax-free spinoff.  The target corporation continues to hold the assets wanted by the acquiring corporation and, immediately after the spinoff, either is merged into the acquiring corporation, or has its shareholders exchange their target corporation stock for stock of the acquiring corporation.  Since the repeal of the <I>
General Utilities</I> doctrine in 1986, the<I>
 Morris Trust</I> transaction has been one of the few ways in which a corporation can dispose of unwanted assets without imposition of corporate-level tax.<P>

	Under current law, there is no requirement that its shareholders remain in control of the target corporation after the spinoff.  <U>
See</U> <U>
Morris Trust v. Commissioner</U>, 367 F.2d 794 (4th Cir. 1966); Revenue Ruling 68-603, 1968-2 C.B. 148.  The Administration proposal targets <I>
Morris Trust</I> transactions by requiring a distributing corporation (the target) (but not its shareholders) to recognize gain in a spinoff if the distributing corporation's shareholders (as a group) do not hold a <U>
50 percent</U> interest in <U>
both</U> the distributing and controlled corporations for the two-year period preceding, and the two-year period following, the distribution.  Thus, the proposal precludes tax-free <I>
Morris Trust</I> transactions where the subsequent acquisition results in a loss of control of the target corporation by its historic shareholders.  <U>
The proposal generally would be effective for distributions after March 19, 1996</U>.<P>

<B>
REVENUE RULING 70-496 OVERRULED.</B> Under section 304, the sale of a subsidiary between nonconsolidated affiliated corporations will be treated as a redemption, and may be taxed as a dividend.  For example, assume <I>
P</I> directly owns two subsidiaries, <I>
S1</I> and <I>
S2</I>, and <I>
S1</I> owns all of the stock of <I>
X.  </I>If<I>
 S1 </I>sells all of<I>
 </I>the<I>
 X </I>stock to <I>
S2</I>, <I>
S1</I> will be deemed to have contributed the stock of </A><I>
X</I> to the capital of <I>
S2 </I>and <I>
S1</I> will be deemed to have received the proceeds of the sale in redemption of stock in <I>
S2</I>.  The proceeds will be taxed to <I>
S1</I> as a dividend to the extent of the earnings and profits of <I>
S2</I> and <I>
X</I> .  However, because <I>
S1</I> actually owns no stock in <I>
S2</I>, the I.R.S. has ruled that <I>
S1</I>'s basis in the <I>
X</I> stock disappears.  <U>
See</U> Revenue Ruling 70-496, 1970-2 C.B. 74.  Thus, if the amount of the distribution exceeds the earnings and profits of <I>
S2 </I>and <I>
X,</I> the excess<I>
 </I>will be taxed at capital gains rates, since basis recovery under section 301(c)(2) is unavailable.  <U>
See</U> section 301(c)(3).  <P>

	Arguably, however, if <I>
S1</I> actually owned even one share of <I>
S2 </I>stock,<I>
 S1</I>'s basis in the <I>
X</I> stock would be added to the one share of <I>
S2</I> stock owned by S1.  <U>
See</U> Revenue Ruling 71-527, 1971-2 C.B. 174.  As a result, section 301(c)(2) would apply to the extent the distribution exceeded available earnings and profits, and <I>
S1</I>'s excess basis, if any, in the <I>
S2</I> stock would remain with the <I>
S2</I> stock.<P>

	Under the Administration proposal, such a section 304 transaction will be treated as a contribution by <I>
S1</I> of the <I>
X</I> stock to the capital of <I>
S2</I> in exchange for <I>
S2</I> stock, followed immediately by a redemption of that <I>
S2</I> stock.  Therefore, <I>
S1</I>'s basis in the <I>
X</I> stock will be reflected in the hypothetical share of <I>
S2</I> stock it is deemed to receive.  In contrast to Revenue Ruling 70-496, <I>
S1</I>'s basis in the <I>
X</I> stock will not disappear, but instead will be reflected in <I>
S1</I>'s share of <I>
S2</I> stock.  To the extent the distribution exceeded available earnings and profits, <I>
S1</I>'s basis in the <I>
S2</I> stock will be recovered.  <U>
See</U> section 301(c)(2).  <I>
S1</I>'s excess basis, if any, in the <I>
S2</I> stock should attach to <I>
S2</I> stock owned by <I>
P</I>.  <U>
See</U> Reg. &#167;1.302-2(c), Example (2).  However, to the extent <I>
S1</I> receives a dividends-received deduction on the deemed distribution from <I>
S2</I>, the Administration proposal appears to require <I>
S1</I> to reduce its basis in the <I>
S2</I> stock under sections 1059(a) and (e)(1).<P>

<P>

<B>
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROPOSALS. </B>The Administration also proposed a number of other significant changes, including (i) requiring taxpayers to determine their basis in substantially identical securities by averaging their basis in all such securities, (ii) amending the extraordinary dividend rules of section 1059 to target the use of options by corporate shareholders to obtain dividend treatment for certain non-pro rata distributions, and (iii) treating transactions designed to reduce the risk of loss on stock as dispositions of such stock in many circumstances (commonly referred to as the &quot;short sales against the box&quot; proposal).  <P>

<H1><B>Legislation Limits Environmental Liability for Lenders and Trustees</B></H1>

<P>		One of the last acts of the 104th Congress was to limit the environmental liability of lenders and trustees
 under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)  (frequently called Superfund).  
The changes to the Superfund law are significant because they more clearly define the actions that lenders or trustees may
 undertake without risking CERCLA liability.  Courts have varied in their interpretations of the activities that create CERCLA liability
 and the amendment provides increased certainty and uniformity.    
<H4>
<P>Lender Liability Limited</H4>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<P>		The definition of owner or operator under CERCLA now explicitly excludes &quot;a person that is a lender
 that, without participating in the management of a vessel or facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect the security
 interest of the person in the vessel or facility.&quot;  &quot;Participation in management&quot; has been defined to specifically
 exclude merely having the capacity to influence or the unexercised right to control.  This is significant because some courts
 previously held that having the right to exercise control was sufficient to create liability, even if the lender never exercised that
 control.
<P>Several other activities also are specifically excluded from the term &quot;participation in management.&quot;
  These include: inspecting the facility and providing financial or other advice in an effort to avoid default or a decrease in
 the value of the facility.  
<P>		In addition,  the law now specifically provides that a lender that has not participated in the management
 of a facility prior to foreclosure is not liable as an owner or operator after foreclosure where the lender maintains business activities
, winds up operations, or takes other measures to preserve or protect the facility.  However, the lender must attempt to divest the
 facility at the &quot;earliest practicable, commercially reasonable time, on commercially reasonable terms, taking into accoun
t market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements.&quot;    
<P>  
<P>		Under the new provision, a lender is considered to participate in manage- ment if, while the borrowe
r is still in possession, the lender exercises 
decision-making control over environmental compliance by the facility.  Such control is defined to include day-to-day dec
ision-making on environmental compliance, or substantial control over the operational, as opposed to financial and administrative, functions of the facility.  In summary, this recent amendment to CERCLA now provides guidance on how a lender can advise a borrower without risking CERCLA liability.
<H4>
<P>Trustee Liability Also Limited </H4>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<P>		The amendment also provides that fiduciaries will not be personally liable for the release
 or threatened release of a hazardous substance, by limiting the liability to the assets held in the fiducia
ry capacity.  However, the limitation does not apply if a fiduciary is liable under CERCLA, independent of its fid
uciary responsibilities.  Moreover, the limita- tion does not apply  if the release or threatened release of hazard
ous sub- stances is caused by the negligence of the fiduciary.
<P> 
<P>		The amendment also defines the term &quot;fiduciary&quot; and includes in the definition executor, adm
inistrator, receiver, and conservator.  Lenders are specifically excluded from the definition.
  The definition also excludes any party acting as a fiduciary for an estate organized for the primary purpose of actively car
rying out a trade or business.
<P>
<P>		Certain safe harbors have been created for fiduciaries, similar to those created for lenders.  For e
xample,  a fiduciary may inspect a facility and provide counseling or financial advice without incurring personal liability.
<P>
<P>		If you have questions about the impact of the amendments, please contact Sara Beth Wat
son at (202)429-6460 (e-mail address:  <a href="mailto:swatson@steptoe.com">swatson@steptoe.com</A>) or the attorney

<Center><H3>INTERNET TELEPHONY</H3><P></P> 
Alfred M. Mamlet</Center><P></P>

<H4>INTRODUCTION</H4><P></P>
		This paper provides an introduction to some of the basic technological, economic,
 regulatory and policy considerations related to Internet telephony.  In the interests of brevity and 
reaching a general audience, some of these topics are necessarily over-simplified.<P></P>

		Estimates of the penetration of Internet voice software exceed 1 million copies
 in the United States as of mid-1996.  Most of this software has been bundled with other products such
 as Internet browser software and modems.<P></P>

		This paper begins by providing elementary background on the technological 
(Part 2), economic (Part 3) and regulatory (Part 4) considerations behind Internet telephony.  The 
paper then analyzes the petition filed by America Carriers Telecommunications Association ("ACTA") 
at the FCC in March 1996 (Part 5).  The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some of the Internet 
interconnection fees issues which pose a much bigger challenge to the Internet than the ACTA Petition 
(Part 6).  Finally, nascent international issues are examined (Part 7).<P></P>

<H4>TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS</H4><P></P>

	<H4>Traditional Voice Telephone Technology</H4><P></P>

		Traditional voice service on the public switched telephone network ("PSTN")
 relies on circuit-switching.  The network devotes a dedicated circuit for each conversation.  A long 
silence on a call between an awkward teenage boy asking a girl for a date consumes the same
 capacity as the intense negotiations between two attorneys.  <P></P>

<H4>Internet Voice Technology</H4><P></P>

<H4>Internet Voice Technology Today</H4><P></P>

		While traditional voice technology employs circuit-switching, all Internet
 transmissions, including data, voice and video use packet-switching.   To use the Internet for a 
voice conversation today, a typical "dial-up" Internet user speaks into a microphone connected to 
a personal computer that is equipped with a sound card.  Software and the sound card first convert
 the voice wave to an analog signal.  Next, additional software converts the analog signal to a digital
 form and then compresses the signal to reduce the necessary bandwidth.  <P></P>

		The Internet breaks all data (including voice and video) into packets, and uses
 routers (computers) to direct the path of the packets on the network. The individual packets of the
 message may be sent over different routes.  This routing technology allows many different messages
 to be sent over the same line, permitting efficient sharing of the same fixed costs.  At the receiving
 end of the call, the packets are reassembled in the original order.  When the call comes over the phone
line and through the PC the initial process is reversed, sending the call through the modem, sound card 
and out the speaker.<P></P>

		The voice quality depends on a number of factors.  If the network is congested, 
some of the packets in the telephone message may be delayed or lost ("dropped"), reducing the 
quality of the call.  Early Internet voice software operated only at half-duplex, which permits only
 one party to talk at a time.  More recently, some software offer full duplex operation, allowing both
 parties to talk simultaneously and reducing delay.<P></P>

		A major limiting factor of Internet telephony has been the requirement that both
 users be online at a prearranged time in order to initiate and receive a call.  This technical obstacle
 may also be eliminated shortly.  Vocaltec has recently unveiled a new product, called the Internet
 Phone Telephony Gateway that reportedly will automatically switch calls from the Internet to the 
traditional public switched telephone network by linking Internet calls to and from local exchange 
networks.  International Discount Telecommunications has also announced a similar product.<P></P>

<H4>Internet Voice Technology Tomorrow</H4><P></P>

		Greater bandwidth, as well as software and hardware innovations will increase
 the quality of Internet telephony.  The above description was for the typical "dial-up" user constrained 
by the local telephone company copper wire network.  Users with access to increased bandwidth
 through an ISDN line, high speed leased line connection or cable modem should have increased
 Internet telephony quality.<P></P>

		A number of companies, including Netscape, Microsoft, AT&T, Sprint, MCI, IBM
 and Intel are working on a variety of innovative products, standards and technologies to enhance the
 delivery of voice and video services over the Internet. The potential for using the Internet for voice 
communications was reportedly a driving factor in the recent $2 billion acquisition of UUNet  by
 MFS Communications.<P></P>

		One potentially promising developing technology is Multicast Backbone
 ("MBONE").  The MBONE is a virtual network that is layered on top of part of the Internet.  It may
 eventually provide Internet telephony comparable to the voice quality on the PSTN.  The MBONE
 also allows live audio and video transmission to be multicast to numerous destinations simultaneously
, permitting videoconferencing, distance learning and "personal broadcasting."  Today, the MBONE
 reportedly operates on about 1700 networks in 20 countries.  It can transmit video at about 3 frame
 per second (TV is 30 frames per second).  Video connections to the MBONE require a minimum
 connection of 128 Kbps (equivalent to a dual channel ISDN line), but a T-1 link is highly desirable. 
 Audio connections require less bandwidth.<P></P>

<H4>ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</H4><P></P>

		Internet voice telephony has two potential cost advantages over traditional PSTN
 services.  First, packet-switching is inherently less expensive than circuit-switching.  Second, and
 more significantly, traditional interexchange and international voice traffic carry a number of
 interconnection charges that are not normally placed on Internet services in the United States.<P></P>
Potential Cost Advantages Of Internet Voice Services<P></P>

		Packet-switching is inherently less expensive than circuit-switching because it
 provides a more efficient method of transmitting calls.  As discussed above, conventional telephone
 service requires a dedicated end-to-end connection.  This connection dedicates more capacity than
 necessary for the call on an exclusive basis.  In contrast, the Internet message is split into packets to
 enable each circuit to be filled to capacity.  <P></P>

		This technological difference means that the circuit-switching PSTN
 uses a lot of lines (for dedicated connections) and economize on switching and routing.  The
 Internet uses a lot of switches (computers) and economizes on lines.<P></P>

		The original design of the PSTN provided significant efficiencies when
 lines were relatively cheap compared to switches.  However, the cost of switches (computers)
 has fallen much faster than the cost of lines.  As a result, the Internet is a highly efficient network 
and enjoys some potential comparative advantages over the PSTN for some services.  <P></P>

		In addition, the Internet offers further efficiencies because it compresses data,
 and uses bulk lines.  While both techniques are employed in the PSTN, they are not as prevalent.<P></P>

		These efficiencies must be placed in the proper perspective.  The marginal
 transmission cost of an incremental Internet telephone call has been estimated to be well under $.01
 per minute.  However, most estimates of the incremental transmission cost for a traditional U.S.
 coast-to-coast voice call range from $.01-$.02 per minute.  In addition, most long distance carriers
 incur marketing, billing and collection, and some fixed switching costs not paid by ISPs.<P></P>

		However, the principal, and substantial, incremental cost differences are 
attributable to regulatorily imposed interconnection costs and universal service contributions in
 PSTN service, most of which are avoided by Internet telephony.  <P></P>

<H4>Potential Regulatory Advantages Of Internet Voice Services</H4><P></P>

<H4>Local Access Charges</H4><P></P>

		Today, U.S. long distance carriers pay local access fees on both the originating
 and terminating end of a long distance call that range from approximately $.03-$.07 per minute on 
each end (or $.06-$.14 in total).  These interconnection fees are generally regarded as well above the
 incremental cost of the interconnection.  The fees are used to pay for development of the local
 telephone network.  They effectively subsidize users who do not make many (or any) long distance
 calls.  <P></P>

		Ever since the modern access charge regime was established in 1983, there 
has been a "temporary" exemption for enhanced services, including Internet services.  This exemption
 is analyzed below.  Since local access fees consume between 40% and 50% of long distance carrier
 revenues, this exemption provides a powerful price incentive to use Internet voice services, which have
 been presumed by most to be enhanced services (this presumption is also analyzed below).  <P></P>

		Entry of new companies into the local telephone market and new FCC rulemakings
 regarding interconnections, universal service and access charge reform may lead to significant
 reductions in access charges.  In addition, as discussed below, the Commission's upcoming
 rulemaking on access charge reform will provide another vehicle for considering the differential 
regulatory treatment of traditional and Internet voice services.  <P></P>

<H4>Universal Service</H4> <P></P>

		In addition to the implicit subsidies in above-cost access charges, traditional
 long distance carriers pay explicit subsidies for universal service that are currently based on the
 number of their subscribers.  The FCC is actively considering changing its methodology for assessing
 contributions to universal service, although it is unlikely to assess Internet Service Providers ("ISPs").<P></P>

<H4>International Accounting Rates</H4><P></P>

<H4>The International Accounting Rate System For Voice Traffic</H4><P></P>

		Traditional voice traffic relies on the "accounting rate system" to price the
 interconnections of most international calls.  This is best illustrated by an example.  AT&T and
 British Telephone ("BT") have negotiated an accounting rate for calls on the U.S.-U.K. route.  
If the accounting rate is $1.00 per minute, then the carriers will normally pay half that amount
 ($.50 per minute) as the settlement rate.  If an American in Orlando, Florida calls a person in
 London for ten minutes, then AT&T will pay BT $5.00 for that call.  In theory, these payments
 compensate BT for the costs of:  (1) providing half of the trans-Atlantic cable circuit used;
 and (2) terminating the call on its local London network.  In practice, these payments normally 
exceed the costs incurred.<P></P>

		Many more calls are billed in the United States, with settlement payments made
 to foreign carriers, than vice-versa for three reasons.  First, U.S. consumers and businesses are
 generally wealthier than their foreign counterparts.  Second, U.S. co<P></P>

		The FCC and many U.S. carriers contend that the settlement rates are well
 above the cost of providing these services.  They are looking for ways to reduce this
 telecommunications trade deficit.  Many foreign governments and foreign carriers maintain
 that these rates are necessary to support construction and improvement of the local telephone
 networks in their countries.<P></P>

<H4>Internet Voice Services Offer A Potential Mechanism To Bypass The International Accounting Rate
 System</H4><P></P>

		Today, one of the leading attractions of Internet voice services is the opportunity
 to bypass the settlement costs in the international accounting rate system.  This is one of the
 objections raised by ACTA, and others.<P></P>

		As part of its efforts to encourage lower accounting rates, the FCC has
 expressed a hope that new technologies may increase the downward pressure on accounting rates:

<UL>
<LI>new technologies offer new and improved forms of communication and should thus be encouraged.
  Development of these technologies would be advanced by a new, more flexible regulatory framework
 providing greater economic incentive to invest in and use the infrastructure necessary to support
 these technological innovations.  Such a framework should be able to accommodate fundamentally
 different ways of organizing the supply and pricing of services."<P></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>		Internet telephony is potentially one such technology that the FCC may
 hope will increase pressure on foreign carriers to reduce their international accounting rates.
 Of course, many foreign governments and foreign carriers will not share any FCC enthusiasm
 for bypass of the international accounting system.<P></P>
</UL>

<H4>Internet Interconnections</H4><P></P>

		On the Internet, interconnection arrangements are largely unregulated.
  In the absence of regulation, the various Internet networks have essentially agreed that they will 
exchange traffic on a "no-charge" basis.  This "bill-and-keep" practice has worked because traffic
 flows have been perceived as relatively symmetrical, and because marginal transport costs are
 viewed as close to zero if there is sufficient capacity.<P></P>

<H4>Internet Pricing</H4><P></P>

		Unburdened with interconnection charges imposed by regulation or economics,
 most U.S. interconnection prices are flat capacity-based access fees.  Typical U.S. "dial-up" access
 users pay flat monthly Internet access fees.  This pricing mechanism has contributed significantly to
 the growth in the Internet's popularity.  And, along with the developing capability to transmit voice and
 video messages, this pricing leads to network congestion.  <P></P>

		U.S. end-users with leased lines and Internet Service Providers ("ISPs")
 generally pay a flat fee for unlimited throughput for their connection (e.g., 56k, T1, T3).  Internet
 users in some other countries pay metered prices based on their usage.<P></P>

<H4>Regulatory Background</H4><P></P>

<H4>Regulatory Jurisdiction</H4><P></P>

		There can be no real dispute that the Commission has jurisdiction over
 Internet communications because its authority encompasses all "interstate and foreign commerce
 in communication by wire and radio. . . ."  <P></P>

		However, ever since the Commission's 1980 Computer II decision, 
the FCC has forborne from imposing common carrier regulation on enhanced services. 
 The central rationale for not regulating the enhanced services market was that it did not have the
 concentrated market structure which justified economic regulation of traditional telephone services.
<P></P>

Under Section 64.702 of the Commission's Rules:<P></P>


<UL>
<LI>the term enhanced service shall refer to services, offered over common carrier transmission
 facilities used in interstate communications, which [1] employ computer processing applications
 that act on the format, content, code, protocol or similar aspects of the subscriber's transmitted
 information; [2] provide the subscriber additional, different, or restructured information; or [3] involve
 subscriber interaction with stored information.<P></P>
</UL>

		Internet data clearly meet this test.  First, computer processing is normally
 used to add packet header information and perform other functions.  Second, the Internet frequently 
provides the subscriber with "additional, different or restructured information.  Third, the Internet often
 "involve[s] subscriber interaction with stored information."<P></P>

		Application of this test to Internet telephony is less clear.  First, the voice
 wave is transmitted from end-to-end without change in content.  Second, the Internet telephony
 user does not receive any "additional, different, or restructured information.  Third,  the subscriber
 may not interact with stored information.   While some Internet telephony may be subject to minor
 store-forward procedures while the voice data temporarily resides on a server, developers of
 advanced Internet telephony applications claim to provide "real-time" communications and 
seamless computer-to-telephone services.<P></P>

<H4>Access Charge Regulation.</H4><P></P>

		In 1983, when the Commission established the modern access fee structure,
 the FCC created "temporary exemptions" for enhanced services to avoid "huge increases in their
 costs of operation which could affect their viability".   In 1988, the Commission proposed repealing
 the exemption.  However, the proposal was met with loud concerns about  ACTA INTERNET VOICE 
proceeding.<P></P>

<H4>ACTA's Petition</H4><P></P>

		In March 1996, ACTA, a trade association comprised mostly of long distance
 resellers, filed a Petition for Rulemaking (and a request for additional relief) with the FCC.  ACTA's
 Petition asked the FCC to:  (1) declare that the FCC has authority over the Internet; (2) institute a
 rulemaking for regulating the Internet; and (3) "immediately order" all software providers to stop
 providing software for Internet voice services until they file tariffs and receive FCC authorizations. 
</P></P>

		In its subsequent Comments, ACTA broadened its target from software publishers
 to include Internet Service Providers ("ISPs"), such as PSI, and Online Service Providers ("OSPs"), 
such as America Online, that offer software with Internet voice telephony features.<P></P>

<H4>Legal Analysis Of ACTA Petition</H4><P></P>

<H4>Software Publishers</H4><P></P>

		At a minimum, the ACTA Petition was misdirected at software publishers.
  Software publishers do not provide "telecommunications" services because they do not transmit 
information.  Further, software publishers do not offer "telecommunications for a fee directly to the
 public."  Instead, they sell software packages that permit the public to use the Internet to transmit
 voice messages over the Internet.  While Internet voice software providers often (but not always)
 market directly to the public, the software provides similar effective functionality as the software
 made by telephone equipment and switch providers used in the public switched telephone network
, who have never been regulated as common carriers.<P></P>

<H4>Internet Service Providers</H4><P></P>

<H4>Common Carriage Regulation</H4><P></P>

<H4>Arguments In Favor Of Common Carrier Regulation</H4><P></P>

		The best argument that Internet voice services qualify for common carriage
 under the statutory definitions is that it meets the three-pronged definition of "telecommunications"
 because (1) it is "the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, [2] of information
 of the user's choosing, [3] without change in the form or content of the information as sent and
 received."  Internet voice services may meet this test because:  (1) the Internet voice user specifies
 where the call originates and terminates; (2) the caller decides what to say; and (3) the recipient
 hears the same voice message that is delivered without change.<P></P>

		It is important to note that this argument would still not subject traditional Internet
 data services to common carriage treatment.  Internet data is changed by computer processing 
between the time it is sent and received by the addition of packet headers (and often by other
 information).  In addition, particular Internet applications and functions do not meet the statute's
 definition of telecommunications.<P></P>

<H4>Arguments Against Common Carrier Regulation</H4><P></P>

		The best arguments against subjecting Internet voice services to common
 carriage regulation are practical and technical ones.  The biggest obstacle is that it is impossible to
 differentiate Internet voice packets from data packets (although future standards may require 
differentiating information in the packet "headers").  For this reason, an ISP could not distinguish
 between regulated voice packets and unregulated data packets.  The ISP would not know when it is
 acting as a common carrier (or "telecommunications carrier" under the statute).<P></P>

		A second issue is that many ISPs are arguably not "telecommunications carriers
" because they do not "offer[ ] telecommunications for a fee directly to the public. . . ."  Instead, they offer 
Internet connections which the end-user combines with software (sometimes supplied by the user) to
 obtain the ability to use telecommunications.  However, other ISPs actively market Internet voice
 services, or at least Internet access software with Internet voice capabilities.<P></P>

		A third complication is that it is impossible to know who all the "carriers" of
 any given voice call are since each of the packets in the call take a circuitous and different route.
  Finally, it is virtually impossible to measure the length of a call.  In short, applying the statutory
 definitions to Internet voice services would be exceedingly difficult to implement today.<P></P>

		To fit Internet voice services into traditional common carrier regulation would 
require redesigning substantial technical (and economic) characteristics of the Internet.  While it is 
true that the PSTN has been designed in part around regulatory requirements, it is far from clear that
 there are substantial public benefits to be gained from common carrier regulation or redesign of the
 Internet.<P></P>

<H4>Forbearance</H4><P></P>

		Even if Internet telephony is a common carrier service, the Commission  may 
forbear from subjecting this service to common carrier regulation if:  (1) regulation is not necessary 
to ensure just and reasonable charges; (2) regulation is not required to protect consumers; and (3)
 it would be in the public interest to forebear from regulation.  <P></P>

		The Commission has forborne from economic regulation of enhanced 
services, including the Internet, since the 1980 Computer II decision for precisely these reasons. 
 Economic regulation of the Internet is hardly necessary to protect subscribers from being charged
 unreasonably high rates.  The Internet has flourished without common carrier regulation, and will 
continue to do so if not regulated.  In addition, the numerous technical and practical problems discussed
 above underline the need for forbearance from common carrier regulation.  <P></P>

		Therefore, the Commission could properly forbear from subjecting Internet 
voice services to common carrier regulation even if it determined that these services met the statutory 
definition of common carriage. Such forbearance would accord with the congressional policy "to
 preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other
 interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation."  <P></P>

<H4>Internet Services and Interconnection Charges </H4><P></P>

		The ACTA Petition marks, the first, but not the last attempt to impose economic 
regulation on the Internet.  The critical issue is not whether Internet telephony should be subject to
 common carrier regulation, but whether it should continue to enjoy the regulatory advantages 
related to interconnection charges and universal service over traditional voice telephone service
, with which it is increasingly competing.  Indeed, the Internet telephony issue will force the Commission
 to confront the question whether any Internet services (data, voice or video) should continue to be 
exempt from the interconnection charges regulatorily imposed on traditional voice services because 
all Internet services use portions of the local and international networks.<P></P>

		Some will point to the explosive growth of the Internet and concomitant increased 
use of the local network to justify imposition of access charges.  Published (but unsubstantiated)
 reports claim that non-voice (Internet, other data, fax) traffic now accounts for fully half of the traffic
 carried on the local network.<P></P>

		The process of rationalizing access charges may begin in the Commission's
 ongoing interconnection and universal service rulemakings.  However, the FCC is likely to initiate a
 rulemaking on access charge reform at the end of 1996 or early 1997.  This will be a difficult and
 contentious proceeding.  Currently, the access charges are well above incremental cost levels to 
subsidize local telephone service.<P></P>

		 New entrants into the local market will target this lucrative market, putting 
downward pressure on these charges.  Local telephone companies are likely to respond to this price
 pressure by reducing their access charges and trying to increase their subscriber line charges. 
 Increases in these subscriber line charges may be politically unpalatable to the Commission and 
Congress.  There will be significant pressure to find additional funds to ease these financial and 
political tensions.  The potential fees from Internet services -- data as well as voice -- will be extremely
 tempting targets to many.  <P></P>

		In addition, it is in the interests of both local exchange companies and most 
interexchange carriers to subject the Internet to the same interconnection charges currently paid 
by long distance carriers.  The local exchange companies view the rapidly expanding Internet traffic
 as a welcome source of new revenues.  Some local exchange companies will want to impose the 
regulation-based interconnection fees on Internet services.<P></P>

		The long distance companies that now pay 40%-50% of revenues for local access
 fees will urge that Internet services shoulder some of the obligations of supporting the local network.
  Even long distance companies that support, and profit from the Internet, will be tempted to use the
 regulatory disparity as a central argument for why they should be given cost-based interconnection
 charges.  Indeed, some long distance companies will strive to use the Internet's "free market"
 interconnection for traditional PSTN services.<P></P>
		To conclude, the potential imposition of access charges poses a far greater
 threat to Internet telephony, and to other Internet services, than the ACTA attempt to require common 
carrier regulation.<P></P>

<H4>INTERNATIONAL INTERNET VOICE ISSUES</H4><P></P>

<H4>International Issues</H4><P></P>

		While the growth of the Internet is explosive throughout the world, the Internet
 (much less discussion of Internet regulation) is generally much less developed in most other countries.
  Since the Internet is inherently an international service, there are many difficult issues to be resolved
 on an international scale.<P></P>

		In the United States, there are many alternatives to obtain leased lines for the
 Internet network.  However, in most foreign countries, these leased lines are available primarily
 (or solely) from the monopoly operator.  Eventually, there will be additional sources of leased lines
 for Internet service as competition is introduced in more countries throughout the world.<P></P>

		Collection rates (end-user rates) for traditional long distance telephone service
 are much higher in most foreign countries than in the United States.  Therefore, the incentives to use
 Internet voice service to bypass the public switched telephone network are substantially greater than
 in the United States.  <P></P>

		Many foreign carriers will be quite concerned if Internet telephony becomes a
 viable and prevalent means of bypass.  Carriers with monopolies on traditional voice services will
 probably try to stop the development of Internet telephony.  In addition, most foreign carriers will be
 quite concerned about any bypass of the international accounting rate system, since they have relied
 on these funds as a critical source of revenue.  <P></P>

<H4>Specific Countries</H4><P></P>

<H4>Switzerland</H4><P></P>

		In July 1995, the Swiss Office of Communications issued a decision stating
 that it saw no need at that time to regulate Internet voice services given its nascent nature.<P></P>
<H4>Canada</H4><P></P>

		The Internet telephony issue was recently raised in Canada
.  A telecommunications ruling officer with the Canadian Radio-television and 
Telecommunications Commission has reportedly indicated informally that an ISP
 providing Internet telephony service would be regulated by the Canadian Telecommunications
 Act, and would be subject to regulation-based interconnection charges.  <P></P>

<div align=center><h3>MEMORANDUM OPINION OF CHARLES R. RICHEY </h3></div>

<div align=center><h3>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE </h3></div>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>This case presents a classic example of how the courts today, particularly
the federal courts, can become needlessly invoked, whether in the national
interest or not, in litigation involving policy decisions made within the
power of the President or another branch of the government. The plaintiff,
in an effort to export a computer diskette for profit, raises administrative
law and meritless constitutional claims because he and others have not
been able to persuade the Congress and the Executive Branch that the technology
at issue does not endanger the national security. This is a &quot;political
question&quot; for the two elected branches under Articles I and II of
the Constitution. </p>

<p>The case arises out of the defendants' designation of the plaintiff's
computer diskette as a &quot;defense article&quot; pursuant to the Arms
Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. §§ 2751-2796d, and the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. §§ 120-130. The plaintiff
alleges that the defendants' designation of a diskette containing source
codes for cryptographic algorithms<a HREF="#note1">1
</a><a name="text1"></a>as a defense article subject to the export controls set forth in the
ITAR, when the defendant deemed a book containing the same source codes
not subject to said export controls, is arbitrary and capricious and an
abuse of discretion in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),
5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (a). The plaintiff also raises a number of constitutional
claims. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants' regulation
of the diskette violates the plaintiff's First Amendment right to freedom
of speech and arbitrarily treats the diskette differently than the book
in violation of the plaintiff's Fifth Amendment right to substantive due
process. 

<p>The defendants move to dismiss the plaintiff's APA challenge based on
a provision in the AECA precluding the judicial review of the designation
of items as defense articles subject to the AECA. The defendants move for
summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff's First Amendment and
Fifth Amendment rights have not been violated by the defendants' regulation
of his computer diskette under the AECA and the ITAR. 

<p>Upon consideration of the filings by the parties, the entire record
herein, the applicable law thereto, and for the reasons set forth below,
the Court shall grant the defendants' Motion to Dismiss the plaintiff's
APA claim as nonjusticiable, and the Court shall grant the defendant's
Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the plaintiff's First and Fifth
Amendment claims. 

<p>BACKGROUND </p>

<p>On February 12, 1994, the plaintiff submitted to the Department of State
a commodity jurisdiction request<a HREF="#note2">2</a><a name="text2"></a>
for the book Applied Cryptography, by Bruce Schneier. The book Applied
Cryptography provides, among other things, information on cryptographic
protocols, cryptographic techniques, cryptographic algorithms, the history
of cryptography, and the politics of cryptography. Part Five of Applied
Cryptography contains source code for a number of cryptographic algorithms.
This first commodity jurisdiction submission did not include &quot;machine-readable
media&quot; such as a computer diskette or CD-ROM. Lowell Dec., Tab. 4.


<p>On March 2, 1994, in response to the plaintiff's commodity jurisdiction
request, the Department of State's Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC)
determined that the book is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Department
of State pursuant to the ITAR. Joint St. Ý 4. The ODTC's response explicitly
stated, however, that this determination did not extend to the two diskettes
referenced in the book and available from the author - - said disks apparently
containing the encryption source code printed in Part Five of Applied Cryptography.
Joint St. Ý 5.

<p>On March 9, 1994, the plaintiff submitted a commodity jurisdiction request
for a diskette containing the source code printed in Part Five of Applied
Cryptography (the &quot;Karn diskette&quot;). The request stated that &quot;the
diskette contains source code for encryption software that provides data
confidentiality&quot; and that &quot;the software on this diskette is provided
for those who wish to incorporate encryption into their applications.&quot;
Joint St. Ý 7. The ODTC responded, stating that the Karn diskette is subject
to the jurisdiction of the Department of State pursuant to the ITAR and
the AECA because the diskette &quot;is designated as a defense article
under category XIII(b) (1) of the United States Munitions List.&quot; Joint
St. Ý 8; Lowell Decl. Ý 15, Tab 9. </p>

<p>Pursuant to procedures set forth in 22 C.F.R. § 120.4(g), the plaintiff
appealed the commodity jurisdiction determination concerning the source
code diskette to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State by letter dated
June 10, 1994. Joint St. Ý 9. The Deputy Assistant denied the plaintiff's
appeal by letter dated October 7, 1994. Joint St. Ý 10. The plaintiff appealed
this denial to the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military
Affairs, defendant Thomas McNamara, by letter dated December 5, 1994. Defendant
McNamara denied the plaintiff's appeal on June 13, 1995, reaffirming the
earlier determinations that the Karn diskette&quot; contains cryptographic
software [[and) is designated as a defense article under Category XIII(b)
(1).&quot; Joint St. Ý 12; Lowell Decl. Ý 22, Tab 14. 

<p>The plaintiff filed his Complaint in this Court on September 21, 1995,
and the defendants tiled their Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative,
for Summary Judgment on November 15, 1995, containing the declarations
of William P. Crowell, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency,
and William J. Lowell, Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls,
Bureau of Political -Military Affairs, Department of State. The plaintiff
filed an Opposition thereto on December 11, 1995, including the declarations
of Barbara Tuthill, a Secretary at Venable, Baetjer &amp; Howard, Philip
R. Zimmerman, a software developer, and plaintiff Philip R. Karn, Jr. The
defendants Replied on December 18, 1995. The plaintiff filed a Supplemental
Memorandum on December 22, 1995, containing the supplemental declaration
of plaintiff Karn, in order to correct alleged misstatements made by defendants.
The defendants filed a Response on January 16, 1996.

TO THE DEFENDANTS' DESIGNATION OF THE PLAINTIFF'S DISK AS A &quot;DEFENSE
ARTICLE&quot; BECAUSE THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT PRECLUDES JUDICIAL REVIEW.</b>
</li></div>
</ol>

<h4>Pursuant to AECA, The President Designated The Karn Diskette As A &quot;Defense
Article&quot; Subject To Export Regulation under The ITAR. </h4>

<p>The AECA authorizes the President to control the export of &quot;defense
articles&quot;: </p>

<p>The president is authorized to designate those items which shall be
considered as defense articles and defense services for the purposes of
this section and to promulgate regulations for the import and export of
such articles and services. The items so designated shall constitute the
United States Munitions List. </p>

<p>22 U.S.C. § 2778 (a) (1). The President delegated this authority to
the Secretary of State, who then promulgated the ITAR. See §§ 22 C.F.R.
§120.1(a). </p>

<p>The ITAR contains 10 subparts, including &quot;Purpose and definitions,&quot;
contained in Part 120, and &quot;The United States munitions list,&quot;
contained in Part 121. Part 121, containing the munitions list, describes
those items designated &quot;defense articles&quot; by the Secretary of
State.<a HREF="#note3">3</a><a name="text3"></a> The descriptions of
such defense articles do not include specific manufacturer names or highly-detailed
descriptions, but instead contain relatively general descriptions, such
as the following: &quot;Military tanks, combat engineer vehicles, bridge
launching vehicles, half tracks and gun carriers&quot;<a HREF="#note4">4
</a>&quot;Military<a name="text4"></a> training equipment including but not limited to attack
trainers, radar target trainers . . . and simulation devices related to
defense articles&quot;<a HREF="#note5">5</a><a name="text5"></a> ;&quot;Body
armor specifically designed, modified or equipped for military use . .
.&quot;<a HREF="#note6">6</a><a name="text6"></a>; and &quot;Radar systems,
with capabilities such as (i) Search, (ii) Acquisition, (iii) Tracking
. . . &quot;<a HREF="#note7">7</a><a name="text7"></a> Likewise, the
munitions list specifically addresses cryptographic systems and components
and includes the following description: </p>

<p>(b) Information Security Systems and equipment, cryptographic devices,
software, and components specifically designed or modified therefor, including:
(1) cryptographic . . . systems, equipment, assemblies, modules, integrated
circuits, components or software with the capability of maintaining secrecy
or confidentiality of information or information systems . . . 22 C.F.R.
§ 120.4, category XIII. </p>

<p>Part 120 of the ITAR provides assistance for interpreting the terms
used in the munitions list. The &quot;commodity jurisdiction procedure&quot;
is explained and provided for in this definitional sect ton, and the ITAR
directs that the ODTC use the procedure &quot;if doubt exists as to whether
an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List.&quot; 22 C.F.R.
§ 120.4. As set forth previously, the plaintiff requested the use of this
procedure for the book and the diskette. The ODTC determined that the diskette
was covered by the munitions list but that the book was not. </p>

<p>The plaintiff argues that the diskette, like the book, is not a &quot;defense
article&quot; covered by the munitions list. The plaintiff contends that
pursuant to sections 125.1<a HREF="#note8">8</a><a name="text8"></a>
and 120.11<a HREF="#note9">9</a><a name="text9"></a>, the diskette is
in the &quot;public domain&quot; and therefore is not subject to the ITAR.
<i>See </i>Plaint's Opp. 19-21. However, the defendants contend that the
diskette does not fall within the &quot;public domain&quot; exemption because
said exemption only applies to &quot;technical data&quot; which, according
to the defendants, does not include cryptographic software. <i>See </i>Defs'
Reply 21-22 (citing 22 C.F.R. §§ 120.10(a) (4),<a HREF="#note10">10</a><a name="text10"></a>

<h4>Section 2778(h) Of The Arms Export Control Act Precludes Judicial Review
Of The Designation Of The Karn Diskette As A &quot;Defense Article.&quot;
</h4>

<p>The AECA explicitly bars judicial review of the President's designation
of an item as a defense article: </p>

<p>The designation by the President (or by an official to whom the President's
functions under subsection (a) of this section have been duly delegated),
in regulations issued under this section, of items as defense articles
or defense services for purposes of this section shall not be subject to
judicial review. </p>

<p>22 U.S.C. § 2778(h). The plaintiff argues, however, that the Court should
construe this provision so narrowly as to cover only the act of listing
items on the munitions list contained in Part 121 of the ITAR and not the
determination whether an item, in this case the plaintiff's diskette, is
actually covered by the language of the munitions list pursuant to the
definitional provisions contained in Part 120 of the ITAR. The plaintiff
bases this argument upon the presumption in favor of judicial review and
the language of § 2778(h) when read in conjunction with § 2778 (a) of the
AECA. 

<p>It is often stated that there is a presumption in favor of judicial
review of agency action absent &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot;
of legislative intent to preclude it. Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Family
Phys., 476 U.S. 667, 671 (1986). However, the Supreme Court has cautioned
that this standard &quot;is not a rigid evidentiary test but a useful reminder
to the courts that, where substantial doubt about the congressional intent
exists, the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative
action is controlling.&quot; Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S.
340, 351 (1984). The presumption may be overcome, and the appropriate standard
for determining whether &quot;a particular statute precludes judicial review
is determined not only from its express language, but also from the structure
of the statutory scheme, its objectives, its legislative history, and nature
of the administrative action involved.&quot; Id. at 345. 

<p>Section 2778(h) expressly bars judicial review of the President's (or
his designee's -- in this case, the Secretary of State's and/or ODTC's)
designation of items as defense articles. In the case at bar, the Department
of State designated the Karn diskette as a defense article by listing &quot;cryptographic
software&quot; in Part 121 to the ITAR and then confirming that the diskette
was covered by this description pursuant to the definitional provisions
to the ITAR contained in § 120.4. The plaintiff argues, however, that because
§ 2778 (a) (1) authorizes the designation of &quot;defense articles and
. . . . [t]he items so designated shall constitute the United States Munitions
List,&quot; and because the bar to judicial review appearing in § 2778(h)
only applies to &quot;the designation in regulations , . . of items as
defense articles,&quot; judicial review is precluded only for the act of
listing items as defense articles on the munitions list published in Part
121 of the ITAR. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, any interpretation
and application of the descriptions on the munitions list by the agency
are reviewable. See Plaint's Opp. at 36-37. 

<p>The Court finds the plaintiff's reading strained and unreasonable. It
is far more reasonable to read § 2778 (a) (1) and (h) to preclude judicial
review for the designation of items as defense articles pursuant to the
language of the munitions list and the procedures provided for interpreting
the list, all set forth in the ITAR -- in other words, if the defendants
follow the procedures set forth in the ITAR and authorized by the AECA
for designating an item as a defense article, such item is a part of the
munitions list. The defendants did precisely that. Furthermore, even if
the plaintiff's reading of the statute were plausible, the Court finds
that any ambiguity would be dispelled by the objective of the AECA, the
structure of the United States export scheme, and the nature of the plaintiff's
challenge. 

<p>To parse the statute as the plaintiff suggests makes little sense in
light of the objectives of the AECA. The AECA was enacted to permit the
Executive Branch to control the export and import of certain items in order
to further &quot;world peace and the security and foreign policy&quot;
of the United States. 22 U.S.C. §2778(a) (1). Designating an export such
that it is subject to the AECA and the ITAR requires first describing the
type of item in the regulations, and second, if asked by a potential exporter,
confirming that the item in question is or is not covered by such description.
The commodity jurisdiction procedure provides the latter function, as provided
for explicitly both in the definitional section of the ITAR and in the
munitions list with respect to cryptographic software. See 22 C.F.R. §§
120.4 and 121.1, category XIII, (b) (1), Note. Determining whether an item
is covered by the munitions list is critical to the President's ability
to designate and control the export of those items the Executive Branch
considers to be defense articles. Simply put, the Court discerns from the
legislative scheme that Congress has precluded judicial review of the commodity
jurisdiction procedure. 

<p>Judicial non-reviewability of the defendants' commodity control decision
is also consistent with the structure of the United State's export control
scheme. Items not regulated by the ITAR but which have both commercial
and potential military application -- &quot;dual use&quot; items -- are
regulated by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. §§ 768-99, which were promulgated pursuant
to the Export Administration Act (EAA), 50 App. U.S.C. §§240120. Like the
munitions list contained in Part 121 of the ITAR, the EAR contains a description
of items, the commodity control list (CCL), subject to the licensing requirements
of the EAR. See 15 C.F.R. part 799. Similarly, the EAA also contains a
judicial review prohibition. Section 2412 (a) of the EAA states that &quot;the
functions exercised under this Act are excluded from the operation of [the
APA.]&quot; In a criminal appeal before the Ninth Circuit, brought by a
defendant who exported laser mirrors without obtaining a license from the
Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the EAA and EAR, the court held that
section 2412 (a) of the EAA precluded judicial review of the Secretary
of Commerce's determination that the type of laser mirrors exported by
the defendant were in fact covered by the language of the CCL. See United
States v. Spawr Optical Research. Inc., 864 F.2d 1467 (9th Cir. 1988),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 809 (1989). In other words, under the EAR and EAA
judicial review is precluded for the act of describing items on the CCL
and for the act of determining whether an item is covered by the CCL descriptions.<a HREF="#note12">12</a><a name="text12"></a>

<p>In addition to the obvious analogy between the schemes of the RAA and
the AECA, these statutes are in fact part of a singular export scheme,
in that the commodity jurisdiction procedure set forth in § 120.4 of the
ITAR not only determines whether an item is a defense article covered by
the munitions list, it also determines whether an item is covered by the
EAR. See Lowell Decl., Tab 2. In fact, Part 121 of the ITAR, containing
the published munitions list which the plaintiff concedes is not subject
to judicial review, states the following: 

<p>NOTE: A procedure has been established to facilitate the expeditious
transfer to the Commodity Control List of mass market software products
with encryption that meet specified criteria regarding encryption for the
privacy of data . . . Requests to transfer commodity jurisdiction of mass
market software products designed to meet the specified criteria may be
submitted in accordance with the commodity jurisdiction provisions of §
120.4. 

<p>22 C.F.R. § 121.1, Category XIII(b) (1). To achieve consistency between
the EAA and the AECA the Court concludes that decisions made pursuant to
the commodity jurisdiction procedure should not be reviewable. Furthermore,
considering the deference afforded the President in matters of foreign
policy, it would be strange indeed if Congress precluded judicial review
of the determination that an item has merely a potential for military use
(i.e., subject to the commodity control list), but permitted review of
the determination that an item was in fact a defense article (e.g., subject
to the munitions list). 

<p>The Court has reviewed House Report No. 101-296, Senate Report No. 101-l73,
and the Congressional Record for legislative history regarding the Anti-Terrorism
and Amendments to the Arms Export Control Act of 1989, which added § 2888(h)
to the AECA. The legislative history regarding § 2778(h) is scant. However,
one of the stated purposes of the Act - - to eliminate &quot;overlapping
standards that lead to confusion and misinterpretation,&quot; including
&quot;identifying which arms are subject to restrictions,&quot; see 8.
Rep. No. 173, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1989); see also H.R. Rep. No. 296,
101st Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1989) -- further supports finding consistency
between the AECA and EAA. 

<p>Finally, the plaintiff's challenge is not of a nature that commands
a heightened presumption in favor of judicial review. Courts have held
that &quot;the presumption of judicial review is particularly strong&quot;
where the plaintiff alleges that the agency facially violated its authority
delegated under the statute. Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217, 223 (D.C.
Cir. 1988). One rationale for this general rule is that such &quot;facial&quot;
challenges typically raise &quot;a discrete issue, unrelated to the facts
of the case, that only needs to be resolved once,&quot; and therefore,
entertaining the challenge does not &quot;open the floodgates to litigation.&quot;
Id.; see also, Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Family Phys., 476 U.S. 677, 680
n.1l (1986); Johnson v. Robinson, 415 U.S. 361, 370 (1974). Another rationale
for presuming the reviewability of such facial challenges is that, &quot;[w]hen
Congress limits its delegation of power, courts infer (unless the statute
clearly directs otherwise) that Congress expects this limitation to be
judicially enforced.&quot; Dart, 848 F.2d at 223 

<p>In the case at bar, the plaintiff's APA claim does not raise a facial
challenge to the agency's action in the context of the agency's statutory
authority,<a HREF="#note13">13</a><a name="text13"></a> but instead disputes
whether the Karn diskette constitutes a defense article subject to the
licensing restrictions of the ITAR. Permitting judicial review of the plaintiff's
APA claim would in fact open the floodgates to litigation; every time a
potential exporter is informed through the commodity jurisdiction procedure
that the item he wishes to export (or has already exported) is designated
in the munitions list, the exporter could seek judicial review of that
decision. 

<p>Based on the authorities cited in the plaintiff's Opposition, the plaintiff
maintains that it is incumbent upon courts to essentially torture the language
of finality provisions in order to permit judicial review whenever possible.
See Plaint's Opp. 34-38, 41-42. Each of the cases cited by the plaintiff
involved either legislative history<a HREF="#note14">14</a><a name="text14"></a>
or a statutory scheme<a HREF="#note15">15</a><a name="text15"></a> that
raised substantial doubt as to whether Congress intended to preclude judicial
review. Moreover, some of the cases often involved a facial challenge<a HREF="#note16">16</a><a name="text16"></a>
to a statute or to the agency's action. Thus, the Court finds that the
authorities relied upon by the plaintiff are inapposite to the circumstances
presented in the present case. For the reasons discussed above (i.e., the
express language of the AECA, the arms export control scheme, and the nature
of the plaintiff's challenge) the Court holds that Congress has barred
judicial review. 

<ol>
<div align=center><li><b>DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT AS
A MATTER OF LAW ON THE PLAINTIFF'S FIRST AND FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS.</b>
</li></div>
</ol>

<p>Although the Court holds that the AECA precludes judicial review of
the Department of State's determination that the Karn diskette is a designated
defense article subject to the ITAR, the plaintiff also asserts that the
regulation of the diskette violates the plaintiff's First and Fifth Amendment
rights. Both parties agree that such constitutional challenges are not
barred by § 2778(h). See Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 602-05 (1988). Accordingly,
the Court will now proceed to address the defendants' Motion for Summary
Judgment with respect to these claims. 

<p>A party is entitled to summary judgment when there are no material facts
in dispute and its position is correct as a matter of law. Anderson v Liberly
Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 247, 247-48 (1986); Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S.
321, 322 (1986) . Material facts are those &quot;facts that might affect
the outcome of the suit under the governing law . . . .&quot; Anderson,
477 U.S. at 248. The Court finds that there are no material facts in dispute
with respect to the plaintiff's First and Fifth Amendment claims, and for
the reasons set forth below, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment
as a matter of law. 

<h4>A. The Court Shall Grant The Defendants' Motion For Summary Judgment
On The Plaintiff's First Amendment Claim Because The Regulation Is Content-Neutral
And Meets The O'Brien Test. </h4>

<h5>1. Regulation Of The Diskette Is Subject To The O'Brien Test Because
The Governmental Interest At Stake Is Unrelated To The Content Of Any Protected
Speech Contained Oh The Diskette. </h5>

<p>The plaintiff contends that the defendants' regulation of the Karn diskette<a HREF="#note17">17</a><a name="text17"></a>
constitutes a restraint on free speech in violation of the plaintiff's
First Amendment rights. The plaintiff argues the diskette should be considered
&quot;speech for the purpose of First Amendment analysis because the computer
language source codes contained on the diskette are comprehensible to human
beings when viewed on a personal computer, because the diskette contains
comments&quot; interspersed throughout the source code which are useful
only to a human and are ignored by the computer, and because the source
code and comments taken together teach humans how to speak in code.<a HREF="#note18">18</a><a name="text18"></a>

<p>As a threshold matter, for the purpose of addressing the dispositive
issue whether the regulation is justified and permissible, the Court will
assume that the protection of the First Amendment extends to the source
code,<a HREF="#note19">19</a><a name="text19"></a> and the comments on
the plaintiff's diskette.<a HREF="#note20">20</a><a name="text20"></a>
The Supreme Court has described the First Amendment right to free speech
as that which &quot;generally prevents the government from proscribing
speech because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.&quot; R.A.V. v. city
of St. Paul, ___ U.S. ___ 112 5. Ct. 253B, 2542 (citations omitted) . Assuming
the source codes and comments are within the arena of protected speech,
the Court must then determine the basis for the regulation at issue in
this case. 

<p>The rationale for a regulation determines the level of scrutiny to be
applied to said regulation; if the regulation is content-based, the regulation
will be &quot;presumptively invalid,&quot; whereas if the regulation is
content-neutral, then the government may justify the regulation if certain
other criteria are met. Id. at 2542-54. These additional criteria -- whether
the regulation is (1) within the constitutional power of the government,
(2) &quot;furthers an important or substantial governmental interest,&quot;
and (3) is narrowly tailored to the governmental interest - - have been
referred to as the O'Brien test after the Supreme Court upheld the government's
prohibition against burning draft cards based on these criteria in United
States. v- O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968) 

<p>The plaintiff disputes this characterization of the law, arguing that
the nature of the matter regulated, (e.g., whether &quot;conduct&quot;
or &quot;pure speech&quot;), as opposed to the rationale for the regulation,
actually dictates the level of scrutiny to be applied. The plaintiff submits
that the O'Brien criteria are inapplicable because they apply only to the
regulation of &quot;conduct&quot;, and that the Karn diskette is `pure
speech&quot;, the regulation of which should require strict scrutiny review.
The Court disagrees, as the plaintiff's argument places form over substance.
Pursuant to extensive First Amendment jurisprudence, the government's rationale
for the regulation controls, regardless of the form of the speech or expression
regulated. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (&quot;Time,
place, and manner&quot; restriction on music permitted where, among other
things, regulation was content-neutral); Clark v. Community of Creative
Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 298 (1984) (Standard for evaluating expressive
conduct, including requirement that regulation be content-neutral, &quot;is
little, if any, different from standard applied to time, place, or manner
restrictions&quot;); O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377 (Government prohibition against
burning of draft cards sufficiently justified if, among other things, &quot;the
governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression&quot;).
Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the Court to make any finding regarding
the nature of the matter contained on the Karn diskette. 

<p>The government regulation at issue here is clearly content- neutral.
The defendants' rationale for regulating the export of the diskette is
that &quot;the proliferation of [cryptographic hardware and software] will
make it easier for foreign intelligence targets to deny the United States
Government access to information vital to national security interests.&quot;
Crowell Decl. at 3. The defendants are not regulating the export of the
diskette because of the expressive content of the comments and or source
code, but instead are regulating because of the belief that the combination
of encryption source code on machine readable media will make it easier
for foreign intelligence sources to encode their communications. The government
considers the cryptographic source code contained on machine-readable media
as cryptographic software and has chosen to regulate it accordingly. 

<p>The plaintiff does not dispute this motive for regulating the export
of the diskette, but instead questions the logic of such a motive in light
of the plaintiff's allegations that, without compiling the source code
and without further programming, the Karn diskette does not perform a cryptographic
function, and that there is no actual danger to national security because
the source codes can be obtained abroad through the book or on the Internet.
Such issues are not material to the determination of content neutrality.
In this case, the plaintiff has not presented any evidence to suggest the
bad faith of the government, or that the government's expressed motive
is a pretense. Accordingly, the Court finds that the rationale expressed
by the government is content-neutral and the regulation is subject to the
standards set forth by the Supreme Court in O'Brien. 

<h5>2. The Regulation Of The Diskette Meets The O'Brien Test Because It
Is Within The Power Of The Government To Control The Export Of Defense
Articles, It Furthers The Significant Governmental Interest of preventing
The Proliferation Of Cryptographic Products, And It Is Narrowly Tailored
To Meet That Interest. </h5>

<p>As stated previously, a content-neutral regulation is justified under
the O'Brien test if it is within the constitutional power of the government,
it &quot;furthers an important or substantial governmental interest,&quot;
and &quot;the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms
is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.&quot;
O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377. The plaintiff does not dispute that regulating
the export of cryptographic software is within the constitutional power
of government.<a HREF="#note21">21</a><a name="text21"></a> Nor does the
plaintiff expressly dispute the second requirement, that the government
has an important interest at stake. The defendants have submitted evidence,
which the plaintiff does not dispute, stating that the interception of
communication made by foreign intelligence targets is &quot;essential to
the national defense, national security, and the conduct of the foreign
affairs of the United States.&quot; Crowell Decl. at 3. In the context
of this factual backdrop, the defendants have expressed the following government
interest for justifying the regulation of the plaintiff's diskette: &quot;the
proliferation of cryptographic products will make it easier for foreign
intelligence targets to deny the United States Government access to information
vital to national security interests.&quot; Crowell Decl. at 3. 

<p>The plaintiff argues instead that the third prong of the O'Brien test
is not satisfied because the cryptographic algorithms contained on the
Karn diskette are &quot;already widely available in other countries (through
the Internet and other sources] or are so 'weak' that they can be broken
by the [National Security Agency].&quot;<a HREF="#note22">22</a><a name="text22"></a>
Plaint's Opp. 5-l6. Although the plaintiff has labeled his argument as
one concerning the &quot;narrowly tailored restriction&quot; requirement
of the O'Brien test, the plaintiff's argument implicates the second O'Brien
requirement by questioning whether the government has a legitimate interest
at stake. Indeed, the plaintiff contends that his argument constitutes
a factual dispute with the defendants, making the plaintiff's First Amendment
claim inappropriate for summary judgment as a matter of law. 

<p>The Court does not agree. The plaintiff attempts to disguise a disagreement
with the foreign policy judgment of the President as a factual dispute.
By placing cryptographic products on the ITAR, the President has determined
that the proliferation of cryptographic products will harm the United States.
This policy judgment exists despite the availability of cryptographic software
through the Internet and the National Security Agency's alleged ability
to break certain codes. Even if this were a factual dispute, it is not
one into which this Court can or will delve. The Court will not scrutinize
the President's foreign policy decision. As the Supreme Court stated in
Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines v. Waterman 55. Corn., 333 U.S. 103 (1948),
such decisions: 

<p>are delicate, complex, and involve large elements of prophecy. They
are and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the
people whose welfare they advance or imperil. They are decisions of a kind
for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility
and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power
not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry. 

<p>333 U.S. at 111. The plaintiff also suggests that the Court balance
any First Amendment harms created through regulation of the diskette against
the injury caused to national security if the export of the diskette were
not regulated. See Plaint's Opp. 16. However, unlike Tinker v. Des Moines
Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 508 (1969), where
the Supreme Court applied an 'ad hoc balancing test, such a test in the
case at bar would require the Court to scrutinize the actual injury to
national security. Again, the Court declines to do so. See United States
v. Mandel, 914 F.2d 1215, 1223 (9th Cir. 1990) (&quot;[W]hether the export
of a given commodity would make a significant contribution to the military
potential of other countries . . . is a political question not subject
to review to determine whether [it] had a basis in fact&quot;); United
States v. Martinez, 904 F.2d 601, 602 (11th Cir. 1990) (&quot;The question
whether a particular item should have been placed on the Munitions List
possesses nearly every trait that the Supreme Court has enumerated traditionally
renders a question `political'&quot;). Furthermore, the plaintiff cannot
genuinely dispute that, absent the restriction on the export of cryptographic
products and the plaintiff's diskette, the actual number of cryptographic
products<a HREF="#note23">23</a><a name="text23"></a> available to foreign
intelligence sources will be greater. 

<p>Finally, the plaintiff has not advanced any argument that the regulation
is &quot;substantially broader than necessary&quot; to prevent the proliferation
of cryptographic products. City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for
Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808 (1984). Nor has the plaintiff articulated any
present barrier to the spreading of information on cryptography &quot;by
any other means&quot; other than those containing encryption source code
on machine-readable media. See, 468 U.S. at 295. Therefore, the Court holds
that the regulation of the plaintiff's diskette is narrowly tailored to
the goal of limiting the proliferation of cryptographic products and that
the regulation is justified. 

<h5>3. The Court Shall Deny The Plaintiff's First Amendment Claim Regarding
The &quot;Technical Data&quot; Provisions Of The ITAR Because The Plaintiff
Does Not Have Standing And The Defendants Have Limited Their Application
Of Said Provisions. </h5>

<p>As a last-ditch argument, the plaintiff contends that the Court should
invalidate the ITAR under the First Amendment because certain provisions
of the ITAR regulating the export of `technical data,&quot; as defined
in 22 C.F.R. S 120.10, constitute `an unconstitutional system of vague
prior restraints.&quot; The plaintiff bases his argument on internal government
memoranda that express concern regarding the possible overbreadth and vagueness
of said provisions. 

<p>The plaintiff has no standing to bring this claim regarding the unconstitutionality
of the &quot;technical data&quot; provisions.<a HREF="#note24">24</a><a name="text24"></a>
The defendants have not applied the &quot;technical data&quot; restrictions
to the plaintiff -- in fact, the crux of the plaintiff's APA claim is that
although the plaintiff believes the diskette is exempted from the ITAR
because it is in the public domain, the defendants have arbitrarily concluded
that the public domain exemption does not apply because the diskette is
not &quot;technical data.&quot; The Court will not accept the plaintiff's
invitation to address the constitutionality of the &quot;technical data&quot;
provisions of the ITAR where the plaintiff's injury is not causally connected
to said provisions. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, __ U.S. __, 112
S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992) (Court held that case-or-controversy standing
required, among other things, that the plaintiff must have suffered an
injury causally connected to the challenged action of the defendant). While
courts have departed from traditional rules of standing with respect to
certain First Amendment claims, claims of facial overbreadth and vagueness
are rarely entertained with respect to content-neutral regulations. See
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973). 

<p>Furthermore, the plaintiff's overbreadth concerns are not genuine. In
United States v. Edler Indus., 579 F.2d 516 (1975), the Ninth Circuit addressed
the argument that the definition of &quot;technical data&quot; in the ITAR
is &quot;susceptible to an overbroad interpretation.&quot; Id. at 520.
The court chose to read the technical data provision narrowly to avoid
finding a constitutional violation. Id. at 521. The Department of State
has since limited its application of the provision in practice to the interpretation
expressed by the court in Edler Indus. See Preamble to Revisions of International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (Final Rule) 49 Fed. Reg. 47682, 47683 (Dec.
6, 1984). In evaluating the plaintiff's overbreadth claim, the Court &quot;`must
. . . consider any limiting construction that a . . . court or enforcement
agency has preferred.&quot; Ward, 491 U.S. at 796 (quoting Hoffman Estates
v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, n. 5 (1982)).
Accordingly, based on the plaintiff's lack of standing, and in light of
the limitations to the &quot;technical data&quot; provisions adopted by
the Department of State, the plaintiff cannot prevail on his First Amendment
claim that the ITAR is vague and overbroad. 

<h4>B. REGULATING THE EXPORT OF THE PLAINTIFF'S DISKETTE IS RATIONAL AND,
ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT VIOLATE THE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS GUARANTEED
THE PLAINTIFF UNDER TIE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. </h4>

<p>As stated previously, I 2778(h) of the AECA precludes the APA claim
asserted by the plaintiff, but it cannot bar a constitutional attack. Recognizing
the significant possibility that this court might hold the plaintiff's
&quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; challenge under the APA nonjustificiable,
see Part I of this Memorandum Opinion, the plaintiff asserts the same &quot;arbitrary
and capricious&quot; challenge under the legal theory that the defendants'
actions violated his right to substantive due process as guaranteed by
the Fifth Amendment. However, the plaintiff may not backdoor his APA claim
through the Fifth Amendment as that would render the judicial review preclusion
in § 2778 (h) absolutely meaningless. See Sylvia Develop. Corp. v. Calvert
County Sylvia Develop. Corp. v. Calvert County, 48 F. 3d 810, 829 n. 7
(4th Cir. (1995) (&quot;As the courts have consistently recognized, the
inquiry into &quot;arbitrariness' under the Due Process Clause is completely
distinct from and far narrower than the inquiry into 'arbitrariness' under
state or federal administrative law&quot;). 

<p>The substantive due process provided in the Fifth Amendment, absent
the assertion of a fundamental right, merely requires a reasonable fit
between governmental purpose and the means chosen to advance that purpose.
See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 19 (1976) (&quot;Under
the deferential standard of review applied in substantive due process challenges
to economic legislation there is no need for mathematical precision in
the fit between justification and means&quot;). Given this &quot;extremely
limited scope of permissible judicial inquiry,&quot; Association of Accredited
Cosmetic Schools v. Alexander, 979 F.2d 859, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1992), the
plaintiff's due process claim lacks any merit. The government clearly has
an interest in preventing the proliferation of cryptographic software to
foreign powers, and the regulation of the export of the cryptographic software
is a rational means of achieving that goal. The Court will not substitute
its policy judgments for that of the President, see Bowen v. Gilliard,
483 U.S. 587, 597 (1987), especially in the area of national security.
See Martinez, 904 F.2d at 602. 

<p>Likewise, the regulation of the plaintiff's diskette as cryptographic
software is rational, even when considered in conjunction with the defendants'
decision not to subject the book Applied Cryptography to the ITAR. As stated
by the plaintiff in his commodity jurisdiction application for Applied
Cryptography, the book contains no machine-readable media,&quot; while
the diskette is precisely that. See Lowell Decl., Tab 4. Although Part
Five of the book could be placed on machine readable media through the
use of optical character recognition technology or through direct typing,
the plaintiff concedes that using the source code in part Five of Applied
Cryptography Applied Cryptography to encode material takes greater effort
and time than using the Karn diskette. Karn Decl. ÝÝ 10-12. Accordingly,
treating the book and diskette differently is not in violation of the plaintiff's
substantive due process rights. Finally, to the extent that the plaintiff's
substantive due process rights require the Court to review the defendants'
interpretation of the public domain exemption to the ITAR, the Court finds
the defendants' interpretation reasonable as a matter of law. 

<p><b>Conclusion</b> 

<p>For the reasons discussed above, the Court shall dismiss the plaintiff's
APA claim, and the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's
First and Fifth Amendment claims. The Court shall issue an Order of even
date herewith consistent with the foregoing Opinion.

information on speaking in a foreign language (and it is not clear that
cryptography qualifies) or convey information on the science of cryptographic
algorithms, the analysis is the same. The plaintiff also relies upon an
unpublished Ninth Circuit opinion declaring Arizona's &quot;English- only&quot;
statute unconstitutional. See Yniguez v. Arizona, 1995 WL 583414 (9th Cir.
Oct. 5, 1995). Yniguez does not apply to the case at bar, however, because

<P>Since 1972, Mike Kail has worked on a variety of matters, including internal corporate investigations, an antitrust grand jury and various pieces of litigation, all of which shared the characteristics of unusual factual density.  His principal focus over these years has been on the petroleum industry.  He was
involved in a structural antitrust case, followed by the Trans Alaska Pipeline tariff proceedings and a "private" Department of Energy overcharge action.

<P>More recently, he has litigated a series of cases relating to the valuation of Alaska North Slope crude oil.  These cases, look at the administrative and superior court level, touched on everything from the nature of the foreign crude oil market to the valuation of tanker transportation to economic theories of
pricing.  In this connection, he has participated in three substantial settlement negotiations with Alaskan officials. 

<P>Because of the complex nature of his practice, Mr. Kail has become intimately familiar with the use of computers, and has helped design both litigation support systems and substantive data bases.

<P>Steve Reed's primary focus lies in the area of energy regulation,
especially on those aspects of the oil and gas industry regulated
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  In particular, he
has participated in representing major oil pipelines in matters
before the FERC and the courts of appeals and is co-author of an
article summarizing the effects of the FERC's recent oil pipeline
regulatory reform efforts.  He also has substantial experience
with various forms of alternative dispute resolution, including
arbitration and ADR mini trials.</P>

<P>Mr. Reed has represented a number of major companies in tax
disputes with various states, particularly those involving
federal constitutional or statutory dimensions.  He has
participated in three U.S. Supreme Court cases involving state
taxation of interstate business, has testified before a number of
state legislative committees on that subject, and recently co-
authored an article in The Tax Lawyer on the subject of equal
protection limitations on state taxation of interstate business.
</P>
<P>Mr. Reed worked as a reporter for the Nashville Banner, covering
state and local government, before attending law school.  Upon
graduation from law school, he was a law clerk to Judge Levin H.
Campbell, in the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit.</P>

<h3 align=center>Steptoe & Johnson <font size=-1>LLP</font><p>Recruiting</h3>
<h2 align=center>Firm Description</h2>

<h3 align=center>Overview</h3>

<P>

Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> is a Washington, D.C.-based law firm with an expanding office in Phoenix, Arizona and an affiliate in Moscow, Russia.  Although Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> is a diverse institution, with more than 200 attorneys from all regions of the country, its attorneys share a common firm culture that emphasizes two primary goals:  (1) the pursuit of excellence in the practice of law at the most challenging levels and (2)preservation of a cooperative, supportive atmosphere.<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Practice Of The Firm</h3>

<P>

The distinctive characteristic of Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>'s practice -- whether litigation, counseling or transactional matters -- is that it reflects the impact of policy and emerging economic, political and social trends on the law.  Our objective is to draw on the creativity of individual attorneys to solve particularly difficult legal problems.  Our attorneys regularly appear as counsel in cases of substantial national or industry importance, and Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> is widely recognized as one of the nation's leading firms in a number of highly visible legal specialties.  We have an active appellate practice, including frequent appearances before the Supreme Court of the United States.  We also have an extensive pro bono program.<P>

<P>

A short sampling of our attorneys' recent activities include:<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of witness in the Whitewater investigation<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of Burlington Northern Railroad Company on a variety of matters, including their recent application for merger which created the nation's largest railroad<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of a major foreign air carrier in a reciprocal investment arrangement with a U.S. airline<P>

<P>

&#183;	defense of the company operating the Trans Alaska Pipeline System in &quot;whistleblower&quot; litigation<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of major industry participants in criminal price-fixing suits and related class actions<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of Resolution Trust Corporation in its formation of two private/public sector partnerships and in the partnerships' acquisitions of portfolios of complex loan and real estate assets with an aggregate book value of $3.5 billion  <P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of numerous taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service and in the Federal courts with respect to a variety of tax issues, including the threatened revocation of exemption of a major non-profit organization<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of lenders and developers in a variety of transactional and litigation matters relating to real estate, financial restructurings and bankruptcy<P>

<P>

&#183;	negotiation of more than $1.5 billion in refinancings of government-backed debt<P>

<P>

&#183;	negotiation of joint ventures and other business arrangements with parties in the former Soviet Union<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of the Canadian Forest Industries Council in countervailing duty litigation before the Department of Commerce, the International Trade Commission and Bi-National Panels established under the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of the government of Bulgaria in its GATT accession sessions<P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of a major law firm threatened with disqualification of its retirement plan<P>

<P>

&#183;	defense of a wide range of defendants -- including lawyers, accountants, appraisers and others -- in professional malpractice litigation <P>

<P>

&#183;	representation of major defense contractors under civil and criminal investigation<P>

 <P>

&#183;	assisting multinational real estate conglomerate in connection with U.S. tax consequences of bankruptcy workout.<P>

<P>

Our representations frequently require originality because they involve issues not previously settled by the courts.  In addition, our cases often demand substantial analysis of public policy or economic issues.  <P>

<P>

The firm maintains an active practice before the Supreme Court, where our cases often make new law. The firm has been successful at the Court in defending an employer's affirmative action hiring plan against a challenge brought by a white plaintiff; in arguing that the Equal Protection Clause limits tax discrimination against out-of-state companies; and in defining the availability of punitive damages under ERISA.  We also handle a substantial number of certiorari petitions, oppositions, and briefs amicus curiae in the Supreme Court.<P>

<P>

As a Washington-based firm, we regularly advise our clients regarding the interpretation and impact of proposed or newly-promulgated federal regulations and new statutory provisions.  In addition, we encounter many novel legal issues first in nonjudicial settings -- in counseling, in legislative and in transactional contexts.  For example, we are counsel to corporations and others in a variety of congressional settings, and our white collar crime specialists find themselves conducting internal corporate investigations here and abroad.  Our employment lawyers counsel on AIDS testing and equal opportunity issues before those issues reach the courts.  <P>

<HR>
<P>Our representations frequently require originality because they involve issues not previously settled by the courts.<P>

<HR>
<P>

	We take a long-term strategic approach to the development of our practice.  A number of Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> attorneys counsel a wide variety of clients, both foreign and domestic, on major international trade and business issues.  We have a Moscow affiliate -- Steptoe &amp; Johnson International -- with a significant practice specializing in trade and corporate transactional work in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. <P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Firm Organization</h3>

<P>

For administrative purposes, the firm's Washington-based practice is organized into eight broad practice groups which include:  (1) energy, environment; (2) transportation; (3) transactions, including corporate, securities, financial services, real estate, intellectual property and East/West investment; (4) tax and ERISA;
(5) international; (6) antitrust; (7) insurance, employment and commercial litigation; and (8) technology, contracts and crimes.<P>

 <P>

Attorneys frequently divide their time among several of the eight groups.  This loose structure fits our practice and philosophy better than would strict departmentalization.  Incoming associates initially are assigned to one of the eight practice groups, based on their interests and the firm's needs, with an option to spend a portion of their time in a second group.  Many new associates wish to gain exposure to a variety of practice experiences before beginning to specialize, and we think it is important to accommodate that desire.  The firm does not have a formal rotation system, but associates may periodically shift from one practice group to another.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Associate Training and Evaluation</h3>

<P>

The introduction of new associates to the firm is not left to good intention and chance.  A new associate's first steps are guided by a more senior associate who serves as an advisor.  The advisor monitors work assignments, provides information about the firm's practice, and offers insight into the way the firm operates.  The advisor ensures that the new associate gets started on the right foot and begins to feel at home as quickly as possible.<P>

<P>

The group system is designed to allow associates to develop expertise and assume new responsibilities at a steady pace.  It is our objective to give associates as much responsibility as they can handle at as early a stage as possible.  This includes dealing directly with clients, conducting oral and document discovery, drafting pleadings and appearing before courts and agencies.<P>

<P>

	To foster professional growth, we conduct a comprehensive in-house training program covering a full range of lawyering skills.  The program includes seminars and workshops designed specifically for new attorneys, as well as training activities open to all Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> lawyers.  The training program includes in-depth workshops coordinated by outside experts on topics such as negotiating techniques, deposition skills and trial advocacy, as well as seminars on client relations, legal ethics, legal writing, business development and similar topics.  Use of the firm's videotaping equipment and extensive library of video training tapes enhances many of these programs.<P>

<P>

<HR><P>
The group system is designed to allow associates to develop expertise and assume new responsibilities at a steady pace.<P>

<HR>

<P>

	In addition to this firm-wide training program, each practice group sponsors training programs relevant to its areas of expertise.  An associate may supplement these in-house practice group programs by attending outside Continuing Legal Education seminars.  Each associate meets semi-annually with the Deputy Manager of his or her group and the Chair or Vice Chair of the Associates Committee, to focus on career development issues that are relevant to that individual associate.<P>

<P>

Each associate annually receives a formal written evaluation of his or her professional progress; in addition, the firm gives each new associate an informal review a few months after arrival.  These evaluations are based on the assessments of all the lawyers for whom the associate has performed significant work during the year; the results are communicated directly to the associate both orally and in writing.  Through the evaluation process, the firm makes a conscious effort to identify and fill gaps in professional experience and to respond to associates' changes in interest and developing expertise.  Evaluations in the sixth and seventh years include a careful and candid assessment of each associate's partnership prospects.  Decisions regarding election to partnership ordinarily are made in the eighth year after law school graduation.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Fostering Diversity</h3>

<P>

It has always been Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>'s goal to hire a diverse group of interesting individuals who are excellent attorneys.  Our attorneys hail from more than fifty different law schools, both U.S. and foreign, and many have had significant careers before joining the firm -- as journalists, business executives, and academics, including professors of English, political science, foreign languages and philosophy. <P>

<P>

	Being a good lawyer is hard work, and we work hard at it.  Nonetheless, many of our lawyers continue to pursue varied interests outside the law.  Our firm includes a playwright with hit productions on Broadway.  Our lawyers also play leading roles in civic, charitable and professional organizations.<P>

<P>

	We are as proud of our accomplishments outside the office as of our victories in the legal arena.  Sharing the rich diversity of our experiences -- both at work and outside the office environment -- increases substantially the rewards associated with the practice of law and contributes to the collegial and informal atmosphere that characterizes Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Commitment to Equal Opportunity</h3>

<P>

Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> strives to make a reality of its strong philosophical commitment to equal opportunity.  The firm is a charter signatory to the Policy Statement Regarding Minority Hiring and Retention of the District of Columbia Conference on Opportunities for Minorities in the Legal Profession; the firm participates in several minority clerkship programs and engages in a variety of outreach programs in an effort to attract minority candidates. The firm has a high percentage of women partners. <P>

<P>
<h3 align=center>Pro Bono and Community Activities</h3>

<P>

Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> has a strong tradition of pro bono representation and takes seriously the obligation in the Code of Professional Responsibility to provide free legal services to those in need.  <P>

<P>

Our organizational structure includes a Public Service Counsel -- an attorney whose full time responsibility is to oversee our Public Service Program, including the development and staffing of pro bono matters within the firm.  Our Public Service Counsel also represents Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> in the pro bono legal community, actively working with the District of Columbia Bar Association and various providers of legal services to broaden the scope of pro bono participation by the legal community.<P>

<P>

Our Public Service Counsel, together with our Public Service Committee, develops policy for our pro bono practice and reviews and evaluates proposed and ongoing pro bono activities.  Participation in the Public Service Program by Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> attorneys is broad-based, and cases are staffed by partners and associates from all of our practice groups.  Many of our attorneys initiate projects in areas in which they have a personal or professional interest.  Our program is also enriched by the fact that attorneys from differing practice areas often work collectively on pro bono matters, bringing their varying perspectives and expertise to the case.  In addition, the firm offers a series of speaker forums and arranges for training covering a wide spectrum of pro bono activities.<P>

<P>

	Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> is a charter signatory to the American Bar Association Law Firm Challenge, designed to enhance the public service commitment among the nation's largest law firms.  As a charter signatory to this initiative, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> has pledged to devote five percent of the firm's billable hours to pro bono representations; to enlist the majority of both partners and associates in the firm's Public Service Program; and to continue to direct the majority of our pro bono efforts toward providing legal services to persons of limited means or on behalf of organizations in matters primarily designed to assist persons of limited means.  In addition, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> is fully involved in the public service activities of the District of Columbia Bar Association.<P>

<P>

	Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>'s efforts have been recognized by numerous public service organizations.  The District of Columbia Bar Association awarded the firm its Annual Pro Bono Award for 1993, the highest honor given to a law firm for its public service commitment.  In addition, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>, either as an institution or through its individual attorneys, has been recognized in recent years by the International Human Rights Law Group, the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, the Washington Area Lawyers for the Arts and the Service Members Legal Defense Network. <P>

<P>The types of pro bono cases handled at the firm are varied, and have included representation of:<P>

<P>

&#183;	several law school graduates previously involved in criminal activity, in an effort to show current moral suitability for admission to the Bar<P>

<P>

&#183;	a parents' advocacy group in an action to remedy rampant fire code violations throughout the local public school system<P>

<P>

&#183;	political refugees from a number of countries in their applications for political asylum<P>

<P>

&#183;	a number of individuals and classes of individuals in sex and race discrimination claims.<P>

<P>

Many Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> attorneys and staff are participating in an adopt-a-school program through which the firm is assisting local school children and their families with legal, social service and educational services.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Summer Associate Program</h3>

<P>

The summer associate program is one of the most important elements of the firm's recruitment effort.  If you receive an offer to join us as a summer associate, we have made an initial judgment that you can make a valuable contribution to the firm's work.  A significant portion of our associate hiring each year comes from the summer associate group of previous years, and a high percentage of our former summer associates who enter private practice in Washington return to the firm.<P>

<P>

	We make every effort to give our summer associates a rounded view of Washington law practice.  Summer associate assignments are designed to provide a variety of substantive work and the broadest possible exposure to our lawyers.  In order to help ensure that these assignments match the work preferences of our summer associates, we have adopted an &quot;open book&quot; system, a notebook of assignments from which summer associates may, with a minimum of guidance, choose their own projects.  <P>

<P>

	In addition, over the summer we keep a special calendar of trials, arguments, depositions, negotiations and other legal activities in which the firm is involved, and we encourage summer associates to attend as many of these events as possible.  We host weekly seminars which cover the firm's organization, its practice, and other matters of topical interest, with presentations by speakers both inside and outside of the firm.  We also try to give our summer associates direct exposure to those institutions that make Washington unique -- the Supreme Court, the Congress and the executive agencies.  <P>

<P>

	It is important to us that we get to know our summer associates not just within the office environment, but also in more informal settings.  To that end, we sponsor a varied program of events, ranging from sailing to theater parties, at which summer associates have the chance to get acquainted with firm attorneys as well as with one another.<P>

<P>

The firm offers a program which provides a number of our summer associates the opportunity to spend a portion of their summer working for public interest organizations in Washington, D.C.  As part of the Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> Summer Public Service Program, second-year law students are sponsored by the firm to spend four weeks with a public service group in an area of interest to them after completing eight weeks as a summer associate at the firm.<P>

<P>

How well our summer associate program succeeds is best judged by those who have been in it, and we strongly encourage you to talk with former program participants.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>Firm Management</h3>

<P>

The firm has an exceptionally democratic governance structure.  Membership on major firm committees rotates regularly so that important policy questions are decided on a broadly representative basis.  In addition, associates at all levels play an active role in many aspects of the firm's administration through membership on firm committees.  Approximately thirty associates currently serve on key firm committees, including the Hiring, Associates, and Professional Training Committees.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>The Phoenix Office</h3>

<P>

Since opening in 1987, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>'s Phoenix office has expanded its practice significantly and currently has 25 attorneys serving clients in the Southwest.  The Phoenix office has a broad-based practice, including business transactions, commercial and employment litigation, media and communications law, water rights and environmental law and real estate development and finance.  In addition to Arizona matters, Phoenix office attorneys are involved in regional and national cases as well, often working closely with their Washington colleagues in areas in which the firm has established a national reputation, such as government contracts law and sophisticated insurance coverage disputes.<P>

<P>

	Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> in Phoenix is neither a free-standing branch operation nor merely an extension of the firm's original Washington base.  The office manages its own representations and staffing requirements but also is intimately involved in the work of the firm as a whole.  Phoenix partners serve on the firm's Executive Committee and on the committee which recommends the selection of new partners.  Phoenix partners and associates serve on the firm's Associates Committee and Professional Training Committee.  Associates joining the firm in Phoenix can expect to deal with a variety of transactional, counseling and litigation matters.  Given the office's relatively small size, associates have the opportunity to work on a wide range of matters and rapidly assume substantial responsibilities.  Like their colleagues in Washington, Phoenix associates have access to the firm's extensive research and in-house training resources, and receive detailed annual evaluations to assist them in understanding their strengths as well as areas that require additional attention.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>The Moscow Affiliate</h3>

<P>

In early 1990, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> became the first U.S. law firm to form a joint venture with a group of private Russian attorneys to provide legal services in the former Soviet Union.  Subsequently reorganized as &quot;Steptoe &amp; Johnson International,&quot; this affiliate represents U.S. and other clients engaged in business in the republics constituting the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.  The affiliate has both Russian and American attorneys in Moscow.<P>

<P>

Supported by the firm's strong international trade and investment practice in Washington, Steptoe &amp; Johnson International assists clients in activities ranging from sales of goods or technology to participation in sophisticated investment arrangements.   Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> attorneys negotiate investment and financing agreements, seek the development and  reform of both countries' investment and trade laws and guide clients through the maze of rapidly evolving U.S. and republic regulations applicable to investment in the former Soviet Union.<P>

<P>

	Using the Moscow affiliate as a springboard, the firm is expanding its services throughout Central and Eastern Europe.<P>

<P>

<P>

<h3 align=center>General Information and Benefits</h3>

<P>

The firm interviews applicants at approximately twenty law school campuses and conducts regional interviews throughout the country.  In addition, we solicit resumes from interested students through the placement directors at dozens of other law schools. <P>

<P>

Letters of inquiry are answered within two or three weeks.  After initial interviews at law schools, the Hiring Committee extends invitations to visit Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> at the firm's expense.  We prefer not to make a hiring decision until we have had a chance to review an applicant's law school transcript, and we therefore request an unofficial copy of the transcript from all candidates as a routine matter.<P>

<P>

Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> seeks to maintain salaries and benefits for both associates and summer associates that are competitive with those offered by other major Washington-based firms.  Summer associates receive an allowance for travel expenses.  Incoming attorneys are reimbursed for household moving and travel expenses in accordance with a policy that is available on request.  Incoming attorneys just graduating from law school who will be starting work shortly after completion of the District of Columbia bar exam, or of another bar exam on which an application for waiver into the D.C. Bar may be based, also receive a stipend to assist with bar review, living and other expenses while preparing for the exam.<P>

<P>

We welcome your applications and inquiries.  Please address them to our Director of Associate Services and Recruiting, Rosemary Kelly Morgan.  <P>

<p align="center"><b>The New Encryption Policy</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>By Stewart A. Baker and Peter Lichtenbaum</b> </p>

<p>There seems to be an iron law of Washington policy-making: If
you solve a tough policy problem on Monday, when you come into
work on Tuesday, you won't find one solved problem on your desk. You'll
find a new problem that arises out of Monday's solution. </p>

<p>Certainly the Clinton Administration's recent announcement of
a new encryption policy suggests that this law is still in
effect. The problem the Administration has been trying to solve
is as vexing as any it has ever faced. Exports of encryption
products -- powerful techniques to encode data and communications --
have long been a sore point between the Administration and industry.
Industry argues that sophisticated data scrambling is needed to
preserve business confidentiality and privacy in the computer age.
The Administration argues that its ability to conduct law
enforcement and intelligence operations will be severely
compromised if strong encryption products spread around the world. </p>

<p>And as usual in such deeply fought debates, both sides are
right. The conflict has been especially difficult because it has
the air of a family quarrel. Silicon Valley companies expect this
Administration to understand the importance of key technologies
and have been stunned by the Administration's refusal to yield on
export controls. </p>

<p>For their part, the Administration's high-tech boosters feel
they ought to get the benefit of the doubt when they ask industry
to adopt a more law-enforcement-friendly style of encryption.
Standard encryption treats the encryption &quot;key&quot; --
equivalent to a safe's combination -- as a secret that can never be
revealed. The Administration prefers &quot;key recovery&quot;
products that set aside the encryption keys in a place where they
can be recovered later -- either by the user if the user turns
out to be forgetful or by the government with a search warrant if
the user turns out to be a crook. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, the Administration announced a new solution
to this dilemma. It would yield something to those who manufacture
old-style encryption if they would agree to start building key-recovery
encryption soon. A previously almost unexportable encryption
product, known as DES or the Digital Encryption Standard, would
now be broadly exportable. But the only companies that could benefit
from this liberalization were those that made a commitment to
develop and sell key recovery products within two years. </p>

<p>Several big high-tech companies expressed interest in taking
the government up on this offer. The policy remained controversial,
but the Administration was understandably pleased with the
reaction to its solution. </p>

<p>But that was Monday. </p>

<p>By Tuesday, the government had a new and equally difficult
problem to solve. Remember that the ability to export old-style DES
is only temporary -- lasting up to two years. For many companies seeking
to export DES products during the two-year window, a critical
question is what will happen to their customers once the two-year
window closes. Specifically, will </p>

<p>the old DES products work with the new key recovery products
being developed? If not, customers buying the DES products could
be stranded in two years. </p>

<p>And that flies in the face of everything the computer industry
has learned about its customers. Companies like Intel and Microsoft
owe their success to &quot;backward compatibility.&quot; Backward compatibility
means that each new generation of Microsoft and Intel products
not only does amazing new things -- it also runs all your old
software, better and faster. </p>

<p>So why is the U.S. government bucking this tide by asking
producers and consumers to drop DES cold in two years? Well, try
looking at it from the government's perspective. If the new
key-recovery encryption works seamlessly with plain old-fashioned
DES, then the old style of DES may never entirely disappear. Even
if key recovery encryption sweeps the country, pockets of crooks
can go on using their FBI-proof encryption systems without
suffering even modest inconvenience. That is not a world that the FBI
wants to live in. And so it argues for a strict cut-off at the
end of two years. </p>

<p>How will this debate turn out? We'd put our money on those
arguing for flexibility and interoperability. The lesson taught
by Microsoft and Intel is just too plain to be ignored. It takes
a miracle to get customers to throw out their old hardware and software
in one dramatic break with the past. If buying key-recovery
encryption means customers must give up all of their legacy
encryption systems, key recovery products will carry a near-fatal
burden in many markets where encryption is now used widely. The
transition to key recovery will have to be gradual or it won't
happen at all. </p>

<p>For the proponents of key recovery encryption, giving up their
demand for a strict cut-off will be a setback, but perhaps only a
temporary one. For the other lesson of the computer industry is
that technologies can be orphaned -- just not immediately. Three
years ago, no one in the PC world would have bought an operating
system that didn't run MS-DOS. Three years from now, we'll be
happy to buy an operating system that is backward-compatible with
Windows 95 but not with MS-DOS. And then, at last, we'll throw
out all our old DOS programs. </p>

<p>The same could be true for key-recovery encryption -- but only
if its proponents manage to show as much patience and market
savvy as Bill Gates. </p>

commerce and robust, secure communications worldwide while protecting the
public safety and national security.  To that end, this Administration is
consulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state and
local law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major initiative
to liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect
their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.  It
will support the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of
the global information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S.
encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key management
infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption products
will be permitted under a general license after one-time review, and contingent
upon industry commitments to build and market future products that support
key recovery.  This policy will apply to hardware and software products.
 The relaxation of controls will last up to two years.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technology
strategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the ultimate
solution must be market-driven.<BR>
<BR>
Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make commitments
to develop and sell products that support the key recovery system that I
announced in July.  That vision presumes that a trusted party (in some cases
internal to the user's organization) would recover the user's confidentiality
key for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under proper authority.
 Access to keys would be provided in accordance with destination country
policies and bilateral understandings.  No key length limits or algorithm
restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products.<BR>
<BR>
Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain
free to use any encryption system domestically.<BR>
<BR>
The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption
policy initiative designed to promote electronic information security and
public safety.  For export control purposes, commercial encryption products
will no longer be treated as munitions.  After consultation with Congress,
jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred from
the State Department to the Commerce Department.  The Administration also
will seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providing
penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery agents
against liability when they properly release a key.<BR>
<BR>
As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the purchase
of key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote key recovery arrangements
in bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop federal cryptographic
and key recovery standards, and stimulate the development of innovative
key recovery products and services.<BR>
<BR>
Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued after
one-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit benchmarks
and milestones for developing and incorporating key recovery features into
their products and services, and for building the supporting infrastructure
internationally.  Initial approval will be contingent on firms providing
a plan for implementing key recovery.  The plan will explain in detail the
steps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute, and/or market
encryption products with key recovery features.  The specific commitments
will depend on the applicant's line of business.<BR>
<BR>
The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periods
if milestones are met.  Two years from now, the export of 56-bit products
that do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted.  Currently
exportable 40-bit mass market software products will continue to be exportable.
 We will continue to support financial institutions in their efforts to
assure the recovery of encrypted financial information.  Longer key lengths
will continue to be approved for products dedicated to the support of financial
applications.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry, users,
state and local law enforcement, and other private sector representatives
with the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery.  Topics will
include:
<UL>
<LI>evaluating the developing global key recovery architecture
<LI>assessing lessons-learned from key recovery implementation
<LI>advising on technical confidence issues vis-a-vis access to and release
of keys
<LI>addressing interoperability and standards issues
<LI>identifying other technical, policy, and program issues for governmental
action.
</UL>
The Administration's initiative is broadly consistent with the recent recommendations
of the National Research Council.  It also addresses many of the objectives
of pending Congressional legislation.<BR>

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/FERC Regulatory Practice
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>FERC Regulatory Practice</CENTER>
</H2>


<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have participated in a wide variety of regulatory
proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) since the creation of that agency in 1977, as well as
before the FERC's predecessors, the Federal Power Commission
(FPC) and the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).

<h4><CENTER>Oil Pipeline Proceedings </CENTER></h4>

<P>Beginning with the ICC's rulemaking and adjudicatory proceedings
that ultimately led to the issuance of the FERC's Opinion 154-B
ratemaking guidelines, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has been an active
participant in the rapidly evolving area of oil pipeline
regulation.  This has included key roles in the major
proceedings involving pipelines both in Alaska and in the
lower-48 states.  In addition to counseling numerous pipeline
companies with respect to applicable law and FERC policies, the
firm has participated in such litigated matters as the
following:  

<H4><CENTER>Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)</CENTER></H4>
Steptoe & Johnson LLP has
participated in virtually all phases of the legal disputes
involving the construction of TAPS and the litigation over the
TAPS rates, including, for numerous specific aspects of the case,
as lead counsel on behalf of all of the TAPS owners.  In
particular, Steptoe & Johnson LLP served as lead counsel in the
cost-of-service phase of the TAPS case before the FERC, and in
the related portion of the Alaska Public Utilities Commission
(APUC) proceeding.  Once the TAPS settlement was announced,
Steptoe & Johnson LLP took a primary role in securing its approval,
both before the FERC and before the APUC.

<P>More recently, the firm has represented the TAPS owners in
defending against the prudency challenge relating to the
inclusion in rates of the costs to repair the significant
corrosion experienced on the pipeline.  That matter involved the
use of an innovative <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/alternat.htm">Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</a> procedure, designed to avoid what would otherwise be a lengthy
and expensive FERC hearing on the merits.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP is
also currently representing a group of TAPS owners in contesting
a proposed connection to the TAPS system, and is representing
one of the owners with respect to the permissibility of a
surcharge imposed on oil shipped from certain fields serving the
pipeline.


<H4><CENTER>Lakehead Pipeline Company, Limited Partnership</CENTER></H4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP is representing Lakehead, which is part of the
world's longest and most complex oil pipeline system, in the
defense of Lakehead's first rate increase in nine years.  The
proceeding appears likely to involve a number of highly
significant issues, including those raised by a group of
protesting Canadian oil producers.  The case was
heard in May, 1993.

<H4><CENTER>Tecumseh Pipe Line Company</CENTER></H4>

<P>The firm recently represented Tecumseh in its first-ever rate
proceeding.  The case involved cost of service, rate design, and
other important issues, several of which had not previously been
raised in any FERC oil pipeline matter.  The case was settled
just prior to going to hearing in June, 1992.

<H4><CENTER>Kuparuk Transportation Company (KTC)</CENTER></H4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has
served as outside counsel for KTC throughout the more than seven
years that KTC's initial rate case was litigated before the FERC
and the APUC.  KTC, which is a partnership made up of
subsidiaries of ARCO, BP/Sohio and Unocal, operates a crude oil
pipeline on the North Slope of Alaska, connecting to TAPS. 
KTC's interstate rate case resulted in a Commission decision on
a range of significant issues under the Opinion 154-B
methodology.  Subsequently, the case was settled by KTC and the
contesting parties at the FERC and APUC (where approval of the
settlement remains pending).

<H4><CENTER>ARCO Pipe Line Company (APL)</CENTER></H4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has served as
outside counsel for APL in the FERC proceedings involving APL's
lower-48 crude and petroleum products tariff rates.  The first
of these ended in Commission rulings that APL's rates for its
crude and products systems were just and reasonable under the
governing cost-based methodology.  The second, which involved
the threshold issue whether APL had market power regarding its
products system tariffs, was terminated in 1991 after the
challenging shippers withdrew from the case.  

<H4><CENTER>Four Corners Pipe Line Company</CENTER></H4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP served as
outside counsel for Four Corners in a rate case before the FERC
that was initiated in late 1986.  The case ended in August 1987,
by a stipulated dismissal of the Commission's investigation
after the presentation of Four Corners' case-in-chief.

<H4><CENTER>Point Arguello Pipeline Company (PAPCO)</CENTER></H4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP served as co-counsel for PAPCO in its initial rate case, which
was filed in early 1988.  PAPCO is a partnership of eleven
corporations, including affiliates of Chevron, Phillips, ARCO,
Texaco and others, that constructed an oil pipeline and related
facilities to transport oil from platforms off the coast of
California to a terminal near Santa Barbara.  

<h4><CENTER>Natural Gas and Other Proceedings</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP is regularly involved in a variety of FERC
matters covering all aspects of the Commission's jurisdiction. 
For example, the firm has been involved in simultaneous
certificate and abandonment applications in which a pipeline and
producer sought to revamp their long-standing contractual
relationship.  The firm also has represented a lender in
connection with the transfer of a permit to operate a
hydroelectric power facility, and the refinancing of the project.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP represented one of the major participants in
the FERC's "Northeast open season" proceeding in which a variety
of pipelines were seeking permission to expand natural gas
pipeline capacity in the Northeastern United States.  The firm's
activity covered both regulatory and antitrust aspects of this
complex matter.

<P>In addition to FERC representations, Steptoe & Johnson LLP's energy
regulatory work frequently involves matters outside the
Commission, including litigated proceedings -- both in federal
and state trial and appellate courts.  

<h4><CENTER>Partners With Substantial FERC Experience</CENTER></h4>

<P>The following Steptoe & Johnson LLP partners have had substantial
involvement in energy matters before the FERC and other
agencies: 

<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/jordan.htm">Robert E. Jordan III</a> -- Mr. Jordan served as lead counsel for ARCO Pipe Line Company in Phase I of the TAPS proceeding, in the

One issue in working on pesticide regulation is that much of the critical <B>EPA guidance material</B> is not generally available.  PR Notices have not been readily accessible and EPA has many internal documents that function as regulations, but are never publicly issued.  To help address this situation, we have included the full text of some EPA documents, and summaries of others on our site.  We hope to add additional documents and categories over time.<P>

<P>

Selected<FONT size=+1><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pubtoc.htm #pr">
PR Notices</a></FONT> from 1993 forward are available here in full text.  This is not the entire set, but includes the most recent ones and those we frequently refer to.<P>

<P>

Summaries of <FONT size=+1><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pubtoc.htm #pcn">EPA Policy and Criteria Documents </a></FONT> that generally were issued before PR Notices became widely used at EPA are available here.  You can request hard copies of each complete document as well.<P>

Jerald S. Howe, Jr.</H2>

<blockquote><center>Space Law and Transactions</center></blockquote>



<P>Jerry Howe leads Steptoe & Johnson LLP's commercial space practice.  He has been extensively involved in strategic/legal planning for space infrastructure transactions; in drafting and negotiation of
a number of government and private agreements relating to the commercial development of outer space; and providing compliance related advice in a number of fields relevant to commercial space ventures.  These matters have involved space platforms, launch vehicles, communications satellites, and microgravity scienceprojects.

<P>This practice has also extended to providing international trade advice with respect to space commerce, and advice and representation regarding export controls and other aspects of
international space-related transactions.

<P>Mr. Howe's commercial space practice is complemented by an extensive practice in procurement law, primarily for clients engaged in aerospace, electronics, and other high-technology contracting.  This practice has involved him in matters of procurement integrity and government ethics requirements,
procurement costing and pricing, contract interpretation and administration, liability and indemnification, trade secrets and data rights and information law, and corporate acquisition projects involving government contracts.

<P>Before coming to Steptoe & Johnson LLP in 1984, Mr. Howe served for a year as judicial clerk to Judge George E. MacKinnon of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  He
is the immediate past President of the Federal Circuit Bar Association and chairs that Association's Judicial Selection Committee, participates as an active member of the Public Contract Law Section of the American Bar Association, and serves on the Board of the Washington Space Business Roundtable.

<p><b>ACTION</b>: Final rule. </p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b>: This rule would amend the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) by establishing an exemption for the temporary export
of cryptographic products for personal use. The effect of the change would
be to ease the burden on U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who
have the need to temporarily export cryptographic products when leaving
the U.S. for brief periods of time. </p>

<p><b>EFFECTIVE DATE</b>: February 16, 1996. </p>

<p><b>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</b>: Rose Biancaniello, Deputy Director
for Licensing, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Department of State, (703)
875-6643 or FAX (703) 875-6647. </p>

<p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</b>: The U.S. Government has since 1993,
at the direction of the President, been reviewing the U.S. policy regarding
the domestic use of, and export controls on, cryptographic technology.
While U.S. national security and foreign policy compel maintaining appropriate
export controls on cryptography, the Department of State has continued
to reform the export control procedures applicable to those products incorporating
cryptography which are controlled by the ITAR in Category XIII(b)(1). For
example, on September 2, 1994, the Department published (at 59 FR 45621)
a final rule change which created a new Section 124.15. The section provides
for a new arrangement by which the Department of State may provide approval
for category XIII(b)(1) cryptography products to be distributed by U.S.
manufacturers directly to foreign end users without obtaining an individual
license for each transaction. </p>

<p>After extensive review, the Department of State has decided to further
amend the regulations to provide for an exemption for the temporary export
of cryptographic products for personal use. The exemption does not apply
to other circumstances, for example, those in which a person contemplates
sales, marketing or demonstration. Nor does the exemption apply to exports
to destinations listed in Section 126.1 of the ITAR which are prohibited
by a United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export
(or for which the issuance of a license for the export) would be prohibited
by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act,
22 U.S.C. 2780, to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly
provided support for acts of international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria). </p>

<p>This rule amends Part 123 to add a new Section 123.27 to reduce the
burden on individual users of cryptographic products by providing an exemption
for the temporary export for personal use of products covered by Category
XIII(b)(1) when the product remains in the possession of the exporter or
the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling
with him/her. For purposes of this exemption, a product is considered to
be in the possession of the exporter if the exporter takes normal precautions
to ensure the security of the product by locking the product in a hotel
room, safe, or other comparably secure location; and, while in transit,
the exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or locked in
baggage accompanying the exporter which has been checked with the carrier.
</p>

<p>This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States
and thus is excluded from the procedures of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR
51735) and 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554. </p>

<p>However, interested parties are invited to submit written comments to
the Department of State, Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Attn:
Regulatory Change, Personal Use Cryptographic Products, Room 200, SA-6,
Washington, DC 20520-0602. </p>

<p>This rule affects collection of information subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq), and will serve to reduce the burden
on exporters by adding an exemption which will remove the current requirement
for a license. </p>

<h5>Paperwork Reduction Act </h5>

<p>The record-keeping requirement contained in section 123.27(b) has been
approved by OMB and has a control number of 1405-0103. An agency may not
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection
of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control
number. </p>

sales, marketing, or demonstration must be licensed in accordance with
policies and procedures established in this subchapter. </p>

<p>(ii) Special definition. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this

<h4>Who Is Affected</H4>

<P>While the Act applies principally to telecommunications carriers, defined broadly as any party "engaged in the transmission or switching of wire or electronic communications for hire," the Act will also have serious implications for vendors supplying these carriers with equipment and services.


<h4>Obligations of Telecommunications Carriers</H4>

<P>To comply with the Act's "capability" requirements, telecommunications carriers must ensure that, to the extent "reasonably achievable," their equipment and facilities:
<ol><LI>allow the government to intercept wire and electronic communications carried on their services;<P>
<LI>allow the government to collect reasonably available caller identification information;<P>
<LI>can deliver intercepted communications and caller identification information to the government in a form that allows the government to retransmit that information;<P>
<LI>can facilitate authorized surveillance unobtrusively and with minimum interference, so that the surveillance target is unaware of the surveillance.</ol><P>
<P>To comply with the Act's "capacity" requirements, telecommunications carriers must ensure that they make available sufficient capacity to satisfy government surveillance needs.  Guidance on the extent of the government's needs will be periodically published by the Attorney General, starting in October 1995.
To comply with the Act's "privacy" requirements, telecommunications carriers must adopt in-house controls to minimize the potential for unauthorized intercepts by employees or law enforcement.


<h4>Obligations of Equipment Manufacturers</H4>

<P>The Act also imposes obligations on "manufacturers of telecommunications transmission and switching equipment" and "support service providers," who must:
<ol><LI>consult with carriers to ensure that all current and proposed equipment will meet the government's surveillance requirements; and<P>
<LI>make available equipment, facilities, services, features, or modifications to carriers at a reasonable charge and on a reasonably timely basis, to facilitate carrier compliance with the government's requirements.</OL>

<P>In spite of these relatively modest obligations, equipment manufacturers will bear much of the burden of the Act because purchasers will demand equipment that ensures compliance with the Act's capability and capacity requirements.



<h4>Compliance Procedures</H4>

<P>The Act provides several avenues for companies to determine if their equipment, facilities, or services are in compliance with the government's requirements:<P>	
<ol><LI><I>Industry Standards</I>:  An industry association or standard-setting organization can issue standards for carrier compliance with the Act.  Compliance with these standards would be deemed to meet the statutory requirements, unless the standards are challenged.<P>
<LI><I>FCC Standards</I>:  A government official or private party can challenge industry standards as deficient.  If the industry standards are challenged, or if no such standards are issued for a given product or service, the FCC can establish compliance standards by rulemaking.<P>
<LI><I>Self-Assessment</I>:  A company could make a self-assessment of compliance, but assume the risk of a Justice Department enforcement action in federal court.<P>
<LI><I>FBI Approval</I>:  A company could also seek informal (or perhaps even formal) reassurance from the FBI.  Discussing compliance directly with the FBI would minimize the risk of a subsequent enforcement action and avoid a public FCC proceeding.</ol><P>

<h4>Government Reimbursement of Compliance Costs</H4>

<P>Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Attorney General may agree to pay carriers certain costs directly associated with modifications to retrofit existing equipment.  The Attorney General is generally not required to reimburse compliance costs for equipment, facilities, or services deployed after January 1, 1995.	

<p><hr><p>
<H3><a name="over">CALEA Overview</a></H3>

<h4>Policy Background</H4>

	<P>In passing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 ("CALEA," also referred to as the "Digital Telephony Act"), Congress responded to what FBI Director Louis Freeh characterized as an urgent law enforcement demand:  the preservation of law enforcement's ability to carry out authorized interceptions of personal communications irrespective of future technological advances.  CALEA intends to achieve this by requiring that, to the extent "reasonably achievable," telecommunications companies must design, build, and deploy equipment, facilities, and services that meet the government's surveillance requirements.

	<P>Prior to the 1990s, law enforcement could satisfy its surveillance requirements by putting alligator clips on wire telephone lines.  This required only minimal assistance from telephone common carriers, which were required to help law enforcement by the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act ("1968 Act," the general federal wiretap statute).  In the early 1990s, though, law enforcement encountered difficulties intercepting cellular communications and communications that employed enhanced services such as call forwarding, voice-mail transfer, speed-dial, and voice-dial.  Law enforcement officials asked Congress for help.  Their battle cry:  advances in telecommunications technology could have the practical effect of repealing the 1968 Act that authorized law enforcement wiretaps.

	<P>CALEA is perhaps best understood as a new development in the government's long-standing policy of requiring assistance from private parties in the conduct of electronic surveillance.  The duty of private parties to assist the government existed in the common law, and has been codified by Congress in the 1968 Act, the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("FISA"), and the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act ("ECPA").  But by imposing system design requirements, CALEA moves beyond the prior statutes that required only occasional operational assistance.

	<P>The final form of CALEA, as discussed in this memorandum, reflects a compromise among the interests of the three primary groups affected by the legislation:  <P>
<ul>
<LI>Law enforcement and intelligence agencies interested in continued access to private communications.  <P>
<LI>Privacy advocates, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, interested in limiting or at least imposing accountability on the government's interception of private communications.  <P>
<LI>Industries concerned that law enforcement demands could impede or add costs to the development and introduction of new communication technologies and services.	</ul><P>
	<P>The government's compromise with industry is reflected chiefly in two aspects of CALEA.  First, CALEA's requirements cannot be enforced against a given company unless that company's compliance is "reasonably achievable," and law enforcement has no other means to conduct the surveillance.  Second, CALEA provides a mechanism for the government to reimburse a company's compliance costs in certain circumstances, primarily for the cost of "retrofitting" equipment now in use.  The government placated privacy groups principally by making concessions unrelated to the core legislation concessions that increase the privacy rights of cordless telephone users and on-line network services subscribers.

<h4>Overview of Who Must Comply with CALEA</H4>

	<P>CALEA imposes different obligations on two groups:<P>
<OL><LI>CALEA imposes on telecommunications common carriers clear and potentially burdensome obligations to assist government electronic surveillance;  and<P>
<LI>CALEA imposes on manufacturers and support service providers only a vague duty to consult with the carriers and provide appropriate equipment to carriers at reasonable cost.  However, as discussed below, these categories should not be seen as unrelated -- carriers who must comply with CALEA will require equipment manufacturers to provide them equipment that ensures the carriers' compliance with CALEA's requirements. </OL><P>



<h4>Obligations of Telecommunications Carriers:  Definition of Telecommunications  Carriers</H4>
	<P>CALEA applies most directly to telecommunications common carriers.  The statute defines telecommunications common carrier as any entity "engaged in the transmission or switching of wire or electronic communications as a common carrier for hire." CALEA <I> 102(8)(a), codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1001(8)(a).  Legislative history suggests that the two key criteria in determining whether a company is considered a telecommunications common carrier under CALEA are:  (1) whether the company's service is made available directly to end-users; and (2) whether the company's service accesses the public switched network. <a href="#note1">[Footnote 1]</a>  <a name="back1"></a>Legislative history further suggests that CALEA's definition of telecommunications common carrier includes a broad spectrum of communications services available to consumers and connected to the public switch network.<a href="#note2">[Footnote 2]</a><a name="back2"></a>

	<P>The statute itself specifies two entities that are to be treated as telecommunication common carriers.  First, any entity "engaged in providing commercial mobile service" is a telecommunications common carrier.<a href="#note3">[Footnote 3]</a>  <a name="back3"></a>Second, any entity that provides a switching or transmission service that the FCC considers "a replacement for a substantial portion of the local telephone exchange service" can be considered a telecommunications common carrier for purposes of CALEA if the FCC decides that it is in the public interest to do so.  CALEA <I>102(8)(a), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1001(8)(a).  This second provision, at least, would appear to go beyond the commonly understood definition of a communications common carrier.

	<P>Certain telecommunications service providers are specifically excluded from CALEA's definition of telecommunications common carriers.  Entities "insofar as they are engaged in providing information services," are not telecommunications common carriers.  CALEA <I> 102(8)(c)(i), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1001(8)(c)(i).<a href="#note4">[Footnote 4]</a>  <a name="back4"></a>Also, entities whose equipment, facilities, or services either "support the transport or switching of communications for private networks or for the sole purpose of interconnecting telecommunications carriers," are exempted from the most onerous requirements of CALEA.<a href="#note5">[Footnote 5]</a>  <a name="back5"></a>Furthermore, "any class or category of telecommunications carriers that the [FCC] exempts by rule after consultation with the Attorney General" will not be considered telecommunications common carriers for purposes of CALEA.  CALEA <I> 102(8)(c)(ii), codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1001(8)(c)(ii).
 
<h4>Obligations of  Telecommunications Common Carriers</H4>
	<P>CALEA imposes three types of obligation on telecommunications carriers:  capability requirements, capacity requirements, and privacy requirements.  The capability requirements are the most significant.  

<h4>Capability Requirements In General</H4>
<P>	CALEA generally requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that by October 25, 1998, the government is capable of intercepting communications and obtaining call-identifying information from their customers ("capability requirements").  CALEA  <I>103(a), codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1002(a).<a href="#note6">[Footnote 6]</a>  <a name="back6"></a>Specifically, to comply with the capability requirements, a telecommunication common carrier must ensure that any equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber the ability to originate, terminate, or direct a communication allow the government, when authorized, to:

<P>(a) intercept all wire and electronic communications to and from a customer, either concurrently with the communication or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government;

<P>(b) record call-identifying information "reasonably available" to the carrier in a manner that allows the information to be associated with a specific communication, either before, during, or immediately after the communication or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government.<a href="#note7">[Footnote 7]</a><a name="back7"></a>  

<P>(c) deliver intercepted communications and call identifying information to the government in a format such that the government can retransmit that information to a location other than the premises of the carrier;

<P>(d) facilitate the interception of communications and collection of call identifying information unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with a subscriber's service.

	<P>These requirements require carriers to assist in the decryption of communications only if two specific conditions are met.  CALEA provides:  "A telecommunications carrier shall not be responsible for decrypting, or ensuring the government's ability to decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication." CALEA  <I>103(b)(3), codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1002(c)(3) (emphasis added).

<h4>Mobile Services</H4>
	<P>CALEA's capability requirements are modified slightly when applied to providers of mobile commercial services, as defined in Section 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, codified at <I>47 U.S.C. 332(d)</I>.  In addition to the obligations discussed above, carriers offering customers the ability to redirect, hand-off, or assign communications to another service area or another service provider must ensure that if the carrier loses access to a customer's communication or identifying information, the carrier can nonetheless identify the service provider that has acquired access to same.  CALEA  <I>103(d), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1002(d).

<h4>Capacity Requirements</H4>
	<P>A telecommunications common carrier must also ensure that it has available sufficient capacity to accommodate the government's law enforcement surveillance needs.  CALEA <I> 104, codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1003.  Legislative history suggests that these capacity requirements respond to law enforcement's concern that certain cellular systems with limited capacity were unable to accommodate a large number of intercepts simultaneously.  House Report at 14.  

	<P>No later than October 4, 1995, the Attorney General will publish an estimate of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all anticipated government interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices.  CALEA requires that, to the extent practicable, the Attorney General identify the capacity required at specific geographic locations, and the capacity required based upon the type of equipment or service, the number of subscribers, the type or size of the carrier, and the nature of the service area.  CALEA  <I>104(a)(2), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1003(a)(2).  Thereafter, the Attorney General will periodically publish notices of any increased capacity requirements that the government anticipates.  Id. 

	<P>A telecommunications carrier subject to CALEA must respond to the Attorney General's notices within six months of their publication in the Federal Register to identify any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity the government may require.  CALEA <I> 104(d), codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1003(d).  Telecommunications carriers subject to CALEA must also ensure that, after October 1998, they can expeditiously accommodate the government's maximum capacity requirements, as estimated by the Attorney General.  CALEA  <I>104(b)(2), codified at 47 U.S.C. </I> 1003(b)(2).

	<P>Unlike the capability requirements, which are mandatory except when specific conditions are met, the capacity requirements are dependent on the availability of government reimbursement.  CALEA provides that until the Attorney General agrees to reimburse a carrier for the expansion of its capacity to meet the government's requirements, the carrier shall be considered in compliance with the capacity requirements.  CALEA <I>104(e), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1003(e).  This suggests that a carrier would have no obligation to comply with the capability requirements until the government agreed to pay the costs of compliance.

<h4>Privacy Requirements</H4>
	<P>CALEA requires telecommunications common carriers to adopt in-house controls to limit the potential for either law enforcement or the carrier's employees to conduct unauthorized intercepts.  CALEA <I> 105, codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1004.  Specifically, CALEA requires that in accordance with regulations to be issued by the FCC, a carrier must implement procedures to ensure that interceptions of communications or access to call-identifying information effected within the carrier's switching premises can only be obtained (1) in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization, and, (2) with the affirmative intervention of an employee of the carrier.  CALEA at  <I>301, codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 229.  The purpose of this provision was to preclude the government from conducting automated remote surveillance.

<h4>Obligations of Equipment Manufacturers and Support Service Suppliers </H4>

	<P>Companies that supply support services or equipment to telecommunications common carriers also have obligations under CALEA.  CALEA imposes limited obligations on "manufacturers of telecommunications transmission and switching equipment," as well as "providers of telecommunication support services."<a href="#note8">[Footnote 8]</a><a name="back8"></a>

	<P>Manufacturers and support services providers must:   (a) consult with carriers to ensure that all current and proposed equipment, facilities, and services will meet the government's capability and capacity requirements; and (b) make available equipment, facilities, services, features, or modifications to carriers at a reasonable charge and on a reasonably timely basis, as necessary for the carrier to comply with CALEA's capability requirements.  CALEA <I>106, 107, codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1005, 1006.

	<P>The Attorney General can enforce these requirements through an order of a federal district court.  CALEA <I> 201(a), codified at 18 U.S.C.</I> 2522.  CALEA provides that the court "may direct that a provider of support services to the carrier or the manufacturer of the carrier's transmission or switching equipment furnish forthwith modifications necessary for the carrier to comply [with CALEA.]"  Id.  Failure to comply with the order could result in civil penalties of $10,000 per day.  Id.

	<P>While the direct statutory requirements imposed by CALEA on equipment manufacturers and support service providers are not great, the practical impact of CALEA is nonetheless significant to them.  CALEA's requirements are designed to flow from the retail telecommunications service providers through to other components of telecommunications systems, including equipment manufacturers.  Given the size of investments in telecommunications systems, neither equipment manufacturers nor carriers can afford to assume the risk that the common carrier will be found in violation of CALEA because of the underlying system's design.  Accordingly, the limited direct statutory obligations of equipment manufacturers should not lead an equipment manufacturer to disregard the requirements of the Act.

<h4>Procedures for Compliance with CALEA</H4>  

	<P>Providers of telecommunications services, especially new services, will have a pressing need to determine how they can comply with CALEA.  A company that is uncertain of the extent to which CALEA applies to its proposed service has at least three and possibly four options.  Under the statute,  the company can (1)  participate in industry-wide standards setting;  (2)  ask the FCC to decide how much compliance is "reasonably achievable;"  (3)  make an independent assessment of what is reasonably achievable, and live with the risk of a subsequent Justice Department enforcement action.  At least one further option seems likely to emerge as companies struggle to define their obligations under CALEA:  (4)  negotiate compliance directly with the Justice Department (and perhaps the FCC), leading to either a formal or informal settlement.  The appropriate avenue for achieving compliance will vary from company to company and industry to industry.

<h4>Industry or FCC Established Standards</H4>  
	<P>Industry associations and standard setting organizations, in consultation with law enforcement officials, are authorized to publish standards that they believe meet CALEA's requirements.  These standards constitute a "safe harbor" if carriers, manufacturers, or support service providers comply with the standards, they are deemed to have met the statutory requirements, at least until the standards are challenged and changed by the FCC.  CALEA <I>107(a), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I>  1006(a).

	<P>Any government agency or any private party can by petition to the FCC challenge the industry association's or standard-setting organization's standards as deficient.  If the industry standards are challenged, or if the private sector does not issue standards, the FCC can establish technical requirements or standards by rulemaking after consultation with the Attorney General.  CALEA <I>107(b), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1006(b).<a href="#note9">[Footnote 9]</a>    <a name="back9"></a>Compliance with standards established by the FCC would constitute compliance with CALEA.  Id.   

<h4>Company Specific FCC Standards</H4>
	<P>An individual company can petition the FCC to determine the extent to which the company must comply with CALEA's capability requirements.  With respect to equipment, facilities, and services deployed after January 1, 1995,<a href="#note10">[Footnote 10]</a> <a name="back10"></a>CALEA provides that, on petition from a company, the FCC will determine whether the company's compliance with CALEA's capability requirements is "reasonably achievable."  CALEA  <I>109(b), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1008(b).  The FCC should reach a determination of what is "reasonably achievable" within one year.  Id.   

	<P>The FCC's central inquiry in such a proceeding would be "whether compliance would impose significant difficulty or expense on the carrier or on the users of the carrier's systems."  Id.  The FCC will have discretion about how to weigh the following ten factors identified by Congress as relevant:<P>


<ol><LI>The effect on public safety and national security.<P>
<LI>The effect on rates for basic residential telephone service.<P>
<LI>The need to protect the privacy and security of  communications not authorized to be intercepted.<P>
<LI>The need to achieve the capability assistance requirements by cost-effective methods.<P>
<LI>The effect on the nature and cost of the equipment, facilities, or service at issue.<P>
<LI>The policy of the United States to encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the public.<P>
<LI>The financial resources of the telecommunications carrier.<P>
<LI>The effect on competition in the provision of telecommunications services.<P>
<LI>The extent to which the design and development of the equipment, facility, or service was initiated before January 1, 1995.<P>
<LI>Such other factors as the FCC deems appropriate.</ol><P>

	<P>If the FCC determines that compliance is not "reasonably achievable," the company may request the Attorney General to reimburse a portion of the company's anticipated costs of compliance.  If the Justice Department agrees to reimburse the company, it may not be required to pay the entire costs of compliance only the costs of getting the company to the "reasonably achievable" threshold, from which the company must pay its own way.  If the Justice Department does not agree to reimburse the company, the company is deemed to be in compliance with CALEA's capability requirements.    

<h4>Self-Assessment and Federal Court Enforcement</H4>
	<P>A company could also conduct a self-assessment of how much compliance with CALEA is "reasonably achievable."  But the company would remain exposed indefinitely to a Justice Department enforcement action, either an action for a court order authorizing government surveillance in a specific law enforcement investigation, or an enforcement action in district court unrelated to a specific surveillance need.  CALEA <I> 201(a), codified at 18 U.S.C.</I>  2522.  In either case, the court could only order compliance if the court found that:<p>
<ul><LI>alternative technologies or capabilities, or the facilities of another carrier, are not reasonably available to law enforcement; and<p>
<LI>compliance is reasonably achievable through the application of available technology to the equipment, facility, or service at issue, or would have been reasonably achievable if timely action had been taken.</ul><P>
	<P>This standard provides a defense to companies that believe their systems cannot be modified at a reasonable cost.  But a company's reliance on these defenses carries a high risk.  If the company invests in technology that does not comply with CALEA, and an alternative technology that the company did not use is later found to meet the "reasonably achievable" standard, the court could order the company to replace its equipment without reimbursement; the court might also order the company to suspend service until its system complied with CALEA. 
 
<h4>Company Specific Negotiated Settlements</H4>
	<P>Given the complexity of many new telecommunications services, a negotiated, company-specific compliance plan may well prove necessary in many cases.  Most companies will want a binding assurance in advance that their system or product's design is adequate for law enforcement's purposes.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), the part of the Justice Department charged with enforcement of CALEA, has recently established a telecommunications industry liaison unit to assist industry compliance with CALEA.  But it remains to be seen whether the FBI will be authorized or willing to certify or otherwise approve a company's compliance with CALEA.  No such authority is conferred by the statute. On the other hand, recognizing the need for greater certainty, FBI officials have indicated a willingness to consider issuing a certification letter upon request of a company that has demonstrated its compliance to the FBI's satisfaction.  

	<P>As an alternative, it seems likely that a company will be able to reach some kind of formal agreement with the FBI and Justice Department as to what constitutes acceptable compliance.  Since the Attorney General can enforce CALEA through a civil action in district court, it follows that the Attorney General could also settle the issue of a company's compliance through entry of a settlement in district court.  Such a settlement might prove preferable to a public FCC proceeding on whether a company's compliance with CALEA is "reasonably achievable."  Though not specifically provided for in CALEA, this process may be feasible to pursue when both the government and the private company share a common interest in not publicizing the technical details of how the government will intercept communications on the company's telecommunications system.

<h4>Recovery of Compliance Costs</H4>

	<P>Government reimbursement to companies for certain costs associated with compliance was a central reason for industry acquiescence in this legislation.  CALEA authorized, but did not appropriate, a total of $500 million to cover reimbursement costs to be paid by the Justice Department in fiscal years 1995 to 1998.  CALEA at <I>110, 47 U.S.C.</I> 1009.  (The Justice Department is seeking $100 million in appropriations for the 1996 fiscal year.)  Different procedures apply to reimbursement for compliance with (a) the capability requirements; and (b) the capacity requirements. 

<h4>Capability Requirements</H4>
		<P>For equipment, facilities, or services deployed after January 1, 1995, the private sector must pay for compliance so long as compliance is reasonably achievable.  Government reimbursement is only available at the discretion of the Attorney General after an FCC finding that a company's compliance with CALEA is not "reasonably achievable."  CALEA  <I>108(c)(2), 109(b), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 107(c)(2), 1008(b).  As discussed above, if the Attorney General fails to reimburse the company in such a situation, the company is considered to be in compliance with CALEA's capability requirements.  Id.<a href="#note11">[Footnote 11]</a><name="back11"></a>


<h4>Capacity Requirements</H4>
<P>	As noted in the discussion of capacity requirements, a telecommunications carrier subject to CALEA must respond to the Attorney General's notices within six months of their publication in the Federal Register.  In its response, the company must identify any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity the Attorney General requires.  CALEA <I>104(d), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1003(d).  

	<P>Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Attorney General may agree to reimburse a carrier for reasonable costs directly associated with meeting the government's capacity requirements.  Until the Attorney General agrees to reimburse the carrier, the carrier shall be considered in compliance with the capacity requirements of CALEA.  CALEA  <I>104(e), codified at 47 U.S.C.</I> 1003(e).

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Labor Relations and Employment Law
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Labor Relations and Employment Law</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP offers a wide range of experience and expertise in all areas of labor
relations and employment law.  Between its Washington, D.C. and
<a href="http://www.steptoe.com/phoenix.htm">Phoenix, Arizona offices</a>, the firm has more than a dozen lawyers
whose practices are fully dedicated to this area of the law.

<h4><CENTER>Employment Discrimination</CENTER></h4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has been prominent in the area of employment
discrimination law since the early 1970s when it represented
AT&T, at the time the nation's largest employer, in
administrative litigation and negotiations to resolve nationwide
claims of race and sex discrimination.  Since that time, our
lawyers have represented employers in civil rights litigation at
all levels of the state and federal system throughout the United
States.  These cases have included local jury trials, large
class actions, enforcement proceedings brought by government
agencies, and appellate proceedings, involving allegations of
bias due to race, sex, age, national origin, disability, and
religion.  Our lawyers have frequently participated in Supreme
Court cases in the equal employment area, representing parties
and amici.  For example,Tom Powers, former Executive Director of
the EEOC, successfully argued two of the most significant cases
to be decided by the Court in this area, <U>Weber v. Kaiser Alum. &
Chem. Corp.</U> and <U>Falcon v. General Telephone Co.</U>  In recent
years, we have litigated numerous cases involving claims of sex,
disability and age discrimination, sexual harassment, and
unlawful retaliation under the civil rights laws.  Our attorneys
frequently lecture and write on new developments in this field
around the country.

<h4><CENTER>Wrongful Discharge Cases</CENTER></h4>
<P>As state legislatures and courts throughout the country have
expanded individual employee rights and created new causes of
action for employees, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have been in
the forefront of representing employers in wrongful termination
and related state court proceedings based on contract and tort
theories arising out of employment disputes.

<P>Our capabilities in this area were expanded significantly in
1992 with the addition to our Phoenix office of a group of
employment lawyers headed by <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/katz.htm">Larry Katz</a> and <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/selden.htm">Dave Selden</a>.  Larry
brought to the firm more than twenty-five years of  experience
representing management clients in traditional labor relations
matters, equal employment opportunity law, and all areas
of employment litigation.  Larry enjoys a national reputation in
this field, with broad experience in the litigation of
employment discrimination and wrongful termination claims.  He
has successfully litigated jury trials on behalf of such large
employers as Allied Signal, Motorola, Wyle Laboratories, and
America West Airlines.

<P>Dave Selden's specialties have included representation of
public employers, construction companies and employers with
disputes arising under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
Adding Larry, Dave and their colleagues to our team of
experienced Washington labor attorneys has given the firm an
extremely broad and talented base in this critical area of
practice.  We have remained on the cutting edge in several
developing areas of employment litigation, defending several
cases brought by alleged whistleblowers, plaintiffs asserting
unique coverage under the disability laws, and "glass ceiling"
challenges.

<h4><CENTER>Employer Counseling</CENTER></h4>

<P>In addition to litigation, our employment lawyers also provide
advice on the growing range of employment law issues affecting the day-to-day personnel
activities of corporations. These include, in particular,
questions involving force reductions and early retirement
programs, the development of sexual harassment and disability
policies, the drafting of personnel manuals, employment
contracts and severance agreements, and the resolution of
grievances through internal proceedings or arbitration.

<P>Our lawyers have particular expertise in issues involving the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act.  In addition, <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/cooper.htm">Ron Cooper</a>
of our Washington office was actively involved, on behalf of
management clients, in the legislative process that led to the
Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, which has a particular
impact on "window plans" and employee waivers.  Our attorneys
are also frequently called upon to advise clients regarding the
WARN Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the Family
and Medical Leave Act.  Moreover, employment issues are often
inextricably related to benefit issues under ERISA, and our
employee benefit lawyers often work closely with our employment
lawyers in advising and representing clients.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP
attorneys have frequently been consulted with respect to labor
relations issues growing out of mergers, acquisitions and other
corporate reorganizations and restructuring, in both union and
non-union settings.

<h4><CENTER>Federal Contract Compliance</CENTER></h4>

<P>For employers who do business with the federal government, we
provide assistance in the development and implementation of
affirmative action plans.  We also represent clients in
connection with investigations and audits by federal agencies
such as the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. 
Because the Executive Order programs are based on the federal
procurement process, our work in this area benefits
substantially from the expertise of our Government Contracts
Group. In turn, the firm's employment lawyers are often
consulted with respect to internal investigations conducted by
the Government Contracts Group, or reviews undertaken by
government contracting agencies, in order to minimize the
prospect of claims by adversely affected employees.  In recent
years, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has frequently been retained to defend
qui tam actions initiated by employees claiming that their
companies have violated government contracts.

<h4><CENTER>Whistleblower Law</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have been very active in
representing employers in litigation brought by "whistleblowers"
as well as client requests for advice in such matters. 

<P>We have extensive experience in litigating such cases under the
federal environmental statutes, and our firm has developed an
unparalleled private database of legal precedents in this arena.

<P>We also have represented clients in sensitive inquiries by
regulators and Congress.

<h4><CENTER>Traditional Labor Relations</CENTER></h4>
<P>We also represent clients in connection with union organizing
campaigns, representation elections, unfair labor practice
charges, and collective bargaining.  Our employment lawyers have
substantial experience in these areas, having successfully
assisted numerous companies in defeating union campaigns in the
last several years.  Furthermore, Larry Katz played a
significant role in establishing the employer's right to take
legal action against a union which makes defamatory statements
during an organizing campaign, when he successfully argued <U>NLRB
v. Bill Johnson LLP's Restaurants</U> in the U.S. Supreme Court a few
years ago.

<P>In conjunction with the firm's <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/transpt2.htm">Transportation Group</a>, we
represent both rail and air carriers in connection with Railway
Labor Act matters.  In addition, with the increased importance
of health benefits to labor relations, we benefit from our close
association with the firm's ERISA Group.

<h4><CENTER>Labor Standards</CENTER></h4>

<P>Our employment lawyers advise numerous clients with respect to
their obligations under various labor standards statutes,
including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Service Contract
Act, and the Davis Bacon Act.  We have conducted several
successful appeals of wage determinations on large construction
projects under government contracts, and have frequently
represented employers in Department of Labor wage and hour
compliance reviews.

<P>Recent decisions under the Fair Labor Standards Act have called
into question the exempt status for large numbers of white
collar employees based on personnel policies that authorize
certain types of deductions from their compensation.  We have
represented both public and private employers facing such
claims, and are advising clients on how to minimize exposure to
this new litigation threat.

<h4><CENTER>International Issues</CENTER></h4>
<P>In consultation with our international lawyers, the firm's
employment lawyers have advised foreign concerns regarding the
employment law ramifications of undertaking business activities
in the United States.  We have also advised the governments of
newly independent and developing countries on labor relations
and employment standards issues that would be relevant in
encouraging foreign investment.

<h3>Russian Statutes Restricting Use of Encryption Technologies</h3>
<P>The following is an overview of recent Russian legislation regulating
development and use of encryption technology.

 <P>The recent <A
href="http://www.steptoe.com/edict.htm">Edict of the Russian President Yeltsin</A> "On Measures to Observe the Law in
Development, Production, Sale and Use of Encryption Devices and
on Provision of Services in Encrypting Information" dated
April 3, 1995 (the "Edict"), and restricting use of encryption
technologies by Russian government agencies, State-owned,
private and foreign entities, complements a rapidly growing body
of law publicly regulating activities which previously were the
exclusive domain of the KGB, other national security agencies,
and of the military.  <a href="#note1">[Footnote 1]</a><a name="back1"></a>
<P>The Edict bans the development, import, sale and use of unlicensed encryption
devices, as well as of "protected technological means of
storage, processing and transmission of information", and
directs the Federal Counterintelligence Service and other
enforcement agencies to ensure compliance and to prosecute
violators.
<P>The Edict designates the Federal Agency
of Government Telecommunications and Information attached to the
Office of the RF President ("FAGTI") as the authority
responsible for the review of applications and issuance of
licenses.  FAGTI has been established pursuant to the RF Law "On
Federal Organs of Government Telecommunications and Information"
of February 19, 1993 <a href="#note2">[Footnote 2]</a><a name="back2"></a> ("Law on Government
Telecommunications").  In accordance with this statute FAGTI,
headed by a Director General, reports directly to the RF
President and is responsible for the security of government
communications, as well as for intelligence operations in
connection with encrypted and coded information <a href="#note3">[Footnote 3]</a><a name="back3"></a>. The
intelligence branch of FAGTI, also headed by a Director General,
is semi-autonomous and operates "in accordance with the Russian 
Federation Law "On External Intelligence" <a href="#note4">[Footnote 4]</a><a name="back4"></a>.
<P>FAGTI also has an R&D branch -- the RF Academy of
Cryptography <a href="#note5">[Footnote 5]</a><a name="back5"></a>-- and several army units: government
communications corps, radio surveillance and engineering
detachments.<a href="#note6">[Footnote 6]</a><a name="back6"></a>
<P>Within its jurisdiction, FAGTI
may issue orders and instruction which are mandatory for all
government and private agencies and companies <a href="#note7">[Footnote 7]</a><a name="back7"></a>.   FAGTI
conducts its activities in coordination with the all RF
enforcement agencies, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of
Communications, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, RF General
Directorate of Security, and other key government services<a href="#note8">[Footnote 8]</a><a name="back8"></a>. 
<P>FAGTI will issue licenses for encryption
activities in accordance with FAGTI's internal regulations and
pursuant to the RF Government Decree "On licensing of certain
types of activities" of December 24, 1994 <a href="#note9">[Footnote 9]</a><a name="back9"></a>, which sets
forth general licensing guidelines for competent government
agencies.
<P>At least one article written by a prominent
Russian mathematician and published in the influential Russian
newspaper "Izvestia" on April 20, 1995 harshly criticized he
Edict as overbroad, granting unlimited discretion to the secret
police and ignorant customs officers, violating civil rights,
creating obstacles for international cooperation in the field of
exchange and processing of information, and making meaningless
the recently adopted intellectual property laws.  The article
expresses the existing concern that the new statutes seek to
revive and legitimize the tested KGB methods in controlling the
Russian society.<p><p> 


<hr><blockquote>
<h3 align=center>Footnotes</h3>

<H4><a name="note1"><B>Footnote 1</B></a></H4>  
<P>Other relevant statutes include the RF Law "On State Secrets" dated July 7, 1993, RF Law "On
Telecommunications" dated February 16, 1995, and the RF Law "On Information, Data Processing and  Protection of Information" dated February 20, 1995. The last statute, among other things, regulates classification of information, licensing, and sets forth equipment certification guidelines.  The above statutes
are available in our Russian law library (in Russian)<a href="#back1">[Return to text at Footnote 1]</a>

<CENTER><H3>Bernstein Litigation</H3><P>
</CENTER><P>
		There have been two recent court decisions addressing whether the First Amendment restricts the State Department's application of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&quot;ITARs&quot;) to encryption.  The first decision was issued by Judge Richey in litigation brought by privacy activist Phil Karn, and was widely hailed as a victory for the government.  The second decision was issued last week by Judge Patel in litigation brought by Daniel Bernstein, and has been taken as a major defeat for the government.  In fact, the approaches taken by the two courts are much closer than they at first appear.  Moreover, Judge Patel's decision is only a preliminary ruling, and it is possible that the government may yet emerge victorious.<P>
<P>
		The background of the Bernstein decision is as follows.  In July 1993, Bernstein submitted a commodity jurisdiction (&quot;CJ&quot;) request with regard to an encryption and decryption algorithm called &quot;Snuffle.&quot;  The State Department informed Bernstein that Snuffle was a defense article under the international Traffic in Arms Regulations (&quot;ITARs&quot;).  Bernstein filed suit, arguing principally that the ITARs violated the First Amendment in that they were a content-based infringement on speech and acted as a prior restraint on speech.  The Justice Department moved to dismiss, arguing that the Snuffle source code was not speech entitled to First Amendment projection, and that even if it was speech, the State Department's regulations satisfied the appropriate standard under the First Amendment.<P>
<P>
		On April 15, Judge Patel of the federal district court in San Francisco rejected the Justice Department's motion to dismiss Bernstein's challenge to the State Department's regulation of source code as a defense article.<P>
<P>
		The court first addressed whether Bernstein's challenge was barred by the provision of the Arms Export Control Act (&quot;AECA&quot;) precluding judicial review of the President's designation of items as defense articles.  See 22 U.S.C.  2778(h).  The court held that the AECA did not bar Bernstein's constitutional challenge as long as his claim was &quot;colorable.&quot;  This holding is consistent with Judge Richey's recent decision in the Karn litigation.<P>
<P>
		The court then addressed the standard for deciding whether Bernstein's constitutional challenge was &quot;colorable.&quot;  The court held that under Ninth Circuit precedent, the standard for allowing the claim to proceed was whether the claim was &quot;wholly insubstantial or frivolous&quot; or was &quot;clearly immaterial and made only for the purposes of jurisdiction.&quot;  This procedural issue is important to an understanding of the court's decision in Bernstein.  The court's decision that Bernstein had a colorable constitutional claim (and therefore could withstand the Justice Department's motion to dismiss) turned on the use of a low standard -- whether the claim was nonfrivolous -- to determine whether the claim was colorable.<P>
<P>
		Most of the court's decision focused on whether the Snuffle source code was speech protected by the First Amendment, as opposed to &quot;conduct,&quot; as argued by the Justice Department.  The court held that the source code was speech, for several reasons.  The court saw computer language as akin to any other languages (e.g., German or French), allowing the communication of &quot;understood meanings within specific communities.&quot;  The court said that it was irrelevant that the source code also was functional (i.e., the Snuffle algorithm was not only about encryption, but -- when compiled into object code -- could encrypt and decrypt).  The court analogized to technical information about hydrogen bomb construction, which has been held to be speech even though it serves a functional purpose.  Finally, the court noted that computer software is entitled to copyright protection, which is intended to protect original expression, supporting the conclusion that source code is a means of original expression and should be treated as speech.<P>
<P>
		Having found that the Snuffle source code was entitled to protection as speech, the court analyzed whether the ITAR control was consistent with the First Amendment. The court treated the ITAR control as a content-neutral regulation reviewable under the fairly lenient standard established in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).  While the court suggested that a higher standard might be appropriate (i.e., that the ITAR control might actually be content-based, and therefore presumptively invalid), the court declined to apply a higher standard without additional briefing from the parties.  The O'Brien standard was applied in the Karn decision as well, and the court there held that Karn did not have a colorable claim that the State Department's action did not meet the standard.<P>
<P>
		Here, however, the court found that Bernstein had a colorable claim that the ITAR control of Snuffle did not meet the O'Brien test for content-neutral regulation of speech.  The court's jurisdiction for this conclusion is only one sentence long, simply stating that the ITAR control appeared to &quot;relate to the 'suppression of free expression' and may reach farther than is justifiable.&quot;  The court said it could not find that Bernstein's contentions on these issues were &quot;frivolous.&quot;  (In contrast, the Karn court avoided deciding whether the ITAR regulation was broader than necessary, finding that to address this issue would involve the court in fundamentally political decisions.)<P>
<P>
		Finally, the court held that Bernstein had a colorable (i.e., non-frivolous) claim that the ITARs imposed a prior restraint on his speech, since the regulation prohibited him from publishing the Snuffle source code without first obtaining a license.  The court noted the &quot;heavy presumption&quot; against prior restraints on speech.  The Justice Department apparently did not contest the point that if the Snuffle program was speech, the ITARs imposed a prior restraint on Bernstein's speech.<P>
<P>
		Since the court denied the Justice Department's motion to dismiss, the case will now enter the fact-finding phase, including discovery of government officials and documents.  It is difficult at this stage to predict the eventual outcome, but I offer the following thoughts.  It appears very likely that Judge Patel will find that the ITARs impose an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.  If this holding is upheld on appeal, it would bar the State Department from requiring licenses before publication of encryption.  However, State could still impose significant civil penalties for publishing controlled encryption, so it is unclear how much impact this change would have.  Indeed, it could be a pyrrhic victory, since exporters might no longer be able to obtain State Department confirmation that a particular activity was allowed.<P>
<P>
		With regard to Bernstein's broader claim that the ITARs unconstitutionally regulate his speech, the key issue will be Judge Patel's factual findings as to the State Department's purpose in regulating encryption and as to whether the ITARs are broader than necessary to achieve a legitimate purpose.  Judge Patel's holding that Bernstein's allegations on these issues were not &quot;frivolous&quot; does not necessarily mean she will end up agreeing with him on the facts.  However, the overall tone of Judge Patel's decision is fairly cool toward the government, and it seems likely that the factual findings will favor Bernstein.  If so, it would be difficult for the government to challenge these factual findings on appeal, given the deference given to lower courts' factual findings.  <P>
<P>
		However, if Judge Patel holds that the ITARs are an unconstitutional content-neutral regulation (or decides that the ITAR controls are content-based and therefore invalid), there would be opportunity for the government to obtain a reversal on appeal based on broader legal issues.  For instance, an appeals court might hold that the lower court's inquiry into whether the ITAR controls are broader than necessary resulted in an improper consideration of a political question (as the Karn court held).  If Judge Patel's decision is based on her view that the ITAR controls are content-based rather than content-neutral, this could also be the subject of an appeal. <P>
<P>
		In the end, it is interesting to note that the &quot;political question&quot; issue is where Judge Patel and Judge Richey parted company.  Until that point, the judges followed similar paths -- both holding that colorable constitutional claims were not precluded from review, that the State Department's regulation of encryption was subject to the First Amendment, and that the ITAR controls were content-neutral.  Judge Richey then refused to address Karn's argument that the controls were broader than necessary, based on the political question doctrine.  Judge Patel, in contrast, preliminarily reached Bernstein's argument on this point -- without even mentioning the political question doctrine.  As fact-finding proceeds, and Judge Patel confronts the need to make findings about what approach the State Department should have taken, it is possible that the political question doctrine may hold greater appeal to her.<P>

<P>Michael Solton's practice focuses on corporate law and
intellectual property.  He is extensively involved in the
privatization of Russian enterprises, representing U.S. and
Canadian companies buying stock in such companies and advising
Russian clients on restructuring options.  Mr. Solton has been
instrumental in facilitating the conclusion of one of the first
successful privatizations of a large Russian enterprise.  For
this project, Mr. Solton designed the legal framework of a deal
involving the Federal and local privatization authorities, the
enterprise, and a foreign investor.   Mr. Solton was involved in
determining the schedule and conditions for the allocation of
stock, and worked closely with Russian privatization officials
on both the Federal and local levels. Mr. Solton's privatization
work is complemented by his expertise in intellectual property. </P>
<P>After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Mr. Solton advised a
team of experts and Russian government officials charged with the
restructuring of the USSR Copyright Office (VAAP), and actively
participated in the drafting of bylaws for the first Russian
copyright office -- the Russian Intellectual Property Agency
(RAIS).</P>  <P>As an associate of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's Moscow affiliate,
Mr. Solton facilitated contacts between RAIS and various
international intellectual property organizations, including the
Motion Pictures Association of America and the International
Publishers Copyright Council.</P>  <P>Mr. Solton is extensively
involved in negotiating and drafting technology transfer
agreements between U.S., European and Russian companies, has
assisted a New York law firm representing a famous Russian
performer in a copyright infringement case brought in a U.S.
federal court, and is advising major U.S. corporations on a day-
to-day basis regarding Russian copyright, trademark and patent
matters. </P> <P>Prior to joining Steptoe & Johnson LLP in 1992, Mr. Solton
was General Manager and General Counsel for the Russian-American
publishing house Interperiodica where he specialized in
copyright, labor and corporate law.  Interperiodica is a joint
venture of the Russian Academy Sciences and General Media
International established to develop new publishing venues
for Russian scientific journals. </p>

<p>At the same time Mr. Solton also served as Chief of Legal 
Department of a U.S. publishing house, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.,
and as a senior research fellow in the Bureau for International
Publishing of the Russian Academy of Sciences.<P>

<P>With the new law, the joint stock company maintains its lead as the best defined business form under Russian Federation law.  Being well defined has its pros and cons.  With advent of more stringent securities regulation, JSC can be cumbersome, especially for closed companies with a small number of shareholders.   Limited Liability Company Law is pending.  If issued before the July 1, 1996 deadline for re-registration of joint stock companies, this may be a good option for certain closed companies depending up tax consequences and other considerations.

<Center><H3> Hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</H3></Center>
<P>
	On July 16, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation held a hearing 
on computer network security.  Sens. Bill Cohen (R-Me.), Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), and Carl Levin (D-Mich.) 
attended the hearing.  Subcommittee staffers, Harold Damelin (Chief Counsel, Staff Director) and 
Daniel Gelber (Chief counsel, Minority Staff Director), were also present.  The witnesses were Sens. 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, and Deputy 
Secretary of Defense John White. 
<P>
<H4>1.	<U>Senate Computer Security Developments</U></H4>

<P>		There was a consensus among the Senators that a catastrophic attack on 
Cyberspace was imminent and that there was an urgent need for a comprehensive strategy to deal 
such an attack. 
<P>
<P>	The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act (S. 982):  The Act was introduced by 
Sens. Kyl, Leahy, and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) in June, 1995 and was reported favorably by the 
Judiciary Committee last month.  The Senate is expected to consider the Act before the August 
break.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
The goal of the Act is to increase the protection for both government and private computer 
systems from the growing threat of computer crimes.  The Act (a) adds a new provision to ensure 
prosecution of computer-age blackmailers, who threaten to harm or shut down computer networks 
unless their extortionate demands are met; (b) penalizes those who, without authorization, access 
information on private computers that are used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications; 
(c) extends federal protection from intentionally damaging viruses to computers of the government 
and financial institutions, including those that are not used in interstate communications; and (d) 
consolidates computer crimes in Section 1030 of Title 18.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>2.	<U>Administration Computer Security Developments</U></H4>

<P>		Both Gorelick and White testified that they considered computer 
security as one of the most important issues for the government.  Sen. Kyl, however, criticized 
the lack of leadership by the President in this area. 
<P>
<P>Critical Infrastructures:  The Critical Infrastructure Working Group, which was formed 
by Attorney General Janet Reno in response to Presidential Decision Directive 39, has identified 
eight categories of Critical Infrastructures:  telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas 
and oil storage and transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems, 
emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue), and government operations.
<P>The Executive Order No. 13010 on Critical Infrastructure Protection: The Order was signed 
by the President on July 15, 1996.  Gorelick described the Order as the &quot;Manhattan 
Project&quot; for infrastructure protection.  Sen. Nunn commented that unlike the &quot;Manhattan 
Project&quot;, any successful measure would require extensive public education and participation.  
<P>
<P><B>The Order creates the following two organizations:</B>
<P> 
<P>The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection:  The Commission will 
formulate measures to protect the nation's Critical Infrastructures.  The Commission will issue 
its final report within one year. It will be chaired by a presidential appointee from the private sector, 
and will have representatives from the public and private sectors.
<P>
<P>Infrastructure Protection Task Force:  This will be an interim interagency task force, 
chaired by the FBI, which will coordinate existing infrastructure protection efforts. 
<P>
<H4>3.	<U>Single Cyberspace Security Center</U></H4>

<P>		Sens. Nunn and Kyl expressed their support for establishing one organization 
that would handle all computer security matters.  Sen. Nunn seemed to favor giving such an 
organization an authority to handle both law enforcement and intelligence matters.  Because the 
private sector owns most of Critical Infrastructures, there was a consensus among participants 
that further efforts should be made to solicit cooperation from the private sector.   
<P>
<H4>4.   <U>Industry-wide Cooperation</U></H4>

<P>		Gorelick testified that there should be an organization like National Security 
Telecommunications Advisory Committee for each one of eight Critical Infrastructures.  
<P>
<H4>5.	<U>Encryption Policy</U></H4>

<P>		The panel devoted about half an hour out of its three hour session to encryption 
policy.  Much of what was said is familiar by now.  Sen. Leahy called for the loosening of export 
restrictions on encryption and expressed his support for the widespread use of strong encryption 
to improve computer security.  Gorelick emphasized the importance of preserving the capability 
for the law enforcement to access data and cautioned against the unregulated use of encryption.  
Sen. Levin also seemed to want more liberalization, recommending a reexamination of current policy 
to strike a better balance between security and privacy interests and interests of the law enforcement 
in accessing data.

<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>


<H2><CENTER>Steptoe & Johnson Company Almaty</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP is a full-service law firm based in Washington D.C.  With over 200 lawyers, Steptoe & Johnson LLP offers legal expertise in virtually every field of law, including corporate transactions, international tax, international trade and finance, intellectual property, general litigation (including international arbitration), antitrust, telecommunications, transportation, energy, and labor and employment law.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP was among the first U.S. law firms to establish a presence in the former Soviet Union, and several of its partners have been actively involved in trade and investment in the region since the detente period of the late 1970's.  

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP established its affiliate in Almaty, Kazakstan -- Steptoe & Johnson Company (Almaty) -- in March of 1994.  The Almaty office has provided legal services -- ranging from the creation of joint ventures and the preparation of loan documents to assistance in obtaining government licenses to the negotiation of leases and the registration of branches and representation offices for clients in the mining, telecommunications, energy, food processing and other sectors, as well as for non-profit and governmental entities.

<P>The Almaty office works in close coordination with Steptoe & Johnson LLP's affiliate in Moscow, Steptoe & Johnson Company.  Established in 1989, the Moscow affiliate has continually expanded to become one of the largest and most prominent western law practices in Russia.  Its eight full-time lawyers, supported by over a dozen local specialists and administrative personnel, offer substantial expertise and experience in a broad range of CIS transactions.  In addition, the Almaty office works closely with Steptoe & Johnson LLP lawyers in Washington D.C. who also have extensive experience in structuring investments in the CIS.  By integrating the CIS expertise of attorneys located on the ground in Almaty and Moscow with the subject area expertise of U.S.-based lawyers specializing in such fields as international tax, intellectual property, project finance, real estate and environmental law -- an integration that is enhanced by a comprehensive communications network involving satellite phone, facsimile and electronic mail links -- the <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/cistrade.htm">CIS Trade and Investments</a> practice of Steptoe & Johnson LLP brings to any client matter literally decades of collective experience and insight.   
      
<P>Steptoe & Johnson Company (Almaty) is widely recognized as one of the leading western law firms in Kazakstan, based on its representation of several large clients in the mining, telecommunications, and investment fund sectors and its work with the Kazak government on several USAID and World Bank technical assistance projects.

Ms. Altinbajeva, Mr. Abbey and Mr. Samuelian are assisted in Almaty by two junior attorneys, Kairat Serikpaev and <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/titkov.htm">Alexander Titkov</a>.  Mr. Serikpaev is a Kazak attorney who serves as a link between Steptoe & Johnson LLP and the Kazak bureaucracy and specializes in registration, land and visa issues.  Mr. Titkov recently completed work on a USAID Mass Privatization project in Kazakstan, where he advised on a wide range of company formation, privatization and securities registration issues.  The head of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's CIS practice is <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/carey.htm">Sarah Carey</a>.  A corporate lawyer for more than 30 years, Ms. Carey has over the past decade negotiated and structured hundreds of joint ventures and other investment and trade transactions in the CIS, as well as advised U.S. and Russian companies on privatization and restructuring alternatives.  Ms. Carey serves on the Boards of the Eurasia Foundation, the Russian-American Enterprise Fund, and the Defense Enterprise Fund--all under Presidential nomination.  <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/white.htm">Walter White, Jr.</a> is a partner in Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Managing Director of Steptoe & Johnson International, in Moscow.

<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P>
<hr>


<P>Legislation providing clear rules governing the certification and liability of key escrow agents would be the preferred outcome of these discussions.  But we must bear in mind two real-world considerations:  (1) in light of the crowded Congressional agenda this fall, the prospects for enacting key escrow legislation are uncertain at best; and (2) industry will not offer key escrow services on a commercially significant scale until industry can make a reasonably informed assessment of the obligations and risks associated with entering the market.  The convergence of these two considerations has led me to consider how the Administration could take immediate action in response to industry concerns -- without resort to legislation. 

<P>Below I outline four possibilities for how government and industry might reach an agreement on key escrow policy through existing statutes and procedures.  Each approach is analyzed on the basis of how it meets the two fundamental interests driving these discussions:  (1) government's interest in assuring that responsible and responsive key escrow agents will provide assistance upon lawful request; and (2) industry's interest in knowing the risks of the business in advance of entering the market.

<P>My hope in offering this proposal is that if legislation is not feasible in the near-term, one or more of the approaches discussed below may provide an acceptable basis for defining the terms under which government and industry will cooperate to develop globally available and commercially successful private key escrow. <hr>
<P>A.  NIST STANDARDS
<OL><LI>NIST standards have the potential to serve as the de facto standard of care applied for purposes of determining key escrow agent liability to customers and third parties.  <P>
<LI>But there is no guarantee that a NIST standard, even if applied correctly by a court, would shield key escrow agents from unjustified liability. <P>
<blockquote>Key escrow agents might be slightly more reassured if the government agreed to intervene, at the request of a certified key escrow agent, in litigation to argue that the NIST standards constituted the appropriate standard of care.  </blockquote>
<LI>But NIST standards alone cannot establish the binding terms and conditions by which the government can ensure that all escrow agents are responsible and responsive.<P>
<LI>Because of the shortcomings of NIST standards in meeting the fundamental interests of both industry and government, it will be necessary to consider other arrangements to supplement any standard of care to be established by NIST.</OL>

<P>B.  COMMON LAW RULES RELATING TO ASSISTING GOVERNMENT
<OL><LI>	Even absent any statutory authorization, federal common law provides a basis for law enforcement to request assistance from private parties.<P>
<LI>The rule that a private citizen must assist law enforcement originated in the English common law, which required all able-bodied men (a posse comitatus) to pursue a felon at the request of a sheriff.<P>
<LI>Most states have codified the common law rule.  Statutory assistance requirements are not limited to the pursuit of felons, but instead generally apply to any assistance required in the execution of state law.  According to one survey, all but twelve states have statutes that require private parties to assist law enforcement.  Jon C. Blue, High Noon Revisited:  Commands of Assistance by Peace Officers in the Age of the Fourth Amendment, 101 Yale L.J. 1475 (1992).  <P>
<LI>When private parties are required to assist the government, the private parties enjoy immunity from claims that arise in connection with providing the assistance.  <I>Fowler</I> v. <I>Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Company</I>, 343 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1965) provides a clear expression of the rationale for common law immunity.  
<blockquote>In Fowler, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal held that if a telephone company acted "for and at the request" of the federal agents in placing a wiretap, and the federal agents had acted within the bounds of their authority, the telephone company would be immune from a private party's suit.  <P>
The Fowler court reasoned that:  "to deny the privilege [of immunity] to those who assist federal officers would conflict with the underlying policy of the privilege itself, to remove inhibition against the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government."  Id. at 157.	</blockquote>
<LI>In the key escrow context, the government might have inherent authority to require assistance from escrow agents.  But the possible availability of some ill-defined common law immunity might not motivate industry to cooperate.  Some of this uncertainty could be eased by an agreement between the government and the escrow agent, setting forth responsiveness standards and stating that:  
<blockquote>The government will intervene in court cases brought against key escrow agents who have met the standards.<P>
The Justice Department has confirmed the availability of common law immunity in the key escrow context. 		</blockquote> </ol>


<P>C.  TITLE III WIRETAP LAW
<OL><LI>	The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 ("Title III") provide the government mechanisms for obtaining assistance from private parties in the interception of electronic communications.  <P>
<LI>A threshold issue is whether Title III could be applied to key escrow -- an initial reading of Title III suggests that such a reading would not be implausible.  <P>
<ul><LI>Under Title III, any government officer authorized by law to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications can, when required, obtain "technical assistance" from communications service providers, landlords, custodians, or "other persons."  18 U.S.C.  2511(2)(a)(ii).<P>
<LI>An escrow agent providing the government a customer's private key could be considered providing "technical assistance" required by government to read encrypted wire, oral, or electronic communications.</ul><P>
<LI>In the most plausible scenario, government and industry could negotiate terms and conditions to govern government requests for keys (i.e., responsiveness).  Then, when the government required a key, it could obtain it by presenting the escrow agent with one of the forms of authority specified in Title III:  <P>
<ul><LI>Court orders:  which are used by the government in most circumstances where "technical assistance" is required executing a wiretap.  <P>
<LI>Attorney General certifications:  which are typically valid for only forty-eight hours, and generally are used in emergencies when a court order is not immediately available.  </ul><P>
<LI>Parties providing assistance under Title III can avail themselves of two statutory liability limitation:  <P>
<ul><LI>The statutory immunity in Title III provides that "no cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or electronic communications service, its officers, employers or agents, landlord, custodian or other specified person for providing information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with the terms of a court order or certification under this chapter."  18 U.S.C.  2511(2)(a)(ii) (emphasis added). 
<LI>The good faith defense of Title III further provides:  "Good faith reliance on a court warrant or order, a grand jury subpoena, a legislative authorization, or a statutory authorization . . . is a complete defense against any civil or criminal action brought under this chapter or any other law."  18 U.S.C.  2520(d) (emphasis added).  </ul><P>
	<LI>These immunity and good faith defense provisions have been widely applied by the courts to telephone companies, banks, and other private parties assisting the government's electronic surveillance for law enforcement purposes.  See, e.g., Camacho v. Autoridad de Telefonos de Puerto Rico, 868 F.2d 482 (1st Cir. 1989); Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515 (9th Cir. 1978); Manufacturas International v. Mfrs. Hanover Trust, 792 F. Supp. 180 (E.D.N.Y. 1992).  <P>
<LI>Title III and FISA cover only a portion of authorized government intercepts.  Agents will have to rely on common law immunity in the absence of a statute.</ol>

<P>D.  GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT LAW
<OL><LI>	Since the government in its commercial key escrow initiative is in effect agreeing to permit exportable key escrow in return for key escrow agents' agreement to provide a service to both its customers and the government, key escrow policy could logically take the form of a government procurement contract.<P>
<ul><li>The basic agreement would be for the government to reimburse key escrow agents for operating their businesses according to certain government- specified standards and providing the government certain services on an on-going basis.  Note that since the government has an interest in the responsibility as well as the responsiveness of escrow agents, the agreement could set standards forth both.</ul><P>
	<li>This approach could prove attractive to industry from a liability standpoint because it might make available the government contractor defense.  <P>
<ul><li>Under the federal common law's government contractor defense, as elaborated by the Supreme Court's Boyle decision, a contractor is immune from tort liability in connection with products built to the government's specifications.  Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U.S. 500 (1988) (helicopter manufacturer not liable under Virginia tort law for death of Marine pilot allegedly attributable to defectively designed emergency escape system).<P>
<li>In Boyle, the Supreme Court set out a three-part test for when the defense is available:  (1) the government approves reasonably precise specifications for product design; (2) a contractor's equipment conforms to those specifications; (3) the contractor warned the government regarding all dangers known to the contractor.<P>
<li>The Boyle Court held that when these three criteria are met, procurement falls within the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) exception for government performance of "discretionary functions,"  28 U.S.C. 2680(a), and that the FTCA immunity available to the government is likewise available to the government's supplier.  </ul><P> 
	<li>The Court's reasoning in Boyle would appear equally applicable in the key escrow context.  In Boyle, the Court reasoned that if government contractors were held liable in tort to third parties, the government contract terms would be adversely affected:  either the contractor would refuse to manufacture for the government or the contractor would raise its prices -- either outcome would disadvantage the government.  <P>
	<li>The government contractor defense, because it exists only as federal common law and has not been codified in legislation, is subject to unpredictable interpretation and application by the courts.  Accordingly: <P>
<ul><li>There is no certainty that the defense would apply in the key escrow context.  For instance, Federal Courts of Appeal are split on the issue of whether the government contractor defense applies to non-military contractors or non-military equipment.<P>
<ul><li>In Carley v. Wheeled Coach, 991 F.2d 1117 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 191 (1993), the Third Circuit held that the government contractor defense conferred immunity on the manufacturer of an ambulance procured by the General Services Administration.  See also Stout v. Borg-Warner Corp., 933 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 584 (1991). <P> 
<li>However, in two cases involving tort claims for exposure to asbestos products, the government contractor defense was found inapplicable.  Nielsen v. George Diamond Vogel Paint Co., 892 F.2d 1450 (9th Cir. 1990); In re Hawaii Federal Asbestos Cases, 960 F.2d 806 (9th Cir. 1992).   </ul><p>
<li>Nor is the exact scope of the government contractor defense well-defined, even if it were found applicable to key escrow agents.<P>
<ul><li>First, the defense applies only to immunity for design defects, not defects in manufacture.  Therefore, key escrow agents would remain liable to customers and third-parties for performance failures unrelated to the government-sanctioned design.  <P>
<li>Second, dicta in Boyle and Federal Circuit Court cases suggest that the government contractor defense may not be applicable to "stock products sold in the commercial market," even if procured by the government. To the extent that key escrow services are considered "stock products," the defense might not be available.<P>
<li>Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the contract between the key escrow service provider and the government would not be a typical government procurement contract -- it is not certain that a contract to provide the government an occasional escrowed key upon request should justify insulating a key escrow agent from liability for running the key escrow service on a day-to-day basis. </ul>  <P>
<li>Moreover, setting key escrow policy via government procurement could be unattractive to industry because of the compliance costs and risks associated with government procurement:<P>
<ul><li>Cost data which government contractors must maintain under the complex Federal Acquisition Regulations.<P>
<li>Uncertainty as to potential liability arising from acting as a partner with government (state action).</ul></ul>

<hr>
<H4 align=center><a name="dev">New Developments in Adverse Effects Reporting</a></H4>
			
	<P>For several months, EPA has stated that it will shortly issue new guidance on reporting adverse effects from pesticides under section 6(a)(2) of FIFRA.  The new regulations were scheduled to be in OMB's hands for review by mid-October, but apparently have not yet been sent.  Personnel from EPA have been speaking about the new policy since late this summer.  As they describe it, the new policy will refine, but not significantly alter, the current reporting requirements. 
	<P>Reporting of pesticide adverse effects currently is governed by EPA's 1979 policy, 44 Fed. Reg. 40718 (July 12, 1979).  This guidance is not published in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.).  Although EPA has begun action to amend or update it several times, the 1979 Guidance remains the only interpretation of the statute currently in effect.  Generally, it requires reporting of known health effects, incidents involving nontarget organisms and series of incidents.  The reporting requirements are broader for products in reregistration. 		
<P>Remarks by EPA personnel indicate that reporting requirements under the policy being developed by EPA will be at least as broad as those under the 1979 policy.  In particular, EPA speakers have said that the new policy will: (1) require reporting many events   registrants   do   not  generally consider adverse effects; (2) require reporting perpetually on registrations that  have  been  canceled; (3)  include
an overly broad definition of pesticide and of information in the possession of registrants; and, (4) require the results of virtually all toxicology studies to be reported. 
	<P>In addition to speaking on revisions to the adverse effects reporting policy, EPA personnel also have been speaking on the adverse effects settlement it reached with DowElanco.  This enforcement action grew out of 6(a)(2) reports filed by DowElanco after media inquiries concerning claims made in personal injury litigation.  Following extensive negotiations and a settlement that was rejected by the Environmental Appeals Board, EPA and DowElanco settled for a penalty of $876,000.  EPA views this settlement as an illustration of its renewed commitment to 6(a)(2) enforcement. The high penalty amount also evidences EPA's position that reporting violations are continuing.  
	<P>The penalty paid by DowElanco was calculated under EPA's Enforcement Response Policy (ERP) (July 2, 1990).  This policy contemplates penalty reductions of up to 40 percent for voluntary disclosure of information, and a reduction of up to another 20 percent for "good faith."  The penalty paid by DowElanco reflected the 20 percent good faith reduction and a 30 percent reduction for incomplete voluntary disclosure.   		
<P>In light of the DowElanco action and EPA's stated intent to pursue 6(a)(2) reporting violations, registrants should consider whether to embark on an audit of their 6(a)(2) compliance.  By undertaking a compliance audit, registrants should be in a position to bring their compliance up to date and minimize any penalties for prior arguable violations.  In addition to the penalty reductions available under the 1990 ERP, registrants conducting compliance audits may be in a position to take advantage of the Interim Policy on Voluntary Environmental Self-Policing and Self disclosure issued by ERP on April 3, 1995. 60 Fed. Reg. 16875.
	<P>This policy is intended to encourage self policing and reporting among regulated entities.  For qualifying audits or self-evaluations, EPA will reduce significantly or might even eliminate the "gravity" component of any penalty that would otherwise apply.  Because adverse effects reports generally have only a gravity component, this can result in the complete elimination of penalties for non-reporting.  Accordingly, registrants may want to seriously consider a self-evaluation of adverse effect reporting compliance to minimize penalties for preexisting failures to report.<P>

<H4 align=center><a name="bar">Barolo Intends to Start Opp Reorganization in 1996, Despite Budget Problems, and Provides Suggestions for Helping EPA</a></H4>

	<P>Daniel Barolo, Director of the Office of Pesticide Programs, recently said that OPP intends to go forward with reorganization plans in 1996, but the level of appropriations finally approved for EPA will have an impact on OPP's plans.  The reorganization is in response to the Clinton Administration's mandate to "reinvent" government, first announced in September 1993.
	<P>Federal agencies at that time were ordered to develop plans to reorganize and revamp the federal bureaucracy.  One of the requirements is the elimination of one layer of middle managers.  To implement this, OPP has to reduce the ratio of supervisors to staff to a minimum of one-to-twelve up to  one-to-twenty.  The target date for completing this phase of reinvention is the end of fiscal year 1998.  The Office also is scheduled to reduce the number of employees in senior grades (GS-14, GS-15 and Senior Executive Service) by about five to ten percent at the end of this year.
	<P>Barolo, speaking at the fall meeting of the American Crop Protection Association, said that in addition to removing a layer of management, OPP also intends to create an Antimicrobial Division, to integrate registration and reregistration   activities,   and  to  pair   science review functions with administrative functions in multidisciplinary divisions.  A first step in the reorganization was the October 13, 1995 announcement that the pilot Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division had been granted permanent status.
	<P>Barolo also offered suggestions to registrants on ways to help EPA enhance its ability to do its job.  These include:
	<UL><LI>Provide training opportunities for OPP staff.  This is particularly important in the face of EPA travel budget reductions.<P>
	<LI>Assist OPP staff on opportunities for automation, especially by providing OPP with the benefit of registrants' experiences with automation projects.<P>
	<LI>Submit complete registration packages, the first time.<P>
	<LI>Contribute to harmonization efforts with Canada, California and others "by jumping the CBI hurdle."  	</ul>
	<P>Claims that data are confidential business information are perceived as a significant impediment to sharing data reviews and corollary information.
	<P>Barolo also said that OPP will continue its work on "Living REDs."  This project is aimed at continuing the process, established when creating a Reregistration Eligibility Document (RED), to capture all decisions made on a pesticide active ingredient and its formulations (for example, special labeling provisions and decisions on uses and use restrictions) in a single data file.  He also said that a notice will be published in the next several months on an options paper on registrant self-certification to the acceptability of acute toxicity data submitted in support of registrations.<P>

<H4 align=center><a name="fif">FIFRA Reform Bills Still Pending</a></H4>

<P>Both the House and Senate have introduced bills to reform FIFRA and the Delaney Clause (Section 409 of FFDCA), but neither bill has been reported to the floor at this time.  

<H4 align=center>H.R. 1627</H4>

	<P>The FIFRA portion of the House bill, H.R. 1627, was reported by the House Agriculture Committee in June, but the House Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over food safety issues, is currently marking up the FFDCA portion of the bill.  H.R. 1627 would make the following reforms to FIFRA, among others:
	<uL><LI>streamlining the pesticide cancellation process,<P>
	<LI>allowing EPA to issue an emergency suspension of a pesticide before processing cancellation of a pesticide,<P>
	<LI>expedited registration of reduced risk pesticides,<P>
	<LI>a ban on local government regulation of pesticides,<P>
	<LI>expedited reviews of antimicrobials and public health pesticides, and<P>
	<LI>providing incentives for registration of minor use pesticides.</ul>
	<P>The FFDCA section of H.R. 1627 would reform the Delaney Clause to delete its zero-risk standard and set a "negligible risk" standard for pesticides in both raw and processed foods. 
		
<H4 align=center>S. 1166</H4>

<P>	Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) introduced on August 10 the proposed Food Quality Protection Act of 1995 (S. 1166), which has been referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee that Lugar chairs.  Lugar's bill is similar to H.R. 1627 in its treatment of the Delaney clause -setting a "negligible risk" standard for pesticides in  both raw and processed foods.  Under the bill, EPA would be able to consider benefits of pesticide use when setting both raw and processed food tolerances.  In the interest of promoting harmonization, the bill requires EPA, in setting tolerances, to consider whether a maximum residue level has been estimated for the pesticide by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
<P>	Lugar's bill  also would revise FIFRA to provide relief to growers of minor use crops.  Manufacturers would be given incentives in the bill to develop new minor use pesticides and maintain minor use registrations.  Such incentives included establishing minor use offices in EPA and the USDA, extending the period during which minor use pesticide manufacturers have exclusive use of their registration data, and allowing EPA to waive minor use data requirements in some circumstances.  A separate Senate bill has been introduced on the issue of minor use (S 794).

<H4 align=center>Reregistration</H4>

	<P>According to Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan), Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, H.R. 1627 may be revised to include language regarding maintenance fees.  Reregistration is funded through the $14 million in annual maintenance fees assessed on the regulated industry, but EPA's authority to assess such fees expires in 1997.  EPA has predicted it will take until 2005 to complete the reregistration process, and that another $105 million will be needed.  EPA has requested an increase in fees to cover that shortfall.
	<P>Pesticide manufacturers support a 3-year extension of the maintenance fees but do not want an increase in the $14 million annual cap on such fees, according to an August 7 letter sent to Roberts by industry groups.  The letter stated that EPA has provided no substantiation for its proposed fee increase.

<H4 align=center>GAO Report on EPA's Accountability for Reregistration Funds</H4>

	<P>The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) recently issued a report to Rep. Roberts outlining suggestions for revising HR 1627 in order to improve the EPA's accountability for funds spent on reregistration.  In the October 26 report to the Committee, GAO suggested means for improving both the financial reporting and the performance reporting for the EPA's reregistration effort.
	<P>GAO noted that all FIFRA reregistration and expedited processing activities are reported as part of the FIFRA Revolving Fund.  GAO suggested expanding the financial auditing of the FIFRA Fund to examine overhead allocations and performance measures.  GAO recommended that the bill before Congress be amended to require a fiscal 1996 full scope audit of the FIFRA Fund, including a requirement that the audit review "the reasonableness of the overhead allocation and the adequacy of disclosures of direct and indirect costs."
<P>The GAO report also recommended two measures for enhancing performance reporting.  The first would require EPA to prepare a schedule that covers the remainder of the reregistration process and indicates how many reregistration eligibility decisions (REDs) will be completed each year.  The second would require the agency to prepare a list of which specific chemical cases will have REDs completed during fiscal 1996, which began Oct. 1, and fiscal 1997.  The list of specific REDs would be updated every two years.  Such a schedule would help Congress assess whether EPA is properly prioritizing its reregistration efforts by working first on REDs for high-risk and high-use pesticides, known as List A chemicals, rather than working first on the lower-risk Lists B, C, and D.<P>

<H4 align=center><a name="pes">Changes for Pesticide Exports Offered for Public Input</a></H4>

<P>	As part of its reinventing government effort U.S. EPA Office of Pesticide Programs  issued proposed changes in the regulations governing the export of registered and unregistered pesticides.  According to a publicly available option paper, the proposed program would reduce the number of pesticides for which export notices are required. EPA is proposing a "risk-based approach"  that would require export notices only "for those pesticides of greatest concern to countries:  pesticides on the international PIC [Prior Informed Consent] list, pesticides which have been nominated by the U.S. for inclusion in PIC procedures, and pesticides with active ingredients that have never been registered in the U.S."  See 60 Fed. Reg. 50,582 (Notice of Availability).
	<P>The major changes include: (1)  exempting certain unregistered products from the foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement requirements; (2) requiring exporters of registered pesticides on the U.S. and international PIC lists to submit export notices; and (3)  changing the content of the notices and the manner and frequency of the transmission, including consideration of electronic transmission of Foreign Purchaser Acknowledgment Statements.  In proposing these changes EPA has recognized what industry predicted when the current policy was announced: that the policy would create too many notices thus diluting the value of the notices.  In addition, EPA is considering steps to harmonize the pesticide export system with EPA's chemical export system under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the European Union's export policy.

<H4 align=center>EPA Exemptions Expanded</H4>

	<P>Section 17(a)(2)  of FIFRA requires that prior to export, exporters of unregistered pesticides obtain a signed statement from the foreign purchaser acknowledging that the purchaser understands that the pesticide is not registered for use in the U.S. and cannot legally be sold in the U.S.  In addition, the statute requires that a copy of the acknowledgment statement be sent to the appropriate official of the importing government. EPA is considering exempting  certain unregistered pesticide products from the requirements of Section 17(a)(2) through a rule promulgated under FIFRA section 25(b).  The exemption would include: (1)  a product not listed on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/ United Nations Environments Programme (UNEP) PIC procedures for banned or severely restricted  pesticides ("international PIC list); (2) a product not a U.S. candidate for inclusion on the PIC list ("U.S. PIC List"); and (3) a pesticide that does not contain an active ingredient that has never been registered in the U.S.   
	<P>The exemption from the foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement would not exempt the product from the labeling requirements for exported pesticides.  For example the label or labeling of any unregistered exported pesticide would be required to have the statement "Not Registered for Use in the United Sates of America."   The labeling requirements of EPA's 1993 Export Policy would apply, including the requirement for multi-lingual labels.  See 40 C.F.R. Part 168.
	<P>In addition, EPA would withdraw the exemption from the unregistered labeling requirements for formulations with minor composition modifications from registered pesticides.   Under the proposal, pesticides formulations with minor composition changes would be required to be labeled as unregistered pesticides in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 168.65. 

<H4 align=center>Proposal Would Increase PIC List Notifications</H4>

	<P>EPA also is considering requiring exporters of registered pesticides on the international PIC list or U.S. PIC list to file export notices with EPA.  This is a change from current law which does not require the filing of these notices for registered pesticides.   The notice would include information necessary to identify the exporter, the purchaser, the pesticide's product name and chemical identity and the country or countries of final destination. 

<H4 align=center>Reporting Changes Suggested</H4>

	<P>Currently EPA sends copies of the foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement to the person named as the recipient for pesticide notification in the international PIC program or for countries that are not participants in PIC to the appropriate embassy.  In the current proposal EPA is considering having the pesticide producers send the notice directly to the official of the importing company.  EPA recognizes the limitations of this proposal in light of the difficulty in verifying compliance and the significant reduction in EPA's ability to track information about exports. EPA also is considering requiring exporters to electronically transmit the foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement directly to the foreign government and to provide electronic or paper copies to EPA.  In neither of these approaches does EPA indicate how the pesticide producers will obtain information on the proper contact person.  Clearly EPA must provide a mechanism for identifying the proper individuals in each country to receive the notice.   In addition, EPA should set forth criteria for acceptance of the notice by the importing country. 
	<P>EPA also may require additional information on  the foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement.  EPA has proposed adding the following: information on available health and safety data for the pesticide or a point of contact for such information; the pesticide's EPA regulatory status such as any EPA tolerances; hazard classification; origin of shipment; exporter information; safety procedures; international PIC status; exporter information; and safety procedures.  
	<P>In 1993 EPA changed from requiring the foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement on an annual basis to a per shipment basis.  Pesticide   producers  have  the  option 
of obtaining a foreign purchaser acknowledgment statement prior to the first shipment to a particular purchaser and to submit to EPA an annual summary of all shipments of that product to that purchaser.  EPA plans to continue this practice. 
	<P>EPA has solicited comments from the regulated community on the proposed changes and is now reviewing the comments received.  EPA hopes to address these issues in 1996.  According to EPA, the speed with which these issues are addressed will depend in part on whether the Agency determines that formal rulemaking is required.<P>

<H4><a name="epa">EPA Releases Revised Test Guidelines</a></H4>

	<P>EPA has proposed updates to pesticide test guidelines for product properties, residue chemistry, and metabolism and pharmacokinetics.  (40 CFR Part 158, Pesticide Registration Data Requirements).  The proposed guidelines are the result of a harmonization  project begun in 1990  (60 Fed. Reg. 44,343).
	<P>The goal of the multi-year project, co-chaired by the Office of Pesticide Programs and the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, was to develop guidelines which incorporate those from OPP, OPPTS and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  OECD's guidelines are commonly used by other countries in registering pesticides, and EPA hopes that by incorporating those guidelines, industry can move towards completing one set of tests which would be applicable for different countries.
	<P>Some of the EPA guidelines harmonized with OECD guidelines include melting point/melting range, boiling point, vapor pressure, water solubility, partition coefficient (n-octanol/water, shake flask method), density, surface tension of aqueous solutions, partition coefficient for octanol/water--estimation by liquid chromatography.  Other guidelines were given reference updating and general editorial revision.
	<P>Other specific changes include guidelines related to color which summarizes the Munsell Color Method for opaque substances and stability which summarizes a CIPAC general method.  The guideline for oxidizing or reducing action incorporates the EPA method previously published in the Federal Register and adds a European Community Method as an option.  The flammability guideline is divided into separate tests for liquids and aerosols and adds three European Community tests as options.  A test for thermal explodability and a summary of a European Community test has been added to the guideline for explodability.  For the corrosion characteristics, EPA has deleted the ASTM method and suggested an alternate test employing visual observations.  Data reporting guidance has been added to all guidelines unique to pesticides.
	<P>The FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel held a public meeting on September 27 to review the proposed guidelines.  At the meeting EPA provided brief presentations of the guidelines for the SAP members.  Questions were taken from the panel as well as the audience.  Some questions involved Good Laboratory Practices and which tests must be run under strict GLPs.  EPA indicated that GLPs apply to all tests.  In response to a question concerning the possible need for specificity, EPA replied that it preferred flexibility in generating data to allow for changes in the state of the art.  
	<P>After analyzing the meeting presentations, questions from the public and the proposed guidelines, the Advisory Panel issued its final report in late October.  Overall, the Panel considered the guidelines a vast improvement over those established in 1980 and cited the appropriateness of EPA's effort at harmonization.
	<P>In reference to product chemistry the Panel noted that a good balance had been developed between guidance and flexibility.  However, the guidelines need a clearer indication of which tests should be run under GLP and the Panel indicated that such information could be provided in the Preamble.  Further, the Panel indicated that the data and analytical methods generated by the tests should be made available to interested parties as quickly as possible.
	<P>Written comments on the proposed guidelines were due to EPA on or before October 31, 1995.  The comments are still being analyzed by EPA staff and further action is not expected for at least thirty days.<P>

<hr>

<H4 align=center><a name="upd">Updated Data Submitters List Available</a></H4>

	<P>An updated Pesticide Data Submitters List (DSL) was released by EPA on September 30, 1995.  This version adds information on data submissions since 1990, when the DSL was last updated.  However, it continues to contain outdated information and does not reflect all data submissions.  Another update is scheduled for March 1996.  A completely reissued DSL will not be available for at least another year.  
	<P>The updated DSL is available via the Internet and the Special Review and Reregistration Division's Electronic Bulletin Board. Microfiche copies can be ordered from the National Technical Information Service.  A Federal Register notice published September 27, 1995, provides additional information on availability of the DSL. 
	<P>The DSL has been periodically updated, but updates have never addressed transfers of data ownership; registrant name changes and relocations; or typographical and other information errors.  It also may be incomplete because its preparation is based on correspondence from registrants explicitly requesting inclusion.  However, the DSL reportedly does not include registrants that submitted registration data using EPA's recommended "data matrix" form, despite the form's inclusion of a section in which registrants may request placement on the DSL.  
	<P>The Office of Pesticide Programs plans to create a completely new DSL following conversion to Oracle, an interactive computer network.  The DSL will be created from OPP's Document Management System.  Registrants will have an opportunity to review and provide corrections and updates to the information before the system becomes operational.  Given the interactive structure of all OPP systems following conversion to Oracle, OPP officials anticipate that changes in data ownership, registrant names and office locations, corrections of errors and updated information on data and submitters will be routinely reflected in the DSL when the new version is available.  <P>

<H4 align=center><a name="epa2">EPA Issues More Reregistration Eligibility Decisions</a></H4>

	<P>EPA in reregistering pesticides initially registered prior to November 1, 1984, must reexamine whether the pesticides meet current scientific and regulatory standards.  If not, use patterns and application methods must be modified to reduce risks to appropriate levels.  As required by FIFRA, EPA issues a Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) upon completion of its investigation of each chemical.  The RED summarizes the scientific assessment of the human health and environmental data bases for the chemical.  The Agency recently released REDs for the following chemicals:
	<ul><LI>Chloro-m-xylenol<br>
	<LI>Dowicil CTAC<br>
	<LI>Fosamine Ammonium<br>
	<LI>Piperalin<br>
	<LI>Polybutene<br>
	<LI>Terbuthylazine<br>
	<LI>(z)-9-Tricosene</ul>

<P>Approximately 15 additional REDs have been completed, but notice has not yet been given in the Federal Register and copies are not yet available.
	<P>In fiscal 1995 EPA completed 40 REDs.  This is an historic high, but EPA is concerned that this pace will not be sustained if budget cuts written into fiscal 1996 EPA appropriations are maintained.  The proposed cuts range between 23 and 34 percent.  Without sufficient funding, Agency staff argue that the current output will not continue and will certainly fall to 35 or 36 REDs completed next year.
	<P>The General Accounting Office submitted a report to the House Agriculture Committee relative to pending FIFRA legislation.  The report suggests that EPA develop a schedule for completion of the remaining REDs.  In addition, the schedule should prioritize the REDs so that Congress can readily determine that high-risk pesticides from List A were being completed before those on Lists B, C, and D.  (See previous article in this newsletter for details on pending FIFRA legislation.)     
	<P>Copies of the newly completed REDs or RED Fact Sheets are available from the OPP Pesticide Docket, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Rm. 1132, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA; or call (703) 305-5805.<P>

<H4 align=center><a name="reg">PR Notice Addresses Regulation of Methyl Bromide, Industrialized Nations Agree to Phase Out By 2010</H4>

	<P>EPA has issued a Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice regarding the production and importation of methyl bromide.  PR Notice 95-4 also discusses the Agency's activity relative to alternatives for methyl bromide.  The future use of methyl bromide is controlled by two separate statutes and one international agreement.  First, it is a pesticide under the jurisdiction of FIFRA.  It currently is in reregistration with the last data due in late 1997.
	<P>Second, methyl bromide is subject to the Clean Air Act.   Under the CAA, EPA determines a chemical's "ozone depletion potential" (ODP).  Any chemical with an ODP greater than 0.2 is listed as a "class I ozone depleting chemical."  Methyl bromide's ODP is 0.6, requiring that it be phased out.  Beginning in 1994 production levels were frozen at 1991 levels.  Final cessation of production and importation is scheduled to occur in 2001.
	<P>Third, methyl bromide is subject to the Montreal Protocol.  In 1992 the signatories to the Protocol agreed to freeze production at 1991 levels beginning in 1995 (except for quarantine and preshipment applications) and to reduce emissions.  On December 7, following a conference of parties to the Montreal Protocol, it was agreed that industrialized nations will phase out methyl bromide use by 2010, with reductions by 25 percent and 50 percent scheduled for 2001 and 2005, respectively.  The issue of exemptions for critical agricultural use, along with a decision on phase out by developing nations, were deferred to 1997.
	<P>EPA has established the Methyl Bromide Alternatives Task Force with members from the Office of Pesticide Programs and participation from the Office of Air and Radiation and EPA Region 9.  The Task Force will coordinate FIFRA, CAA and Montreal Protocol activities, and work with USDA, commodity groups and others to develop alternatives to  methyl   bromide.  In the near term, EPA expects that already registered  pesticides  will  be replacements for methyl bromide.  However, some of these also may face regulatory difficulties.  To aid the replacement process, the Agency will expedite review of potential alternatives, especially those which may be reduced risk alternatives.
 	As    an    additional   inducement to the development of alternatives,   on   January 13,    1995, EPA  notified  state  pesticide agencies and federal agencies that future emergency exemption requests for methyl bromide made under section 18 of FIFRA must include documentation on the steps taken to find an alternative and also include a commitment to continue pursuit of alternatives.

<P><CENTER><I>By <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart A. Baker</a></I></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.

<hr>

<H4 align=center>Summary</H4>

		<P>The OECD's ad hoc meeting of experts on cryptography was the brainchild of U.S.  policymakers.  Export controls on encryption have increasingly been attacked as unworkable by U.S. software and hardware producers, who see a major market for security on the global information infrastructure.  This need, they argue, will be met by foreign producers if U.S. export controls are kept in place.  Many companies in the software business have also attacked the latest Administration proposal allowing the export of strong encryption only if it incorporates some form of key escrow.  These companies question the international demand for key escrow.
<P>The likely U.S. purpose in calling for the OECD meeting was to show that other nations are or soon will be inclined to favor key escrow in order to avoid the problems that criminal use of encryption will pose.  From the U.S. point of view, the meeting was an opportunity to raise the consciousness of other governments about the problem of uncontrolled encryption while at the same time demonstrating to U.S. industry that defeating U.S. export controls would not open the door to a vast market for unescrowed encryption but would instead spark new and perhaps inconsistent local regulation of encryption.

		<P>If that was the purpose of the meeting, it was a qualified success.  It was not a complete success, because several governments expressed grave doubts about the U.S. effort to control encryption technology.  Most prominent among the doubters were the Scandinavian countries.  Japan also showed little interest in controlling encryption;  it seemed more concerned about catching up in this former defense technology now that its commercial possibilities were growing.  

		<P>Other governments, in contrast, were supportive of some kind of escrow, though they disliked that term and preferred to speak of "trusted third party" approaches to key storage and recovery.  The European Union, the United Kingdom, and France clearly favor the development of trusted third party encryption systems.  Other countries also said favorable things about trusted third parties.  But that term is deliberately ambiguous.  It mixes together a wide variety of "trust" services for users of computer networks.  Some services, such as maintaining a register of digital signatures or providing digital timestamps, do indeed require trust but are quite uncontroversial.  At its most minimalist, support for "trusted third party" encryption might simply mean that governments will set standards that allow companies performing uncontroversial  "trust" services to also perform private key escrow when asked to do so by users of encryption systems.  Such an approach is unlikely to make escrowed encryption the dominant form of secure computer network communication.

		<P>But at least some European governments plainly mean to do more than that under the heading of trusted third party encryption.  Both Italy and the Netherlands have recently considered legislation to regulate encryption directly in the fashion of the French.  The UK is also disinclined to see the spread of uncontrolled encryption within its borders.  While these governments now seem unlikely to adopt French-style encryption regimes, they are clearly intrigued at the thought that, with government's thumb on the scale, European telecom and computer companies might be willing to adopt trusted third party encryption even without a direct government mandate.

		<P>The good news for U.S. policymakers is that many European governments are clearly interested in doing something to encourage key escrow encryption, and Australia and Canada are likely to follow if a consensus in favor of key escrow emerges.  This proposal for international concensus is bound to cause some of the most vocally anti-escrow U.S. companies at least a moment of self-doubt.  

		<P>The bad news for U.S. policymakers is that there is little appetite in Europe (let alone Japan) for direct regulation of the encryption market (even the French are showing more flexibility in enforcing their law).  And some European governments' commitment to trusted third party encryption may not go beyond saying nice things about it while waiting to see what the market does.

<P>For a variety of reasons, the OECD is likely to be drawn into the process of making international encryption policy.  The U.S. was generally pleased with the warmth -- if not the ambiguity -- of the international praise for trusted third party encryption, and it hopes to build a stronger international consensus for such encryption.  Industry, particularly U.S. industry, would rather see policy made in the OECD than in a (presumptively more protectionist) European forum.  And the other OECD nations see that forum as a good place to moderate unilateral U.S. policies, such as the current requirement that keys be escrowed in the United States.  Thus all of the participants have something to gain from continuing the dialogue in the OECD.
<H4 align=center>The Meeting In Detail</H4>

		<P>The meeting was opened by the head of the OECD's science, technology and communications division.

		<P>In a carefully orchestrated set of nominations and seconds, Mike Nelson of the United States was elected Chairman of the meeting.

<P>The U.S. then opened with a description of its cryptographic policy and initiatives.  The U.S. delegation was rounded out by representatives of the Business Software Alliance and representatives of the National Research Council panel on cryptography, which is due to finish its report within a few months and was trying to get a better handle on international aspects of encryption policy.  Also attending from the U.S. were several private representatives named to the Business-Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC).

</OL>

		<ol><LI><B><I>United States</I></B>

		<P>The opening statements on U.S. policy were unsurprising for anyone who has followed developments here.  The U.S. said that the growth of the GII has meant growing demand and supply in the security field.  Key escrow appeals to the U.S. government as a "third way."  The U.S. expressed keen interest in the approaches of other countries, particularly toward "trusted third party" concepts.

		<P>The floor was then opened to a series of (mostly skeptical) questions from other nations.  Japan led off, asking how effective an key escrow system could be.  "Won't criminals simply use their own systems?" Japan asked.  In addition, in a question that suggested the Japanese had not closely followed recent developments in U.S. policy, the Japanese delegate questioned the wisdom of using a classified algorithm for international security solutions.  The U.S. noted that the spread of escrow would make it harder but not impossible for crooks to develop alternative systems.  And the U.S. explained that Clipper used a classified algorithm but that the latest initiative was algorithm-neutral. 

		<P>The Dutch asked for an explanation of who could be an escrow agent and who would make that decision.  The U.S. referred generally to the criteria recently released on this topic.  None of the other governments made an issue of the U.S. criteria that disqualify foreign-owned firms from being escrow agents (at least for products sold in the U.S.) and require a security clearance for escrow agents.	

		<P>Finland returned to the idea of criminals making their own encryption.  Finland also noted that all cryptosystems have been broken in the long run and that introducing a weakness like key escrow was risky.

		<P>The UK representative noted that the rest of the world has been behind the U.S. in struggling with this issue.  "What's the next step from the U.S. point of view?" he asked.  The U.S. said that implementing the 64-bit escrowed encryption policy is the next step.

		<P>The European Commission asked for a timetable, and the U.S. said that the policy should be formally adopted by February 1996.  The U.S. also acknowledged that the 64-bit limit has been widely attacked.  The U.S. defended it on two grounds.  "As a practical matter, it will protect our data for the rest of our lives.  And we are taking a risk in allowing software exports when the problem of binding the algorithm to the escrow is so difficult in software."

		<P>Denmark expressed the view that it could get the contents of encrypted communications between crooks and their bank by going to the bank for the data.  It thought that key escrow would likely be redundant for interceptions that require a court order.  (It also hinted at a suspicion that the real plan was to use escrow to facilitate intercepts that don't use court orders, such as foreign intelligence-gathering.)  The U.S. countered by pointing out that the bank might be in Panama or the Caymans.<P>

		<LI><B><I>European Community</I></B>

		<P>The next presentation was the European Commission (EC).  The EC began by laying out the Commission's responsibilities in the field.  This is by no means uncontroversial.  While there are a number of law enforcement initiatives within the European Union, the bureaucrats of the Commission have been excluded from them.  Instead, the bureaucracies of member states work out the arrangements themselves.  On the other hand, the Commission has been active in information security, telecom, and even export controls.  On the whole, the Commission is in charge of industries and issues that are benefited by the spread of encryption and not in charge of interests that are hurt by the spread of encryption.  This makes it less enthusiastic about controlling encryption than member states like the UK and France.  (In an odd way, the division of responsibilities and resulting conflicts are reminiscent of the conflicting duties and views of NIST and NSA.)

		<P>The second slide laid out the Commission's organization,  including the infosec calling of DG XIII.  DG XV is also mentioned.  It is a rival organization.  It is in charge of ensuring a genuine common market, and as such is perhaps even more responsive to business than DG XIII.  Hallway speculation suggested that DG XIII was losing the turf battle with DG XV over the encryption issue and that this would be good for business interests and bad for those who wanted to control encryption.  As an example, the DG XV rules on privacy of telecommunications evidently require -- or nearly require -- that encryption be installed on telecom lines within three years.

		<P>The EC next laid out the fundamental principles that a government encryption "solution" must meet.  It must be secure and trusted.  It must be tested by neutral parties (presumably in the government or through peer review).  Downloaded software, the Commission emphasized, would never provide trusted security.  The EC stressed voluntary use, saying that mandates would fail.  The EC explained the international perspective as requiring regional "sovereignty sharing" arrangements because the alternative was to lose sovereignty entirely.  To make the product work, the EC said, it would have to be legally as well as technically effective.  By this the Commission meant that governments would have to create a legal framework for digital signatures and escrow agents.  And the EC put expansion of the 64-bit limit under the category of "future enhancement" that would be needed eventually but perhaps not now.

		<P>Finally,  the EC offered what it described as an informal consensus of European Union countries on their preferred solution.  The solution would be to create a collection of Trusted Third Party (TTP) services -- certification of digital signatures, revocation of same, notarization, timestamping, and key escrowing.  The TTPs would be several and would be independent of each other and probably of governments.  This idea will be proposed by the Commission in January or February for adoption by the European Council.  Procedurally, any such step must first go to the European Parliament for its opinion and then to the Council.  If accepted there, a total of eighteen countries would be behind the idea.

		<P>Implementation of the TTP notion will require political consensus, trials of pilot services, and passage of laws to create the necessary framework for TTPs.  The Commission plans to finance trials of some of the technology.  It expects governments and industry to do most of the work in developing specific proposals.  And it foresees a need for international action that would create a framework for trusted transactions.  The Commission's sketch of such a framework envisioned trusted parties negotiating across borders with each other and then "sponsoring" their users for trusted transactions.   			
		<P>There were relatively few questions in response to the Commission presentation.  Finland noted that testing the strength of an encryption system meant more than looking at key length.  Norway asked whether the TTP concept included key escrow.  The Commission said that it did but that the term key escrow was not used because it had been tainted by Clipper.  The U.S. asked whether the U.S. approach was compatible with the European TTP approach.  At a technical level, The Commission declared, it was too early to tell, because the EC approach wasn't mature as a technical matter.  On a policy level, it thought the EC approach was more focused on providing security than on guaranteeing law enforcement access and that it was more focused on meeting market demand than the U.S. proposal.<P>

		<LI><B><I>Canada</I></B>

		<P>By way of background, Canada described the unenthusiastic reaction given to Clipper by a blue ribbon commission of Canadians.  The advisory council, established in 1994, set forth several principles for data security.  First, a basic level of security is essential for the data highway.  The precise amount of security should be matched to the value of the data protected.  Second, there must be balance between security and law enforcement interests.  Again, how to achieve balance was not spelled out, but Clipper and similar key escrow approaches were rejected on grounds of Canadian sovereignty (presumably because of U.S. government access to keys).  Third, standards should by open, corporations should be free to adopt their own solutions, and algorithms should be freely available (another slam at Clipper).  Fourth, the security infrastructure would require standards and a government oversight body to foster the public key infrastructure (PKI).  Fifth, and finally, the group called for review and revision of Canadian law to give effect to digital signatures and the like.

		<P>On the critical question of whether encryption should use escrow, Canada clarified, the report made no recommendation.  Escrow was not ruled out, but allowing one government to hold the keys was not acceptable.  The Canadian government has not yet responded formally to the report, but it is expected to accept it soon and to begin implementing the recommendations.

		<P>The Canadian government's plans for PKI were then presented.  The presentation was impressive in terms of the extent of implementation already undertaken by Canada.  But the extent to which it actually addresses the concept of encryption for privacy is open to question.

		<P>The Canadian PKI scheme envisions a single public management authority (PMA) that would approve a wide variety of certification authorities, such as major corporations.  (The PMA will be the oversight body.) There will not be a single Canadian root.  The PKI will require interoperability.  And it appears that Nortel will be at the center of the Canadian plan.  It will apparently be part of the first implementation, which will take place over the next two years and will involve 175,000 users.

		<P>The French immediately asked how all this would control encryption.  The Canadian answer was unclear.  Data recovery services will be possible in the Canadian scheme, but there is no sign that the government will encourage such services.

		<P>The Dutch asked about whether Canada planned privacy legislation.  Canada said that it would probably enact "light" rules following the OECD guidelines.  The Dutch also asked about an Ontario study touching on anonymous signatures, and Canada said that the Ontario recommendation was being taken seriously but that no decision had been made about when anonymous signatures would be recognized or enabled.

		<P>The EC expressed admiration for the extent of Canada's progress but suggested that the solution was quite nationally focused.  "How do you plan to interoperate with the U.S.?"  The response, a bit vague, was that issues would no doubt arise and had not been answered yet.  Canada believes its system is compatible with European TTP proposals.

		<P>The UK asked whether Canada was rejecting the idea of escrowing keys or just Clipper.  Canada said the concern was sovereignty and the idea of a U.S.-centered escrow system.  The report's endorsement of balance would suggest some kind of escrow system, Canada thought, but law enforcement had not yet clearly stated what it required.<P>

		<LI><B><I>United Kingdom</I></B>

		<P>The UK presentation picked up several earlier themes, starting with the invocation of a need for "balance" in data security between security needs and law enforcement needs.  "We can't dodge the issue or solve it using export controls," the UK said.  The balance requirement had been adopted in an interim report of a departmental committee to Ministers, and the Ministers have approved the report.  The report also recommends implementation of a TTP network with key escrow.  The report envisions TTPs responding to government intercept orders or warrants by providing encryption keys.

		<P>UK Ministers asked for more specificity on the TTP/escrow approach.  Lots of industry consultation is planned.  Royal Holloway College in London has also developed a new architecture for a possible escrow-TTP approach.  Any TTP approach would no doubt include timestamping, digital signatures and other services in addition to key retrieval.

		<P>The Dutch noted that the UK had foreseen a need to answer legal questions.  What legal questions?  The UK answered that there was some doubt whether UK law, which refers specifically to intercepting communications, could be applied without amendment to key retrieval.  Further, some new authority may be needed to license TTPs.  Ditto for the process of verifying signatures.

		<P>What about liability? asked the U.S.  The UK agreed that this was another unanswered question.

		<P>Finland asked how the UK would evaluate encryption strength.  The UK representative said that the government will not mandate crypto systems. Finland also asked whether a TTP, which is clearly useful for some purposes, was really needed for key retrieval.  The UK said that the government hoped TTPs would be used for key storage.

		<P>Austria and Denmark asked a series of questions:  "What happens when TTPs go out of business?  Will unlicensed TTPs be permitted?  What about TTPs that refuse to obey court orders or warn the user when they receive court orders?"  The UK said keys would have to be transferred if the TTP failed.  The question of licensing TTPs is not yet decided, but it will probably be necessary for TTPs that want to provide digital signature services.  All TTPs will be required to surrender keys if they want to get and keep such licenses.  The Danish representative observed that this wasn't much of a threat for a small TTP that was willing to give up its license, perhaps because it was originally established to serve a criminal enterprise.  Austria raised the prospect of the Mafia buying up a TTP.  The UK noted that under UK law anyone who hinders the police in doing their duty has committed a prosecutable offense, so the threat of license withdrawal is not the only enforcement mechanism.<P>

		<LI><B><I>Japan</I></B>

		<P>Japan's presentation is the subject of a separate paper.  Briefly summarized,  the Japanese brought by far the largest delegation, yet they included no police or national security representatives.  The presentations all suggested that Japan is taking seriously the publicity stressing the importance of good security for networked digital commerce.  It apparently has not taken seriously the threat to law enforcement's capabilities.  Unless the OECD conference leads to some rethinking of Japan's position,  it will not provide much encouragement to TTP or escrow solutions. (Concerns about tax evasion -- probably more focused on digital cash than encryption for privacy -- offer the only faint sign that Japan will rethink its position.)  The Japanese representative even offered the view that encryption systems not designed for government use should not be subject to export controls.

		<P>The U.S. delegation asked whether Japan now controls exports of encryption products and was told that it does, under the remnants of CoCom.  The decision about what's exportable is now made on an individual basis.<P>

		<LI><B><I>Australia</I></B>

		<P>Australia's position shadowed earlier European views.  Australia has generated two new reports on encryption this year.  So far, all the focus has been on using encryption to enhance privacy.  New privacy legislation is likely to drive companies toward greater use of encryption.  The Prime Minister has evidently asked for more study of the law enforcement impact of encryption.  But the Australian status report is unsympathetic to large-scale modification of encryption technology for law enforcement.  Instead, it suggests relying on warrants requiring decryption, a solution that will likely require a review of the rules against self incrimination.  Australia expressed little interest in intervening in the market to encourage greater use of TTPs for key retrieval, although it expects TTPs in general to be an important institution in electronic commerce.  TTPs will mostly regulate themselves, although some government oversight (perhaps including liability rules) is likely, and an antitrust exemption may be needed so that TTPs can work together.

		<P>In questions after the presentation, the UK asked how Australia's approach would allow the government to get keys from crooks, and Australia acknowledged that it would not.  Denmark offered the observation that in some circumstances the Danish courts will shift the burden of proof to the defendant if he does not provide certain kinds of evidence that is within his control.  The U.S. asked whether Australia has any TTPs now and whether Australians will embrace the use of TTPs for data retrieval.  Australia's representative could not say.<P>

		<LI><B><I>Italy</I></B>

		 <P>The Italian Interior Ministry recently made two proposals for legislation restricting encryption.  Neither passed, and passage now seems unlikely.  In other respects, Italy is typical of Europe.  It has controls on encryption exports, both under a 1990 (military devices) and a 1992 law (high technology) as well as under the new EU-wide export control regime. A 1994 decree defines encryption for export control purposes.

		<P>Italy also has authority over informatics policy and security policy.  It apparently has not pursued the idea of linking TTPs to key escrow.  The "technical" presentation by the Italian telecom company, STET, addressed policy issues in only a limited way, expressing a preference for a single international approach to encryption, expressing doubts about whether TTPs will hold keys if that makes the system seem weaker, and pointing out that monitoring communications to interdict unescrowed encryption is very difficult.

		<P>In response to a U.S. question, the Italian representative said he was unaware of any criminal probes defeated by use of encryption, but he reported that the Mafia was thought to be seeking access to strong U.S. encryption for its communications.

		<P>This led Austria to ask whether anyone knew of cases of crooks using encryption.  Denmark reported one case.  Holland reported a case of suspected terrorists using high-grade encryption; when pressed for information about how the case turned out, the Dutch representative simply said, "The encryption gave us a lot of trouble."  The U.S. reported that out of 350 computer evidence investigations last year, encryption turned up in 2% of the cases (that's seven matters by my count).<P>

		<LI><B><I>Switzerland</I></B>

		<P>Switzerland is concerned about computer intrusions and has strong privacy rules.  So far, it has not encouraged TTPs for key storage because of security concerns.  It has no answers to the law enforcement problem.  That's why it is participating in the experts' meeting.<P>

		<LI><B><I>The Netherlands</I></B>

		<P>The Dutch delegation indicated that domestic encryption controls are under consideration.  (A draft bill to restrict encryption was released prematurely in 1994 and produced such controversy that it was withdrawn, according to the hallway discussions.)  The restrictions might act like gun control, giving licenses for strong encryption to good citizens who show a need for it.  Other possibilities include a requirement that telecom companies offering encryption services provide decryption to the police when necessary and a requirement that citizens decrypt information that they have encrypted when that is necessary for purposes of a criminal investigation.   None of this has reached the level of legislation or even a formal proposal.<P>

		<LI><B><I>Norway</I></B>

		<P>Norway is planning to deploy a hardware-based security system for government and private use that will not be escrowed and will not use a public algorithm.<P>

		<LI><B><I>General Discussion</I></B>

		<P>The EC offered some principles that should illuminate the question of liability for TTPs.  First, strict government licensing is likely and will reduce liability concerns.  Second, security solutions will be reviewed and formally certified.  Third, TTPs will use strong crypto.  Fourth, key-splitting is an important safety/security feature.  Fifth, it is possible that compliance with law enforcement warrants will be required for TTPs that get the benefit of the government's liability-reducing initiatives.

		<P>Italy expressed the view that key-escrow systems will not work unless the public is persuaded that they offer good security.

		<P>Sweden stated that it was not clear whether government had a role in shaping encryption technology, and that establishing international rules will be much harder than establishing national rules.  At a national level, government can set an information technology framework, set standards, evaluate security, and encourage TTPs. Sweden sees the need for a balanced solution, but it has no national legislation on the point.  It is engaged in a plan for large-scale electronic procurement using smart cards.

		<P>Norway's representative expressed doubts about the wisdom of focusing on the use of TTPs for key escrow.  He thought this might be counterproductive.  TTPs are needed with or without key retrieval functions.  The biggest need is just to get good encryption on the market.

		<P>The UK, which was among the more supportive governments toward U.S. policy, nonetheless expressed the view that using U.S. export control laws to require that keys be escrowed in the U.S. would be a problem for the UK government.

		<P>Finland said that it was still in the process of developing policy in the encryption field, but it expressed considerable coolness toward escrow proposals.

		<P>Scott Charney of the U.S. delegation presented detailed data about the extent of computer intrusions in the U.S., laid out the need for encryption, and then pointed out the practical risks.  He indicated that the threat of encrypting or otherwise destroying computerized data was being used today in the U.S. and gave examples.  One small U.S. city, for example, had all of its data encrypted by an unknown hacker.

		<P>Australia stressed that any international solution must allow for interoperability and must keep data secure while it crosses borders.  Escrow systems will have difficulty working in an international context.</OL>

<H4 align=center>Conclusions</H4>

		<P>At the meeting's close, the Chair sought and obtained the agreement of the group to a variety of steps aimed at building on the dialogue of the past day and a half.

		<P>First, he noted the principles suggested by the European Commission representative as necessary for any escrow or TTP encryption system.  He suggested that they be formalized and distributed to the member governments.  These may form the basis of further refinement if the OECD process moves forward on encryption.

		<P>Next, the Chair distributed questions for each government to bear in mind and perhaps answer at any follow-up meeting.  The  OECD was at pains to emphasize that this was not to be an official OECD questionnaire as that term is ordinarily understood in the organization.

		<P>Third, the Chair and the OECD staff proposed a path forward for continued OECD action on encryption.  A February 9 meeting in Canberra will allow an hour or two of discussion by the experts group formed to consider such issues as intellectual property, data protection, and security on information networks.  This is time enough to consider a proposal for further work on the issue by a more official group.  The likely result of the February 9 meeting is approval of a work plan on encryption that could be considered and approved in March.

This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.

The law would appear to restrict the import, sale, or use of encryption products unless a key to the product is escrowed in France with an escrow agent certified by the French government.  This draft law indicates that France is seriously considering mandatory key escrow.  <P><P>		Of possible concern is the law's import provisions, which impose no barriers to imports of European products while imposing restrictions on imports of products from other countries.  Read literally, this could violate France's obligations under the most-favored-nation provisions of the World Trade Organization agreements.  It is possible that this provision will not in fact favor German and Finnish products over Japanese and U.S. products because the European-preference provisions apply only to importation of encryption products, and the law's restrictions on use and supply seem to apply irrespective of product source.  The apparent import preference for European products may simply reflect France's obligation to allow the free flow of goods within the European Union. <P><P><hr><P><P>Art. 12<P><P>		Article 28 of the Law No. 90-1170 dated December 29, 1990, on telecommunications regulation is hereby amended as follows:<P><P>		I - Section I is hereby amended as follows:<P><P>		1) The first paragraph shall be completed by the following phrase:  &quot;Secret coding method denotes all materials or programs conceived or modified for the same purpose.&quot;<P><P>		2) The second and third paragraphs are hereby replaced by the following provisions:<P><P>		&quot;To preserve the interests of national defense and the internal or external security of the State, while permitting the protection of information and the development of secure communications and transactions, <P><P>		1) the use of a secret coding method or service shall be:<P><P>		a) allowed freely:<P><P>		- if the secret coding method or service does not allow the assurance of confidentiality, particularly when it can only be used to authenticate a communication or ensure the integrity of the transmitted message;<P><P>		- or if the method or the service assures confidentiality and uses only coding<P>conventions managed according to the procedures and by an organization approved under the conditions defined in Section II;<P><P>		b) subject to the authorization of the Prime Minister in other cases.<P><P>		2) the supply, importation from countries not belonging to the European Community, and exportation of secret coding methods as well as services:<P><P>		a) shall require the prior authorization of the Prime Minister when they assure confidentiality; the authorization may require the supplier to reveal the identity of the purchaser;<P><P>		b) shall require declaration in other cases.&quot;<P><P>		3) A decree sets the conditions under which the declarations are signed and the authorizations approved. This decree provides for:<P><P>		a) a simplified system of declaration or authorization for certain types of methods or services or for certain categories of users;<P><P>		b) the substitution of the declaration for the authorization, for transactions concerning secret coding methods or services whose technical characteristics or conditions of use, while justifying a certain attention being paid with regard to the aforementioned interests, do not require the prior authorization of these transactions;<P><P>		c) the waiver of all prior formalities for transactions concerning secret coding methods or services whose technical characteristics or conditions of use are such that the transactions are not capable of damaging the interests mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph.<P><P>		II - Section II is hereby replaced by the following provisions:<P><P>		&quot;II - Organizations responsible for managing, on behalf of others, the coding conventions for secret coding methods or services that allow the assurance of confidentiality must be approved in advance by the Prime Minister.<P><P>		They are obligated to maintain professional confidentiality in the exercise of their approved activities.<P><P>		The approval shall specify the methods and services that they may use or supply.<P><P>		They shall be responsible to preserve the coding conventions that they manage.

<h4>The Gore Letter</h4>
<blockquote><P>In his July 20, 1994 letter to Congresswoman Cantwell, Vice President Gore expressed considerable interest in private key escrow alternatives to the Clipper chip:  "The Administration understands the concerns the industry has regarding the Clipper chip.  We welcome the opportunity to work with industry to design a more versatile, less-expensive system.  Such a key escrow scheme would be implementable in software, firmware or hardware, or any combination thereof, would not rely on a classified algorithm, would be voluntary and would be exportable.  While there are many severe challenges to developing such a system, we are committed to a diligent effort with industry and academics to achieve such a system . . . .  We also recognize that a new key escrow encryption system must permit the use of private sector key escrow agents as one option."
<P>Gore's letter promised immediate action:  "We agree that we need to take action this year to insure that over time American companies are able to include information security features in their program in order to maintain their international competitiveness.  We can achieve this by entering into a new phase of cooperation among government, industry representatives and privacy advocates with a goal of trying to develop a key escrow encryption system that will provide strong encryption, be acceptable to computer users worldwide, and address our national security needs as well."
<P>Fifteen months later, where are we?  
<P><OL><LI>On August 17, 1995 White House aide Mike Nelson announced the Administration's private key escrow policy:  encryption software with a 64-bit key length, an adequate key escrow function, and escrow with a government-approved key escrow agents will be exportable.  <P>
<LI>Nelson called for a series of public and private meetings between government and industry in September 1995 to determine the criteria by which the exportability of key escrow encryption will be decided.  NIST also requested public input on a possible key escrow Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). 
</OL></blockquote>


<h4>Grassley Legislation</h4>
<blockquote><P>Senator Grassley (Republican - Iowa), introduced S. 974, the Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act of 1995 on June 27, 1995.  The bill has raised controversy because it would impose criminal liability for the dissemination of any encryption software to foreign nationals, irrespective of the software's exportability.  
<P>The legislation is intended to close the Zimmerman loophole -- the legislation would impose criminal liability or a person if he knew or reasonably should have known that the computer network on which an encryption program was posted is "accessible to foreign nationals and foreign governments."  
<P>Grassley's bill incorporates, albeit crudely, the key escrow concept:  the bill would provide a defense to criminal liability if the person prosecuted established that "the software at issue used a universal decoding devise or program that was provided to the Department of Justice prior to the distribution."
<P>Grassley's bill, apparently drafted without Administration input (or for that matter, crypto-expert input), will not likely be a priority on the crowded legislative agenda in the Fall of 1995.</blockquote>

<h4>Terrorism Legislation</h4>
<P>In response to the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, some members of the Administration advocated, but did not specify in concrete public proposals, restraints on the use of encryption in the United States.  
<blockquote>	<P>FBI Director Louis Freeh repeatedly stated that Congress must "deal" with encryption.  Freeh testified to Congress:  "Encryption capabilities available to criminals and terrorists endanger the future usefulness of court-authorized wiretaps.  We must continue working to address this problem."  Statement before the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, May 3, 1995.  In internal Administration debates over the past several years, law enforcement is known to have advocated mandatory key escrow in the U.S.   See generally, Electronic Privacy Information Center, August 16 Press Release (analyzing fruits of its FOIA request for encryption policy documents).  
<P>Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick spoke favorably of mandatory key escrow even for domestic users of encryption at public debates on the topic, but Justice made no public proposal for mandatory key escrow.
<P>No action:  The Administration kept domestic encryption controls out of the terrorism bill.  According to Director Freeh, the Administration needed more time to reach a consensus:  "We need a lot of help [with encrypted communications], and we need it very quickly.  As I said, we are working hard on the Administration to resolve this problem, but if not resolved, we will not have an effective counter-terrorism strategy, nor will we have an effective counter-criminal strategy is a very short time . . . I think right now what we need to do is resolve within the Administration some issues and have a consensus as to what we need.  The question of whether legislation is needed is a question which is not resolved yet.  Perhaps down the road there will be issues for the Congress to take up."  Transcript of May 3, 1995 Hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's Crime Subcommittee.</blockquote>

<h4>Gore Task Force Report</h4>
<blockquote><P>Vice President Gore's National Information Infrastructure Task Force's report on NII security issues, released in June 1995, was quite favorable to key escrow.  The report suggested that "private sector approaches being developed to meet the needs of corporate key escrow may also benefit government, both as a user and in its law enforcement responsibilities."  Report at 22.
<P>The Report recommended government promotion of private key escrow:  the government should "continue to work with industry to develop alternative key escrow technologies, to make available standards and technology for public use, to develop methods for providing compatibility among different key escrow technologies, and to consider ways to promote use of such technologies overseas."  Report at 28. </blockquote>

<h4>OTA Report to Congress</h4>
<blockquote>	<P>In its June 1995 report to Congress, the Office of Technology Assessment also lauded the prospects of commercial key escrow.  "Being able to export key escrow encryption products would presumably make escrowed encryption products more attractive to commercial developers and users.  Therefore, the Clinton Administration could ease export requirements for products with integrated key escrowing as an incentive for the commercial development and adoption of such products."  
<P>The OTA Report included favorable descriptions of proposed private key escrow systems, including those of Trusted Information Systems and Bankers Trust.</blockquote>

<h4>Private Industry Turns Up The Heat</h4>
<blockquote><P>Computer Systems Policy Project:  CSPP met with senior Administration officials and urged serious consideration of commercial key escrow as an acceptable answer to U.S. industry and government.  
<P>Trusted Information Systems:  TIS has proposed a software system that would embed a data recovery field (DRF) in every encrypted file.  The private key is automatically stored in a data recovery center (DRC), which law enforcement can access with a valid search warrant.  Data Recovery Centers can be maintained within a company or with an outside escrow agent.  In an effort to improve the prospects for export authorization, TIS has included in the software check-sums to defeat user efforts to disable the Data Recovery Field function.  TIS reportedly has sought export authorization for escrowed software containing 56-bit DES.
<P>National Semiconductor:  National Semiconductor, in coordination with Trusted Information Systems, has designed a hardware-based system:  Commercial Automated Key Escrow (CAKE).  The hardware solution, because it is tamper-proof, counterfeit-proof and difficult to disable could prove more attractive to law enforcement than software alternatives.  Similar to the TIS software system, the National Semiconductor CAKE system involves a data recovery field in each message and a data recovery center maintained within a corporation or with an outside agent.  The proposed hardware is a PersonaCard, a tamper-resistant PCMCIA token.  
<P>Bankers Trust:  Bankers Trust has proposed a hardware-based key escrow system that will allow customers wide choice among algorithms and escrow agents.  User-generated private keys will be escrowed automatically and can be "split" between one or more escrow agent designated by the user.  Central to the system is the user's ability to store key fragments with multiple escrow agents, thereby reducing the risk of private key compromise.  Bankers Trust intends to qualify as a key escrow agent.
Hewlett Packard:  Hewlett Packard's key escrow architecture is designed to accommodate developments in cryptographic algorithms and government policies.  The Hewlett Packard system would involve three components:  a tamper-resistant cryptographic unit to which algorithms could be uploaded and in which private keys would be stored; a policy card needed to enable the cryptographic unit and programmable to comply with any applicable government restrictions (i.e., the policy card could only enable algorithms in the cryptographic unit which were approved by the government); and a network security driver.</blockquote>

<h4>Leading Academics</h4>
<blockquote><P>According to Lance Hoffman of George Washington University's Institute for Computer and Telecommunications Policy, "key escrow systems can provide escrowed encryption that is more sensitive to the balance between the citizen and government than the flawed clipper initiative."  Balanced Key Escrow (August 4, 1995).  
<P>Georgetown Professor Dorothy Denning has also been a strong advocate of commercial key escrow, and has written on the important but rarely discussed international aspects of key escrow.</blockquote>

<h4>White House Announces Administration Policy</h4>
<blockquote><P>At the August 17, 1995 cryptography policy workshop sponsored by the Software Publishers Association and the American Electronics Association, the Administration announced a new export authorization policy for commercial key escrow encryption products:  strong encryption software with an acceptable key escrow function will be exportable.  Software (and probably hardware) eligible for export could contain 64-bit key encryption, including DES.
<P>The Administration scheduled two public meetings in September to develop criteria and guidelines for determining when the escrow function is acceptable and to determine what the criteria should be for key escrow agent eligibility.  Government use of key escrow encryption is also under discussion.
<P>NIST and NSA will determine if a given key escrow system is properly designed and contains a adequate key escrow function.  Central to this determination will be the binding procedure.   NIST, NSA and other agencies will have input on the issue of escrow agent certification.
<P>If a key escrow software product qualifies for exportability after a one-time NSA review, export authorization jurisdiction will be shifted from the State Department to the Commerce Department.  As a result, exporters will not require individual validated licenses, but will merely be required to file quarterly reports with Commerce regarding the dollar value exported to each country.  (This is the same procedure as currently required for exports of mass-market software containing 40-bit RC-4.)
<P>Government officials making the announcement emphasized the need for the U.S. government to support U.S. exports of key escrow encryption products.  Those countries with strict controls on domestic use of encryption will be encouraged to approve for domestic use all key escrow products exported from the U.S.</blockquote>

<h3 align=center>Steptoe & Johnson <font size=-1>LLP</font><p>Recruiting</h3>
<h2 align=center>Summer Public Service Program</h2>


<P>

In 1990, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> inaugurated a program to allow a number of its summer associates to spend a portion of their summer in public interest placements in Washington, D.C.  The S&amp;J Summer Public Service Program is intended to enhance the firm's already substantial pro bono commitment, while serving to expand opportunities for second-year law students who might not otherwise be in a position to work for a public-interest organization during the summer.<P>

<P>

The program is designed to accommodate up to seven Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> summer associates who would otherwise spend the entire summer with Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> and who wish to pursue public service work during the latter part of their summer associate stay in D.C.  Summer associates must spend at least the first eight weeks of their summer working at the firm, and are then eligible to spend the balance of the summer (up to four weeks) working with a public service group in an area of interest to them.  Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> will contribute to each organization an amount earmarked to make up the difference between the regular weekly summer associate salary at the firm and the salary otherwise offered by the public-interest organization.  In this way, the firm hopes that law students whose financial obligations might otherwise preclude them from exploring public interest opportunities will be encouraged to participate.  <P>

<P>

Each organization will employ the participants in this program on the same terms and conditions as the organization's usual summer law clerks.  This should ensure that the participants will experience a realistic sample of life in a public interest organization with respect to workload, supervision, evaluation and the type of projects offered.  The firm encourages the participants in this program to continue their association with the firm during the public interest placement by attending firm social events, seminars and the like.  <P>

<P>

The <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/ps2.htm">list of organizations</a> that will take part in the program this summer covers a broad spectrum of public needs and approaches to public service.  If, however, a student desires a placement at an organization not on the list, the firm will be happy to discuss whether appropriate arrangements can be made with that organization to participate in the program.<P>

<P>

During the past five summers, Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> summer associates have worked at the offices of AYUDA, Counsel for Child Abuse and Neglect, the D.C. Public Defender Service, Human Rights Watch, International Human Rights Law Group, Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Legal Counsel for the Elderly, National Women's Law Center, Neighborhood Legal Services, Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, The State and Local Legal Center, Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, and Women's Legal Defense Fund.<P>

<P>

Participants in the program are selected in January.  In the event the number of summer associates interested in participating exceeds the program's capacity, the participants will be selected by lottery.  Once the participants are selected, the firm will assist in pairing up students with compatible placements.<P>

<P>This program will not take the place of the usual pro bono work assignments available to summer associates during the summer, nor will it decrease in any way the firm's commitment throughout the year to providing legal services to individuals and organizations that cannot afford to pay.  The firm's goal is to facilitate the participation of summer associates in public-interest work on an organized basis, while encouraging students with an ongoing interest in public-interest law to spend part of their summer at Steptoe &amp; Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font>.  <P>

<P>

Inquiries regarding the details of the program should be addressed to the firm's Director of Associate Services and Recruiting, Rosemary Kelly Morgan, at (202) 429-8036.<P>

<p>On January 14, 1997, the FBI, pursuant to CALEA, published in
the Federal Register its <a
href="waisgate.txt">Second Notice and request
for comments on its proposed capacity requirements for electronic
intercepts</a>. The FBI proposed actual and maximum capacity
requirements for communication interceptions, pen register and
trap and trace device-based interceptions. In developing its
proposed capacity requirements, the FBI examined historical
interception activity in geographic areas to determine peak
surveillance activity. The FBI then applied growth factors to
this information to project future capacity requirements.
Comments on the FBI's Second Notice are due on or before February
13, 1996. </p>

<p>The Administration has released a draft of the new <a

5 categories and create different licensing schemes for each. </p>

<p>Latest Developments in Administration's Encryption Policy: On
November 15, 1996, the Administration released an Executive Order
in preparation for the transfer of most encryption jurisdiction
to the Commerce Department. The Administration also announced the

<!-- WebElite Preview File --><p align=center>Recent Developments in Computer Security </p>
<p align=center>by </p>
<p align=center>Stewart A. Baker and Monica L. Selter </p>
<p>The computer revolution has brought miraculous change to the way that American companies do 
business. Thanks to technological breakthroughs, our civil infrastructure has become more efficient. 
Our transportation, utilities, telephone companies, and financial institutions now all rely heavily on 
computer networks in providing their services to customers. Dependence on technology, however, 
has its risks. Systems can fail, leaving the company and its private and corporate customers unable 
to perform routine tasks. Moreover, computer networks may be vulnerable to intruders. Infiltration 
of the computer systems of a major railroad, or of our telephone or utilities companies could be 
crippling -- hampering business and private communications, delaying the delivery of food and fuel, 
or even leaving entire cities in the dark.<a href="#1./" name="e1"><sup><font size=1><u>1/</u></font></sup></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the development of computer security systems to help prevent such occurrences and 
to efficiently react if they do occur has been slow. Many companies do not yet have adequate 
computer security safeguards to protect their systems from failure or infiltration. Nor do 
industry-wide standards of care for information technology systems exist. This situation begs the 
question, what happens if something does go wrong? Who will be expected to pay? How will 
liability be determined? </p>
<p>The lawyerly answer is that liability is likely to depend on whether a company has exercised due 
care in protecting its systems. But defining due care could be difficult for both companies and for 
those who must allocate liability, such as courts and insurance providers. This is especially true if 
private industry has not agreed on computer security guidelines. </p>
<p>In the absence of industry-wide computer security guidelines, courts and insurers may decide to 
look for guidance to the government. After all, the government also faces computer security 
dilemmas as it becomes more reliant on information technology. </p>
<p>Indeed, inadequate security procedures have caused serious problems for government agencies. In 
1995, for example, according to a recent GAO report,<a href="#2./" name="e2"><sup><font size=1><u>2/</u></font></sup></a> the Defense Department's unclassified 
computer systems and networks, which contain sensitive data, suffered as many as 250,000 
attacks; some attacks actually corrupted data or paralyze systems. Attack incidents are doubling 
each year and cost the government millions of dollars. The GAO report also cites to problems at 
the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS' computer system currently is not secure enough to ensure 
the confidentiality of taxpayer data or to protect such data from manipulation by unauthorized 
persons for personal gain. </p>
<p>Perhaps because government computer breaches come to the attention of the public more 
frequently than do private breaches (which are rarely reported), the government is at the forefront 
of establishing computer security guidelines. At the behest of Congress, the civilian sector federal 
agencies have been working on securing their computer networks for several years.<a href="#3./" name="e3"><sup><font size=1><u>3/</u></font></sup></a> Although 
progress is slow, 1996 has seen a big step toward comprehensive guidelines for government 
entities. The most recent developments are summarized below.	</p>
<p>In February the Office of Management and Budget (&quot;OMB&quot;) published a revision of Appendix III 
of its circular A-130, &quot;Management of Federal Automated Information Resources.&quot;<a href="#4./" name="e4"><sup><font size=1>4/</font></sup></a> This 
document &quot;establishes a minimum set of controls to be included in Federal automated information 
security programs.&quot;<a href="#5./" name="e5"><sup><font size=1><u>5/</u></font></sup></a> The policy set forth in the OMB Circular is mandatory for federal authorities. 
It emphasizes: </p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>individual responsibility </li>
<li>system specific development of security rules </li>
<li>flexibility in necessity for formal risk assessments of specific systems </li>
<li>personnel controls </li>
<li>ability to detect and react quickly and efficiently to security threats </li>
<li>network security training </li>
<li>awareness of network interconnectivity </li>
<li>contingency planning in case of security breach </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The OMB circular also assigns various responsibilities to specific agencies. Among them, the 
National Institute for Standards and Technology (&quot;NIST&quot;) is responsible for providing guidance to 
agencies in security planning, interconnectivity, incident handling, training, and information sharing. 
In this role, this September, NIST issued its General Accepted Principles and Practices for 
Security Information Technology Systems,<a href="#6./" name="e6"><sup><font size=1><u>6/</u></font></sup></a> which supplements a 1995 handbook on computer 
security.<a href="#7./" name="e7"><sup><font size=1><u>7/</u></font></sup></a> This document sets forth eight basic principles necessary for developing computer 
security systems.<a href="#8./" name="e8"><sup><font size=1><u>8/</u></font></sup></a> In addition, it provides a check list of information technology security practices 
that NIST believes &quot;provide a common ground for determining the security of an organization and 
build confidence when conducting multi-organizational business.&quot;<a href="#9./" name="e9"><sup><font size=1><u>9/</u></font></sup></a> Included on this checklist are 
program and risk management practices, as well as sections on computer security incident handling 
and preparation for contingencies and disasters. NIST notes in its circular discussing the principles 
and practices that they provide a standard of care in the area of computer security. </p>
<p>Another government initiative is the Federal Computer Incident Response Capability (FedCIRC), 
which will assist federal agencies in &quot;their incident handling efforts by providing proactive and 
reactive computer security related services.&quot;<a href="#10./" name="e10"><sup><font size=1><u>10/</u></font></sup></a> The operational incident handling capability is 
subcontracted out by NIST to the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's CERT (SM) 
Coordination Center (CERT/CC) and the Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory 
Capability (CIAC). NIST will analyze the vulnerability data provided by FedCIRC to develop 
incident handling standards and guidelines. The service will provide summaries of security breach 
incidents, a web site with information computer security, such as tools, information about

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Administration has released, and is seeking informal
comments on, a draft of the new Commerce Department regulations on
encryption exports. </p>

<p>The new regulations create a new category of controls --
&quot;EI&quot; (which stands for &quot;encryption items&quot;). The regulations
divide these encryption items into 5 categories and create
different licensing schemes for each. </p>

<p>Certain mass-market encryption software may be released, after
a one-time review, from normal EI controls and made eligible for
mass market treatment (which includes eligibility for all the
provisions of the Export Administration Regulations applicable to
other software).</p>

<p>&quot;Recovery&quot; encryption software and equipment will be
eligible for a license to export and reexport in unlimited
quantities to all non-embargoed destinations. Applications for
key recovery and key escrow products must identify a satisfactory
key recovery agent with established security policies adequate to safeguard
keys or other escrowed material.</p>

<p>56-bit DES or equivalent non-recovery encryption items will be
eligible for 6-month export and reexport licenses after an initial
review of the item and the submission of a satisfactory key
recovery plan demonstrating a commitment to develop key recovery
products and services. Licenses can be renewed for additional six
month periods depending upon the applicant's adherence to
benchmarks set out in the original plan. All licenses issued
under this category will expire after December 31, 1998.</p>

<p>All other encryption items may be eligible for
&quot;encryption licensing arrangements.&quot; These arrangements are
like the distribution arrangements currently available for
encryption items at the State Department. Such arrangements may
allow exports and reexports of encryption software and equipment
in unlimited quantities to all non-embargoed destinations, but
applications must specify the sales territory and classes of
end-uers. Such arrangements may also impose certain reporting
requirements. Encryption items not approved for an encryption
licensing arrangement may still be granted individual licenses on
a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Encryption &quot;technology&quot; (e.g. technical data) may be
licensed for export and reexport on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>As expected, the usual Commerce Department rules on foreign
availability and de minimis content will not apply to encryption items.
Similarly, controlled software will not be eligible for
&quot;publicly available&quot; treatment, even if the source code
or object code is published in a book or other media.</p>

<p>Other notable provisions of the new regulations include a
&quot;grandfather&quot; provision for existing State Department
licenses and arrangements; detailed rules concerning Internet
distribution of encryption software; and a broad definition of
&quot;recoverable&quot; encryption which includes items that
allow access to unencrypted data without necessarily requiring
access to the keys. </p>

<p><b>ACTION: </b>Interim rule. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b> This interim rule amends the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by exercising jurisdiction over,
and imposing new combined national security and foreign policy
controls on certain encryption items that were on the United States
Munitions List, consistent with Executive Order 13026 and a
Presidential Memorandum, both issued by President Clinton on
November 15, 1996. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan to
make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products
to protect their privacy, intellectual property and other
valuable information. The plan envisions a worldwide key management
infrastructure with the use of key recovery and key escrow
encryption items to promote electronic commerce and secure communications
while protecting national security and public safety. To provide
for a transition period for the development of this key
management infrastructure, this rule permits the export and
reexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent encryption items
upon issuance by BXA of an initial license valid for six months,
if an exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and market
recoverable encryption items and to help build the supporting
international infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware
and software. <br wp="br1">

<p><font size="4">Background </font><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>On November 15, 1996, the President issued a Memorandum
directing that all encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions
List, except those specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted,
or modified for military applications, be transferred to the
Commerce Control List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026
(15 November 1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additional
provisions with respect to controls on such encryption items to
be imposed by the Department of Commerce. The Executive Order
also provides for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination
of encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List that
are placed on the Commerce Control List. In issuing the
Memorandum the President stated: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover,
such products, when used by international criminal organizations, can
threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well as
the safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation of
encryption products must be controlled to further U.S. foreign
policy objectives, and promote our national security, including
the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption items to protect their privacy, intellectual
property and other valuable information. It will support the
growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of the
global information infrastructure, and sustain the economic competitiveness
of U.S. encryption product manufacturers during the transition to
a key management infrastructure. Under this initiative,
non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will be permitted for export and reexport after a
one-time review of the item and if the exporter makes satisfactory
commitments to build and market recoverable encryption items and
to support an international key management infrastructure. This
policy will apply to hardware and software. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The relaxation of export and reexport controls on
non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will last until January 1, 1999. The temporary
relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption policy
initiative designed to promote electronic information security and public
safety. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The initiative carries out important foreign policy and
national security concerns identified by the President. Export
controls on cryptographic items are essential to controlling the
spread aborad of powerful encryption products which could be
harmful to critical U.S. national security, foreign policy and law
enforcement interests. This initiative will preserve such
controls and foster the development of a key management
infrastructure necessary to protect important national security,
foreign policy and law enforcement concerns. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule implements the Administration's policy on
encryption exports. This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) by imposing national security and foreign policy controls (&quot;EI&quot; for
Encryption Items) on certain information security systems and
equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components
specifically designed or modified therefor, including recoverable encryption software,
and related technology (&quot;encryption items&quot;).
&quot;Encryption items&quot; do not include encryption items specifically
designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications
(including command, control and intelligence applications). Such
items remain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to be
controlled by the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls.
EI controls apply to encryption software, including recoverable
encryption &quot;software&quot; transferred from the U.S. Munitions
List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November
15, 1996 (61 FR 58767). </p>

<p>This interim rule also amends the Export Administration
Regulations to require a license for exports and reexports to all destinations,
except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EI
reasons. The licensing policy is as follows: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>(1) <u>Certain mass-market encryption software</u>.
        Certain encryption software that was transferred from the
        U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant
        to E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) may be released
        from &quot;EI&quot; controls and thereby made eligible
        for mass market treatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine
        eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must
        submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption
        software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and
        company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day
        processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR
        and 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information.
        Note that the one-time review is for a determination to
        release encryption software in object code only.
        Exporters requesting release of the source code should
        refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to
        part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines
        that the software is released from EI controls, such software
        is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to
        other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market
        software. If BXA determines that the software is not
        released from EI controls, a license is required for export
        and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and
        license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        <p>(2) <u>Recovery encryption software and commodities</u>.
        Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for
        EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002,
        including encryption equipment designed or modified to
        use recoverable encryption software, may be released from
        &quot;EI&quot; controls and thereby made eligible for
        license exception RSE after a one-time BXA review.
        License exception RSE is valid for all destinations
        except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and
        Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request
        to BXA. Requests for key escrow and key recovery
        encryption items will receive favorable consideration
        provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key
        recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified
        (refer to new Supplement No. 4 to part 742) and security policies
        for safeguarding the key(s) or other escrowed
        material/information as described in new Supplement No. 5
        to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA
        and are maintained after export or reexport as required
        by the EAR and any license conditions. If the exporter or reexporter
        intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter
        or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key
        recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to part 742. In
        addition, the key recovery or key escrow system must meet
        the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742.
        Note that eligibility is dependent on continued
        fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent
        identified in Supplement 5. <br wp="br1">

        length DES or equivalent strength supported by a
        satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting
        recoverable items and services</u>. License applications
        from manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit
        key length DES or equivalent strength will be approved
        for export and reexport by the Department of Commerce
        upon the issuance of an export license valid for six
        months after an initial BXA review of the item and the
        submission of a satisfactory business and marketing plan that
        explains in detail the steps the applicant will take
        during the two-year transition period beginning January
        1, 1997 to develop, produce, or market encryption items
        and services with recoverable features. Any subsequent
        renewal is not automatic, and will depend on the applicant's
        adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set
        forth in the plan submitted for the initial license
        application. This relaxation of controls will last until
        January 1, 1999. The plan that is submitted with applications for
        the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit
        key length DES or equivalent strength must include the
        elements in new Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that
        BXA will accept requests for export and reexport of
        non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length
        DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors,
        re-sellers, and other entities that are not manufacturers
        of the encryption items. BXA will authorize exports and reexports
        of such items only in instances where a license has been
        granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The
        authority to so export or reexport will be for a time
        period ending on the same day the producer's authority to
        export or reexport ends. <br wp="br1">

                the regulatory treatment of the distribution and
                warehouse arrangements currently permitted under
                the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
                Applicants may submit license applications for
                exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities
                and software in unlimited quantities for all
                destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,
                North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will
                be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption

                extended validity periods specified by the
                applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In
                addition, the applicant must specify the sales
                territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may
                require the license holder to report to BXA
                certain information such as item description,

        Applications for the export and reexport of encryption technology
        will be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that all &quot;EI&quot; encryption items are not subject
to any mandatory decontrol or licensing requirements based on
foreign availability provisions of the EAA or the EAR In section
1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have determined that the export of encryption products
    described in this section may harm national security and
    foreign policy interests even where comparable products are or
    appear to be available from sources outside the United
    states, and that facts and questions concerning the foreign
    availability of such encryption products cannot be subject to
    public disclosure or judicial review without revealing or
    implicating classified information that could harm United
    States national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly,
    section 4(c) and 6(h)(2) - (4) of the Export Administration
    Act of 1979 (&quot;the EAA&quot;) ..., all other analogous
    provisions the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the
    regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not
    be applicable with respect to export controls on such
    encryption products. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This interim rule amends part 768 of the EAR, Foreign
Availability, to make clear that the provisions of that part do
not apply to encryption items transferred to the Commerce Control
List. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to exclude
encryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce
Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996)
from the <u>de minimis</u> provisions for items exported from
abroad. This rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to reflect that
certain encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN
5D002 that has been transferred to the Department of Commerce
from the Department of State by E.O. 13026 will be subject to the
EAR even when publicly available. Such encryption software in
both source code and object code remains subject to the EAR and
is not eligible for publicly available treatment even if published
in a book or any other writing or media. This rule also amends
part 740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR to reflect
that encryption software will not be eligible for &quot;mass
market&quot; treatment under the General Software Note or for
export as beta-test software under License Exception BETA unless
released from EI controls through a one-time BXA review (refer to new
Supplement No. 6 to part 742). Note that License Exception TMP is
available for temporary exports and reexports of encryption items
except under the provisions for beta-test software. Software and
technology that was controlled by the Department of Commerce prior
to [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE] are not affected by this rule and will
continue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment.
Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to [INSERT EFFECTIVE
DATE] will continue to be eligible for mass market treatment
under the General Software Note, and License Exception TSU for
mass-market software. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>For purposes of this rule, &quot;recovery encryption
products&quot; refer to encryption products (including software)
which allow law enforcement officials to obtain under proper
legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the
user, the plaintext of encrypted data and communications. Such recoverable
products fulfill the objectives of the Administration's encryption
policy. Other approaches to access and recovery may be defined in
the future. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule also amends part 742 of the EAR to reflect
the new combined national security and foreign policy controls imposed
by this rule, and adds a new Supplement No. 4 to part 742 titled
&quot;Key Recovery or Key Escrow Products Criteria&quot; that
includes product criteria, a new Supplement No. 5 to part 742
titled &quot;Key Recovery or Key Escrow Agent Criteria&quot; that includes
interim requirements for key recovery agents, a new Supplement
No. 6 to part 742 titled &quot;Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request
for a Mass Market Software Product that contains Encryption&quot;
that includes the criteria for the one-time review of
classification requests for release of certain encryption
software from EI controls, and a new Supplement No. 7 to part 742
titled &quot;Review Criteria for Exporter Key Recovery or Key Escrow
Development Plans.&quot; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 of the
EAR for classification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR to
reflect the Department of Justice role in the review of
encryption license applications, amends the record keeping provisions
of part 762 of the EAR, adds new definitions to part 772 of the
EAR, and amends the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to
part 774) by adding new EI controls under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and
5E002 for commodities, software and technology that are placed
under Commerce Department jurisdiction by E.O. 13026. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements on
quantities shipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters,
in order to allow the United States to fulfill the reporting
requirements of the Wassenaar Arrangement. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals of
technology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separate
Federal Register Notice. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because the
transfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions List
to the CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, the
provisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, and
contract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition of
controls. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals
issued by the Department of State prior to (INSERT DATE OF
PUBLICATION) may ship remaining balances authorized by such licenses
or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers
Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs,
citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department license
number. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and
conditions, including the expiration date, existing at the time
of issuance of the State license. Any reports required for distribution
and other types of agreements previously authorized by the
Department of State, valid at the time of this publication, should
be henceforth submitted to the Department of Commerce. Export violations,
including the terms and conditions of export, shall hereafter constitute
a violation of the EAR. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the Export
Administration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congress
on (<u>DATE OF REPORT</u>), notifying the Congress of the
Department's intention to impose controls on certain information
security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, software
and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and
related technology that will be controlled on the CCL and that
will be subject to new control procedures. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August
20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent
permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR in
Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, notice of August 15,
1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August 14, 1996 </p>

<p>(60 FR 42527). <br wp="br1">

<p><font size="4"><b>Rulemaking Requirements </b></font><br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant
    for purposes of E. O. 12866. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person
    is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to
    a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information,
    subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act,
    unless that collection of information displays a currently
    valid OMB Control Number. This rule involves collections of
    information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
    3501 <u>et seq.</u>). These collections have been approved by
    the Office of Management and Budget under control number
    0694-0088. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism
    implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
    assessment under Executive Order 12612. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5
    U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
    opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date,
    are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military
    and foreign affairs function of the United States (Sec. 5
    U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, no other law requires that a
    notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public
    comment be given for this interim final rule. Because a
    notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment
    are not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or
    by any other law, the requirements of the Regulatory
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <u>et seq.</u> ) are not
    applicable. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, because of the importance of the issues raised by
these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final
regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible
time to permit the fullest consideration of their views. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The period for submission of comments will close (<u>INSERT
DATE 45 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION</u>). The Department will
consider all comments received before the close of the comment
period in developing final regulations. Comments received after
the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but
their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or
all of the material be treated confidentially because of its
business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The
Department will return such comments and materials to the person
submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development
of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations
will be a matter of public record and will be available for
public inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness,
the Department requires comments in written form. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which
will also be a matter of public record and will be available for public
review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government
or foreign governments will not be made available for public
inspection. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The public record concerning these regulations will be
maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information
Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce,
14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20230. Records in this facility, including written public
comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,
may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations
published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal
Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of
records at the facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo,
Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer,
at the above address or by calling (202) 482-5653. <br wp="br1">

                (61 FR 58767) may be released from &quot;EI&quot;
                controls and thereby made eligible for mass
                market treatment after a one-time review. To
                determine eligibility for mass market treatment,
                exporters must submit a classification request to BXA.
                40-bit mass market encryption software may be
                eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software
                may be eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to
                new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR and
                748.3(b)(2) of the EAR for additional information.
                Note that the one-time review is for a determination
                to release encryption software in object code
                only unless otherwise specifically requested. Exporters
                requesting release of the source code should
                refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No.
                6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines
                that the software is released from EI controls,
                such software is eligible for all provisions of
                the EAR applicable to other software, such as
                License Exception TSU for mass-market software.
                If BXA determines that the software is not
                released from EI controls, a license is required
                for export and reexport to all destinations,

                be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or
                reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a
                key recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to

</p>

<p>KEY RECOVERY AGENT REQUIREMENTS; SECURITY POLICIES; KEY
RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW PROCEDURES <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of
Commerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval
of the export or reexport of key recovery encryption items
controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any
arrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key
recovery agent must reflect the provisions contained in this
Supplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA and other agencies.
This Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery
agent personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for a
license to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide,
or cause the proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA
sufficient information concerning any proposed key recovery agent
arrangements to permit BXA's evaluation, in conjunction with
other agencies, of the key recovery agent's security policies,
key recovery procedures, and suitability and trustworthiness to
maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or other escrowed material/information.
The key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant
for the export or reexport license or another party legally
obligated to the applicant to provide escrow services. BXA
retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revoke
export or reexport licenses if BXA, in conjunction with other
agencies, determines that a key recovery agent no longer meets
these criteria. The requirements related to the suitability and
trustworthiness, security policies, and key recovery procedures
of the key recovery agent shall be made terms and conditions of
the export or reexport license for key recovery items. BXA shall
require the key recovery agent to provide a representation that
it will comply with such terms and conditions. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><u>Key Recovery Agent Requirements</u> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">

identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and social security
number any new individual(s) who will assume the responsibilities
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this Supplement. Before that
individual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key recovery
agent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets the
criteria set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this
Supplement. BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, reserves the
right to determine at any time the suitability and
trustworthiness of such personnel. <br wp="br1">

<p>(8) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to
be the security and operations officer(s). <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(9) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user's
organization and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA may approve
such key recovery agents if sufficient information is provided to demonstrate
that appropriate safeguards will be employed in handling key
recovery requests from government entities. These safeguards
should ensure: i) the key recovery agent's structural independence from
the rest of the organization; (ii) security; and (iii)
confidentiality. <br wp="br1">

<p>SUPPLEMENT NO. 7 TO PART 742 - REVIEW CRITERIA FOR EXPORTER
KEY RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW DEVELOPMENT PLANS <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>1. In exchange for specific commitments from exporters to help
build and support a global key management infrastructure (through
development, production and marketing of recovery products and services),
we will permit these companies to export non-recoverable
encryption items with 56-bit key length DES, or equivalent,
encryption items as we now permit the export of certain mass
market encryption software (i.e. rapid review, flexible
licensing) for a maximum of two years. Companies' commitments
should be in the form of a letter from senior corporate
management (i.e. an officer of the company) confirming the
corporate commitment and providing (in the letter or in
attachments) the information specified below. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>2. Issuance of an initial export license valid for six months
will be based on an initial BXA review in conjunction with other government
agencies, and the submission to and approval by BXA (after appropriate
interagency review) of a plan that explains in detail the steps
the applicant will take to develop, produce or market recoverable
encryption products or services. Proposed recovery products and
services will be evaluated against technical criteria which are
found in Supplement No. 4 to this part. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>3. Any subsequent six-month renewal is not automatic, and is
subject to adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set
forth in the plan submitted for the initial license. Review will
entail assessment by appropriate government agencies, at intervals
not to exceed six months, to determine if the licensee is showing
acceptable progress in meeting the milestones set forth in the
exporter's plan. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>4. For the initial license, the applicant must commit to
implementing a key escrow, key recovery or recoverable products
and services development plan based on the following elements: <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Criteria for Exporters <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>5. In its initial application, the applicant must describe its
business and marketing plan for developing key recovery, recoverable
or key escrow products and services during the two year
transition period. The plan must describe specific actions
(including, to the extent applicable, research and development, testing,
production, distribution and marketing achievements and goals)
and the kinds and magnitude of resources expected to be committed
under the plan. In addition, the plan must describe how the applicant
will make the transition within two years from the export of
56-bit non-key recovery or non-key escrow products and services
to the export of key recovery, recoverable or key escrow products
and services. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>6. By January 1, 1998, or within six months from receiving the
initial approval for export (whichever is later), the applicant
will indicate the arrangements for export purposes made for key
recovery or key escrow (which may be internal to the company) acceptable
to BXA. Criteria for key recovery or key escrow agents are in
Supplement No. 5 to part 742. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>7. The initial plan submitted by the exporter will provide the
basis for the review and approval of the initial license and any subsequent
renewals during the two year transition period. Exporters may
amend the plan as needed during the course of this period,
subject to review. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>Criteria for Non-Manufacturing Exporters </b><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>8. An initial license will be granted for export of non
recovery products and services only if the manufacturer of those products
has submitted, and had approved according to the criteria above,
a plan to develop key recovery, recoverable or key escrow
products or services. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>Additional Factors </b><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>9. An applicant may, at its discretion, provide other
information to indicate commitment to the development of a key management
infrastructure, such as: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>a. Participation in U.S. Government pilot programs; <br

<p>744.9 Restrictions on activities of U.S. persons with respect
to certain encryption items. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(a) <u>General prohibition</u>. No U.S. person (as defined in
paragraph (c) of this section) may, without a license from BXA, knowingly
provide assistance to foreign persons, including providing
training, to manufacture or to export encryption items transferred
from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List
(Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) pursuant to Executive
Order 13026. This provision does not apply to any activity
involving such encryption items that have been licensed or otherwise
authorized by the BXA. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(b) <u>Procedures for informing persons by BXA</u>. BXA may
inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to the
EAR, that a license or other authorization is required because an
activity could involve the types of assistance described in paragraphs
(a) of this section. When such notification is provided orally,
it will be followed by a written notification within two working
days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export
Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse
the U.S. person from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph
(a) of this section. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(c) <u>Definition of U.S. person</u>. For purposes of this
section, the term U.S. person includes: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>(1) Any individual who is a citizen or permanent resident
        alien of the United States; <br wp="br1">

    </dd>
</dl>

<p>(d) <u>License review standards</u>. Applications involving
activities described in section 744.9 will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether the activity is
consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy
interests. <br wp="br1">

software is controlled because, like the items controlled under ECCN 5A002,
it has a functional capacity to encrypt information on a computer
system, and not because of any informational or theoretical value
that such software may reflect, contain or represent, or that its

<hr>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<B>
I.	Introduction</B><P>

No means of communicating is completely free from security risks.  Private rooms can be bugged.  Conventional mail can be intercepted and read.  Attorneys' offices can be burglarized.  Telephone lines can be tapped.<P>

The law has made great progress in providing criminal and civil redress for interception of electronic communications.  The courts, statutes, and ethical rules appear to be farther behind in addressing how attorneys should adapt to new technologies in their practice of law.  Security risks pose interesting and largely unanswered questions regarding lawyers' ability to protect client confidences.  Although the law is still developing to address the status of Internet e-mail communications between attorneys and clients, evaluation of current attorney-client privilege law, confidentiality rulings, and federal statutes on electronic communications and electronic surveillance can provide guidance on this issue. <P>

<B>
II.	The Risks of Internet E-mail</B><P>

	<B>
A.	Interception:</B>  In the journey of an e-mail message, interception can conceivably occur at any unprotected point along the way, such as the user's terminal, the network server, the transmission lines, electronic storage, etc.<P>

		1.	<B>
Passive Monitoring:</B>  Passive monitoring is essentially equivalent to eavesdropping.  The risk is that an unauthorized party will intercept and read the message either in transmission or in storage, thus compromising confidentiality.<P>

		2.	<B>
Active Interception:</B>  This is the feared &quot;hacking.&quot;  Variations of hacking include re-routing an e-mail transmission, modifying the transmission, interfering with authenticity, and even accessing the sender's LAN or WAN.  Here, not only is confidentiality compromised, but accuracy as well.  Another hacking risk is the potential theft of the sender's or receiver's password.<P>

		3.	<B>
Authentication:</B>  The risk here is that the message is actually from someone other than the designated sender.  Risks for lawyers in this context include receiving false information or phantom instructions. <P>

		4.	<B>
Reliability:</B>  Many transmission reliability problems are not inherent in the Internet.  Instead they are likely to be at one of the end points in message transmission.  For example, a software problem in a network server could prevent accurate messaging.<P>

		5.	<B>
Misrouting:</B>  The transmission can be misdirected through either human or computer error.<P>

<B>
III.	Internet E-mail and Confidentiality</B><P>

		Is the attorney-client privilege waived for communications sent via Internet e-mail due to lack of security?  <P>

		Is mere transmission of Internet e-mail a waiver of the privilege even if there is no breach of security?  <P>

		Is the ethical obligation of confidentiality breached if an attorney communicates with a client about confidential matters over the Internet?<P>

		This section will introduce the attorney client privilege and the ethical obligation of confidentiality and discuss each in the context of Internet e-mail security.<P>

	<B>
A.	Attorney-Client Privilege:</B>  While one state case has directly stated that an e-mail communication was privileged, the issue has not been fully litigated.  In <U>
State v. Canady</U>, 460 S.E. 2d 677, 689 (W. Va. 1995), the court decided that an e-mail message was protected by the privilege.  The opinion does not appear to treat the privileged communication differently due to its status as an electronic communication.  The e-mail message is from a corporation employee to the corporation's inside counsel regarding legal advice contained in a letter from the corporation's outside counsel.  Nevertheless, in a footnote the court states that the issue of waiver of attorney client privilege remains open to the circuit court below on reconsideration. <P>

		Communications between an attorney and client covered by the attorney-client privilege are protected from compelled disclosure.  In general, state and federal privilege is similar.  While the language delineating the elements of privilege varies, most jurisdictions privilege law can be broken into the following components.<P>

		1.	<B>
Elements of the privilege:</B><P>

			a.	a communication,<P>

			b.	between privileged persons (attorney, client, or agents of either),<P>

			c.	made in confidence,<P>

			d.	to seek, obtain, or provide legal advice,<P>

			e.	where the privilege is affirmatively raised, and<P>

			f.	not waived.<P>

			<U>
See</U> <U>
United States v. Noriega</U>, 917 F.2d 1543 (11th Cir. 1990); <U>
United States v. Machine Shoe</U>, 89 F. Supp. 357, 358-59 (1950); Edna Selan Epstein &amp; Michael M. Martin, <U>
The Attorney-Client Privilege and the Work-Product Doctrine</U> 14 (1989); Wigmore, <U>
Evidence</U> e 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).<P>

			g.	<B>
Policy:</B>  The basic policy behind the privilege can be summarized as promoting client truthfulness and encouraging a client's full, free disclosure.  <U>
E.g.</U>, <U>
Upjohn Co. v. United States</U>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981); <U>
Cox v. Administrator U.S. Steel &amp; Carnegie</U>, 17 F.3d 1386 (11th Cir. 1994); <U>
United States v. Noriega</U>, 917 F.2d 1543, 1550 (11th Cir. 1990).<P>

			h.	<B>
Choice of Law:</B>  Federal Rule Evidence 501 states that privileges are to be governed by federal common law unless state law supplies the rule of decision for an element or defense in a civil action, in which case state law will apply.  While a full choice of law analysis is outside the scope of this outline, in general, state privilege law is applied in state courts and federal privilege law is applied in federal courts in federal questions cases.  For diversity cases in federal courts, state privilege law is likely to be applied.<P>

		2.	<B>
Privileged Persons:</B>  In order to be covered by the attorney-client privilege, a communication must be between privileged persons, including the attorney, the client, agents or &quot;communicating agents&quot; of either necessary to the provision of legal services.  <U>
City of Worchester v. HCA Management Co., Inc.</U>, 839 F. Supp. (D. Mass. 1993).  Traditionally, those considered privileged persons other than the attorney and the client have been associates, law clerks, paralegals, secretaries, and other assistants who assist the attorney in rendering legal services.  <U>
Zenith Radio Corp. v. Radio Corp. of America</U>, 121 F. Supp. 792, 794 (D. Del. 1954).  In addition, accountants and other professionals have been considered privileged, but only to the extent they assist in legal, not business or other professional services.  <U>
United States v. Schwimmer</U>, 892 F.2d 237 (2d Cir. 1989).  The privilege has been extended to communicating agents (insurance agents, translators, secretaries, etc.) of either the client or attorney who facilitate the attorney-client communications, thus assisting in providing legal advice.  <U>
Golden Trade, S.r.L. v. Jordache</U>, 143 F.R.D. 514, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).<P>

			a.	<B>
Extension to E-mail:</B>  Service providers have access to e-mail to the extent necessary to perform their services and protect their rights and property.  Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. e2511(2)(a)(i) (Supp. 1995).  Whether service providers can be considered privileged persons or communicating agents of the attorney has not been addressed by any court.  To the extent the service providers' role in facilitating communication between attorney and client is recognized, then they would be categorized as communicating agents and the privilege would be retained.  Of course, the confidentiality requirement must still be met.<P>

		3.	<B>
Confidentiality:</B>  If communications are not made in confidence, the attorney-client privilege is not effective.  Traditionally, courts have held that if a client intends a communication with his or her attorney to be confidential, then the privilege will attach.  <U>
E.g.</U>, <U>
United States v. Rockwell, Int'l</U>, 897 F.2d 1255, 1265 (3d Cir. 1990); <U>
Gottlieb v. Wiles</U>, 143 F.R.D. 241 (D. Colo. 1992).  Many courts go beyond the focus on intention to require that the intention be reasonable.  <U>
In re Auclair</U>, 961 F.2d 65, 70 (5th Cir. 1992); <U>
United States v. Noriega</U>, 917 F.2d 1543, 1551 (11th Cir. 1990); <U>
EDO Corporation v. Newark Ins. Co.</U>, 145 F.R.D. 18 (D. Conn. 1992).<P>

			a.	<B>
Extension to E-mail:</B>  If courts consider e-mail to be confidential, then use of e-mail to communicate privileged matters will not pose a threat to the attorney-client privilege.  Proving the <U>
intention</U> of confidentiality in an e-mail transmission would seem to be no more difficult than with any other type of communication.  Less clear is whether the intention to keep an e-mail confidential is <U>
reasonable</U>.  Certainly, it is possible to breach the confidentiality of attorney-client e-mail transmissions, but perhaps, no more likely than with voice mail, which has not been seriously questioned.  Cellular telephone communications have, on the other hand, been found notoriously lacking in confidentiality.  Lawyers may have been slow to join the Internet e-mail revolution, but courts have not been deluged with cases claiming lack of privilege or failure of confidentiality due to the use of e-mail. <P>

				Two state courts have viewed internal e-mail communications as protected by the privilege.  <U>
National Employment Service Corporation v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company</U>, Suffolk Co. Sup. Ct. No. 93-2528-G (Mass. Sup. Ct. Dec. 21, 1994); <U>
State v. Canady</U>, 460 S.E. 2d 677, 689 (W. Va Sup. Ct. 1995) (noting that sufficient facts were found by the trial court, then waiver of attorney-client privilege may still be found under these circumstances).<P>

				California has passed legislation providing that confidential communications do not lose their confidential status simply because they take place on a &quot;facsimile, cellular telephone, or other electronic means.&quot;  Cal. Evid. Code e952.  If the privilege is withdrawn for Internet e-mail in other jurisdictions, we can expect to see more legislation of this sort.<P>

			b.	<B>
Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968</B>:  18 U.S.C. e2517(4) provides that &quot;no otherwise privileged wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this chapter shall lose its privileged character.&quot;  The effect of this provision on intercepted e-mails is uncertain, but is discussed more fully below in the section on federal statutes relating to electronic surveillance and electronic communications.  Depending on how choice of law and preemption issues are resolved, this provision could provide significant protection for privileged and confidential e-mails.<P>

			c.	<B>
Reasonable Expectation of Privacy for Technologies Other Than E-mail:</B>  Courts taking the view that the intention of confidentiality must be reasonable are likely to inform their judgment with cases addressing the reasonable expectation of privacy in various technologies.  (The ethics rulings on confidentiality have referred often to the reasonable expectation of privacy cases in analyzing technology related confidentiality questions.)  Courts have held there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in cellular, portable, or cordless telephone conversations, and pagers.  <U>
Tyler v. Berodt</U>, 877 F.2d 705, 706-07 (8th Cir. 1989) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in cordless phone); <U>
Edwards v. State Farm Ins. Co.</U>, 833 F.2d 535, 541 (5th Cir. 1987) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in cellular telephone conversations); <U>
Edwards v. Bardwell</U>, 632 F. Supp. 584, 589 (M.D. La. 1986) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in radio transmitted telephone calls); <U>
State v. Washington</U>, 855 P.2d 315, 317-18 (Wash. Ct. App. 1993) (person leaving message on pager has no reasonable expectation of privacy in message left); <U>
People v. Wilson</U>, 554 N.E.2d 545, 552 (Ill. App. 1 Dist. 1990) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in radio transmitted telephone calls); <U>
State v. Howard</U>, 679 P.2d 197, 206 (Kan. 1984) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in cellular telephone conversation by person placing call).  <U>
But see</U> <U>
People v. Bulllock</U>, 277 Cal. Reptr. 63, 66-67 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) (reasonable expectation of privacy for data housed in pager).  Generally, courts have found wire transmissions to be more private than radio transmissions.  <U>
See</U> <U>
Dorsey v. State</U>, 402 So. 2d 1178, 1183-84 (Fla. 1981).<P>

			d.	<B>
Reasonable Expectation of Privacy for E-mail:</B>  One court has held (in the 4th Amendment search and seizure context) that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in e-mail transmitted and stored by on-line service providers.  <U>
United States v. Maxwell</U>, 42 M.J. 568, 1995 CCA LEXIS 129, at *8-14 (U.S.A.F. Crim. Ct. App. 1995) (finding &quot;virtually no risk that appellant's computer transactions would be received by anyone other than the intended recipients&quot;) (emphasis added).  While one court's view certainly does not create a trend, this court seemed to place faith in the security of e-mail. <P>

			e.	<B>
Presence of Third Parties:</B>  The presence of nonessential third parties during the original confidential communication abrogates the privilege.  <U>
E.g.</U>, <U>
United States v. Gann</U>, 732 F.2d 714, 723 (9th Cir. 1984) (communication to attorney in front of police officers who were conducting a search of client's house).  <P>

				(1)	<B>
Presence of Third Parties Extended to E-mail:</B>    E-mail is unlike the traditional circumstance of having a third party physically present to undermine the confidentiality of the communication.  In the e-mail context, the third party would be remote, as in the case of a service provider.  As discussed above in the context of privileged persons, however, the service provider may be considered a communicating agent of the attorney or client necessary to the performance of legal services.  If so, the third party presence would not destroy the privilege. <P>

			f.	<B>
Inadvertent Disclosure:</B>  There is a certain amount of overlap between inadvertent disclosure pertaining to the original communication and inadvertent disclosure treated as an implied waiver (discussed directly below). In the context of confidentiality, inadvertent disclosure most clearly applies to the case of the eavesdropper.  The traditional view is that if confidentiality was intended, then, absent negligence the privilege is maintained even if a communication is overheard or intercepted.  <U>
People v. Decina</U>, 138 N.E.2d 799, 807 (N.Y. 1956) (explaining test is whether it was <U>
reasonable</U> to intend that communication not be overheard).  <P>

				(1)	<B>
Inadvertent Disclosure Extended to E-mail:</B>  The negligence approach above supports the position that e-mail communications can retain their privileged nature even if intercepted as long as the interception is not foreseeable.  The question remains, is it foreseeable?  As discussed above, while e-mail is at least as secure as voice mail, and has not had the well-publicized security problems of cellular phone transmissions, courts have not answered this question.<P>

		4.	<B>
Implied Waiver</B><P>

			a.	<B>
Implied Waiver by Inadvertent Disclosure Generally:</B>  Courts and commentators have taken three views on the effect of an inadvertent disclosure on the attorney client privilege.  The inadvertent disclosure cases most clearly applicable to e-mail are those cases in which a fax has been misdirected, often, but not only, to the adversary.<P>

				(1)	<B>
The Strict View:</B>  Under this view, promoted by Wigmore, the attorney-client privilege is waived by any inadvertent disclosure resulting from negligence.  <U>
In re Sealed Case</U>, 877 F.2d 976, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  <U>
International Digital Sys. Corp. v. Digital Equip. Corp.</U>, 120 F.R.D. 445 (D. Mass. 1988); <U>
Underwater Storage Inc. v. United States Rubber Co.</U>, 314 F. Supp. 546 (D.D.C. 1970).<P>

				(2)	<B>
The Balancing View:</B>  The case-by-case approach uses several factors to determine whether it is fair considering all the circumstances to find inadvertent disclosure of confidential information to be a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.  One typical version of the factors (evaluating inadvertent disclosure in the context of document production) balances (1) the reasonableness of precautions taken to prevent inadvertent disclosure; (2) the number of inadvertent disclosures; (3) the extent of disclosure; (4) delay in curing and steps taken to rectify disclosures; and (5) the interests of justice in excusing the error.  <U>
Hartman v. El Paso Natural Gas Company</U>, 763 P.2d 1144, 1151-53 (N.M. 1988).  <U>
See also</U> <U>
Alldread v. City of Grenada</U>, 988 F.2d 1425, 1433 (5th Cir. 1993); <U>
United States v. Pepper's Steel &amp; Alloys</U>, 742 F. Supp. 641, 643 (S.D. Fla. 1990).<P>

				(3)	<B>
The No Waiver View:</B>  Under this approach, inadvertent disclosure alone will not waive the privilege under the theory that the right should not be unintentionally waived.  <U>
Transamerica Computer Corp. v. IBM Corp.</U>, 573 F.2d 646, 647 (9th Cir. 1978); <U>
Shriver v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., Inc.</U>, 145 F.R.D. 112 (D. Colo. 1992); <U>
Mendenhall v. Barber-Greene</U>, 531 F. Supp. 951, 955 (N.D. Ill. 1982).<P>

			b.	<B>
Implied Waiver by Inadvertent Disclosure Extended to E-mail:</B>  Inadvertent disclosure of e-mail can occur in many ways.  An e-mail message can be sent to the wrong address, an e-mail address can be mistakenly included on an e-mail routing list, or a party can intercept the message without permission at any point along the way.<P>

				(1)	<B>
The Strict View:</B>  Although the strict view requires that the attorney-client privilege be guarded carefully, it is not absolute.  This view finds waiver when disclosure results from negligence.  With this in mind, is merely sending an e-mail to a client, which is later intercepted, likely to be considered negligent?  Probably not.  Less certain is whether failure to use encryption would be considered negligent.  Once communications reach a certain level of sensitivity, common sense dictates that a court could find negligence if an attorney fails to use encryption or switch to a safer means of communicating.<P>

				(2)	<B>
The Balancing View:</B>  As with any balancing approach, results are probably less certain in this category.  In jurisdictions adopting the case-by-case approach, it is likely that inadvertent disclosure of e-mail would not be considered a waiver of the attorney-client privilege unless the sender has repeatedly sent privileged information to the wrong parties, has unusual security problems, or some other facts in the case would create unfairness if waiver were not implied.<P>

				(3)	<B>
The No Waiver View:</B>  Jurisdictions following the approach that inadvertent disclosure does not alone constitute implied waiver are unlikely to find that the attorney-client privilege is waived if a third party is mistakenly sent an e-mail message or otherwise gains access to one.  The reason for this conclusion is that these jurisdictions find waiver only where it is intended.<P>

				(4)	<B>
Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968</B>:  18 U.S.C. e2517(4) provides that &quot;no otherwise privileged wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this chapter shall lose its privileged character.&quot;  The effect of this provision on intercepted e-mails is uncertain, but is discussed more fully below in the section on federal statutes relating to electronic surveillance and electronic communications.  Depending on how choice of law and preemption issues are resolved, this provision could provide substantial protection for the privileged status of e-mails and protect against claims that the privilege has been waived through interception.<P>

				(5)	<B>
The Confidential Legend:</B>  The use of a confidential legend on an e-mail is likely to have effect only in jurisdictions following the balancing approach, where it would be one of the precautions taken.  In &quot;strict view&quot; jurisdictions, a mis-sent fax is likely to be considered negligently sent, leading to waiver.  In &quot;no waiver&quot; jurisdictions, as discussed above, intent to waive would be missing, thus no waiver would be implied.<P>

	B.	<B>
Ethical Obligation of Confidentiality</B><P>

		1.	<B>
Generally:</B>  The ethical obligation of confidentiality is far broader than the attorney-client privilege.  Model Rule of Professional Responsibility 1.6 states that &quot;[a] lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation.&quot;  Thus, while the privilege protects from compelled disclosure those confidential attorney-client communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, the duty of confidentiality protects information from other sources as well, and in situations other than judicial proceedings.  Essentially, more information is protected and in more circumstances.<P>

		2.	<B>
Application to Internet E-mail:</B>  Few ethics rulings address the relationship between e-mail and confidentiality directly.  In one interesting advisory opinion, a disabled attorney was investigating the possibility of setting up an on-line legal service.  The advisory committee expressed concern about service provider access to privileged information sent via e-mail.  The committee stated that &quot;unless certainty can be obtained regarding the confidentiality of communications via electronic media, that representation of a client or communication with a client via electronic media, may violate Rule 1.6, absent an express waiver by the client.&quot;  S.C. Bar Adv. Op. 94-27 (1995).  The committee came to this conclusion after choosing rulings on cellular telephone communications as an appropriate analogy.  Whether the analogy is apt will be discussed further below.  Although not directly stated, the language of this advisory opinion would appear to apply to voice mail as well as e-mail, as voice mail is merely another electronic medium.<P>

		3.	<B>
Cellular Telephone Analogy to E-mail:</B>   Multiple jurisdictions have decided or advised that attorneys should not have confidential discussions with clients without notifying their clients and getting informed consent.  N.Y.C. Eth. Op. 1994-11 (not requiring informed consent, but requiring the attorney to exercise reasonable caution, minimize exposure of client confidences, and take sufficient steps to insure security); Mass. Adv. Op. 94-5 (requiring informed consent to use of cellular telephone); N.H. Adv. Op. 1991-92/6 (1992) (informed consent required unless scrambling device is used); Iowa Ethics (p. No. 90-94 (1991) (advising lawyer to explain that communication is not confidential on cell phone). <P>

			a.	The New York City opinion has three elements worth contemplating in the e-mail context.  <P>

				(1)	The opinion explains that the lawyer should &quot;exercise caution.&quot;  The level of caution required for e-mail transmissions is probably less than for cellular phones.  These decisions came about as the result of well-publicized cellular telephone eavesdropping.  While there have been isolated cases of Internet hacking, the problem is not nearly as prevalent as cell phone eavesdropping.  One reason for this is the difference in difficulty involved.  Anyone with a scanning device capable of intercepting the FM radio signals of cellular telephones can easily accomplish the interception.  Computer hacking takes substantially more know how.  <P>

				(2)	The opinion advises the attorney to warn the client that the conversation is occurring on a cellular phone.  The logical basis for this position is that unless the lawyer warns the client, the client may not know that the lawyer is on a cordless or cellular phone.  In contrast, an e-mail recipient knows by observation that the means of transmission is electronic mail.  Perhaps, however, lawyers should be responsible for warning their clients of e-mail security risks?  If so, when?  At the beginning of a representation?  Every time an e-mail is sent?  The first communication by e-mail?  <P>

				(3)	The committee stated that the lawyer &quot;should consider taking measures sufficient to ensure, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that communications are no more susceptible to interception than standard land-line telephone calls.&quot;  In the e-mail context, this would be an invitation to encryption.  The language of this opinion suggests that lawyers have discretion regarding the need for extra security measures, a logical for e-mail as well.  If e-mail is the only practical means of communicating and highly confidential information must be transmitted, then encryption may be part of exercising reasonable caution.  <P>

			b.	A Colorado Opinion took the position that for all technologies &quot;a lawyer must exercise reasonable care when selecting and using communications devices in order to protect the client's confidences or secrets from unauthorized disclosure.&quot;  Colo Ethics Op., No. 90 (1992).  This opinion also cited court cases addressing reasonable expectation of privacy of various technologies as a means of determining what is &quot;reasonable,&quot; but cautioned attorneys to do their own research into the security of individual technologies.<P>

		4.	<B>
Inadvertent Disclosure of Confidential Information:</B>  As in the materials addressing privilege, the ethics rulings speak to the problem of inadvertent disclosure.  Aside from the cases where materials were inadvertently disclosed in a document production, the cases seem to result most often from a mis-sent facsimile.  Several state bars have decided that adverse counsel receiving such a fax have no obligation to return or refrain from using the confidential material.  This posture is analogous to the strict view of attorney-client privilege waiver discussed above where the privilege is waived if negligently disclosed by mistake.  The ABA, on the other hand, has issued two formal opinions supporting the position that adverse counsel receiving inadvertent confidential or privileged faxes should refrain from reading them, notify the sending attorney, follow the sending attorney's instructions regarding document disposition, and refrain from using the information until a court provides definitive direction.  ABA Formal Op. 94-382; ABA Formal Op. 92-368.<P>

			a.	<B>
Inadvertent Disclosure of Confidential Information Extended to E-mail:</B>  While the mis-sent e-mail may be rarer occurrence than the mis-sent facsimile, the possibility is not that remote.  For example, e-mail address lists can be easily prepared for mass mailings.  Sending to the wrong mailing list could result in sending an e-mail to the wrong place.  It has become common practice to include a warning legend on facsimiles to alert recipients of the confidential nature of a document.  Thus, in the fax context there is at least the possibility of adverse counsel returning an e-mail unread.   <P>

				With e-mail, however, it seems less practical to use a warning legend because there is no front page covering the confidential message.  The e-mail alternatives to the cover sheet warning legend seem to be a note in the subject heading or an introductory sentence or two proclaiming the warning before the message begins.  Unless the legend is merely a short &quot;Privileged and Confidential&quot; at the top the legend would become a likely source of irritation to intended recipients (clients) who would have to scroll through the warning.  Another problem is that of deciding which transmissions get the warning.  Attaching the warning to all transmissions may be safest, but unnecessary and annoying.  One solution might entail attaching the warning only for sensitive, privileged communications.  But if you forget, does your previous practice make a finding of breach of the confidentiality obligation (or waiver of the attorney-client privilege more likely?<P>

<B>
IV.	Federal Privacy Protection -- The Illegality of Intercepting E-mail</B><P>

	<B>
A.	Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (&quot;Title III&quot;) and The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (&quot;ECPA&quot;)</B>:  The intent of Title III, 18 U.S.C. ee 2510-2520, was to balance the needs of privacy of wire and oral communications, on the one hand, and to provide for and control the ability of law enforcement to engage in electronic surveillance.  <U>
See</U> <U>
Gelbard v. United States</U>, 408 U.S. 41, 48 (1972).  The ECPA significantly amended Title III to include electronic communications and to add sections regulating stored wire and electronic communications.  Taken together Title III, as amended by ECPA and other acts, 18U.S.C. ee 2510-2711, regulate electronic communications and electronic surveillance.<P>

		1.	<B>
Interception of Electronic Communications:</B>  Interception and disclosure of electronic communications is prohibited.  18 U.S.C. e2511(1).  Persons violating this statute are subject to fines or imprisonment, e2511(4) or civil suits, e2511(5).<P>

		2.	<B>
Access to Stored Electronic Communications:</B>  Obtaining, altering or preventing authorized access to stored electronic communications is prohibited.  18 U.S.C. e2701(b).  This violation is punishable by fines or imprisonment, e2701(b), or civil suits, e2707.<P>

		3.	<B>
Service Provider Exceptions:</B>  Electronic communications service providers can access electronic communications as long as the access is in the ordinary course of business and is either necessary for rendering the service or to protect the service provider's rights or property.  This access is available to service providers whether the electronic communication is in transmission, e2511(3), or stored, e2701(c).  <P>

		4.	<B>
Illegally Intercepted Communications Excluded as Evidence</B>:  Illegally intercepted communications cannot be used as evidence in court or other formal government proceedings.  In addition, evidence derived from illegally intercepted communications is also excluded.  18 U.S.C. e2515.  Thus, at least where information is <U>
illegally</U> intercepted, the attorney-client privilege seems to be secure.  <P>

		5.	<B>
Intercepted Privileged Communications:</B>  18 U.S.C. e 2517(4) provides that &quot;[n]o otherwise privileged wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this chapter shall lose its privileged character.&quot; <P>

			This language could conceivably provide sweeping protection for the attorney-client privilege for communications sent via Internet e-mail (or any electronic medium).  Several issues arise, however, in considering this provision in the context of state privilege law. <P>

			a.	<B>
Preemption</B>:  Many cases have stated that Title III and ECPA preempt the field of electronic surveillance to the extent that state regulation is more permissive than the federal laws.  <U>
See, e.g.</U>, <U>
United States v. Marion</U>, 535 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1976); <U>
State v. Aurilio</U>, 366 So. 2d 71 (Fl. App. 1979).  Thus state laws can provide for more safeguards in controlling law enforcement wiretapping, but they cannot allow law enforcement more leeway in gathering evidence than does the federal law.<P>

				Section 2517(4) was passed as part of Title III in 1968 in a criminal context relating to the control of law enforcement surveillance.  It is unclear how the provision applies to civil intercepts of privileged communications by persons not engaged in law enforcement.  Thus, the scope of preemption remains unclear in the context of attorney-client privilege law.<P>

				Multiple cases also state that federal evidence law applies in federal courts, including the evidentiary provisions of Title III should apply to federal prosecutions.  <U>
See e.g.</U>, <U>
United States v. Testa</U>, 548 F.2d 847 (1977); <U>
United States v. Marion</U>, 35 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1976); <U>
United States v. Feiste</U>, 792 F. Supp. 1153 (D. Neb. 1991).  These cases do not refer specifically to the provision on privileged communications, however, they support the position that intercepted communications remain privileged at least in federal prosecutions.<P>

			b.	<B>
Applicability of State Law</B>:  The &quot;otherwise privileged&quot; language does suggest that common law waiver or confidentiality principles may still apply.  As discussed above, Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, provides for the application of state privilege law where substantive state law is applied in a case.  The safety of the attorney-client privilege may then depend on choice-of-law or federal preemption issues.<P>

				One of the few cases addressing e 2517(4) states that &quot;[t]he sections's use of the language 'otherwise privileged' to us means privileged other than by virtue of their character as private telephone conversations.&quot;  <U>
United States v. Turner</U>, 528 F.2d 143 (9th Cir. 1975).  The case goes on to discuss the legislative history to conclude that the communications remain privileged in the event that they were privileged under traditional privilege law.  Nevertheless, this case does not address the preemption issue, so it is unclear whether waiver or other privilege elements may still come into play in the analysis.<P>

		6.	<B>
Interception of Privileged Communications By Service Providers:</B>  While e2517 provides at least some privilege protection in federal cases, service providers are given limited permission to disclose intercepted communications in a manner that may effectively destroy the privilege. Although service providers cannot generally divulge intercepted or accessed stored communication, they can turn over to law enforcement officials any such communications that &quot;appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.&quot;  e2511(3)(a)(iv).  The law does not directly address how this affects the privileged status of an e-mail.  Confidentiality of the communication is, however, clearly compromised.<P>

			a.	<B>
Confidentiality:</B>  The service provider exception raises serious concerns regarding the ethical obligation of confidentiality.  If service providers have the discretion to turn materials over to law enforcement officials, attorneys and clients communicating via e-mail risk that their communications will be divulged.  For example, if a criminal defendant client and his or her attorney were communicating by e-mail about the facts of the case (probably inadvisable), a service provider who randomly came across that information could turn it over to law enforcement officials.  <P>

			b.	<B>
Privilege:</B>  Whether information turned over to law enforcement officials may also be introduced as evidence in court is unclear.  The privilege does not appear to be lost merely because the interception is by a service provider.  <U>
Compare</U> e2517 <U>
with</U> e2511(3)(a)(iv).  However, if the privilege is found to be waived, under the analysis in section III.A above, then the intercepted information given to law enforcement officials could be used as evidence as well.<P>

		7.	<B>
Illegally Obtained Electronic Communications:</B>  If a burglar breaks into your office and steals your files, it seems unlikely that a court would find the attorney-client privilege waived under any of the theories described above.  Similarly, it seems that the attorney would not be found in violation of ethical obligations unless there was a known security risk, such as a faulty lock, an open window, or maybe even a particularly sensitive document not left in a safety deposit box.  On the other hand, it is illegal to intercept cellular telephone calls as well, but the materials discussed above, in the sections on privilege and confidentiality, suggest that the use of a cellular phone to discuss confidential information is an ethical violation, and that it may constitute waiver of the attorney-client privilege depending on the jurisdiction deciding the issue.  Where e-mail falls in this spectrum is uncertain.  Common sense might suggest that because it is generally simpler either to burglarize an office or intercept cellular telephone calls than it is to intercept e-mail messages that e-mail messaging would be safe from the treatment given to cellular telephones.<P>

	<B>

V.	Available Security</B><P>

Firewalls:</B>  Acts as a barrier to limit incoming and outgoing communications to particular locations on the server, to or from particular addresses, etc.<P>

What Lawyers Should Do to Preserve the Attorney-Client Privilege and Confidentiality:</B>  Establishing an e-mail confidentiality policy and making attorneys in a firm aware of it is likely to improve e-mail security.

<H2 align=center>Legal Aspects of Network Security</H2>
<CENTER><I>By <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart A. Baker</a></I></CENTER>

<hr>
<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P>
<hr>

<P>Summary:  This outline provides an overview of three legal means to promote computer network security: 
<OL><LI>The imposition of civil liability on those hired to provide network security; <P>
<LI> Imposition of civil liability on those who violate network security; and<P>
<LI>The criminal prosecution of those who violate network security.  </OL><P>
<P>Of course, none of the three assures secure networks.  In practice, network security vendors seek to contract out of the liability that could arise from failures in network security.  Computer hackers, notoriously antiauthoritarian, are imperfectly deterred by the threat of criminal prosecution.  And hackers will not have the deep pockets that make attractive targets for civil suits.  Laws are only part of the development of safe and secure computer networks.  Technical advances fueled by the prospect of income from corporations that demand the best available security in the age of open networks -- to a much greater degree than legal incentives -- will drive the development of computer security.

<h3>I.   Standard of Care for System Security</h3>
<blockquote><H4>A.   Common Law Standard of Care</H4>
<P>The customer has the right to expect a reasonable level of network security in light of the vendor's special knowledge, skills, and ability.  <I>Diversified Graphics v. Groves</I>, 868 F.2d 293 (8th Cir. 1989) (holding computer specialist to professional's standard of care). <I>But</I> <I>see</I><I> Hospital Computer Sys. Ltd</I>., 788 F. Supp. 1351 (D. N.J. 1992) (computer consultants not held to professional's standard of care).  A vendor's use of industry standard security technology may serve as evidence of reasonableness, but will not always relieve the vendor of liability -- industry practice may be unreasonable.  T.J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737 (2d. Cir.), cert. denied, 287 U.S. 662 (1932).

<P>Liability for unreasonable security could arise when:

<ol><LI><B>Loss of Data Due to Security Breach</B>:  because a customer hires a security vendor to protect data, the loss or disclosure of data resulting from security failure could give rise to liability.  Ed Fine Oldsmobile v. Diamond State Tel. Co., 494 A.2d 636 (Del. 1985) (telecommunications company liable for negligent loss of data).  <P>
<LI><B>Loss or malfunction of encryption keys</B>:  a security vendor or key escrow agent who cannot decrypt a customer's files or retrieve a customer's private key from escrow could face substantial liability.<P>
<LI><B>Failure to Detect System Intruders</B>:  irrespective of damage, a network's inability to detect intruders could give rise to liability.  Ostalkiewicz v. Guardian Alarm, 520 A.2d 563 (R.I. 1987) (residential security company was held negligent for its failure to have an installed alarm system contact the local police). <P>
<LI><B>Unauthorized Copying</B>:  failure to prevent or detect unauthorized copying, even though the underlying data is still available to the customer, could also give rise to vendor liability.</OL>

<H4>B.   Government Standard of Care</H4>
<OL><LI><B>Computer Security Act</B>:  in coordination with NIST, each government agency must establish a computer security policy "commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information contained in such system."  Pub. L. No. 100-235, 101 Stat. 1724, 1729-30 (1988) (codified at 40 U.S.C. 759 note); 15 U.S.C.  278g-3 (1988 & Supp. 1994).<P>
<LI><B>National Archives and Records Administration</B>:  NARA has elaborated security procedures and standards of care for stored electronic records, including measures to restrict unauthorized access and to require backup and recovery procedures for electronic records.  36 C.F.R.  1234 (1994).  A high standard of care is applied to "official" file copies of text documents on electronic media.  Id. at 1234.22. <P> 
<LI><B>NIST</B>:  forthcoming publication, "Federal Computer Security Principles and Practices," will serve as a benchmark for judging the adequacy of computer security and determining what constitutes "reasonable" security.</OL>

<H4>C.  Model Contract Standards of Carez</H4>
<P>Various organizations have proposed standards of care to incorporate into commercial contracts, frequently in the realm of financial transactions.
<OL><LI><B>UCC Article 4A</B>:  provides an "ordinary care" standard for security of electronic funds transfer transactions, subject to modification in light of any specific security procedures agreed to between customer and bank.  U.C.C.  4A-201 (1991).  <P>
<LI><B>UNCITRAL EDI Uniform Rules of Conduct</B>:  requires security that is commercially reasonable in the circumstances, with reference to trade-data interchange protocols.<P>
<LI><B>ABA Model EDI Agreement</B>:  provides a standard of care linked both to technical standards chosen by the parties and published industry guidelines used within the particular industry.  Model Electronic Data Interchange Agreement and Commentary, reprinted in 45 Bus. Lawyer 1717 (1990).</ol>

<H4>D.  Commercial Contract Standard of Care</H4>
<P>Standard contracts used by vendors providing computer system security often contain the following clauses intended to replace the common law standard of care and minimize the vendor's liability for system security failures.<P>
<OL><LI><B>Disclaimers of Warranties</B>:  disclaim all express warranties as well as implied warranty of merchantability and implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (U.C.C. 2-314, 2-315 (1991)).  Also vendors may expressly disclaim warranty to any third party who might rely on the security of a customer's computer system. <P>
<LI><B>Waiver of Liability for All Negligent and Grossly Negligent System Security Failures</B>:  standard contracts waive liability for negligence to the extent permitted by law.  Most standard contracts also include a waiver of consequential and incidental damages.  Transport Corp. of Am. v. IBM, 30 F.3d 953 (8th Cir. 1994) (no consequential damages for disc drive failure).  The potentially enormous consequential damages that may result from breaches in security should cause vendor's concern.  See Evra Corp. v. Swiss Bank Corp., 673 F.2d 951 (7th Cir.) (finding bank would be liable for consequential damages for failure to transfer funds as directed by customer if bank were aware of special circumstances related to the transfer) cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1017 (1982).  <P>
<LI><B>Burden of Proof</B>:  vendors may place the burden of proof on the customer to establish that the security failure was the fault of the vendor.  If the source of the security failure cannot be proven, as may often be the case, the vendor would not be liable.<P>
<LI><B>Force Majeure</B>:  most standard contracts include a broad force majeure clause that would extend to equipment malfunction and other events that are arguably within the vendor's control.<P>
<LI><B>Indemnification from Suppliers Who are Responsible for Security Failure</B>:  vendors, through contracts with suppliers, can require indemnification and hold accountable the party responsible for the security failure.  <P>
<LI><B>Liquidated Damages</B>:  contracts can limit total damages for which the vendor could be liable to either a sum certain or an externally determined amount, such as the amount to date paid by plaintiff-customer to the vendor.  Ritchie Enter. v. Honeywell Bull, Inc., 730 F. Supp. 1041 (D. Kan. 1990) (damages for computer system failure limited by contract to purchase price of system).  But a remedy so inadequate that it fails the "essential purpose" of the contract might not be given effect.  Milgard Tempering, Inc. v. Selas Corp., 902 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1990) (refusing to give effect to a contract's "repair or replace" clause when the vendor proved unable to provide a product that met customer's requirements).<P>
<LI><B>Integration Clause</B>:  such a clause is sought by vendors to preclude a customer from arguing that the vendor's statements prior to or contemporaneous with the contract constituted an express warranty regarding system security.  Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Secord, 357 N.Y.S.2d 702 (1974).  But see Glovatorium v. NCR Corp., 684 F.2d 658 (9th Cir. 1982) (liability for salesmen's misrepresentations of computer system's capabilities);  Sierra Diesel Injection Serv. v. Burroughs Corp., 874 F.2d 653 (9th Cir. 1989) (integration clause in standard form contract not given effect).<P>
<LI><B>Insurance</B>:  computer insurance policies available to both vendor and customer can cover losses attributable to fraudulent modification, damage, disappearance, or destruction of electronic data.  Parties could agree to a contract provision requiring one party to obtain such insurance.</OL>

<H4>E. Clinton Administration's Liability Proposals</H4>
<P>The National Information Infrastructure (NII) commission established by Vice President Gore, in its June 1995 report on security of the NII, noted that "civil liability is likely to create incentives for improving the security of information systems. . . .  However, consensus about what constitutes reasonable standards for information security will be difficult to achieve."  NII Security: The Federal Role (June 5, 1995) (attached to OMB Press Release re National Information Infrastructure Security Issues Forum Releases "NII Security:  The Federal Role" (June 14, 1995)).  The report suggested:  <P>
<OL><LI>Adoption of performance or technical standards for computer security, which might constitute de facto liability standards.<P>
<LI>Testing by independent nationally recognized "security certification" laboratories, which might also constitute de facto liability standards.<P>
<LI><B>Sector-Specific Liability Standards</B>:  "Because security requirements greatly vary in different contexts, such as finance, law enforcement, medicine, national security, research, and education, there may be a need for context-specific standards that can evolve as requirements change."  This arguably reflects the context-specific common law standard of care.  </OL>

<H4>F.  Other statutory standards of care</H4>
<P>The government has imposed heightened and relaxed standards of care on service providers for the following sectors:
<OL><LI><B>Telecommunications Common Carriers</B>:  both the standard of care and potential liability of telecommunications carriers are limited in the tariffs approved by the FCC.  47 U.S.C.  203 (1988 & Supp. V 1993);  Lebowitz Jewelers Ltd. v. New England Telephone & Telegraph, 508 N.E.2d 125 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987) (telephone carrier not liable for losses from jewelry store robbery even though burglars disconnected alarm from an easily accessible carrier's box).   <P>
<LI><B>Bonded Warehousemen</B>:  a higher standard of care applies to certain regulated storage facilities.  Warehousemen must exercise care "commensurate with the task;" warehousemen may not disclaim or waive this standard of care, but may by contract with the customer limit damages to a sum certain.  U.C.C.  7-204(1) (1991).</OL></blockquote><P>

<h3>II.  Civil Actions Against Those Who Violate Network Security</h3>

<blockquote><H4>A.  State tort law</H4>
<P>Tort law provides various causes of action against perpetrators of computer crime, including:
<OL><LI><B>Invasion of privacy</B>:  although the scope of this tort claim and, in some states, statutory cause of action, varies, invasion of privacy in all likelihood would be applicable to unauthorized access to private computer data.<P>
<LI><B>Conversion</B>:  the tort of conversion involves the intentional wrongful taking or interference with the personal property of another.  Since the essence of the tort is the deprivation of an owner's right to use or possess property, it could be applicable to data damage or theft.  As conversion can apply to the taking of either tangible or intangible property, there is likely some overlap among conversion, trade secrets misappropriation, and intellectual property right violations.<P>
<LI><B>Misappropriation of trade secrets</B>:  most states provide a private cause of action for the theft and disclosure of trade secrets, but not all electronic information qualifies as a trade secret -- only that information which is non-public, commercially advantageous and protected.  Kewannee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470 (1974).  Federal intellectual property law may preempt certain trade secret actions, including those related to copyrighted software.  Joseph D. Zamore, Business Torts  17.08(3) (1991).  But see Warkington Assoc., Inc. v. Rel-Time Eng. Sys., Inc., 522 F. Supp. 367, 368 (N.D. Ill. 1981) ("[N]either Congress nor the courts have viewed the Federal Copyright Act as preempting the common law of trade secret misappropriation.")<P>

<LI><B>Interference with Contract</B>:  the tort of interference with contract provides for recovery against a party who intentionally induces another party not to perform a contract.  Stofer v. First Nat'l Bank, 571 N.E.2d 157, 166 (Ill. 1991).  Computer sabotage conducted for commercial advantage could give rise to this cause of action. <P>

<LI><B>Interference with Prospective Advantage</B>:  the tort of interference with prospective advantage involves a party who intentionally deprives another of a business opportunity.  O'Brien v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 401 N.E.2d 1356, 1357 (Ill. 1980).  Computer sabotage conducted for commercial advantage could also give rise to this cause of action. </OL>

<H4>B.  Civil Copyright Action</H4>
<P>Unauthorized use of copyright material without the copyright owner's permission can give rise to an infringement action.  17 U.S.C.  106, 501(a).  Plaintiff is not required to prove defendant's intent to infringe.  Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Frena, 839 F. Supp. 1552, 1558 (M.D. Fla. 1993).  Therefore, inadvertent theft of copyright material from a computer network could give rise to an infringement action.

<H4>C.   Section 605 of the Communications Act</H4>
<P>Civil cause of action against any person who intercepts and discloses unauthorized wire or radio communication, or who receives unauthorized wire or radio communication for his benefit.  47 U.S.C. 605(e)(3) (1988 & Supp. V 1993);  California Satellite Sys. v. Seimon, 767 F.2d 1364 (9th Cir. 1985). Remedy can include actual damages, statutory damages, and litigation costs -- statutory damages may be multiplied if repeated violations are found. There is no liability for the inadvertent interception of data.  Snider Communications Corp. v. Cue Paging Corp., 840 F. Supp. 664 (E.D. Ark. 1994) (no cause of action against paging company which had received data stream that included data from another paging service's subscribers).

<H4>D.  Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)</H4>
<OL><LI><B>Unlawful Interception of Communications</B>:  civil cause of action against any person engaged in unauthorized interception and disclosure of electronic communications.  18 U.S.C.  2520 (1988);  Boddie v. American Broadcasting Co., 731 F.2d 333 (6th Cir. 1984) (civil actions against television network that broadcast an unauthorized recording of plaintiff).  Electronic communication is broadly defined to include all types of data communications.  Remedy can include statutory damages, punitive damages, and litigation costs -- statutory damages may be multiplied if repeated violations are found.  Biton v. Menda, 812 F. Supp. 283 (D.P.R. 1993) (each intercepted conversation justified a $10,000 civil penalty).  <P>
<LI><B>Unlawful Access to Stored Communications</B>:  a provider of electronic communication service, subscriber, or customer aggrieved by a unauthorized access to stored electronic communications may bring a civil action against any person which engaged in that violation.  18 U.S.C.A. 2707 (Supp. 1995);  Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, 816 F. Supp. 432 (W.D. Tex. 1993), aff'd, 36 F.3d 457 (5th Cir. 1994).  Damages can include actual damages, defendant's profits, minimum statutory damages of $1,000, and litigation costs.  18 U.S.C.A.  2707(c).</OL> </blockquote><P>

<h3>III.   Computer Crime</h3>
<blockquote><P>The following statutes provide a basis for the prosecution of virtually every imaginable computer crime.  Although state and national legislators are justifiably alarmed by the potential damage which could result from computer crime, additional criminal provisions are not required.
<H4>A.   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986</H4>
<OL><LI><B>Fraudulent Use of Access Device</B>:  criminal penalties for use of an unauthorized "access device," such as computer password, PIN code, or smart-card, to obtain something of value, including electronic funds transfers and credit card charges.  18 U.S.C. 1029(a)(Supp. 1995);  United States v. McNutt, 908 F.2d 561 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1084 (1991);  United States v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2d Cir. 1988).<P>
<LI><B>Alter, Damage, or Destroy Information on a "Federal Interest" Computer</B>:  extends not only to systems used by the U.S. government and systems operated by government-regulated financial institutions, but also to any other system that links two or more computers in different states.  18 U.S.C.A.  1030(a)(5)(Supp. 1995).  Requisite "intent" is intent to obtain access to the system, not an intent to cause damage.  United States v. Morris, 928 F.2d 504 (2d. Cir.) (conviction of Robert Morris for releasing the Internet "worm" that crippled 6,000 computer systems worldwide), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 817 (1991). <P>
<LI><B>Commit Fraud for Financial Gain on a "Federal Interest" Computer</B>:  criminal penalties for those who use a federal interest computer to defraud victims of property or anything of value.  18 U.S.C.A.  1030(a)(4)(Supp. 1995).<P>
<LI><B>Access to Classified Government Information</B>: criminal penalties for unauthorized access to classified government information with the intent to injure the United States or benefit a foreign nation.  Id.  1030(a)(1).<P>
<LI><B>Fraudulent Access to Financial Records</B>:  criminal misdemeanor penalties for unauthorized access to computer records of financial institution, credit card issuer, or consumer credit reporting agency.  Id. 1030(a)(2).</ol>

<H4>B.   State Computer Crime Laws</H4>
<OL><LI><B>Unauthorized Tampering</B>:  New York law imposes criminal liability for the unauthorized alteration of a computer program or computer data.  N.Y. Penal Law  156.20 (Supp. 1995); People v. Versaggi, 629 N.E.2d 1034 (1994) (Kodak computer technician convicted for shutting down phone service of company chemical plant).<P>
<LI><B>Trade Secret Violations</B>:  most states criminalize the theft and disclosure of trade secrets.  Not all information qualifies as a trade secret -- only that information which is non-public, commercially advantageous and protected.  Kewannee Oil, 416 U.S. 470. </OL> 

<H4>C.  Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)</H4>
<OL><LI>Unlawful Interception of Communications:  criminal penalties for interception of electronic communications without the consent of at least one party to the communication.  18 U.S.C.A. 2510,  2511 (1970 & Supp. 1995).  Electronic communication is broadly defined to include all types of data communications.<P>
<LI><B>Unlawful Access to Stored Communications</B>:  criminal penalties for unauthorized access to electronic communications stored on a network or personal computer.  18 U.S.C.A. 2701 (Supp. 1995).</OL>

<H4>D.  Garden Variety Criminal Statutes</H4>
<OL><LI><B>Wire Fraud</B>:  criminal liability for fraudulent attempt to obtain money or property by means of a wire communication.  18 U.S.C.A.  1343 (Supp. 1995).  Wire communication includes computer messages sent via the public switch network.  The broad definition of property extends to property interest in the non-disclosure of proprietary information.  Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19 (1987) (wire fraud conviction of Wall Street Journal reporter's disclosure of column contents).  But see United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994) (wire fraud statute did not provide basis for criminal copyright prosecution of bulletin board operator). <P>
<LI><B>Copyright Infringement</B>:  criminal liability for intentional infringement of copyright for commercial advantage or financial gain.   Copyright Act 506(a); 18 U.S.C.A.  2319 (Supp. 1995).  Downloading alone might constitute infringement.  MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 517 (9th Cir. 1993) (civil infringement liability), cert. dismissed, 114 S. Ct. 671 (1994).<P>
<LI><B>Racketeering (RICO)</B>:  Criminal liability for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity, including fraud, interference with commerce, or money laundering.  18 U.S.C.A.  1961 (Supp. 1995).  <P>
<LI><B>Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property</B>: criminal liability only applicable to transport of "goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more." 18 U.S.C.A.  2314 (Supp. 1995).  The transport of stolen intellectual property may not qualify as "goods, wares, [or] merchandise" for purposes of this statute.  United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991) (ITSP not applicable to transport of source code); Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985) (ITSP not applicable to interstate shipments of pirated Elvis recordings).<P>
<LI><B>Interference with Commerce</B>:  criminal liability for interference with interstate commerce by means of extortion or threat of violence.  18 U.S.C.A.  1951 (1970 & Supp. 1995).<P>
<LI><B>Interference with Communications Systems</B>:  criminal liability for intentional interference with the function of a communications "line, system, or station."  18 U.S.C.A. 1362 (Supp. 1995). <P>
<LI><B>Vandalism to Government Property</B>:  criminal liability for intentional depredation against property of the United States.  Id.  1361.  This provision served as the basis for destruction of a governmental computer.  United States v. Komisaruk, 885 F.2d 490 (9th Cir. 1989).<P>
<LI><B>Vandalism to Public Records</B>:  criminal liability for intentional damage to public records and documents maintained by the government.  18 U.S.C.A.  2071 (Supp. 1995).    </OL>

<H4>E.   Pending Federal Legislation (August, 1995)</H4>
<OL><LI><B>Exon's Communications Decency Act</B>:  Senator Exon's (Republican-Nebraska) amendment to S. 652 targeted on-line porn, and those who transmit objectionable materials through the Internet or commercial on-line services -- but it may also impose liability on operators of the telecommunications systems and on-line services used to transmit that material.  Status:  approved by the Senate;  opposed by Speaker Gingrich and as yet not brought before the House for a vote.  <P>
<LI><B>Grassley Electronic Racketeering Bill</B>:  Senator Grassley's (Republican-Iowa) bill, S. 974, was introduced as the "Elliot Ness meets the Internet" legislation.  S. 974, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 1995.  Status:  referred to Senate Judiciary Committee, no immediate action anticipated.  In addition to the controversial encryption measures, Grassley's bill would:<P>
<UL><LI>Amend definition of racketeering activity to criminalize acts which "damage or threaten to damage electronically or digitally stored data."<P>
<LI>Specify that any person who uses a computer or computer network in furtherance of racketeering activity is subject to prosecution under RICO.  <P>
<LI>Provide law enforcement authority to obtain Title III electronic surveillance orders for any RICO violation, including the computer-related RICO violations in the Grassley bill.  </UL></ol></blockquote><P>

<P>

	Congress has just enacted the most significant telecommunications legislation in more than sixty years.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &quot;1996Act&quot; or &quot;S.652&quot;) eliminates and reduces numerous barriers to entry in the local telephone, long distance and video markets.  There are a number of other provisions that will significantly change all aspects of telecommunications law from Television to the Internet.  <P>

<P>

	This analysis of the 1996 Act focuses on the changes to the Communications Act with the greatest impact upon electric utilities.  The electric utilities are directly affected by the legislation in two principal ways.  <P><P><B>
First</B>, the 1996 Act opens up the local exchange market to competition.  This will significantly enhance the value of the existing communications assets of utilities.  For virtually any new entrant in the local telephone market, an electric utility's extensive fiber optic network, other communications facilities and access to poles, conduits, ducts and rights-of-way would be treasured assets.  Many electric utilities are likely to participate in the newly competitive telephone market by:  (1)selling capacity in their fiber optic cable system to new entrants; (2)participating in joint ventures with experienced telecommunications providers; or (3)even entering the local market directly.  Regardless of the form of participation, an understanding of the new structure of the local telephone market will be valuable.  In addition, participation in the local telephone market may subject utilities to obligations ranging from interconnection responsibilities to Universal Service Fund contributions.  <P>

<P>

	<B>
Second</B>, the 1996 Act dramatically expands the new pole attachment requirements for electric utilities.  Pole attachments for all telecommunications carriers, not just cable operators, are now subject to federal regulation.  The 1996Act also provides a new rate formula for attachments given to these telecommunications carriers which, while more generous than the old formula, does not allow a utility to recover its fully allocated costs, much less the market rate.  Finally, the 1996Act may impose, for the first time, a mandatory requirement on an utility to provide pole attachments.  <P>

<H4 align=center>Local Competition<P>

Preemption</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The 1996 Act broadly preempts all state and local government barriers to entry.  The FCC is given authority to determine which state and local statutes and regulations are preempted.

</UL>
<H4 align=center>Interconnection Obligations</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The 1996 Act creates three tiers of interconnection obligations.  <B>
First</B>, the legislation includes a new statutory definition of common carriage that will impose basic interconnection obligations on all telecommunications carriers that directly or indirectly serve the public.  Electric utilities that provide telecommunications services directly to the public, or indirectly to the public by providing capacity to other carriers, may have these basic interconnection obligations:

<UL>

<LI>interconnect directly or indirectly with other carriers; and

<LI>conform to network interconnection standards established by the FCC and handicapped accessibility standards.

</UL>
<LI><B>
Second</B>, all local exchange carriers (&quot;LECs&quot;) (including new entrants) will have four additional interconnection obligations intended to enable multiple carriers to provide competing services in the same area:

<UL>

<LI>permit resale of their services;

<LI>provide number portability and dialing parity to the extent technically feasible;

<LI>offer access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way; and

<LI>establish reciprocal compensation agreements for origination and termination of telecommunications.

</UL>
<LI><B>
Third</B>, incumbent local exchange carriers have the most stringent set of interconnection requirements:

<UL>

<LI>duty to comply with the interconnection obligations of all LECs

<LI>duty to negotiate in good faith interconnection agreements with new entrants covering the following subjects;

<LI>duty to provide nondiscriminatory, unbundled interconnections at any technically feasible point of incumbent LEC network at reasonable rates;

<LI>duty to provide services at wholesale rates to competitors for resale at rates that do not include retail marketing and billing and collection charges;

<LI>duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the network; and 

<LI>duty to provide actual collocation of equipment on incumbent LEC premises at reasonable rates and nondiscriminatory conditions.

</UL></UL>
<H4 align=center>Interconnection Agreements</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The heart of the statutory plan to facilitate competitive entry into the local exchange market is the interconnection agreement to be negotiated between an incumbent LEC and a new entrant.  

<LI>If an agreement cannot be negotiated, either party can request the State Commission to conduct compulsory arbitration.

<LI>Interconnection agreements are subject to State Commission approval.  Judicial review of State Commission decisions will be in federal district courts.

</UL>
<H4 align=center>Universal Service</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The 1996 Act lays the groundwork for changing the Universal Service system.

<LI>The difficult task of devising a new Universal Service plan has been delegated to a Joint Board of FCC and State Utility Commissioners.

<LI>The legislation expands the class of carriers required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund to all telecommunications carriers providing interstate communications.  This expanded class will include some electric utilities.

</UL>
<H4 align=center>Pole Attachment Regulation<br>



Expanding Scope of Regulation</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The 1996 Act expands pole attachment regulation to cover attachments given to all telecommunications carriers (except for incumbent local exchange carriers) in addition to cable TV system operators.

<LI>Existing pole attachment agreements with telecommunications carriers remain in force with their rate provisions intact.

</UL>
<H4 align=center>

Rate Regulation</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The formula used previously for cable TV system operators will continue to apply to them as long as they do not expand to telecommunications.  This formula limits rates to the cost of the proportionate amount of usable space occupied, and does not permit any recovery of costs allocable to unusable space.  The old formula will also be used for telecommunications carriers for two years.

<LI>The FCC is required to establish a new formula by regulation within two years.  The new formula will permit utilities to recover the same cost of the proportionate amount of usable space occupied under the old formula, plus two-thirds of the proportionate cost of the unusable space.  Moreover, rate increases arising from the new formula must be phased-in over five years from the effective date of the FCC regulation.  In summary, while the new formula is more generous than the old, it will not be effective for seven years and will prevent utilities from recovering their fully allocated costs, much less market rates.

</UL>
<H4 align=center>Mandatory Pole Attachments</H4>

<UL>

<LI></CENTER>The 1996 Act also contains a <B>
mandatory</B> pole attachment provision, stating that &quot;[a] utility <B>
shall</B> provide a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.&quot;

<LI>The precise scope of this mandatory duty is unclear.  It could be:

<UL>

<LI>a requirement to provide attachment to any requesting carrier or cable TV operator;

<LI>a requirement to provide attachment to any requesting carrier or cable TV operator if an attachment has already been given to a competing carrier or cable TV operator; or

<LI>a requirement that a utility providing telecommunications or cable TV provide nondiscriminatory access to competitors.

</UL>
<LI>Since the previous pole attachment provisions withstood a Fifth Amendment challenge precisely because there was no mandatory obligation, the current statute may be vulnerable to a Fifth Amendment challenge.

</UL>
local telephone competition
	Many electric utilities are considering participation in the local telephone market in one form or another.  Most electric utilities have extensive fiber optic networks and other assets that would be quite valuable for any competitive entry into the local telephone market.  The 1996Act increases the value of these assets by breaking down barriers to entry into the local exchange market.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Preemption of State and Local Entry Barriers</h4>

	The 1996 Act broadly preempts all state and local statutes and regulations that create barriers to entry in the local exchange and interstate markets.  This blanket removal of entry barriers opens the way for utilities, long distance companies, cable television companies, competitive access providers, and others to enter the local exchange market.  This preemption provision is also likely to curtail the ability of a state or local government to impose substantive franchising regulations on carriers attempting to enter the telecommunications market.  However, a state or local government might be able to require a franchise if the grant were a ministerial action.  <P>

<P>

	Under the preemption provision, a State retains authority to &quot;protect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers.&quot;  However, a State's attempt to restrict entry unduly is not likely to prevail since the FCC has the authority to determine that such regulation is preempted.  This FCC power will probably be used to invalidate most attempts to restrict entry.  <P>

  <P>

	The 1996 Act includes an explicit provision preserving the right of local governments to impose such fees.  State or local governments can &quot;require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis.&quot;  The key requirement is that the fee must be &quot;competitively neutral.&quot;  If a Regional Bell Operating Company (&quot;RBOC&quot;) is not charged a fee, then an electric utility offering telecommunications services should not have to pay one.  <P>

	<h4 align=center>Interconnection Requirements</h4>

	<p>The 1996 Act establishes interconnection requirements that allow requesting carriers to interconnect with the network of an existing telecommunications carrier.  The 1996 Act imposes these interconnection obligations in two ways:  (1) through a generalized interconnection obligation required of all telecommunications carriers; and (2) through interconnection obligations that are specifically required of all local exchange carriers.  Within six months of enactment, the FCC is responsible for developing regulations to implement both categories of interconnection obligations.  To the extent that they are consistent with Federal law, State access and interconnection obligations are not preempted.<P>

<P>

	The first category of interconnection requirements will require an electric utility providing telecommunications services to allow competing carriers to interconnect with the utility's communications network.  The second category of interconnection requirements will be instrumental in allowing new entrants seeking to provide telecommunications to take advantage of the vast communications network of the incumbent local exchange carrier (&quot;LEC&quot;).  <P>

<h4 align=center>Interconnection Requirements For All Telecommunications Carriers</h4>

	The 1996 Act contains a generalized interconnection duty that is imposed on all &quot;telecommunications carriers.&quot;  <P>

<h4 align=center>Expansion of Common Carriage</h4>

	Under the 1996 Act, a &quot;telecommunications carrier&quot; is a &quot;provider of telecommunications services....&quot;  In turn, &quot;telecommunications service&quot; means the &quot;offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used to transmit the telecommunications service.&quot;<P>

<P>

	The definition of &quot;telecommunications carrier&quot; is potentially a significant expansion of the interconnection obligations currently required of all common carriers because under the 1996 Act a 
telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a <B>
common carrier</B> under this Act only to the extent that it is engaged in providing telecommunications services.... <P>

<P>

	Previously, it was possible for an utility to provide &quot;private carriage&quot; by negotiating individualized agreements with common carriers such as competitive access providers.  However, these provisions could potentially reclassify the same utility activity as common carriage.  Common carriers are subject to a number of requirements including: (1) filing interstate tariffs with the FCC; (2) charging just and reasonable rates; (3) serving all customers in a non-discriminatory manner; and (4)providing interconnections as described below.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Interconnection Obligations</h4>

	The 1996 Act requires each telecommunications carrier:  <P>

<P>

(1) to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers; and<P>

(2) not to install network features, functions, or capabilities that do not comply with the standards established pursuant to section 255 or256.<P>

<P>

Therefore, electric utilities providing &quot;telecommunications services&quot; have potential interconnection obligations.  However, the interconnection obligations of LECs are much greater.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Local Exchange Carrier Interconnection Obligations</h4>

	LEC interconnection requirements are further divided into two categories:  (1)interconnection obligations required of all LECs (including new entrants); and (2)additional obligations required of only incumbent LECs.  A LEC is a provider of telephone exchange service or exchange access service.  A company that completes a local call between customers provides telephone exchange services, while a company that connects a customer with a long distance telephone carrier provides exchange access service.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Interconnection Requirements of All LECs</h4>

	Under the first category, the 1996 Act specifies that all LECs (including new entrants) have the following duties:  <P>



<UL>

<LI>A duty not to prohibit or impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of the LEC's telecommunications services.

<LI>A duty to provide number portability (to the extent technically feasible) and dialing parity.  Number portability permits consumers to retain the same local phone number regardless of which LEC they are using.  Local dialing parity permits consumers to dial the same number of digits regardless of which carrier they use.

<LI>A duty to offer access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of telecommunications services on rates, terms, and conditions that are consistent with the 1996 Act's pole attachment regulations.

<LI>A duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the origination and termination of telecommunications.

</UL>

These requirements are intended by Congress to encourage competition by knocking down entry barriers, opening networks and requiring cooperation between LECs.  A new entrant in the local exchange market will be required to comply with this list of local exchange carrier obligations.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Interconnection Requirements of Incumbent LECs</h4>

	&quot;Incumbent local exchange carriers&quot; must satisfy a much more stringent set of interconnection requirements, designed to reduce barriers for new entrants.  An &quot;incumbent LEC&quot; is a carrier offering local service in the area at the time of enactment, or one classified by the Commission as having a market position comparable to an &quot;incumbent LEC.&quot;  <P>

<P>

	Incumbent LECs have the following duties:<P>



<UL>

<LI>A duty to negotiate, in good faith, agreements that incorporate the duties that are required of all LECs, and the following duties:

<LI>A duty to provide interconnection to any requesting carrier.  An interconnection agreement must contain rates, terms, and conditions that are &quot;just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory....&quot;  Further, it must provide for interconnection at any technically feasible point within the incumbent LEC's network, and the agreement must be at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or &quot;to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection....&quot;

<LI>A duty to provide, on an unbundled basis and at rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, nondiscriminatory access to network elements at any technically feasible point.

<LI>A duty to offer any telecommunications service that it offers at retail to subscribers for resale at wholesale rates.  The wholesale rates shall be determined by the state commission on the basis of the retail rates minus the marketing, billing and collection costs avoided by the LEC.  The reasonableness of these rates will be an issue that creates substantial administrative litigation.  

<LI>Duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the information necessary for the transmission and routing of services using that LECs facilities and network.

<LI>A duty to provide, at rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, for actual collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the LEC.

</UL>

	The additional interconnection requirements and obligations imposed upon incumbent LECs are intended to promote competition by reducing barriers to entry and by preventing LECs with established market power from using their monopoly power in the local exchange markets to prevent the development of competition.<P>

<h4 align=center>Waivers of Interconnection Requirements</h4>

	In an effort to alleviate any adverse economic burdens that any of the LEC interconnection requirements may cause, the 1996 Act includes certain exemptions. The most significant of these exemptions is that LECs with less than 2percent of the subscribed access lines nationwide are permitted to petition the relevant State commission for a modification or suspension of interconnection requirements required of all LECs, and the requirements required only of incumbent LECs.  To the extent the State believes that imposing interconnection obligations upon these carriers would create an adverse economic impact on consumers or carriers, or would be technically infeasible, the State is permitted to suspend the interconnection obligations.  <P>

<P>

	In addition, rural telephone companies are exempt from the interconnection requirements for incumbent LECs until they receive an interconnection request that the State determines is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with the universal service provisions of the 1996Act.<P>

	<h4 align=center>Procedures for Negotiation of Interconnection Agreements</h4>

	The heart of the statutory plan to facilitate competitive entry into the local exchange market is the interconnection agreement to be negotiated between an incumbent LEC and a new entrant.  An incumbent LEC must agree to negotiate over each of the interconnection obligations discussed above.<P>

  <P>

	The new entrant (or the incumbent LEC) can ask the State commission to conduct compulsory arbitration.  The request must be made during the 25-day window between the 135th and 160th day after the new entrant initially requested negotiation of an interconnection agreement.  The State commission has only about six months to complete the arbitration.  <P>

<P>

	Regardless of whether the State commission is requested to take part in the negotiations, all negotiated interconnection agreements are subject to final approval from the State commission.  The standard by which the State commission reviews these interconnection agreements for approval depends upon the State commission's involvement in the negotiation process.  <P>

<P>

	In reviewing an interconnection agreement in which the State has not intervened, the State has broad discretion to reject the agreement if it would not be consistent with &quot;the public interest, convenience, and necessity....  In reviewing an interconnection agreement that was achieved through arbitration by the State commission, however, the State can reject the agreement only if it determines that it does not satisfy the interconnection standards mandated by Congress.  Appeals from State commission interconnection determinations will be heard by federal district courts.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Universal Service Contributions</h4>

	The 1996 Act lays the groundwork for changing the system of Universal Service.  The 1996 Act delegates to a Joint Board of FCC and State Utility Commissioners the task of creating a new Universal Service plan for a competitive environment.  <P>

<P>

	The 1996 Act also expands the class of carriers required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund:  <P>

<P>

Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service.<P>

<P>

Thus, electric utilities providing interstate telecommunications services will be required to contribute funds to the Universal Service Fund.  As mentioned above, an electric utility will be considered a telecommunications carrier depending upon the degree to which it offers telecommunications services to the public.  Any other provider of interstate telecommunications may also be required to make a contribution if the Commission decides the public interest warrants.  <P>

<P>

	As for telecommunications carriers that provide intrastate telecommunications services, the 1996 Act does not preempt state regulations that mandate particular universal service contributions for that state.  <P>

<h4 align=center>POLE Attachment Regulation</h4>

	The 1996Act makes three critical revisions to the pole attachment provisions in the Communications Act, which cover poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way.  <B>
First</B>, the 1996Act broadens the scope of pole attachments subject to regulation.  <B>
Second</B>, the 1996Act establishes a new formula for the additional pole attachments subject to regulation which provides for increases over the old rate formula.  However, these increases will occur very gradually, and still will not allow utilities to recover their fully allocated cost, much less market rates.  <B>
Third</B>, the 1996Act may be construed to require utilities to furnish pole attachments in some circumstances.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Expansion of Pole Attachment Regulation</h4>

	The 1996 Act greatly expands the coverage of federal pole attachment regulation.  Previously, federal law only regulated pole attachments for cable television providers.  However, under the 1996 Act, federal regulation extends to pole attachments for virtually all telecommunications carriers.  <P>

<P>

	There is only one exception.  Pole attachments provided to an &quot;incumbent local exchange carrier,&quot; such as an RBOC, are not covered by the 1996 Act.   Presumably, incumbent LECs have, or can readily obtain, comparable pole attachments.  Incumbent LECs that want attachments from an electric utility can be charged market rates.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Pole Attachment Rates For Telecommunications Carriers </h4>

	Pole attachment rates for a cable system that will be used solely for provision of cable services will continue to be subject to the old formula.  Pole attachments for telecommunications carriers will be set at rates that will increase gradually over the old formula.  Very gradually.  <P>

<P>

	Under the formula that will continue to apply for cable television providers, an electric utility can only charge for the cost related to the proportion of usable space that is occupied on the pole.  By only considering the percentage of the usable space occupied, the old rate formula does not reflect any of the utility's costs for the unusable space on the pole.  Accordingly, a utility is prohibited from recovering its fully allocated costs under the formula that will continue to apply to cable TV operators.  <P>

<P>

	For the next two years, the rates for telecommunications carriers' new pole attachments will also be subject to the same formula previously applied only to cable TV operator attachments.   Fortunately, current pole attachment agreements will remain in force with their rate provisions intact.  However, new pole attachment agreements with any telecommunications carrier will be subject to the old rate formula immediately.  As under existing law, the new federal pole attachment regulations will not apply in states where pole attachment regulation meets the federal standards.  <P>

<P>

	The FCC is required to adopt new rate regulations for pole attachments provided to telecommunications carriers within two years.  These regulations must permit utilities to recover the full proportionate cost of the usable space (as under the current formula) plus two-thirds of the proportionate cost of the non-usable space (which was not permitted previously).  Clearly, utilities will still be prevented from recovering their fully allocated costs.  <P>

<P>

	While the new rate formula will permit rate increases, these increases must be phased in through equal annual increments over a five-year period commencing when the FCC's rate regulations become effective.  In contrast to the 1996Act's prompt implementation of most provisions, it will take seven years before these rate provisions are fully effective.  <P>

<h4 align=center>Mandatory Pole Attachments</h4>

	The 1996 Act may impose a new <B>
requirement</B> that utilities provide pole  attachments to requesting carriers.  While the previous pole attachment provisions did not require a utility to provide or renew a pole attachment,  the new legislation states that:  <P>

<P>

A utility <B>
shall</B> provide a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.  <P>

<P>

	This mandatory access provision will lead to litigation over two critical issues.  <B>
First</B>, it is not clear from this language whether this provision:  (1)requires a utility to provide attachments to any requesting cable television system or telecommunications carrier; (2)requires a utility providing attachments to one cable system or one telecommunications carrier to provide them to all competing carriers (subject to space limitations); or (3)requires a utility providing telecommunications or cable TV service to provide nondiscriminatory access to competitors.  <P>

<P>

	<B>
Second</B>, there is a good argument that the mandatory access provision, particularly if construed broadly, is a taking under the Fifth Amendment.  In <I>
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</I>, 458U.S. 419 (1982), the Supreme Court found that a New York statute requiring landlords to give cable television operators access to their property for cables and switches was a taking.  <P>

<P>

	Relying on <I>
Loretto</I>, the Eleventh Circuit invalidated the previous pole attachment provision because it found that the FCC effectively required a utility to maintain a pole attachment.  The Supreme Court, however, reversed.  It construed the Pole Attachment Act not to require a utility to provide a pole attachment.  <P>

<P>

	Nevertheless, the Supreme Court specifically left open the application of <I>
Loretto</I> if utilities were required &quot;to enter into, renew, or refrain from terminating pole attachment agreements.&quot;  The new statutory provision poses precisely this question.  Utilities will be able to challenge the mandatory access provisions on constitutional grounds.

<a name="1">EPA ACTS TO INVOLVE PUBLIC IN NEGOTIATED REGISTRATION ACTIONS</a></h4>

<P>

	EPA has announced that it plans to begin seeking input from public interest groups and other members of the &quot;public&quot; in registration decisions that previously had been negotiated between the Agency and registrants.  This new policy, published in the Federal Register on August 10, 1994, may have an important effect on negotiated registration actions to reduce risks.<P>

	For several years, EPA has tried to avoid formal action to suspend or cancel registrations, believing these procedures are too time and resource consuming.  Instead, EPA has acted by negotiating with registrants.  Generally, EPA informs registrants what restrictions it wants, ranging from hazard warning changes to deletion of label uses to cancellations, and the negotiates with the registrant(s) to a level of restriction both sides find acceptable.  Then, the registrant submits a &quot;voluntary&quot; request that EPA take the action agreed upon, and EPA implements the decision.<P>

	The decision as to what level of restriction is acceptable to EPA and the negotiations that lead up to the voluntary action to date have taken place in private, with just the registrant and EPA participating.  This was thought by both sides to preserve any settlement or attorney work product privileges, and, of course, to avoid a burdensome public suspension or cancellation hearing, with potential adverse publicity.  Among recent examples are the Alar withdrawal and the withdrawal of mercurial biocides from the marketplace.<P>

	Now, EPA is indicating that it plans to open to members of the public the thus-far closed process of negotiating product withdrawal or restriction.  The Federal Register notice dated August 10 indicates that EPA will be providing notice of negotiations concerning these &quot;voluntary&quot; actions to public interest groups and others to involve them in the decision making.  This action is likely to have a serious disturbing influence on the negotiation process.<P>

	In the future, registrants must be especially careful to have clearly articulated ground rules before undertaking any negotiations with EPA.  If it is not possible to agree upon a role for non-parties that is satisfactory to the registrant, the registrant may be compelled to consider the alternative of having EPA begin formal suspension or cancellation action.<P>

	Under current law, these proceedings generally move very slowly, and any resolution that could have been reached with EPA through pre-complaint negotiation also can be attained in negotiations to resolve a suspension or cancellation hearing.  However, EPA has been aggressive in threatening to publicize any formal hearing, and making the registrant appear to be a malefactor.<P>

<h4 align=center><a name="2">DOT FINALIZES NEW HAZMAT STANDARDS, PROPOSES OTHERS</a></h4>

<P>

	The Department of Transportation's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) recently updated regulations for hazardous materials transportation.  59 Fed. Reg. 67390 (Dec. 29, 1994).  The changes bring the regulations into conformity with international standards, specifically those in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.<P>

	The new regulations amend approximately one-third of the hazardous materials rules.  Many of the changes are editorial; however, some are more substantive, e.g., the addition of new categories to the hazardous materials classification tables and reclassification of certain other materials.  The rules are effective October 1, 1996, with voluntary compliance beginning immediately.<P>

	RSPA has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking relative to hazardous materials transportation registration and fee assessment.  60 Fed. Reg. 5822 (Jan. 30, 1995).  Comments on the new fee proposal are due by April 3, 1995.  Because the current annual fee of $300 does not generate adequate revenues to fund the nationwide emergency response training program, RSPA is proposing a graduated fee scale ranging from $300 to $5050, depending on material type.<P>

	Radioactive materials would be at the high end with a $5,050 fee ($50 for processing).  Fees for explosives and certain materials poisonous by inhalation would range from $300 to $5,050, depending on quantity.  Hazardous materials in bulk quantities would be assessed fees between $300 and $5050, depending on the number of different bulk packagings used during a registration year.  Anyone transporting registrable hazardous materials in non-bulk packaging or anyone not transporting in one year, but planning to do so in the next year, would pay a $300 fee.<P>

	Only one change would be made in the definition of materials.  The regulation would be expanded to include every &quot;material poisonous by inhalation.&quot;  The proposed rules would make permanent the exemption from registration for foreign-domiciled parties offering registrable quantities of hazardous materials only from outside the United States.  This exemption applies only if the other country does not impose a registration requirement or fee on United States companies.<P>

	In other activity, RSPA terminated a rulemaking proceeding begun in 1987 which questioned the need for shippers to obtain proof of insurance from each hazardous material carrier.  Since adequate enforcement mechanisms regarding insurance already exist, RSPA considered a rule burdensome and unnecessary.<P>

<h4 align=center><a name="3">CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION (CWC) LIKELY  TO IMPACT MANY U.S. CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUPPLIERS</a></h4>

<P>

	The U.S. Department of Commerce is developing  regulations to implement the Chemicals Weapons Convention (&quot;CWC&quot;).  This international agreement will have a broad impact on the U.S. chemical industry, affecting approximately 6,000 U.S. facilities that produce, ship or consume a wide range of commercial chemicals and related products.  They will be subject to reporting obligations and possibly even inspections under this new program.  59 Fed. Reg. 66291, 66292.<P>

	The CWC is a multi-lateral treaty that prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer or use of chemical weapons.  It also establishes an ambitious program for monitoring production and trade in chemicals that have &quot;dual uses;&quot; <U>
i.e.</U>, chemicals which are used in commercial applications but also are ingredients for various military chemical agents.  The United States and 130 other countries signed the CWC on January 13, 1993.  President Clinton has submitted the treaty and implementing legislation to Congress.  The treaty will not enter into force until 180 days after the 65th nation ratifies the convention.  The Preparatory Commission, the body of signatory states currently working out implementation matters, assumes an effective date as early as July 1995.<P>

	Chemicals covered by the CWC are divided into three schedules based on their possible utility in developing chemical weapons.  Schedule 1 covers known warfare agents and their immediate precursors.  These chemicals have limited commercial applications.  Schedule 2 covers toxic chemicals and precursors that have some industrial uses.  Schedule 3 covers chemicals with broader commercial applications.  The CWC also covers &quot;other relevant facilities&quot; that produce unscheduled discrete organic chemicals or discrete organic chemicals containing phosphorus, sulfur and chlorine above specified thresholds.<P>

	Because many of the chemicals covered by the CWC have legitimate commercial applications, the Commerce Department predicts that the Convention will have a far-reaching impact on U.S. industry.  For example, thidiglycol (&quot;TDG&quot;), which is commonly used to manufacture ink for ballpoint pins, also is a precursor for the blistering agent mustard.  Similarly, trimethyl phosphite, which is used in insecticides, also is a precursor for some nerve agents.<P>

	The CWC requires an extensive reporting and international inspection regime for facilities, including civilian industries, that produce and in some cases process or consume chemicals that could be used in a weapons' program.  The Bureau of Export Administration (&quot;BXA&quot;), estimates that the reporting requirements may apply to thousands of commercial chemical facilities.  In addition, the facilities that produce and in some cases process or consume specified quantities of CWC related chemicals willbe subject to routine on-site inspection conducted by international inspectors.  CWC also provides for &quot;challenge&quot; on-site inspections, which may be conducted at any public or private location at the request of another country when there is legitimate concern about activities.<P>

	The CWC includes provisions to protect the confidential business information of companies that are subject to the reporting and inspection requirements.  These provisions were developed in consultation with chemical trade associations from the U.S., Europe and Japan.<P>

	The CWC requires that upon its entry into force each country that ratifies the convention adopt the necessary measures to implement its obligations.  The BXA announced December 23, 1994, that it will begin drafting regulations to implement the CWC.  59 Fed. Reg. 66291 (1994)  If you would like a copy of the chemicals on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 or have questions regarding the CWC or its likely impact, please contact us.

<h4 align=center><a name="4">INTEREST GROUPS SUE TO OBTAIN CONFIDENTIAL STATEMENTS OF FORMULA</a></h4>

<P>

	In a case that potentially could impact all pesticide registrants, the Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides (NCAP) and the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides (NCAMP) have brought suit against EPA seeking the release of Confidential Statements of Formula, including the identities and quantities of inert ingredients, for six registered pesticides.  The American Crop Protection Association (ACPA) has intervened in the lawsuit on the side of EPA. <P>

	Federal pesticide law has embodied a policy of confidential treatment for product formulas since the original enactment of FIFRA in 1947, and manufacturers have relied on the assurance of confidentiality in submitting their formulas for registration and reregistration.  Section 10 of FIFRA protects confidentiality of formulas submitted to EPA in connection with pesticide registration and reregistration.  Significantly, section 10(d)(1)(B) protects from disclosure the identities and quantities of inert ingredients utilized in pesticide formulations. 7 U.S.C. e136h(d)(1)(B).  In addition, Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) protects from disclosure pursuant to FOIA, trade secrets and confidential commercial information submitted by regulated entities.  5 U.S.C. e552(b)(4).  EPA has promulgated specific procedures at Title 40, Part 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations, for preserving the confidentiality of proprietary business information pursuant to Exemption 4 of FOIA. <P>

	In April 1991, NCAP and NCAMP sent EPA a formal FOIA request seeking the Confidential Statements of Formula, including the identities and quantities of inert ingredients, for Aatrex 80W (atrazine), Weedone LV4 (2,4-D), Roundup (glyphosate), Velpar (hexazinone), Garlon 3A (triclopyr), and Tordon 101 (picloram and 2,4-D). EPA denied  the FOIA  request on the grounds that the request sought confidential information exempt from disclosure pursuant to Exemption 4 of FOIA.  NCAP and NCAMP filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that EPA's withholding of the Confidential Statements of Formula and EPA's failure to segregate confidential and non-confidential portions of the Confidential Statements violate FOIA, and an injunction ordering release of the requested information.  The requests of NCAP and NCAMP, if granted, could set a precedent subjecting the Confidential Statements of Formula submitted by all pesticide registrants to disclosure through FOIA.<P>

	ACPA  intervened in the suit on the side of EPA to protect the rights of its members, particularly the registrants of the  pesticides at issue.  Much of the  information at issue has been submitted under seal to the Court pursuant to a protective order.  Plaintiffs, ACPA and EPA each have filed motions for summary judgment.<P>

	The summary judgment motions of ACPA and EPA focus primarily on section 10(d) of FIFRA and on the exemptions to FOIA for information protected from disclosure by another statute (Exemption 3) and for trade secrets and confidential commercial information (Exemption 4).  ACPA takes the position that the Confidential Statements of Formula are protected pursuant to section 10 of FIFRA in combination with Exemption 3 of FOIA, which protects from disclosure information specifically exempted by statute.  5 U.S.C. e552(b)(3).  In the alternative, ACPA argues that the Confidential Statements of Formula are protected trade secrets and commercial information under Exemption 4 of FOIA.  ACPA's motion also develops the commercial harm that could arise from indiscriminate disclosure of pesticide formulations.<P>

	In its motion, EPA defends its decision on both procedural and substantive grounds.  EPA points out that the regulations do not require it to incorporate a discussion of the criteria set out at 40 C.F.R. e2.208 in its determination.  EPA also argues that release of full or partial lists of ingredients by some of the registrants of pesticides at issue did not waive confidentiality claims to unreleased information, such as sources and percentages of ingredients in the formulation.  Finally, like ACPA, EPA argues that the withheld information qualifies for protection as both trade secrets and confidential information.<P>

	In their motion, NCAP and NCAMP argue that their FOIA request should be granted because (1) EPA failed to follow its own regulations by not making specific findings with respect to the criteria set forth in its regulations for determining trade secret or confidential commercial information; (2) EPA did not make an independent determination that the information sought was confidential, but rather rubber-stamped the registrants' claims; (3) EPA failed to segregate satisfactorily confidential from non-confidential information, for example, in three cases EPA declined to disclose the identity of the active ingredient even though the registrant must disclose the identity of the active ingredient on its label; and (4) the information sought does not qualify as trade secrets or confidential commercial information because the identities of inert ingredients in particular formulations can be obtained through reverse engineering and are available in public documents such as patents, MSDSs, and published documents.  Plaintiffs also emphasize that, with respect to three of the pesticides, the registrants made available lists of the inert ingredients.<P>

	Significantly, in their summary judgment motion, NCAP and NCAMP appear to back away from their original FOIA request.  Their complaint clearly seeks release of the Confidential Statements of Formula, which would include not only the identities of inert ingredients, but also percentages of ingredients utilized in the formulations and sources of all ingredients, including the actives.  Plaintiffs' motion, however, focuses solely on the identities of the inerts, a distinction which is buried in a footnote.  If in fact NCAP and NCAMP are interested only in the identities of the inert ingredients, the court, if it grants their demand for the Confidential Statements of Formula, could give them much more information than they actually are seeking in the lawsuit and could set a dangerous precedent regarding disclosure of Confidential Statements of Formula.<P>

	The parties are scheduled to submit opposing briefs in the near future.

<a name="5">TREND IN RECENT COURT DECISIONS CONFIRMS THAT FIFRA SECTION 24(b) PREEMPTS COMMON LAW DAMAGES CLAIMS AGAINST PESTICIDE MANUFACTURERS</a><P>

<P>

		A number of well reasoned cases have solidified the trend in the case law holding that FIFRA &#167;24(b) preempts state common law tort claims against pesticides based on inadequate labeling, failure to warn, breach of warranty, and other related causes of action since the Supreme Court's decision in <I>
Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.</I>, 112 S. Ct. 2608 (1992) (plurality).  <I>
Cipollone</I> addressed the preemptive scope of a provision of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 analogous to &#167;24(b) of FIFRA.  <P>

		Section 24(b) of FIFRA precludes states from imposing labeling requirements on registrants, even those <I>
in addition to</I> FIFRA standards:  &quot;[A] State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirement for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under the Act.&quot;  7 U.S.C. &#167;136v(b).  Prior to <I>
Cipollone</I>, the federal Courts of Appeals were divided on whether the language of<B>
 </B>&#167;<B>
</B>24(b) preempted claims for mislabeling and failure-to-warn brought by plaintiffs allegedly harmed by a pesticide registered under FIFRA.  Some courts found that 24(b) did not preempt common law claims, following the line of reasoning in <I>
Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical Co.</I>, 736 F.2d 1529 (D.C. Cir.), <I>
cert</I>. <I>
denied</I>, 469 U.S. 1062 (1984).  The court in <I>
Ferebee</I> held that for purposes of FIFRA preemption, state tort damage actions were distinguishable from state regulation through legislation and administrative regulation.  The Supreme Court in <I>
Cipollone</I>, confronted with language virtually indistinguishable from that of FIFRA &#167;24(b), rejected <I>
Ferebee</I>'s distinction between regulations and tort suits, instead adopting the rationale of numerous other decisions preempting state tort claims on the ground that damage actions have the same effect as legislative regulation.  Either in response to administrative regulation or to avoid tort liability, the registrant must change its label.<P>


		Following the Supreme Court's ruling in <I>
Cipollone</I>, virtually every court to consider the issue has held that claims relating to pesticide labeling or packaging, including particularly claims that the label failed to include certain warnings, are preempted by FIFRA.  The courts have differed, however, on what kinds of claims other than express inadequate labeling claims are also preempted.  Review of these cases is instructive in terms of (a) avoiding, where possible, conduct that may give rise to potential claims that plaintiffs will argue are outside FIFRA preemption; and (b) framing the issues in response to any such claim in away that increases the likelihood that a court will apply the broad effect of <I>
Cipollone</I>'s mandate in a given case.<P>


<B>
Duty-to-Warn Claims</B><P>

<P>

		Recent cases decided by a number of federal and state courts virtually all have held that a variety of claims relating to pesticide labeling are preempted, whether or not specially identified as labeling claims.  Such claims seek to impose state law liability on a registrant for doing exactly what federal law authorizes:  distribution of a federally registered pesticide with warning labels required and approved by EPA.  Such claims, therefore would impose state law duties different from and in addition to the FIFRA labeling requirements, and are therefore preempted by FIFRA.<P>



<B>
Breach Of Warranty Claims and Other Claims Based on Warnings Outside the Label</B><P>



		A number of courts have similarly held that, in addition to labeling claims, breach of warranty claims are preempted.  Clearly, with respect to allegations relating to warranties expressed or implied by the label, these claims are based on, or derived from, FIFRA-approved labeling and therefore are preempted.  <P>



		A leading case taking a broad view of the preemptive effect of FIFRA &#167;24(b) is the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in <I>
Papas v. Upjohn Co.</I>, known as &quot;<I>
Papas II</I>.&quot;  <I>
Papas II</I> involved personal injury claims arising from exposure to a pesticide.  The Eleventh Circuit held that FIFRA &#167;24(b) preempted not only plaintiffs' claims based directly on inadequate label warnings, but also plaintiffs' claims based on negligent testing and disclosure to EPA, inadequate point-of-sale and other non-label warnings, and implied warranty.  <P>



		The court in <I>
Papas II</I> also extended the preemptive effect of FIFRA &#167;24(b) to failure-to-warn claims that go beyond the actual language of the labels and to claims for breach of implied warranty.  The court held that FIFRA &#167;24(b) preempted claims asserting that Upjohn Co. breached a duty to warn by failing to utilize adequate point-of-sale or other non-label warnings.  In addition, the court held that claims based on breach of implied warranties were preempted.  The court reasoned that implied warranties are imposed by state contract law and run afoul of FIFRA &#167;24(b)'s prohibition against state regulation of labeling.<P>



		The year after the Eleventh Circuit decided <I>
Papas II</I>, a Florida state appeals court, in <I>
ISK Biotech Corp. v. Douberly</I>, likewise held that FIFRA &#167;24(b) preempts claims for inadequate labeling and failure to warn outside the label.  In that case, which involved crop damage associated with use of a particular pesticide, plaintiffs argued that ISK Biotech had a duty to disseminate warning information once it became aware that its pesticide damaged watermelon crops and the label was no longer accurate.  The Florida court, citing <I>
Papas II</I>, held that this claim arose from a theory of inadequate labeling and, therefore, was preempted by FIFRA &#167;24(b).<P>

<B>
Claims Related To Testing And Placement In The Stream Of Commerce</B><P>



		Allegations relating to monitoring, testing, inspection and placement in and removal from the stream of commerce also come within the ambit of FIFRA's preemption of pesticide labeling and packaging.  <P>



		FIFRA's labeling regulations are inextricably linked to monitoring, testing, and inspection of pesticides.  Before registering a pesticide under FIFRA, EPA requires submission of substantial test data so that EPA can make its risk-benefit determination.  7 U.S.C. &#167;136a(c)(2).  The regulations set forth in detail the types of data that must be submitted in support of a registration application.  <I>
See</I> <I>
generally</I> 40 C.F.R. Part 158.  By granting a registration under FIFRA, EPA has determined that the product will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects in the environment, including any unreasonable health risks to humans.  7 U.S.C. &#167;36(bb); 40 C.F.R. &#167;52.112(e).  Thus, approval under federal law constitutes a finding, based on EPA's expert review of extensive evidence and testing, that the product bearing the labeling required by EPA does not pose any unreasonable risk.   In <I>
Papas II</I>, plaintiffs attempted to circumvent FIFRA &#167;4(b) by arguing that their claims were not based on the inaccuracy or inadequacy of the EPA-approved label, but on the fact that the manufacturer, Upjohn Co., caused the labeling inadequacy by failing to disclose to EPA information that should have been on the label.  The court responded that it was up to EPA and not a jury to determine whether the labels were incomplete and, if so, what changes were necessary.<P>

<B>
Recent Attempts to Circumvent FIFRA Preemption</B><P>



		Other cases have extended FIFRA preemption to alleged duties to warn not specifically encompassed by the label.  In a few recent decisions, however, lower federal and some state courts have tried to limit the application of <I>
Cipollone</I> in the FIFRA context.<P>



		For example, a California state appeals court recently considered FIFRA &#167;24(b) in connection with California's program to eradicate the medfly.  In that case, <I>
Macias v. State of California</I>, plaintiff sued pesticide manufacturers after he was blinded allegedly due to exposure to aerial spraying of malathion mixed with bait.  The State of California failed to provide the general public with the warnings set forth on malathion's EPA-approved label.  Plaintiff sued the manufacturers of malathion, alleging they had a duty to warn the downstream bystanders once they became aware that the State, the direct user, had failed to do so.  The California Court of Appeals took a narrow view of the preemptive effect of &#167;24(b) and stated:  &quot;'FIFRA does not occupy the whole field of pesticide regulation,' merely 'the entire field of pesticide labeling.'&quot;  The court did not cite <I>
Cipollone</I>, but relied instead on <I>
Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier</I>, in which the Supreme Court held that FIFRA &#167;24(b) does not prohibit government units below the state level from imposing ordinances requiring posted placards to warn about pesticide use .  The California Supreme Court has accepted review of the <I>
Macias</I> case.  <P>

		A couple of other recent decisions also have refused to apply preemption to state tort claims not expressly based on a failure-to-warn theory.  For example, in <I>
Papas II</I>, the Eleventh Circuit drew the line at claims for breach of express warranties.  The court reasoned that express warranties made outside the label are voluntary and governed by state law.  Consequently, the court held, FIFRA &#167;24(b) does not preempt claims for breach of express warranty.<P>


		Similarly, a Florida intermediate appellate court in <I>
ISK Biotech Corp. v. Douberly</I>, held that FIFRA &#167;24(b) preempts claims for inadequate labeling and failure to warn outside the label, and limited that rule by also stating that &#167;24(b) did not preempt plaintiff's claim for a defective product.  The court held that the strict liability claim was based solely on the product's defective condition, and, therefore, was independent from any theory pertaining to inadequate labeling.  While the court did not cite to it, the decision in <I>
ISK Biotech</I> adopted the same rationale as <I>
Kennan v. Dow Chemical Co.</I>, a pre-Cipollone decision from the Middle District of Florida which likewise held that FIFRA &#167;24(b) did not preempt claims based on strict liability for defective design or manufacturing flaw.  <P>



		We believe the logic in the <I>
Macias</I>, <I>
ISK Biotech</I> and <I>
Macrie</I> decisions is fundamentally flawed, based on the language of FIFRA and the explicit findings EPA (and the states) make in granting a registration.  The limitations should be subject to attack in an appropriate follow-on case.<P>



		Like the California court in <I>
Macias</I>, a New Jersey appellate court has held that state courts are not preempted by FIFRA &#167;24(b) from imposing a duty on pesticide manufacturers to warn persons likely to be exposed to pesticides downstream, <I>
i.e.</I>, those persons who would not have access to the label.  In <I>
Macrie v. SDS Biotech Corp.</I>, the court considered claims brought by employees of a produce broker who were injured when they were exposed to a pesticide sprayed directly on produce by a farmer in contravention of the label instructions.  While the court did not hold that a duty existed to warn individuals downstream from the direct user, the court held that the claim was not preempted and could go to the jury.<P>



<CENTER>
*   *   *<P>

</CENTER>		In sum, recent court decisions have clearly established that in most U.S. jurisdictions, state tort law claims based on pesticide labeling are preempted by FIFRA &#167;24(b).  However, recent cases in a few jurisdictions have somewhat narrowed the full preemptive scope of FIFRA &#167;24(b).  In responding to common law claims based on exposure to pesticides, a registrant should work to maximize the preemptive value of its registration by characterizing a case as involving the FIFRA-approved label to the extent practicable, and relying upon all available case law, statutory and regulatory support.<P>

<H3>I.  Basics Of On-Line Commerce</H3>
<blockquote><H4>A.  Using On-Line Service Providers</H4>
<OL><LI>Merchants pay fees and abide by the on-line service provider's rules in exchange for space in the on-line service provider's "electronic mall."  <P>
<LI>Subscribers to the on-line service can browse the mall, view merchant products, and purchase the merchant's goods or services by means of:<P>
<UL><LI>Credit Card<P>
<LI>Electronic Cash<P>
<LI>Charge to subscriber's account with the on-line service (Microsoft Network). </uL><P>
<LI> America On Line:  As an Example<P>
<UL><LI>Benefits to merchants:  AOL has more than several million subscribers.  AOL helps the merchant design publicity, promotions, etc. to reach AOL subscribers.<P>
<LI>Fees:  Merchants pay AOL a store set-up fee, an annual maintenance fee, and a commission on all sales made via AOL.<P>
<LI>Terms and Conditions of Sale:  Merchants must offer AOL subscribers a "100% satisfaction guarantee," agree to on-line product complaint procedures, and provide a discount to first-time shoppers.  The merchant must also abide by AOL condition's, such as a restriction of the merchant's right to sell or reuse AOL customer names.  Merchants must indemnify and hold harmless AOL in a variety of circumstances</UL></OL></blockquote>

<H4>B.  Using the Internet</H4>
<OL><LI>Merchant uses a node on the Internet to create a "World Wide Web" page.<P>
<LI>Users find the Web page using software browsers (e.g., Netscape) that may have commercial features (encryption for credit cards).</OL></blockquote>

<H3>II.  Overview Of Tax Issues</H3>
<blockquote><H4>A.  Sales Via An Internet Web Site</H4>
<P>Will Merchants Be Required to Collect Use Tax?

<H4>B.  Will Service-Providing Companies like CompuServe be Required to Collect the Use Tax for On-Line Purchases?</H4>
<OL><LI>May service providers be required to collect tax?<P>
<LI>May such service providers be deemed agents of the out-of-town merchant, and as such, be required to collect tax?</OL>
<H4>C.  Use Tax Collected On Sale of Information</H4>.
<H4>D.  Tax of Issuers of Electronic Cash.</H4></blockquote>

<H3>III.  Sales Via An Internet Web Site:  Will Merchants Be Required to Collect Use Tax? </H3>

<blockquote><H4>A.  Test for Commerce Clause challenge to state tax</H4>
<OL><LI>Tax does not violate Commerce Clause if it "[1] is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to  the services provided by the State." Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977).<P>
<LI>To meet requirement of "substantial nexus" to impose sales and use tax, the seller must have a physical presence in the taxing jurisdiction greater than just the "slightest presence."  National Geographic Soc'y v. California Board of Equalization, 430 U.S. 551, 556 (1977).  But the physical presence may not be required to be "substantial." Orvis Co v. Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, 64 U.S.L.W. 2012, 1995 WL 354196 (N.Y.  June 14, 1995).</OL>
<H4>B.  The test represents balancing of interests</H4>
<P>"The view that interstate commerce enjoys a free trade immunity from state taxation; and the view that businesses engaged in interstate commerce may be required to pay their own way."  Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252, 259 (1989). 
<H4>C.  What are the 'nexus' boundaries set forth by the Courts so far?</H4>
<OL><LI>"[A] vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the 'substantial nexus' required by the Commerce Clause."  Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 1912 (1992). <P>
<LI>In summary, courts review a number of factors to determine whether a sufficient nexus exists.  See e.g. Quill, 112 S.Ct. at 1907-08; National Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 754; Pledger v. Troll Book Clubs, 871 S.W.2d 389, 390 (Ark. 1994); Geoffrey, Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 437 S.E.2d 13 (S.C.), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 550 (1993); SFA Folio Collections v. Bannon, 585 A.2d 666 (Conn.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1223 (1991); Bloomingdale's By Mail v. Pennsylvania, 567 A.2d 773 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1989), aff'd without op., 591 A.2d 1047, and cert. denied, 504 U.S. 955 (1992); L.L. Bean v. Pennsylvania, 516 A.2d 820 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1986). <P>
<UL><LI>Whether the seller maintains offices or other places of business in the taxing state.  Generally, the continuous presence of an office or other place of business will create sufficient nexus for taxation.  See D.H. Holmes v. McNamara, 486 U.S. 24 (1988)(finding nexus for taxation of out-of-state mail order business of Louisiana Corporation with, among other things, 13 department stores in-state); National Geographic Soc'y, 430 U.S. 551 (finding nexus where company had two in-state offices, even where the operations of those offices was unrelated to the out-of-state mail-order business).<P>
<LI>Whether the seller places sales people or other representatives in the taxing state.  See Quill, 112 S.Ct at 1914. ("the presence in the taxing state of a small sales force, plant or office" of an out-of-state company will likely create a sufficient nexus). <P>
<LI>Whether the seller owns property within the taxing state.  A small amount of property has been held not to create a sufficient nexus for taxation.  Quill, 112 S.Ct. at 1914 & n.8. (company's licensing of small amounts of software to clients in the state).  See also Cally Curtis v. Groppo, 572 A.2d 302, 306 (Conn. 1990) (leasing of films by out-of-state company did not create a sufficient nexus), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 77 (1990).<P>
<LI>Whether the seller maintains a local telephone listing within the taxing state.  (1) Fact that telephone call was initiated or terminated in a state and either charged to a service address in the state or billed or paid for within the state supported nexus for purposes of excise tax on interstate telephone calls.  Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252, 263 (1989).  However, Court doubted that "States through which [a] telephone call's electronic signals pass have a sufficient nexus" and that "the termination of an interstate call [in a state] by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a state to tax a call."  Id.
(2) Use of "800" telephone number held not to create nexus.  SFA Folio Collections, 585 A.2d at 671; L.L. Bean, 516 A.2d at 825.<P>
<LI>Whether the seller advertises in local media; whether the seller prints or publishes catalogs in the taxing state; whether the seller is licensed to do business in the taxing state; whether the seller has a bank account in the taxing state; whether the seller has enlisted the aid of a collection agency in the taxing state.  These factors have not been dispositive, but when they are absent, they usually are cited as support for the fact that no nexus exists.  SFA Folio Collections, 585 A.2d 666; L.L. Bean, 516 A.2d 820.</UL><P>
<LI>Still unclear as to the exact extent of the physical presence required.<P>
<UL><LI>See Orvis Co., 1995 WL 354196 at *1. (holding that use tax may be applied where out-of-state company sends sales agents into the taxing jurisdiction only "sporadically.")  See also Standard Pressed Steel v. Washington Dep't of Revenue, 419 U.S. 560 (1975) (finding nexus where one employee, who worked out of his home, was present in the taxing jurisdiction). </UL></OL>

<H4>D.  Arguments for Taxing Authorities that Merchants of On-Line Sales Can Be Required to Collect Use Tax</H4>
<OL><LI>The Supreme Court's "bright-line, physical- presence requirement" set forth in Quill does not provide a safe harbor for Internet transactions.  <P>
<UL><LI>The bright-line rule originally exempted only the mail and common carriers. <P>
<LI>The rationale given in Quill for maintaining the physical presence rule was partly the long-term reliance of existing mail-order businesses on the existing rule.  But the on-line business is too young to claim long-term reliance on such a rule.<P>
<LI>Another factor considered by the courts to determine state taxation is whether the out-of-state merchant derived benefits from the state.  Internet sales are facilitated by local computer networks and servers, often operated by state university or other government computers, which may be maintained with state money.<P>
<LI>"Cached" Web software is physically present in user's computer memory.<P>
<LI>"Transactional Nexus."</UL></OL>

<H4>E.  Arguments that Merchants of On-Line Sales Will Not Be Required To Collect Use Tax </H4>
<OL><LI>Other than use of common-carrier phone lines, the Internet does not create any physical presence by sellers in the taxing state.  It certainly is less of a physical presence than that created by out-of-state mail-order companies that physically send their materials into the state. <P>  
<LI>The question of whether a merchant receives benefits from a taxing state is associated with the Due Process limits on state taxation, not with Commerce Clause. <P>
<UL><LI>Until the Supreme Court's 1992 decision in Quill, 112 S.Ct. 1904, both Due Process concerns and Commerce Clause concerns precluded state taxation of out-of-state mail-order transactions where the seller did not have sufficient contact with the taxing state.  See National Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 756.  In Quill, the Court found that Due Process concerns no longer stood in the way of such taxation.  112 S.Ct. at 1911.      <P>
<LI>The Due Process rationale for allowing states to tax out-of-state merchants is different from that of the Commerce Clause.  The Due Process rationale is based on whether the merchant derived some benefit from the state, while the Commerce Clause rationale centered on protection of interstate commerce from undue state interference.  Id.</UL></OL></blockquote>

<H3>IV.  Will Service-Providing Companies like CompuServe be Required to Collect the Use Tax for On-Line Purchases?</H3>
<blockquote><H4>A.  May Service Providers be Required to Collect Use Tax?</H4>
<OL><LI>Service providers could be required to collect use tax if they have a sufficient nexus to the taxing state, either by virtue of computer equipment in the state or sales offices and personnel. <P> 
<UL><LI>State courts have used Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252, to uphold the imposition of use taxes on the sale of telephone exchange network access services.  AT & T v. Department of Revenue, 778 P.2d 677, 681 (Colo. 1989); GTE Sprint v. Department of Treasury, 445 N.W.2d 476, 481 (1989).  <P>     
<LI>One case seems particularly on point: The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the imposition of use tax on "automatic data processing and computer services" which included provision of "access to computer equipment for the purpose of processing data or examining or acquiring data stored in or accessible to such computer equipment."  Quotron Sys. v. Limbach, 584 N.E.2d 658, 659 (Ohio 1992).  
Quotron was required to collect the tax from subscribers for fees collected by it for terminal charges, access fee and charges for data.  The court found "a definite link exists" between Quotron and the taxing state; "Quotron owns equipment that it delivers to subscribers in Ohio, constructed two communication concentrators in Ohio, and employs personnel in Ohio to install and maintain equipment."  Id. at 659-60.  Furthermore, the "information travels on telephone lines in Ohio to equipment situated in Ohio to subscribers located in Ohio."  Id. at 660. </UL><P>
<LI>Arguments for State Taxing Authorities that Service Providers Must Collect Tax<P>
<UL><LI>Purchase of merchandise over Internet carries the same nexus as the purchase of telephone services; both initially involve a local telephone call.</UL><P>
<LI>Arguments that Service Providers Do Not Have to Collect Tax<P>
<UL><LI>States have never tried to tax the U.S. Mail or other common carriers for facilitating interstate purchases.<P>
<LI>Upholding service provider's requirement to collect tax on telephone call is not the same as requiring service provider to collect tax on purchase.  The later is one step removed.  Furthermore, Sprint is a telephone "retailer;" maybe closer to a merchant than a service provider. </UL></OL>

<H4>B.  Agency Argument</H4>
<OL><LI>Companies such as CompuServe may be required to collect a use tax on out-of-state purchases if they are deemed agents or representatives of the out-of-state merchants assisting in the solicitation of business.<P>
<UL><LI>Individual employees as agents or representatives:  (1) Can be an independent contractor; if independent, it is important that the person receive a commission.  Scripto, Inc. v Carson, 362 U.S. 207 (1960);  (2)Test in a case involving gross receipts tax was "whether the activities performed in th[e] state on behalf of the taxpayer are significantly associated with the taxpayer's ability to establish and maintain a market in this State for sales." Tyler Pipe Industries v. Washington Dep't of Revenue, 483 U.S. 232, 249-51 (1987).  Unclear whether analysis for gross receipts tax can apply here.  See Geoffrey, 437 S.E.2d 13, 18 (S.C. 1993) (Quill rule limited to sales and use tax); (3) The employee might not have to be positioned full-time in the taxing state.  Orvis, 1995 WL 354196.   <P>
<LI>Other companies as agents or representatives.  Courts will usually not find that corporate affiliation alone creates an agency relationship.  SFA Folio Collections, 585 A.2d 666 (finding insufficient nexus where out-of-state company was part of "larger enterprise of affiliated corporations" including some corporations subject to state tax); L.L. Bean, 516 A.2d 820 (finding insufficient nexus where out-of-state corporation sold returned items and seconds to in-state corporation).<P>
<LI>Finding agency or representative relationship may depend on state law. (1) Court held that two "essential elements for a showing of agency relationship were authorization and control." Pledger, 871 S.W.2d at 392 (finding no agency relationship where teachers acted as go-between between book seller and students; deriving its test from the Restatement (Second) of Agency and 2 Am.Jur. 13, Agency,  2).
The agent must have authority to act for the principal and its acts must be subject to the principal's control.  Pledger, 871 S.W.2d at 392. (2) Court also distinguished factually similar California case on the basis of different state laws regarding agency.  Id. (citing Scholastic Book Clubs v. State Board of Equalization, 207 Cal.App.3d 734 (1989) (holding teachers were agents of an out-of-state book seller)).</UL><P>
<LI>Arguments for State Taxing Authorities<P>
<UL><LI>Under Tyler Pipe Industries test, service providers such as CompuServe may "significantly" assist the out-of-state merchant in maintaining a market in the taxing state.  483 U.S. at 250.  If CompuServe provides potential customers with access to on-line catalogs, it may meet this test.<P>
<LI>CompuServe could have a relationship of "authorization and control" with the out-of-state merchant.  This would depend on the details of the contract.   </UL><P>
<LI>Arguments for Service Providers<P>
<UL><LI>Unclear whether Tyler Pipe Industries analysis can apply here.  That case involved nexus to apply gross receipts tax, while it is possible the Quill case is limited to sales and use tax. See Geoffrey, 437 S.E.2d at 18.<P>
<LI>Depending on terms of the contract and state law, service provider will argue that no agency relationship exists.</UL></OL></blockquote>

<TITLE>INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY TRUST FUND</TITLE>
</HEAD>


<H2 align=center>Information Superhighway Trust Fund</H2>
<CENTER><I>By <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart A. Baker</a></I></CENTER>

<hr>
<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P>
<hr>

		<P>If you spend a lot of time on-line, you've already learned to cope with pornographers, scam artists, and pedophiles.  But the next time you log on, you could encounter a minority that scares even the most hardened denizen of cyberspace.

		<P>Tax collectors.

		<P>State tax collectors, to be precise.  Unlike the federal government, states get a large portion of their total revenue from sales taxes, and they will soon be fighting to collect taxes on every sale that's made in cyberspace.

		<P>Just ask the inhabitants of postalspace.  A few years ago, the Supreme Court confirmed a long-standing ruling:  Mail-order companies don't have to collect a state's sales taxes unless the companies do something more in that state than just take orders by mail or telephone.  Only Congress could do away with this "something more" requirement, the Court declared.

		<P>So the states asked Congress for help against the mail-order industry.  They got nothing.  Other than a modern Washington lesson:  Never get in a lobbying fight with people who send out direct mail for a living.

		<P>Especially not a fight about taxes.  As one state tax official put it to me, "Congress will never vote to raise taxes that it can't spend."

		<P>But the states aren't about to give up.  The "something more" rule costs state and local governments more than $3 billion a year.  It also hurts Main Street stores that sell in physical space -- and that can't afford to compete with mail order companies charging no sales tax.

		<P>So every year the states pass new laws that stretch the definition of "something more."  Every year they launch new audits of catalog companies, trying to catch them doing "something more."  And every year, they doggedly litigate about how to apply the "something more" requirement.  With considerable success.  Indeed, some catalog companies have found that it's easier just to collect the taxes than to keep fighting.

<hr>
 
 		<P><I>How does cybercommerce fit into all this? </I>  Like Bambi on the opening day of hunting season.  Applying the lessons of the mail-order wars, state governments are already gunning for on-line merchants who don't collect state taxes.  Services like CompuServe and Prodigy face state tax audits and litigation.  Next the states will set their sights on companies that use the Internet and World Wide Web.
		<P>In short, merchants planning to sell things on-line can either collect taxes for all fifty states (and thousands of local governments) or put their lawyers and accountants on permanent standby to handle an endless series of audits and tax claims. 
 
		<P>Win or lose, it's hard to imagine anything worse for electronic commerce than years of litigation about what kind of on-line contacts with a state constitute the "something more" that gives that state jurisdiction over the seller.  As soon as the rules have been laboriously worked out for one technology, another will emerge.  The courts may never catch up. Meanwhile, uncertainty will mean fewer new businesses on the Net, and that in turn will mean less revenue to improve the Net's performance.
<hr>

		<P><I>Is there a way out of this fix?</I>  

		<P>Well, maybe.  Surprisingly, there are at least two reasons why on-line sellers might want to accept federal legislation that lets the states tax all on-line sales.  

		<P>First, unlike the mail-order industry, on-line merchants don't have the resources for an endless war with the states.  

		<P>Second, relying on litigation could split the on-line industry.  Services like America On Line or CompuServe have local phone lines and servers in every state. That gives the states a pretty strong "something more" claim against both the commercial services themselves and against everyone who sells through them.  The Internet and World Wide Web, in contrast, have much less in the way of local contacts and corporate identity.  Like the Main Street merchants, commercial services like CompuServe can't afford to get stuck collecting state taxes while their competitors on the Web do not.

		<P>Congress, of course, still may wonder why it should help raise taxes that someone else will spend.  One answer is for the states to earmark the money for something that national leaders of both parties want -- but can't afford.

		<P>Vice President Gore has worried publicly that educational institutions and rural and poor Americans will be left behind -- will become information "have nots" -- when the information infrastructure is built.  And Speaker Gingrich has famously toyed with the idea of giving poor people laptops as a way of democratizing the information age.

		<P><I>Well, suppose the states agree that half the revenue raised from on-line taxes will be spent improving access to the information infrastructure?</I>  Some states might decide to spend the money underwriting Internet accounts for schools and libraries; others might fund fiber optic lines in rural areas.  Let the states set their own priorities; Congress can take credit for the overall policy. 

		<P>Of course, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, and some will suffer as a result of such a bill.  I don't mean the consumers who will pay the taxes -- or the on-line companies that will collect them -- since both of these groups will benefit from the network improvements the taxes fund.

		<P>No, the real losers will be those lovers of the English language who cringe at every new "information superhighway" metaphor.  Because, if the bill does pass, no force on Earth can keep Congress from designating the earmarked state revenues as the "Information Superhighway Trust Fund."

<H3 align=center>Emerging Japanese Encryption Policy</H3>
<P><CENTER><I>By <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart A. Baker</a></I></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.

<hr>


<H4>Summary:  The emerging Japanese consensus on cryptography</H4>

		<P>Japan's encryption policymaking is in its early stages, but there are strong signs that encryption is increasingly seen as a key technology for improving Japan's penetration of the Global Information Infrastructure.  A highly selective (and possibly biased) sampling of informed Japanese opinion on cryptography suggests a growing determination to treat cryptography as a national Japanese economic priority.  

		<P>In the United States and Europe, encryption policy is formed by a mix of interests.  Advocates of business, national security agencies, and more recently the police -- all play a large role in the policy debate.  This policy triumvirate is difficult to see in Japan.  For a variety of reasons, commercial interests are predominant in Japanese government thinking about encryption.  Time after time during my interviews, I was reminded that Japan was an island nation that has not had to defend itself for fifty years and so has not had to confront the national security concerns associated with encryption.  And Japanese police face severe political and constitutional constraints on wiretapping, so the prospect of losing this criminal investigative tool seems not to be as troubling to the Japanese government as to the United States and many European nations.

		<P>That leaves business interests in command of encryption policy inside Japan.  And business interests increasingly see encryption as an enabling technology that is critical for Japanese success in a world suffused with information networks.  Cryptography is seen as a key technology for a variety of network payment problems, from ensuring the identity of each party to the transaction to providing an electronic receipt without creating a risk to the privacy of electronic transactions.

		<P>Just below the surface of Japanese government comments on encryption policy there seems to lie a suspicion that U.S. government concerns about national security and law enforcement are an excuse to perpetuate what is increasingly seen as U.S. domination of a strategic industrial technology.  Some officials insisted that all encryptionsystems can be broken, suggesting that the solution was to fund better police decryption technology.  Others suggested that the solution was to have two levels of encryption -- reserving the most powerful for government and national security while encouraging commercial encryption standards that are less strong.  This approach, however, has proven to be a dead end in the United States, where any cryptographic strength deemed exportable has immediately been condemned as insufficient by business and cryptography experts.

		<P>All in all, the emerging Japanese consensus on cryptography could pose a major challenge to U.S. (and perhaps European) government hopes of striking a compromise between commercial and governmental interests with respect to cryptographic policy.  If Japan puts the weight of its government and industry behind strong, unescrowed encryption, competitive pressure will quickly doom any attempt to influence this technology through export controls and standard-making.  Governments will be forced to choose between overt regulation in the Russian and French manner or laissez-faire policies of the sort that now prevail in the domestic markets of countries like the United States, Great Britain, and Germany.

		<P>Whether Japanese policy will in fact coalesce around a purely commercial approach to cryptography remains to be seen.  In response to the analysis above, one senior MPT official stated that the U.S. and European concerns had not been well understood in Japan until the OECD meeting and that the MPT's study group would be giving special importance to the issue in its review of electronic payment systems.  Thus, it is apparently still possible that Japan will join with the U.S. and European governments in seeking to shape a more accessible encryption standard.

<H4>Details of Japanese Encryption Studies</H4>

		<ol><B><LI><I>The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications</I></B>

		<P>The powerful Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) is hoping to take the lead in driving this area of policy.  (Likely competitors for control of cryptography policy include the Ministry for International Trade and Investment and the Bank of Japan -- also agencies with a predominantly commercial focus).  <P>

			<ul><LI><I>Network study group</I>.  In early 1995, the MPT set up a "Research and Study Group on the Use of Electronic Information and Networks."  The Research Group's report is hardly surprising to students of the Global Information Infrastructure.  It emphasizes the need for privacy protection on networks to encourage use of the infrastructure, and it proposes some concrete measures to protect the safety and reliability of electronic information.  

		<P>The group recommends use of public key encryption for a variety of network-enhancing purposes -- authentication of identity (both for digital signatures and access control), hashing (antiforgery and antitampering), and confirmed receipt of intact messages.  

		<P>To encourage such uses, the group endorses legislation with the vague goal of "promoting" EDI and electronic commerce.  More concretely, the report calls for international measures to combat consumer fraud on international networks.  

		<P>Finally, the report opens what will surely be among the most controversial issues for international negotiations over the Internet, calling for international "rules to govern contents circulating on networks" -- rules that "make it a prerequisite for nations to respect and comprehend each other's social and cultural backgrounds."

		<p>This report is one of three study group reports sponsored by Japan's MPT.  The others also treat cryptography as a central enabling technology for digital commerce.  <P>

			<LI><I>Security technology study group</I>.  A group focused on security technology seems to have been established to encourage concentrated government research aimed at assessing the strength of cryptographic systems and at promoting standardization of cryptographic techniques.  The government recognizes that cryptographic standardization has pros and cons, but its summary is remarkable for what it does not say.  Unlike the U.S. and Europe, Japan shows little concern for criminal misuse of standardized encryption, even though the terror group that gassed Tokyo's subways -- Aum Supreme Truth -- apparently had encrypted some of its computer files.  The downside of standardization from the Japanese point of view is the practical difficulty of agreeing on standards, particularly in the face of export controls on the technology, and (apparently) a sense that standardization will increase vulnerability by allowing wrongdoers to focus their code-breaking efforts on a single technology.

		<P>The only discussion of the U.S. government's favored solution, key escrow, comes in an unusual context -- certification of digital signatures.  For an American, this seems to be mixing two very distinct policy concerns.  It is true that digital signatures almost certainly require some kind of certification authority, i.e., some institution that will verify and stand behind the identities that go with digital signatures.  Key escrow in the context of signature certification seems to imply that certifying authorities will keep copies of each private key as well as each public key used for digital signatures.  

		<P>The policy reasons for considering this option are grounded in the underlying technology.  Public-key encryption may be used for two separate purposes.  A message can be encrypted by anyone using the certified and published key belonging to a particular individual, and it can only be decrypted by that individual.  Conversely, a message encrypted using the private key of that individual may be decrypted by anyone who has access to the published public key.  This method is obviously useless for privacy, but it is an effective digital signature, since the only person who could have encrypted such a message is the holder of the private key.  

		<P>Because the same key pair may be used for encryption as for signature, escrowing signature keys would also allow access to encrypted communications that use the same key pair. The problem with this approach is that it would also add a layer of insecurity to the entire digital signature structure, allowing those with access to the escrow system not just to decrypt but also to forge messages from registered users.  Since there is little law-enforcement reason for being able to conduct such forgeries, adding this layer of insecurity has been rejected in U.S. policy circles.  Instead, the U.S. seems to be moving toward a system in which digital signature standards are divorced from encryption-for-privacy  standards.  Whether the Japanese government intends to achieve authorized access to digitally encrypted messages through the certification authority is not yet known, but as the consequences of holding private signature keys begin to dawn on the private sector, this option seems unlikely to prove attractive.<P>

			<LI><I>Electronic payment study group</I>.  The third study group concerns electronic payment and digital cash.  Its report is due in March 1996.  It too will focus on standardization of cryptographic techniques.  It seems likely that the risks of such technology will be more prominent for this group, which is also charged with examining the tax, foreign exchange and credit creation issues arising from digital cash schemes.</UL><P>

		<B><LI><I>The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)</I>
</B>
		MITI has its own independent -- even competitive -- computer technology initiative.  It funds the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA).  Within the IPA, there is a software technology center headed by Takashi Goto.

		<P>The IPA and MITI, like MPT, have concluded that cryptographic technology is important for Japan's competitiveness as the Internet grows in importance and as electronic commerce increases.  The IPA is spending about $320 million on research and development for the electronic commerce technology, including evaluation methods for cryptography.

		<P>While MITI formally supports discussions of cryptography policy on an international basis, the Clipper Chip was highly unpopular in Japan for a variety of reasons.  There's a strong antipathy to wiretaps among the Japanese people.  Wiretaps are lawful with a warrant, but remain controversial.  Therefore, the Clipper Chip's law enforcement rationale did not resonate in Japan.  The Chip's use of a classified algorithm and the lack of technical controls on police or government access were also seen as significant failings in the system, according to MITI sources.</OL>

<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">By the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
including but not limited to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to take
additional steps with respect to the national emergency described and
declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and
continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996, I, WILLIAM
J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, have decided
that the provisions set forth below shall apply to administration
of the export control system maintained by the Export Administration
Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq. (&quot;the EAR&quot;). Accordingly,
it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Section 1. Treatment of Encryption Products. In
order to provide for appropriate controls on the export and
foreign dissemination of encryption products, export controls of
encryption products that are or would be, on this date,
designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the United
States Munitions List and regulated by the United States
Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22
U.S.C. 2778 et seq. (&quot;the AECA&quot;), but that subsequently
are placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be
subject to the following conditions: </p>

<p align="left">(a) I have determined that the export of
encryption products described in this section could harm national
security and foreign policy interests even where comparable
products are or appear to be available from sources outside the
United States, and that facts and questions concerning the
foreign availability of such encryption products cannot be made
subject to public disclosure or judicial review without revealing
or implicating classified information that could harm United
States national security and foreign policy interests.
Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the Export
Administration Act of 1979 (&quot;the EAA&quot;), 50 U.S.C. App.
2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued in effect
by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and by notices of
August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all other analogous
provisions of the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the
regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not
be applicable with respect to export controls on such encryption
products. Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of Commerce (&quot;Secretary&quot;) may,
in his discretion, consider the foreign availability of
comparable encryption products in determining whether to issue a license
in a particular case or to remove controls on particular
products, but is not required to issue licenses in particular
cases or to remove controls on particular products based on such consideration;</p>

<p align="left">(b) Executive Order 12981, as amended by
Executive Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as
follows:</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(1) A new section 6 is added to read as follows:
&quot;Sec. 6. Encryption Products. In conducting the license review
described in section 1 above, with respect to export controls of
encryption products that are or would be, on November 15, 1996, designated
as defense articles in Category more (OVER) 2</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">XIII of the United States Munitions List and
regulated by the United States Department of State pursuant to
the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that
subsequently are placed on the Commerce Control List in the
Export Administration Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense,
Energy, and Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
shall have the opportunity to review any export license
application submitted to the Department of Commerce. The Department
of Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a
voting member of the Export Administration Review Board described
in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory Committee on
Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this order. The
Department of Justice shall be a full member of the Operating
Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of this order,
and of any other committees and consultation groups reviewing
export controls with respect to such encryption products.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Steptoe & Johnson LLP Karn Decision Summary</TITLE></HEAD>
<h2 align=center>Karn Decision Summary</h2>
<P>A federal district court in Washington, D.C. on March 22, 1996, dismissed a case brought by privacy activist Phil Karn challenging the State Department's refusal to allow him to export cryptography.  Our summary of the <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/karn.htm">decision</a> follows.

<hr>
<P><CENTER><I>No legal analysis is complete without a particularized review of the needs and circumstances of an individual client.  This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson <font size=-2>LLP</font> web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P>
<hr>

<P>In February 1994, Karn applied for a license to export cryptographer Bruce Schneier's book Applied Cryptography. The State Department approved the license, but shortly thereafter denied Karn's request for a license to export a diskette which contained text files of different cryptographic algorithms that were printed in the book.  Karn filed suit, making two main arguments.  First, he argued that the State Department should have treated the diskette as in the public domain and therefore not subject to regulation as a defense article on the U.S. Munitions List, and that its failure to do so was arbitrary and therefore violated the Administrative Procedures Act.  Second, Karn argued that by prohibiting his export of the diskette, the State Department had imposed a prior restraint on his right to free speech in violation of the First and  Amendment to the Constitution.

<P>The court rejected both of Karn's arguments.  The court found that Karn's argument that the State Department should not have regulated the diskette as a defense article was barred by a provision of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. Section 2778(h).  That section provides that the President's "designation" of items as defense articles shall not be subject to judicial review.   The court found it was reasonable to interpret the term "designation" to refer not only to the listing of broad categories of defense articles on the Munitions List, but also to the decision that a particular item is contained within one of the listed categories.  The court reasoned that it was appropriate to interpret the term "designation" broadly in light of Congress' intent in enacting the AECA to give the President discretion to control the export of those items the Executive Branch considers to be defense articles.  Moreover, the court noted an anomaly would result if Karn's position prevailed, in that the Export Administration Act precludes judicial review of the Commerce Department's determination that an item is a dual-use commodity: the court stated that "it would be strange indeed if Congress precluded judicial review of the determination that an item has merely a potential for military use (i.e. subject to the commodity control list), but permitted review of the determination that an item was in fact a defense article (e.g. subject to the munitions list)."  Accordingly, the court found that Karn's challenge to the State Department's regulation of the diskette as a defense article was barred by statute, and the court did not reach the merits of Karn's argument that the diskette was in the public domain and therefore not subject to regulation as a defense article.

<P>With regard to Karn's First Amendment argument, the court first noted that the AECA's bar on judicial review did not apply to Karn's constitutional challenge.  The court then found that under past First Amendment cases, the standard to be applied in reviewing the State Department's action depended on the purpose of the action, namely whether the State Department's action was aimed at regulating the content of Karn's speech ("content-based") or was taken for other reasons ("content-neutral").   The difference is important because content-based regulations are presumptively invalid, while content-neutral regulations are legitimate if certain criteria are met.  The court found that the State Department's decision to bar the export of the diskette was content-neutral, stating that "[t]he defendants are not regulating the export of the diskette because of the comments and or source code, but instead are regulating because of the belief that the combination of encryption source code on machine readable media will make it easier for foreign intelligence sources to encode their communication."  Finally, the court held that the State Department's action met the criteria for content-neutral regulations, finding that the State Department's action was within its constitutional authority, that the government had an important interest in regulating the export of cryptography, and that the restriction was "narrowly tailored" to this government interest.  The court refused to address Karn's argument that the restriction was not "narrowly tailored" in that the regulated encryption was either widely available in other countries or could be broken by the National Security Agency, reasoning that to address Karn's argument on the merits would embroil the court in sensitive foreign policy issues that involved fundamentally political decisions.

<P>Karn and his supporters are likely to appeal the court's decision.  However, until an appeals court considers these issues, the lower court's decision will provide the legal framework under which exporters of encryption must operate.  Given the court's rejection of Karn's arguments, in terms that indicate a broad willingness to defer to Executive decisionmaking in this area, the State Department is likely to rely on this decision as supporting its legal authority to regulate encryption exports as it deems necessary.

<Center><B><FONT SIZE=4>Hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</FONT></B></Center>
<P>
<P>
		On June 25, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing
on computer network security which addressed vulnerability of both government and private sector 
networks.  Senator Sam Nunn was the only senator present at the meeting.  Subcommittee staffers 
Harold Damelin (Chief Counsel, Staff Director) and Daniel Gelber (Chief Counsel, Minority Staff 
Director), also attended the hearing.  The witnesses included John Deutch (Director, CIA), Peter 
Neumann (SRI International), and four representatives from the RAND Corp. (Roger Molander, Robert 
Anderson, Andy Riddile, and Peter Wilson). 
<P>
<P>		The next hearing is scheduled on July 16 to discuss how the executive branch 
intends to respond to cyberspace security threats.  Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick and 
Deputy Secretary of Defense John White will be witnesses for the next hearing.
<P>
<H4><B><U>Likelihood of Cyber-Attacks</U></B></H4>

<P>		Nunn agreed with all witnesses that coordinated attacks on cyberspace are 
inevitable and will threaten national and economic security.  They concurred that the relatively easy 
access to tools and knowledge necessary to conduct cyber-attacks would allow even a small group 
of individuals to pose a serious security threat.  They predicted that both government and private 
computer systems are likely targets of cyber-attacks.
<P>
<H4><B><U>Cyber-Attack Response Center</U></B></H4>

<P>		There was an agreement that securing cyberspace should be a very high 
priority of the U.S. government.  Deutch gave the following list of actions that intelligence organizations 
are currently taking or plan to take:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>improve collection activities that are designed to uncover evidence of foreign intent to attack U.S. computer systems;
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>work closely with the FBI and Department of Justice on computer security issues;
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>forge working relationships with the private sector, including U.S. corporations and academic institutions;
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>devote additional resources to computer security threat analysis;
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>create a new government intelligence center at the National Security Agency to deal with cyberspace security; and,
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>finish a comprehensive report on cyberspace security by December 1, 1996.  
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<P>		Among the above six items mentioned by Deutch, Nunn seemed to be most 
interested in the plan to establish a new government intelligence center.  Deutch testified that the 
center should focus its efforts on developing tools to deal with cyberspace security and on sharing 
such tools with the private sector.  He also said that he hopes to open the center in the next two to 
four years.
<P>
<P>		Additionally, Nunn identified a need for a 24-hour real-time crisis response center 
to help the private sector combat cyber-attacks.  Deutch testified that such a center, if established, 
should be under a direction of the Department of Justice and separate from the center that he plans to 
establish.  Nunn and the other witnesses, however, seemed to support establishing one center to handle 
all cyberspace security issues in order to facilitate closer cooperation among intelligence, law 
enforcement, and the private sector.  Given the unwillingness of private companies to share information 
on cyber-attacks, several witnesses suggested implementing confidentiality procedures for the reporting 
of cyber-attacks.
<P>
<H4><B><U>Government-Funded Public Awareness Campaign</U></B></H4>

<P>		Nunn, Neumann, and the RAND representatives agreed that the private sector has 
failed to secure cyberspace.  Nunn asked all witnesses whether an electronic &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; 
was necessary before the country takes cyberspace security seriously, for which nobody gave a definite 
answer.  
<P>
<P>		Nunn seemed to advocate the increased use of government resources to educate 
the public on cyberspace security threats.  He showed interests in creating an organization like the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a public awareness campaign. 
<P>
<H4><B><U>Private Sector Insurance</U></B></H4>

<P>		Nunn asked Neumann and the RAND representatives whether the insurance 
industry could play a role in increasing cyberspace security.  None of them were aware of insurance 
that covers a third-party liabilities arising out of cyber-attacks.  Nunn suggested that if such insurance 
were available, insurance contracts could require private companies to put more resources into 
computer security.
<P>
<H4><B><U>Protection of Essential Services</U></B></H4>

<P>		Nunn expressed an interest in Anderson's proposed &quot;Minimum Essential 
Information Infrastructure&quot; (MEII) plan, in which minimum essential services are identified and 
are placed under a higher security standard.  The goal of MEII plan is to secure a subset of cyberspace 
so that &quot;essential services&quot; can survive cyber-attacks.  Anderson's definition of 
&quot;essential services&quot; seemed to include private-sector services such as financial, utility, 
and transportation services.  Anderson testified that a further study is necessary to define what 
&quot;essential services&quot; are. 
<P>
<H4><B><U>Encryption Export Controls</U></B></H4>

<P>		Neumann testified that the use of cryptography technology would help increase 
cyberspace security and that the U.S. government should remove the regulation on the export of 
cryptography technology.  Nunn did not comment on this recommendation.
<P>
<H4><B><U>Liability Legislation</U></B></H4>

<P>		There was an exchange between Nunn and the Rand representatives on 
legislation that would limit liabilities of private companies for damages caused by internal security 
tests.  Nunn agreed with the Rand representatives that internal security tests conducted by the Defense 
Information Systems Agency have shown that such tests are useful in identifying security holes.  
The Rand representatives testified that private companies seemed unwilling to conduct internal security 
tests due to fear of potentially large liabilities that might arise out of damages caused by such tests.  
Nunn seemed to agree with the Rand representatives that legislation that limits liabilities could 
encourage private companies to conduct self-attacks on their systems.

<H2>THE WHITE HOUSE</H2>
<P><H4>Office of the Vice President</H4>
<P<H4>>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- FRIDAY, November 15, 1996</H4>
<P><H4>VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY</H4>
<P><H5>President Signs Executive Order Transferring Jurisdiction of Encryption Technology</H5>
<P>
<P>WASHINGTON -- Vice President Gore today (11/15) announced that President Clinton has taken two significant actions to
 implement the encryption export liberalization plan announced in October.
<P>
<P>First, President Clinton has signed an executive order directing the transfer of jurisdiction for the export control of commercial 
encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce Department.  Second, President Clinton has designated 
Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography.
<P>
<P>&quot;We are moving forward to implement the encryption export liberalization plan that I announced in
 October,&quot; said Vice President Gore.  &quot;These two actions will help to promote the growth of international electronic
 commerce and robust secure global communications in a manner that protects the public safety and our national security.&quot;

<P>
<P>On October 1, 1996, Vice President Gore announced an Administration plan to make it easier for Americans to use
 stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable 
information.  The plan comprises a comprehensive set of actions to promote the development of key recovery products and an
 encryption key management infrastructure.  Specifically, it allows the export of 56-bit key length encryption products under a 
general license contingent upon industry commitments to build and market future products that support key recovery.  It also
 called for transferring jurisdiction for controlling the export of commercial encryption technology from the State Department to the
 Commerce Department.
<P>
<P>Key recovery presumes that a trusted party (such as a bank or, in some cases, a party internal to the user's organization) could 
recover a confidentiality key to the encrypted data for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under proper court authority.
<P>
<P>The Executive Order, &quot;Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products,&quot; and a Presidential Memorandum
 on Encryption Export Policy, signed by President Clinton today, directs the transfer of jurisdiction for the export control of
 commercial encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce Department.  The transfer becomes effective
 upon promulgation of regulations by the Commerce Department, expected before the end of the year.
<P>
<P>This action subjects licensing application decisions to strict time lines for governmental response, while providing for
 interagency consultation on those decisions.  Under the executive order, concerned agencies will have the opportunity to
 participate in Commerce Department licensing decisions.  No agency will have a veto over decisions to export encryption
 products.  The computer and communications industries have called for the jurisdiction transfer, and it was recommended 
in the recent report of the National Research Council.
<P>
<P>Vice President Gore also announced today that President Clinton has designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as 
Special Envoy for Cryptography, with the responsibility to promote the growth of international electronic commerce and
 robust, secure global communications in a manner that protects the public safety and national security.
<P>
<P>Ambassador Aaron will carry out his responsibilities as Special Envoy while retaining his position as the United States
 Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris.  As special 
Envoy, Ambassador Aaron will promote international cooperation, coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governments on
 encryption matters and provide a focal point for identifying and resolving bilateral and multilateral encryption issues.
<P>
<P>Ambassador Aaron has served in both government and the private sector.  He has been a member of the boards of
 several major private sector organizations, and served as Deputy National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter. 
 He has been the Permanent Representative at the OECD since 1993.

<TITLE>Steptoe & Johnson LLP/Tax Practice

</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>Steptoe & Johnson  LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Tax Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has one of the largest and most diverse tax practices in the country. 
The practice covers the entire spectrum of federal taxation,
including representation of business and individual clients in
controversy, compliance, transactional, planning and policy
matters, in the context of both international and domestic
interests.  The firm's tax practice encompasses all aspects of
ERISA and estate planning.

<h4><CENTER>Tax Controversy and Litigation</CENTER></h4>

<P>A major component of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's wide-ranging tax
practice is our extensive experience in handling tax
controversies, both at administrative levels and in litigation
before the courts.
<P>We represent clients in controversy matters at all levels within
the Internal Revenue Service.  During the audit phase, we assist
our clients in analyzing and evaluating factual and legal issues
and in making presentations to local IRS officials and to the
IRS National Office in referrals for technical advice.  In
Coordinated Examination and Industry Specialization audits we
deal with IRS attorneys to eliminate issues and to minimize the
need for litigation.  We work closely with our clients during
the administrative stages of a case to develop an optimum record
in the event litigation is necessary.  That work includes the
preparation of administrative settlement agreements, drafting
refund claims, securing reputable and effective expert
witnesses, and respoanding to or contesting IRS information and
document production demands.  We frequently prepare protests of
proposed IRS audit adjustments, and we represent our clients in
conferences with IRS Appeals Officers.

<P>The needs of our clients are such that we continuously have
cases pending in the United States Tax Court, the United States
Court of Federal Claims, and various federal district and
appellate courts on many different substantive and procedural
tax issues.  In some of these cases, we serve also as counsel
for our clients through the administrative process; in others we
are engaged initially as litigation counsel.  The types of
litigation that we have handled cover a wide range of issues and
thus reflect the broad scope of the firm's substantive tax
practice.  As part of our litigation activities, we represent
clients in negotiations before the IRS and the Tax Division of
the Department of Justice with the objective of obtaining
favorable settlement of pending litigation matters.

<P>The firm's tax controversy and litigation practice also includes
the representation of individuals and corporations who are
alleged to have engaged in conduct exposing them to criminal
sanctions.  These representations involve a variety of factual
circumstances and legal issues, and they include representation
that extends from pre-litigation proceedings, such as jeopardy
assessment review hearings and summons enforcement contests, to
post-trial proceedings, such as the preparation of sentencing
memoranda.

<P>Our attorneys have briefed and argued numerous tax cases before
the Supreme Court of the United States.  In recent terms, we
have handled before that Court such diverse matters as state
insurance premium tax questions, federal statutory limitations
on state taxation, corporate tax issues, and ERISA preemption
matters.  In addition, the firm is often asked to assist other
law firms in drafting petitions for certiorari and in preparing
briefs on the merits, as well as in counselling them with
respect to the unique nature of Supreme Court practice.

<h4><CENTER>Transactional Tax Practice</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's transactional tax practice involves the
representation of both publicly-traded and closely-held
corporations and partnerships with respect to all aspects of tax
and business planning.

<P>We plan and negotiate all types of acquisitions, restructurings,
and dispositions, both taxable and tax free, foreign and
domestic.  These transactions include acquisitions, stock
purchases, LBOs, spin-offs and joint venture arrangements.  We
advise with respect to choice of entity issues and have
significant expertise in using partnerships and S corporations
to structure major business acquisitions.  Our work often
involves the issuance of opinion letters and discussions with
Congressional, Treasury, and IRS personnel, and we regularly
obtain IRS private letter rulings.

<P>We are involved in the formation and structuring of venture
capital companies, including the development of hybrid debt and
equity instruments.

<P>Our firm has developed significant expertise in the area of debt
restructurings and workouts, both within and outside of
bankruptcy.  In this context, we analyze tax issues relating to
net operating losses, cancellation of indebtedness income, and
original issue discount.

<P>We advise affiliated groups of corporations with respect to
consolidated return issues, often negotiating and drafting tax
sharing agreements in the context of acquisition transactions. 
In addition, through our work with closely-held affiliated groups, we encounter with great frequency the at risk rules,
passive loss rules and interest limitation provisions,
particularly as they apply in a consolidated return setting.

<P>As a corollary to our transactional planning, we render general
business tax advice on a continuing basis to a variety of
companies.  We provide these clients with advice concerning such
matters as tax accounting, depreciation and other forms of
capital cost recovery, and the corporate alternative minimum tax.

<h4><CENTER>Real Estate and Partnership Matters</CENTER></h4>

<P>Our tax group provides tax advice in connection with the
planning, negotiation and documentation of real estate
transactions involving billions of dollars of property each
year.  Our clients include commercial, residential and shopping
center developers, homebuilders, institutional investors, hotel operators,
property managers, and others.  We represent large organizations
that operate nationally and internationally as well as
individual entrepreneurs who operate regionally and locally. 

<P>Our representations span the entire life cycle of a real estate
project and include raising equity funds through joint ventures
and public and private securities offerings; structuring debt
financing from institutional lenders and domestic and foreign
debt placements; planning site acquisition and development of
the project; planning and execution of leasing, operation and
refinancing of the project; and counseling in connection with
disposition of the project in taxable or nontaxable transactions.

<P>The recent depression in the real estate markets has given rise
to a spate of loan work-outs and restructurings.  We have
assisted many clients in handling these transactions in a manner
that minimizes the adverse tax consequences usually associated
with them.  We have also assisted clients in accessing the
evolving capital markets through innovative securitization
transactions, including the formation of real estate investment
trusts (REITs) and "umbrella partnership" real estate investment
trusts (UPREITs).

<P>While real estate has historically been owned through
partnerships, much of the rest of the business world has only
recently discovered the partnership form.  Major tax law changes
enacted in 1986 have enhanced the partnership as a favored
choice of business entity, and we have been in the forefront in
planning under the new regime.  We have been heavily involved in
developing the use of partnerships as acquisition vehicles and
in leveraged buyouts.  We have also been active in the evolving use of partnerships to effect tax-free
disposition of assets.  We have planned and executed "frozen"
partnerships and used other tax-free disincorporation techniques
to reduce corporate taxes.  Our clients include publicly-traded
and closely-held operating businesses, as well as organizations
that are active players in the merger, acquisition and leveraged
buyout arena.

<h4><CENTER>International Taxation</CENTER></h4>

<P>Much of the firm's tax advice is provided in the cross-border
context.  Specifically, Steptoe & Johnson LLP represents foreign and
domestic clients in connection with the acquisition and
disposition of businesses located in the United States and
abroad.  In this regard, the firm has provided a full range of
legal services including structuring transactions, negotiating
and drafting contract terms, and advising clients of the tax
legislative and regulatory climate that may affect their
transactions.

<P>The firm also has provided clients, both individuals and
corporations, with tax advice concerning the most advantageous
ways to structure investments and international business
operations, including establishing Foreign Sales Corporations,
deferring current taxation of income, and maximizing the
availability of foreign tax credits.  We have particular
expertise advising clients with respect to the detailed rules
restricting the ability of U.S. persons to defer income through
the use of offshore corporations.

<P>We have been instrumental in the development of joint venture
arrangements throughout Europe, Latin America, Asia, Russia,
Kazakstan, Ukraine and other former Soviet Republics, and we
have helped to structure license agreements and technology
transfer arrangements designed to minimize U.S. and foreign tax
burdens.
<P>In addition to representing clients in connection with the
planning of international transactions and the structuring of
operations carried out around the globe, our lawyers have
advised foreign and domestic clients regarding the audit of
their returns by international examination agents of the IRS and
by foreign tax collection agencies.  We have also participated
in Competent Authority matters, generally relating to transfer
pricing, involving government-to-government negotiation of
issues relating to the tax returns of specific taxpayers.  In
addition, we advise clients regarding the required disclosure of
treaty-based return positions and the filing of the special
returns for foreign-owned businesses operating in the United
States.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP is experienced in the transfer pricing area. 
We advise clients with respect to transfer pricing methodologies (working
both with economists and independently), document those
methodologies to help clients avoid penalties and represent
clients in the IRS Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") program.

<P>We are one of the few American law firms with an affiliate in
Moscow.  Steptoe & Johnson International serves our clients in
Russia, other former Soviet Republics, and Eastern Europe in all
aspects of doing business in and with those countries.
<h4>
<CENTER>ERISA</CENTER></h4>

<P>Our firm's ERISA practice covers the full range of tax, labor
and legislative issues.  We represent plans, plan sponsors,
actuaries and other plan consultants, banks, insurers,
investment entities and trade associations that focus on ERISA
issues.  These representations give us a very broad range of
experience and expertise in issues that relate to employee
benefit plans.

<P>In the course of our practice we represent clients before the
Department of Labor on requests for advisory opinions and
information letters as well as on prohibited transaction
exemption requests.  We have an active fiduciary litigation
practice specializing in preemption issues and damage questions.

<P>Our ERISA practice extends to transactional matters, and we
provide relevant advice in mergers and acquisitions, including
issues relating to funded plans and unfunded retiree health
costs.

<P>In the tax ERISA area we provide advice concerning taxation of
benefits, deduction of contributions, and qualification of
plans.  We represent clients before the IRS and the Tax Court
when adverse rulings are threatened or issued.  We actively
represent clients at all administrative levels before the IRS
and the Treasury Department with respect to new or evolving
matters of law to help shape policy.  In addition, we have been
extensively involved in crafting new products or approaches in
welfare benefit areas and with respect to ESOPs.  We also have
assisted clients in developing sophisticated and novel
nonqualified deferred compensation programs.

<P>Our plan termination and multi-employer withdrawal liability
practice takes clients through the termination or withdrawal
process and seeks to minimize liability on account of such
events.  We have obtained favorable rulings and settlements in
all areas under ERISA Title IV.  In addition, we have advised
clients on the relationship between the bankruptcy laws and
ERISA, taking an active role in troubled company work-out
situations.

<P>Finally, our ERISA attorneys have extensive experience in
legislative lobbying and in keeping our clients abreast of
legislative issues and initiatives in the ERISA field.

<h4><CENTER>Insurance Tax</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has one of the preeminent insurance tax
practices in the country.  It covers both company and product
tax issues, and involves tax controversy and tax planning, as
well as legislative and administrative lobbying.  Our attorneys
have extensive experience with prior and current law, and are
directly involved in ongoing developments affecting taxation of
the industry.

<P>In the controversy area, we represent clients at all
administrative levels within the IRS.  We assist companies in
responding to audit inquiries and proposed adjustments and in
presenting Technical Advice requests to the IRS National Office.

<P>In addition, we work with clients to prepare protests, to
effectuate settlements, and to file claims for refund.  We often
litigate cases for our clients, appearing before the United
States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims, and
other courts.  We have successfully represented insurance
company clients in several cases before the Supreme Court.  Two
of those matters, in which we successfully represented industry
groups, raised constitutional issues relating to state premium
taxes.

<P>In the tax planning area, we work with clients to devise and
implement tax strategy, to obtain private letter rulings, and to
develop return positions.  We provide advice on the structure of
transactions, including stock and asset acquisitions and
dispositions, and with respect to the application of the
consolidated return regulations.  Also, we often assist clients
with product tax matters, including questions concerning the
definition of life insurance.

<P>Our attorneys were extensively involved in the legislative
processes resulting in TEFRA and the 1984 Tax Act and are
continuously involved in legislative developments affecting the
industry.  Additionally, we often represent insurance interests
before the IRS and the Treasury Department regarding coordinated
issues, proposed regulations, and other matters of general
importance to the industry.

<h4><CENTER>Tax Exempt Organizations</CENTER></h4>

<P>We have a team of lawyers who specialize in all aspects of the
representation of tax-exempt organizations.  The firm's clients
include professional and trade associations, educational
institutions, health care organizations, private foundations,
lobbying and other advocacy groups, political organizations,
religious organizations, veterans' and other membership groups,
medical research organizations, and a wide variety of other
charitable, educational, scientific, religious, and social
welfare organizations.  In addition, we advise business entities
that participate in commercial ventures with tax-exempt
organizations.

<P>Our tax-exempt organizations practice provides a full range of
services for nonprofit organizations.  We assist our clients in
establishing and maintaining exempt organizations, including
advice as to the formation of the organization and its
qualification for tax-exempt status under IRS procedures, and,
where applicable, state requirements.  Once an organization has
been created and qualified, we provide ongoing counseling on a
broad spectrum of tax issues, including: qualification for
public charity status; unrelated business income; reporting
obligations; eligibility to conduct legislative or political
campaign activities; use of for-profit subsidiaries;
participation in partnerships and joint ventures; and
maintenance of charitable giving, including planned giving
programs.

<P>Our attorneys work closely with our charitable organization
clients in the development and operation of fund- raising
programs.  We provide advice relating to the contributions,
record keeping, and reporting in the context of capital
campaigns, special events, direct mail solicitations, and planned
giving.  In the case of planned giving, the firm provides advice
and prepares the documents for major gifts or bargain sales of
appreciated property, and the use of charitable remainder
trusts, pooled income funds, charitable gift annuities, and life
insurance for charitable giving. 

<P>As part of our tax-exempt organizations practice, we advise our
clients with respect to federal and state fund raising
regulation requirements, including the constitutionality of
these laws.  We monitor developments in this area of the law,
and assist our clients in registering and reporting under these
laws.

<P>Our tax-exempt organizations practice includes the handling of
complex audits, litigation, and criminal investigations.  We
also provide advice and counsel concerning many other areas of
the law as they relate to tax-exempt organizations, including
leases, employment contracts, intellectual property matters,
antitrust issues, labor law questions, and matters pertaining to
employee benefits and executive compensation planning.

<h4><CENTER>Information Reporting and Employment Tax Matters</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP actively represents major institutions in the
financial services industry with regard to extensive tax
information reporting obligations.  Our work includes ongoing
advice regarding federal and state tax information reporting
obligations for interest, dividends, and other taxable payments
to various domestic and foreign payees.  We also assist clients
in complying with information reporting for ERISA plans, tax
shelters, and exempt organizations, and deal with IRS personnel
at the national, regional, and local levels in devising
practical solutions to frequent technical problems that arise in
the context of the reporting requirements.  In addition, we
represent clients before the IRS in seeking the abatement of
civil penalties that have been imposed for alleged failures to
comply with various information reporting requirements.

<P>We provide legal advice on employment tax issues.  We represent
employer coalitions before the IRS with regard to the employee/
independent contractor status of large classes of workers, and
we represent classes of taxpayer-employees in test cases
involving both foreign employment and domestic employment.  Our
attorneys are very familiar with issues faced by large
corporations, issues that are receiving increased administrative
attention in the current enforcement environment.

<h4><CENTER>Trusts and Estates</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has an extensive and diverse estate planning
practice.  Our practice includes the preparation of complex
wills and trusts and the effective planning and implementation
of important tax strategies, including charitable giving
strategies.

<P>Our estate planning and administration practice provides
services for estates of all sizes and is national in scope.  One
of the practice's most notable features is the breadth and depth
of its tax expertise.  Whether our client's concern is with
planning to preserve business interests, the "freezing" of
estate values, international tax issues, gifts to family or
charity, or simply to accommodate changes in the tax law, we are
able to bring to bear an array of experience and resources.  We
are particularly well experienced at the interplay of estate
planning and other legal concerns, including the protection of
family interests when a threat of bankruptcy arises or the most
effective use of transactional mechanisms to achieve estate
planning objectives.

<P>In addition, our attorneys administer many estates, trusts and
private foundations, and we are well equipped to address all
related tax matters.  By utilizing experienced tax accountants
and paralegals whenever feasible and appropriate, we are able to provide these services on a very cost effective
basis.

<P>Our lawyers are also experienced in dispute resolution relating
to trusts and estates.  We represent affected trusts and
estates, their fiduciaries, and all classes of beneficiaries in
connection with disputes over the validity and interpretation of
wills and trusts. 

<h4><CENTER>Tax Policy</CENTER></h4>

<P>We represent our clients in presenting their points of view on
tax policy matters pending before the Congress, the Treasury
Department, and the IRS.  In this practice, we maintain regular
contact with Congressional tax staff, Treasury and IRS
officials.  We counsel various industry groups and individuals
in obtaining technical revisions to, and clarifications of,
pending legislation.  We assist our tax clients in developing
their legislative objectives and strategies.  Similarly, once
legislation has been enacted, we represent our clients before
Treasury and the IRS with respect to the issuance of regulations
under the new law.  Our regular contacts with tax policy
officials enable us to respond quickly in providing information
to our clients and in presenting our clients' concerns to those
officials.

<h4><CENTER>Ethical and Practice Standards</CENTER></h4>

<P>One of our more unique areas of practice centers on the
standards of conduct for tax professionals.  This practice has
two principal dimensions.

<P>First, we represent tax professionals who have been charged with
misconduct by federal or state officials who exercise regulatory
jurisdiction over such professionals.  In this connection, our
clients include professional firms, large and small.  Typically,
these clients are alleged to have violated the ethical standards
of the American Bar Association, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, or similar organizations, as
adopted by the licensing authority of the particular practice
jurisdiction.  Our representation of professionals and
professional organizations also includes advice respecting
conflicts of interest and the effect of prior government service
on private practice in related areas.

<P>The second dimension of this practice involves alleged
malpractice by tax professionals.  In this connection, we
represent either the aggrieved client or the allegedly negligent
tax professional.  For this kind of case, we are frequently
retained by professional liability insurers to represent insured tax professionals who have been
charged with malpractice.

<P>The law regarding the ethical responsibilities of tax
professionals has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and
changes in these professional standards have influenced the
development of the law of malpractice in the tax field.  In
addition, we have recently witnessed the phenomenon of a large
number of tax shelter investments that have failed to achieve
their advertised tax or investment objectives.  These failed tax
shelters have spawned extensive litigation focused on the
professional responsibility and liability of the professionals
who were involved in their promotion and sale.

<P>The authoritative text on the subject of ethical standards in
tax practice was co-authored by a Steptoe & Johnson LLP partner, and
we have been closely identified with the development of the law
in this area.

<h4><CENTER>Professional Standing</CENTER></h4>

<P>Our firm is internationally recognized as having a premier tax
practice.  This recognition stems from the quality of our
clients, from the breadth and significance of tax issues that
they entrust to us, and from the quality and experience of our
tax attorneys.

<P>We encourage our tax attorneys to undertake professional
development activities, to contribute to the development of the
tax law, and to serve as leaders of the tax bar.  These lawyers
speak regularly and frequently on important tax subjects, they
teach in formal and informal educational institutions and
institutes, they author respected texts and articles on tax
subjects, they participate in leadership roles in the major tax
professional organizations, and they are widely respected in
their fields of tax law.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's tax group includes a number of attorneys who
have had government experience.

</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Financial Services Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a diverse financial services practice designed to meet the needs of
our domestic and international institutional and individual
clients in the evolving financial services marketplace.  We
represent commercial banks, thrift institutions, credit unions,
holding companies, their officers and directors, and
individuals controlling, affiliated with or conducting
transactions with such financial institutions.  We have
represented Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and
Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in a wide range of matters
pertaining to failed and failing financial institutions and to
their portfolios of loans and real estate. 

<P>The matters we handle for these clients are as varied as the
clients themselves and fall into several types of matters:
formation, acquisition and changes in control of financial
institutions; regulatory and enforcement matters; commercial
financing and workout matters; litigation; legislative matters;
and specialized representations in the financial services area.

<h4><CENTER>Formations, Acquisitions and Changes In Control</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has advised domestic and international clients
regarding the organization of new financial institutions and
holding companies, assisted with charter applications and
advised clients regarding changes in control of financial
institutions and regarding mergers and acquisitions of healthy
as well as failing or failed financial institutions.  In
addition, we have advised national and regional securities firms
and other financial institution clients regarding trust company
powers, the trust company chartering process in various
jurisdictions and related issues.  This transactional work has
encompassed drafting basic documentation for such transactions,
preparing regulatory submissions and providing tax analyses and
opinions regarding such transactions.  

<h4><CENTER>Regulatory and Enforcement Matters</CENTER></h4>

<H4><CENTER>Regulatory Matters</CENTER></H4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP represents financial
organizations before federal and state regulatory agencies
regarding a variety of matters that arise under governing
supervisory requirements.  Such representations involve both
matters requiring regulatory approvals and those limited to
interpretive issues.

company clients regarding a wide range of interpretive and
operational issues such as: 
<ul><LI>federal limitations on affiliate transactions such as the

<LI>the responsibilities and potential liabilities of officers and
directors.</ul>


<P>In addition, the firm has advised clients considering expansion
of their products and services and assisted them in seeking
approval to offer such new products and services.  Our
representations in this area have included: 
<ul><LI>representing a financial institution in the formation and
operation of several financial institution mutual funds;<P>
<LI>representing a client regarding the establishment of a
multiple-partner electronic funds transfer system, a
representation that required obtaining the approval of four

<LI>advising a client regarding the development of an automatic
payment system; <P>
<LI>advising a bank holding company client in connection with its
application to offer data processing services through a new
subsidiary; <P>
<LI>counselling another client concerning the establishment of a
travel services program to be  offered through national and
state banks; and <P>
<LI>assisting a savings institution client in obtaining
regulatory approval to implement a pension advisory and
administrative service.</ul>

<P>These regulatory representations often have involved working
with both local or regional offices of various state and federal
regulatory agencies and with agency headquarters in Washington. 

<H4><CENTER>Enforcement Matters</CENTER> </H4>
Steptoe & Johnson LLP has represented and advised both depository institutions and individuals associated
with them as officers, directors or controlling persons in a
variety of supervisory and enforcement matters.  These matters
have ranged from informal enforcement proceedings, to more
formal written agreements and memoranda of understanding, to
cease and desist actions initiated by federal and state
agencies.  The firm has successfully represented clients in
connection with the early termination of formal enforcement
actions.  In handling these enforcement matters we have
represented clients before each of the federal bank and thrift
institution regulatory agencies.

<h4><CENTER>Commercial Financing and Workout Matters</CENTER></h4>
<H4><CENTER>Commercial Financing Transactions</CENTER></H4>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's
transactional practice in the financial institutions area
includes representations of domestic and foreign lenders and
borrowers in connection with a broad range of sophisticated
financial transactions.  Our work in this area has involved
structured financings, sales of loan portfolios and
securitization of assets as well as traditional commercial and
real estate-related lending including project financing,
equipment financing, international financing, nonstandard
collateral financing, agricultural financing, construction
financing, real estate financing and leveraged sale-leaseback
transactions.   

<P>For example, the firm has:
<ul><LI>structured the refinancing by rural electric utilities of $1.7
billion in long-term, fixed-rate Federal Financing Bank loans

which involved our establishing special-purpose grantor trusts

beneficial interest suitable for sale to public investors;<P>

development in the District of Columbia.</ul>

<H4><CENTER>Creditor/Debtor Relations; Workout Matters</CENTER></H4>
<P>We have substantial
experience and expertise in creditor/debtor relations, in
reorganizations and workouts, especially those involving debtors
engaged in the development of real estate, and in bankruptcy
litigation.  Our practice in this area has encompassed the
entire gamut of functions within and outside of proceedings,
including our representation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation in the largest bankruptcy filed in l985 and in the massive LTV bankruptcy.  



<P>The firm's attorneys are often involved in the capstone of
bankruptcy negotiation -- the reorganization plan -- including
some extremely complex plans in major reorganizations, and
Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have broad experience in rendering
advice and in structuring transactions in the course of
bankruptcy proceedings.  In addition, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has
represented some of the nation's largest lenders, and FDIC and
RTC, in pursuing the borrowers and guarantors of billions of
dollars in connection with troubled real estate projects.  



<P>Such representations within and outside proceedings include, for
example, matters in which the firm:

<LI>represented the principal creditor in the negotiation of a
$3.5 billion settlement agreement for our client in the LTV

partnerships and obtained significant concessions for its client
and similarly situated claimants in the plan of reorganization. </ul>

<h4><CENTER>Litigation Practice</CENTER></h4>

<P>We have represented clients in a wide variety of litigation
involving financial institutions, their officers, directors,
shareholders and those doing business with them.  For example,
we have: 

<ul><LI>represented lenders in defense of a variety of lender
liability claims and counterclaims, including a case involving
defense of a lawsuit in which investors in a project as to which
a financial institution was the construction lender sued the
promoter and financial institution for securities fraud, common
law fraud, RICO and similar claims when the project failed;<P>
<LI>represented a bank holding company in emergency litigation
against the District of Columbia to prevent it from blocking the
merger between the holding company's commercial bank and a
District of Columbia bank;<P>
<LI>represented plaintiffs in a $10,000,000 state law fraud action
against a state bank, a case involving litigation in the federal
and bankruptcy courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the
District of Columbia;<P>
<LI>represented a financial institution in the defense of a class
action alleging securities fraud in the context of the financial
institution holding company's acquisition of another holding
company;    <P>
<LI>represented a variety of lenders in collection actions in
federal and state courts; and<P>
<LI>represented financial institution clients in matters involving allegations of bank fraud and allegations of violations of the False Claims Act and similar legal theories.</ul>



<P>And, as described below, our financial services representations
have included extensive litigation experience on behalf of FDIC
and RTC, both pursuing its claims against those involved with
financial institutions and defending it as receiver in
litigation brought against it by creditors of failed financial
institutions and others.  A number of these cases have involved
novel and complex issues of first impression. 

<h4><CENTER>Legislative Matters</CENTER></h4>

<P>As participants in a regulated industry, Steptoe & Johnson LLP's
financial institution clients must remain alert to relevant
actions taken by the U.S. Congress and the federal regulatory
agencies.  Congress has been active in recent years enacting
legislation affecting the structure and financial stability of
the financial system, and we have been actively involved in
representing financial institutions and other interested parties
in connection with such legislation.   

<P>The firm has assisted clients in preparing written statements
for testimony before congressional committees and has drafted
statutory language with supporting explanations in connection
with the representation of such clients. We have advised
clients, for example, regarding the effects of legislation on: 
<ul><LI>bank securities and insurance activities; <P>
<LI>community reinvestment and related obligations; <P>
<LI>the status of limited purpose trust companies under the Bank
Holding Company Act; <P>
<LI>the use of specific intangible assets under statutory capital
standards; <P>
<LI>deposit insurance premium assessments;<P>

<LI>tax attributes of financial institutions; <P>
<LI>international regulatory standards; and<P>

<LI>statutory provisions governing government loan programs.  </ul>

<P>In addition to such specific representations, we routinely
monitor congressional and federal agency activities in the
financial services area for a number of clients, helping keep
them abreast of legislative issues and initiatives in the
financial services area and advising them about actions that may
affect their operations. 

<h4><CENTER>Specialized Representations in the Financial Services Area</CENTER></h4>

<H4><CENTER>Representation of FDIC and RTC</CENTER></H4>

<P>In recent years we have
represented Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution
Trust Corporation in a broad spectrum of legal work.  Among
other matters, we have advised FDIC and RTC as receiver of
various failed institutions on a variety of issues such as the
exercise of their powers as receiver and their administration of
the claims process.  We have advised them regarding such
specialized issues as their disposition of stock and
stock-secured assets in the portfolios of failed institutions,
theirdisposition of a failed institution's portfolio of
so-called Qualified Financial Contracts, their collection on
assets involving debtors in bankruptcy proceedings and various
industrial revenue bond matters.  

<P>We have represented RTC in a wide range of corporate,
contracting, transactional and other matters.  For example, we
have: 
<ul><LI>advised and represented RTC with respect to its asset
management arrangements with SAMDA contractors;<P>
<LI>advised RTC regarding its policies and procedures in the
procurement of other third-party services; <P>
<LI>represented RTC with respect to contractor suspension and
debarment issues;  <P>
<LI>represented RTC, and prepared its December 1990 Report to
Congress, regarding the so-called Southwest Plan 1988
FSLIC-Assisted Transactions; and<P>
<LI>represented FDIC/RTC in negotiations and documentation of
transactions involving their formation of several innovative
private/public sector limited partnerships and the acquisition
by those partnerships of portfolios of loans and REO with
market values of $450 million and $1.28 billion respectively. </ul>

<P>In addition to the foregoing counseling and transactional work
for FDIC and RTC, we have extensive litigation experience on
behalf of FDIC and RTC, both pursuing their claims against
debtors and others involved with financial institutions and
defending them in litigation brought against them in their
capacity as receiver of failed institutions, including lender
liability theory claims.  We represented FDIC as receiver for
The National Bank of Washington in a wide array of litigation,
including the landmark Cafritz litigation which tested for the
first time, and established, FDIC's powers under the "Crime
Control Act of 1990" to freeze a debtor's assets pending the
outcome of litigation on the merits.  

<H4><CENTER>Privatization Activities</CENTER></H4>
<P>The firm has extensive experience in
representing clients in matters involving the privatization of
matters previously performed by government entities.  Among
other privatization matters, we have advised foreign
governments on issues pertaining to modifications of their
banking laws and regulations in the context of privatization
efforts.  For example, the firm has:
<ul><LI>Advised the Government of Kenya, at the request of the World
Bank, on the modifications to its laws which are necessary to
carry out a program of privatization and economic reform.  The
firm's advice took the form of adetailed evaluation of economic
legislation and recommendations for changes.  <P>
<LI>Advised the Government of Tanzania, in conjunction with the
World Bank, on modifications to its banking laws which are
necessary to carry out a program of privatization and economic
reform.</ul>

<P>Other Specialized Financial Services Representations.  Finally,
the firm has handled a wide array of other representations
relating directly or indirectly to financial institutions,
including, for example, matters involving: 
<ul><LI><I>Banking Arrangements in Russia and Eastern Europe</I>:  We have
advised private sector clients regarding banking arrangements
and various other financial issues pertaining to doing business
in Russia and Eastern Europe;<p>
<LI><I>National Treatment Issues</I>:  We have advised the embassy of a
major western nation regarding U.S. laws affecting its financial
institutions engaged in business in the United States and have
advised other financial institution clients on national
treatment issues;<P>
<LI><I>Employment Law Issues</I>:  We have represented financial
institutions in a variety of employment law matters, including,
among others, claims of unlawful discrimination, reductions in
force, compliance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act; and<P>
<LI><I>ERISA</I>:  We have advised financial institutions acting as
fiduciaries, plan advisors and in other capacities in connection
with various benefit plans on the requirements of ERISA.  </ul>

<H4><CENTER>Staffing of Representations in the Financial Services Area</CENTER></H4>
  
<P>The selection of Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys who participate in
our diverse financial services practice depends upon the
requirements of the particular representation.  In addition to
the areas of expertise described above, we draw, as appropriate
in particular representations, on the specialized skills of the
firm's experts in other fields relevant to our financial
services representations, such as securities law, corporate, tax
and white-collar expertise.  <p><blockquote><CENTER><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pgatoc.htm">Practice Areas Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/sjbios.htm">Attorney Bios</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/welcome.htm">Home Page</a></CENTER></body></html>

This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P><hr><CENTER><h3>Defending Against Information Warfare</h3><P><P>by<P><P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm"><I>Stewart Baker</I></A><P></CENTER><P><P>December 2002: As Iraqi troops mass once again on the border with Kuwait, the President mobilizes U.S. forces. <P>But as the crisis grows, civilians find themselves suffering home-front hardships unprecedented in this century. The U.S. power grid fails again and again. Telephone service goes down. Looting spreads beyond the inner city as groceries run short and merchants stop taking checks and credit cards. Railroad networks suffer inexplicable failures, leading to safety measures that cut in half deliveries of food and fuel to a snowbound East Coast. Airports close and flights are cut due to interruptions in air traffic control data.<P>&quot;I haven't seen anything like this since the strategic bombing of Germany in 1944 and 1945,&quot; declares a British military commentator. &quot;The critical nodes of America's civilian infrastructure are being taken down more or less at will.&quot;<P>Protests mount against a distant military intervention. When disruption of natural gas deliveries to the Northeast causes a wave of nursing home deaths, Congress passes a resolution condemning the President's handling of the crisis. Twenty hours later, the President orders the troops home. <P>For the first time in its history, America has suffered more casualties at home than on the front. Worse, the clear superiority of U.S. military forces has been rendered irrelevant.<P>That's the Pentagon's latest nightmare -- one born, ironically, of its own futuristic plans for winning wars by attacking the information and communications systems of our adversaries. Only as those plans were being hatched did it begin to dawn on military planners that the nation most vulnerable to such an attack is, well, us.<P>Five years ago, telephones in the Baltimore-Washington area shut down for hours due to a simple mistake in programming. Switch failures in 1991 also shut down major airports when air traffic controllers could not get the data they needed. If that's what happens when everyone is trying to make the system work, imagine what would happen if a large number of skilled operatives were trying to shut it down. <P>Even the military is vulnerable. In one recent study, government hackers probed thousands of unclassified military systems. They succeeded 88% of the time. Only 4% of their successful attacks were detected. <P>But the attacks in my scenario never touched a government or military computer. The United States could be crippled by attacks aimed entirely at systems in private hands. And private companies can't be expected to protect against state-sponsored information warfare. By and large, it doesn't make economic sense for them to spend more on network defenses than they are likely to lose to everyday hackers and criminals. <P>For the same reason, few in the private sector want government advice, let alone government mandates, designed to raise the level of security on their computer networks.<P>Indeed, it's hard for government and industry to even have a dialogue on this issue. Five minutes into the discussion, industry says that it needs cheap unbreakable encryption to secure its systems, and the government asks how the FBI can catch the crooks who will use encryption to hide their activities. Ten minutes after that, industry is shouting &quot;Big Brother&quot; and the government is sermonizing about the World Trade Center bombing. By the time that fight has wound down, nobody has the energy -- or the mutual trust -- needed to discuss the gritty details of network security. <P>And so we rock along, putting more and more of our infrastructure into cyberspace and hoping our adversaries won't notice or won't exploit those vulnerabilities. Fat chance.<P>So far, the government's response has been heavily dominated by the military. But we won't get far without a consensus -- one that includes industry -- on questions like how we can identify organized attacks on critical civilian systems, how we can provide cost-effective protection against the most obvious attacks, and (as a way to get industry to the table) how to limit the liability of companies that act responsibly in reporting and protecting against attacks. <P>In talks with the telecommunications industry and others, the Clinton Administration is trying to build such a consensus. That's a excellent idea, but as a veteran of the encryption debates, I have one prediction. Nothing will come of the effort unless the Administration announces clearly and unequivocally that whatever institution it creates to address this problem will offer no advice about encryption policy. <P>None. Zip. Zero.<P>A high-level review of computer security that doesn't talk about encryption -- what could be more boring? <P>But the alternative is to sit around waiting for a Pearl Harbor attack on our information infrastructure. And in the end, that'll be a tad more excitement than any of us really wants.<P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><hr><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart Baker</A> has an international and technology law practice in Washington.

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Environmental Law Practice
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Environmental Law Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a broad-based practice in the area of environmental law,
encompassing many sub-specialties in this diverse field.  Our
environmental practice group is widely recognized as a leader
among major private firms.  The principal areas in which our
environmental lawyers practice are outlined below.

<h4><CENTER>Site Remediation and Cost Allocation</CENTER></h4>

<P>Remediation of contaminated sites and facilities raises some of
the most complex and difficult issues for environmental lawyers
and their clients.  Problem areas include responding to
regulators, negotiating enforcement documents, negotiating or
litigating cost allocation and recovery claims, working with
consultants and regulators to develop efficient, cost effective
remediation approaches, and identifying other parties with whom
to share the burden of remediation and negotiating or litigating
an acceptable allocation.  

<P>Steptoe's environmental practice has a long record of successful
work in this challenging field.  We represent parties that are
alleged to have owned, sent waste to, or hauled waste to,
locations that are now contaminated.  Our clients include
industrial, transportation, oil and chemical companies;
municipalities; and real estate owners.  Steptoe attorneys are
experienced in connection with CERCLA (Superfund), RCRA and
analogous state programs in a large number of jurisdictions,
including Arizona, California, Connecticut, the District of
Columbia, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Oregon, Virginia and Washington.  Many of these sites include
private cost allocation actions in addition to site remediation
issues. 

<h4><CENTER>Operating Facility Issues:  RCRA, The Clean Water Act</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe's environmental practice group also provides ongoing
compliance advice to clients in the industrial and
transportation sectors.  We regularly work with clients on
federal and state hazardous waste compliance issues, including
waste classification, and RCRA permit requirements and disposal
requirements.  Steptoe lawyers also provide practical advice on
Clean Water Act permitting and enforcement issues.  We regularly
advise on NPDES and indirect discharge permits, and appear
before water regulatory agencies in several states.  The firm
also has much experience in working on wetlands issues with
federal and state regulatory agencies.  

<h4><CENTER>Toxic Substances Control Act</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe also has an active practice under the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA).  We frequently provide TSCA compliance
advice, and regularly handle administrative enforcement
proceedings before the EPA.  In resolving enforcement matters,
we focus on assisting our clients to come into compliance and
assist in providing the information necessary to ensure that
ongoing compliance takes place.

<h4><CENTER>Medical Waste and Medical Devices</CENTER></h4>

<P>Over the past few years, regulation of medical waste has become
an increasingly important issue to OSHA, FDA and EPA.  Steptoe &
Johnson LLP has been in the forefront of this emerging area of
regulation.  We represent registrants of pesticide
products intended to disinfect or sanitize health care
facilities and medical wastes.  We have advised clients on the
trial federal Medical Waste Tracking Program, as well as medical
waste regulation on the state level.  Currently, we are active
in the regulation of medical waste at the federal level and in
many states have established relationships with local counsel
who regularly provide advice on state and local compliance
issues.

<h4><CENTER>Occupational Safety and Health</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe has an active practice under the Occupational Safety and
Health Act and analogous state programs.  We provide compliance
advice to a number of employers in manufacturing, construction
and service industries.  We also handle a range of enforcement
matters.  Steptoe lawyers recently won a substantial victory in
a trial before an OSHA administrative law judge, and now are
defending that victory before the Occupational Safety and Health
Review Commission.  Our compliance and enforcement practices
cover a wide range of substantive issues, from toxic agent
exposure to lifting standards and the issues raised by OSHA
under the so-called General Duty Clause.

<h4><CENTER>Toxic Tort Defense</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe's toxic tort defense specialists represent chemical
manufacturers and users throughout the nation. This group has
successfully defended many cases, from ones involving chemical
exposures (e.g., mercury, arsenic), to alleged noise-induced
hearing loss.  We have been particularly active in defense of
personal injury and property damage claims allegedly caused by
exposure to pesticides, including successfully establishing
federal preemption of state tort claims under FIFRA.  Our toxic
tort defense practice is nationwide, with recent or current cases
in state and federal courts from Hawaii to New Jersey.

<h4><CENTER>Defense of Environmental Criminal Matters</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a national practice in defense of white
collar criminal matters generally, and environmental crimes in
particular.  Steptoe attorneys include former federal
prosecutors from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the
Department of Justice's Environmental Crimes Section, other
Sections and U.S. Attorney's offices.  Steptoe attorneys defend
both corporate and individual clients against alleged
environmental, health and safety-related criminal matters, at
both the state and federal levels. 

<h4><CENTER>National Environmental Policy Act</CENTER></h4>

<P>The firm has extensive experience in working with NEPA, both in
assisting clients in compliance and in assessing the adequacy of
environmental impact statements.

<h4><CENTER>Natural Resources Law</CENTER></h4>

<P>Both the D.C. and Phoenix offices have experience dealing with
the environmental aspects of legal questions involving mining
(both deep and strip mining), mineral leasing (oil, gas,
geothermal), forestry, grazing, land exchanges (federal, state
and private), water rights, and wildlife law (including
particularly the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal
Protection Act).

<h4><CENTER>Environmental Audits, Acquisitions and Divestitures</CENTER></h4>

<P>The firm arranges and participates in environmental audits for
clients related to property or corporate acquisitions and
divestitures.  We frequently perform the environmental portion
of preacquisition due diligence reviews, and have much
experience drafting transactional documents to clearly define
environmental responsibility.

<h4><CENTER>Energy Projects</CENTER></h4>

<P>The environmental practice group works together with the firm's
energy practice group on the environmental aspects of energy
projects (power plants, pipelines, etc.).

<h4><CENTER>International Environmental Practice</CENTER>
</h4>

<P>Together with lawyers from the firm's international practice
group, including the Moscow office, Steptoe environmental
lawyers frequently advise on and work with both international
environmental law (NAFTA, etc.), and national environmental law
abroad (Europe, the Far East, Latin America).  The practice
group also assists the firm's large international trade practice
on environmental matters involving funding sources like the
World Bank, USAID, and the various U.S. interregional banks.  We
also provide advice to clients on environmental trade questions
arising under the GATT.

<h4><CENTER>Congressional and Administrative Agency Representation</CENTER></h4>

<P>The environmental practice group has long experience in
representing clients on environmental matters before Congress
and administrative agencies, both in the process of assisting in
the developing of legislation and in formulating its regulatory
implementation.  We currently are active on the Superfund and
FIFRA bills pending in Congress, and in the past have been
active on other issues, such as the recent amendments to the
Clean Air Act.

<H2><CENTER>Representation of Institutional Investors in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (&quot;CIS&quot;)</CENTER></H2>
<CENTER><B>Scope of Work<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Since Steptoe &amp; Johnson opened its Moscow affiliate office in 1990, we have been at the forefront of developments in debt and equity financing, and related securities law issues, in Russia and the CIS.  In early 1994, we expanded our CIS operations to Almaty, Kazakstan as well.  The following synopsis focuses on our experience counseling institutional investors on a wide range of investment activities in Russia and the CIS.<P>
<P>
Steptoe &amp; Johnson represents investment funds, investment fund managers, and investment advisors, as well as other venture capital investors.  Our attorneys are well versed in the corporate and tax environments in which institutional investors operate in the CIS and around the world.  We advise our clients regarding appropriate structures and procedures for debt and equity financing in the CIS in a manner that provides them the maximum benefit under Russian (and other nations') currency, securities, tax, and other laws.  Our attorneys have structured and negotiated a broad array of debt and equity financing terms including various forms of debt security (mortgages, stock and asset pledges, cash collateral accounts, etc.) and a variety of stock rights (preferred stock, put and call rights, preemptive rights, antidilution provisions, voting rights and agreements and registration rights) --all standard questions faced by venture capital investors.  All of our work for client investments has involved careful review of CIS securities and corporate laws for applicable restrictions and requirements.<P>

MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT<br>
THE SECRETARY OF STATE<br>
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY<br>
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<br>
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL<br>
THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE<br>

<br>
SUBJECT: Encryption Export Policy<br>
<br>
<br>
Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover,
such products, when used by international criminal organizations, can
threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well as
the safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation of
encryption products accordingly must be controlled to further
U.S. foreign policy objectives, and promote our national
security, including the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens
abroad. Nonetheless, because of the increasingly widespread use
of encryption products for the legitimate protection of the
privacy of data and communications in nonmilitary contexts; because
of the importance to U.S. economic interests of the market for
encryption products; and because, pursuant to the terms set forth
in the Executive order entitled Administration of Export Controls
on Encryption Products (the &quot;new Executive order&quot;) of
November 15, 1996, Commerce Department controls of the export of
such dual-use encryption products can be accomplished without compromising
U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests, I
have determined at this time not to continue to designate such encryption
products as defense articles on the United States Munitions List.</p>

<p>Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, I direct that:</p>

<p>1. Encryption products that presently are or would be
designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions List
and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to the Arms
Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall be transferred to
the Commerce Control List, and regulated by the Department of
Commerce under the authority conferred more in Executive Order
12924 of August 19, 1994 (as continued on August 15, 1995, and
August 14, 1996), Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and
the new Executive order except that encryption products
specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or
modified for military applications (including command, control,
and intelligence applications), shall continue to be designated
as defense articles, shall remain on the United States Munitions
List, and shall continue to be controlled under the Arms Export Control
Act. The transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective
upon the issuance of final regulations (the &quot;Final
Regulations&quot;) implementing the safeguards specified in this
directive and in the new Executive order.</p>

<p>2. The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption
products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be
placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the
Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce shall, to the extent
permitted by law, administer the export of such encryption
products, including encryption software, pursuant to the requirements
of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration Act (50
U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations thereunder, as
continued in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994
(continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996), except as
otherwise indicated in or modified by the new Executive order,
Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive
orders and laws cited therein.</p>

<p>3. The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption
products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be
licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls of
both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration Act (50
U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations thereunder, as
modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of December
5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited therein, are
satisfied. Consistent with section 742.1(f) of the current Export
Administration Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure
that a license for such a product will be issued only if an
application can be and is approved under both section 5 and
section 6. The controls on such products will apply to all
destinations. Except for those products transferred to the
Commerce Control List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations,
exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be
subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof
would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and
national security interests, including the safety of U.S.
citizens. Consideration shall be given to more liberalized
licensing treatment of each such individual product after interagency
review is completed. The Final Regulations shall also effectuate
all other specific objectives and directives set forth in this
directive.</p>

<p>4. Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically
be transformed into object code, and because export of such source
code is controlled because of the code's functional capacity,
rather than because of any &quot;information&quot; such code
might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that encryption
source code shall be treated as an encryption product, and not as technical
data or technology, for export licensing purposes.</p>

<p>5. All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding &quot;de
minimis&quot; domestic content of items shall not apply with
respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1 of
this memorandum. more</p>

<p>6. The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with
section 16(5)(C) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide
that it will constitute an export of encryption source code or
object code software for a person to make such software available
for transfer outside the United States, over radio,
electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications
facilities accessible to persons outside the United States,
including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet
file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the
software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the unauthorized
transfer of such code outside the United States.</p>

<p>7. Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of
State shall continue to have authority to administer the export
of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum
as defense articles designated in Category XIII of the United States
Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.</p>

<p>8. Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the
administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary
of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine whether
adequate controls on encryption products can be maintained under
the provisions of the new statute and advise the Secretary of
Commerce of their conclusions as well as any recommendations for
action. If adequate controls on encryption products cannot be
maintained under a new statute, then such products shall, where
consistent with law, be designated or redesignated as defense
articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1), to be placed on the United
States Munitions List and controlled pursuant to the terms of the
Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations. Any disputes regarding the decision to designate or
redesignate shall be resolved by the President.</p>

TEXT OF A LETTER FROM<br>
THE PRESIDENT TO THE SPEAKER OF<br>
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND<br>
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE</p>

<p align="center">November 15, 1996</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)<br>
<br>
In order to take additional steps with respect to the national
emergency described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August
19, 1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996,
necessitated by the expiration of the Export Administration Act
(EAA) on August 20, 1994, I hereby report to the Congress that
pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (the &quot;Act&quot;), I have today
exercised the authority granted by the Act to issue an Executive
order (a copy of which is attached) to revise the provisions that
apply to the administration of the export control system
maintained by Department of Commerce in the Export Administration
Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq.<br>
<br>
The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer
certain encryption products from the United States Munitions List administered
by the Department of State to the Commerce Control List administered
by the Department of Commerce. When I made that decision I also
decided to amend Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which
sets forth procedures for the interagency review and disposition
of dual-use export license applications, to include the
Department of Justice among the agencies that have the
opportunity to review such applications with respect to
encryption products transferred to Department of Commerce
control.<br>
<br>
Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate
controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption products
transferred to the Department of Commerce. Among other provisions,
I determined that the export of encryption products transferred
to Department of Commerce control could harm national security
and foreign policy interests of the United States even where
comparable products are or appear to be available from foreign
sources. Accordingly, the new order makes clear that any EAA
provision dealing with issuance of licenses or removal of
controls based on foreign availability considerations shall not
apply with respect to export controls on such encryption
products. Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of Commerce retains
the discretion to consider the foreign availability of comparable
encryption products in any particular case.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
<br>
WILLIAM J. CLINTON<br>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Administration Statement on
Commercial Encryption Policy</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><b>July 12, 1996</b></p>

<p>The Clinton Administration is proposing a framework that will
encourage the use of strong encryption in commerce and private
communications while protecting the public safety and national
security. It would be developed by industry and will be available
for both domestic and international use.</p>

<p>The framework will permit U.S. industry to take advantage of
advances in technology pioneered in this country, and to compete
effectively in the rapidly changing international marketplace of communications, computer
networks, and software. Retaining U.S. industry's leadership in
the global information technology market is of longstanding
importance to the Clinton Administration.</p>

<p>The framework will ensure that everyone who communicates or
stores information electronically can protect his or her privacy from
prying eyes and ears as well as against theft of, or tampering
with, their data. The framework is voluntary; any American will
remain free to use any encryption system domestically.</p>

<p>The framework is based on a global key management
infrastructure that supports digital signatures and confidentiality.
Trusted private sector parties will verify digital signatures and
also will hold spare keys to confidential data. Those keys could
be obtained only by persons or entities that have lost the key to their
own encrypted data, or by law enforcement officials acting under
proper authority. It represents a flexible approach to expanding
the use of strong encryption in the private sector.</p>

<p>This framework will encourage commerce both here and abroad.
It is similar to the approach other countries are taking, and will
permit nations to establish an internationally interoperable key management infrastructure
with rules for access appropriate to each country's needs and
consistent with law enforcement agreements. Administration
officials are currently working with other nations to develop the framework
for that infrastructure.</p>

<p>In the expectation of industry action to develop this
framework internationally, and recognizing that this development
will take time, the Administration intends to take action in the
near term to facilitate the transition to the key management
infrastructure.</p>

<p>The measures the Administration is considering include:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. Liberalizing export controls for certain commercial
    encryption products.</p>
    <p>2. Developing, in cooperation with industry, performance
    standards for key recovery systems and products that will be
    eligible for general export licenses, and technical standards
    for products the government will purchase.</p>
    <p>3. Launching several key recovery pilot projects in
    cooperation with industry and involving international participation.</p>
    <p>4. Transferring export control jurisdiction over
    encryption products for commercial use from the Department of
    State to the Department of Commerce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Administration officials continue to discuss the details of
these actions with experts from the communications equipment, computer
hardware and software industries, civil liberties groups and other members
of the public, to ensure that the final proposal balances
industry actions towards the proposed framework, short-term
liberalization initiatives, and public safety concerns.</p>

<p>The Administration does not support the bills pending in
Congress that would decontrol the export of commercial encryption products
because of their serious negative impact on national security and
law enforcement. Immediate export decontrol by the U.S. could
also adversely affect the security interests of our trading
partners and lead them to control imports of U.S. commercial
encryption products. </p>

<p>A Cabinet Committee continues to address the details of this
proposal. The Committee intends to send detailed recommendations
to the President by early September, including any
recommendations for legislation and Executive Orders. The
Committee comprises the Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce
and Treasury; the Attorney General; the Directors of Central
Intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and senior
representatives from the Office of the Vice President, the Office
of Management and Budget, and the National Economic Council.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>US Cryptography Policy:</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Why We Are Taking the Current
Approach</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b>July 12, 1996</b></p>

<p>We live in an age of electronic information. Information
technology is transforming society, creating new businesses, new
jobs and new careers. The technology also creates new
opportunities for crime, and new problems in investigating and
prosecuting crime. As a result, electronic information, be it corporate trade
secrets, pre-release government crop statistics, or a patient's medical
records, must have strong protection from uninvited modifications
of disclosure. Cryptography enables that protection.</p>

<p>The United States is the world leader in information
technology. US firms continue to dominate the US and global
information systems market. Retaining this leadership is
important to our economic security. The Clinton Administration,
through its National Information Infrastructure initiative, has
long recognized that government has an important role as a
facilitator and catalyst for the industry-led transformation of the
way we use computer and communications technology to work and
live.</p>

<p>In particular, government has a strong interest in promoting
the legitimate use of robust encryption to support US
international competitiveness, foster global electronic commerce,
prevent computer crime, and ensure that the information
superhighway is a safe place to conduct one's business. At the
same time, there is a growing recognition, affirmed most recently
by the National Academy of Science that the use of encryption to
conceal illegitimate activities &quot;poses a problem for society
as a whole, not just for law enforcement and national
security.&quot; In brief, criminals can use encryption to
frustrate legal wiretaps and render useless search warrants for
stored electronic data. We know of no technical solution to the problems
that would result from the global proliferation of strong
cryptography (see box). The implications of this are no small
matter. </p>

<p>Encrypted computer files have hampered the prosecution of
child pornographers. Militia groups advise their members to use encryption
to hide illicit weapons, financial, and other criminal
activities. Aldrich Ames was instructed by his Soviet handlers to encrypt
computer files that he passed to the Soviets. And international
terrorists and drug dealers increasingly use encryption to
prevent law enforcement officials from reading their voice and
data transmissions. Grave crimes, such as a plot to shoot down
several airliners over Chicago, have been foiled by the use of
wiretaps. Had the FBI been unable to read those transmissions,
however, a major tragedy might have ensued.</p>

<p>No restrictions apply to the US domestic use of cryptography,
and the Administration has no plan to seek restrictions. Cryptography
has long been controlled for export for national security
reasons, so as to keep it from getting into the hands of foreign
governments. But is has today become a dual-use technology, and
international businesses want to use the same security products
both domestically and abroad. The Administration is thus under
strong pressure to provide relief from cryptography export controls.</p>

<p>For our cryptography policy to succeed, it must be aligned
with commercial market forces and operate on an international basis.
Further, it should preserve and extend the strong position that
US industry enjoys in the global information systems marketplace.
Accordingly, the US government is working with US industry and
our international trading partners on an approach that will
protect information used in legitimate activities, assure the
continued safety of Americans from enemies both foreign and
domestic, and preserve the ability of the US information systems
industry to compete worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Key Management and Recovery</b></p>

<p>A consensus is emerging around the vision of a global
cryptography system that permits the use of any encryption method
the user chooses, with a stored key to unlock it when necessary.
The encryption key would be provided voluntarily by a computer
user to a trusted party who holds it for safe keeping. This is
what many people do with their house keys -- give them to a
trusted neighbor who can produce them when something unexpected
goes wrong. Businesses should find this attractive because they
do not want to lock up information and throw away the key or give
an employee -- not the company -- control over company
information. An individual might also use this service to ensure that
she can retrieve information stored years ago. This will require
a new infrastructure, consisting of trusted parties who have
defined responsibilities to key owners. Under law, these trusted
emergency key recovery organizations would also respond in a
timely manner to authorized requests from law enforcement officials
who required the key to decode information lawfully obtained or
seized from a subject of investigation or prosecution.</p>

<p>The Federal government will use key recovery encryption on its
own computers because it makes good management sense. It would be
irresponsible for agencies to store critical records without key recovery, risking
the loss of the information for programmatic use and the
inability to investigate and prosecute fraud or misuse of the
information.</p>

<p>A number of US and international companies are working with
the US and other governments to create a system of trusted parties
who are certified to safeguard the keys. In some cases, organizations
might guard their own keys. In other cases, persons will use the
key recovery services provided by third parties, one of a suite
of services that will include electronic directories and electronic
&quot;notaries&quot; in support of online commerce. Persons will
be free to choose the type and strength of encryption that provide
the degree of security they believe appropriate for their use.
Taken together, an overall key management infrastructure is
needed to make electronic commerce practical on a global scale.</p>

<p>Some commercial products and services which provide emergency
key recovery are already available. Testing and refinement is
needed before a widespread, robust infrastructure is put in
place. The US government is committed to supporting the development
of such a key management infrastructure through pilots and
experimental trials. The State Department is expediting the
review of several export license applications that test
commercial key recovery on an international scale. An interagency
working group is identifying several potential governmental uses
of commercial cryptography - both internal transactions and in
communications with the public - where key recovery can be
tested. A plan outlining these government tests will be available
in August. The government will be purchasing key recovery products
for its own use, and will adopt a Federal standard for evaluating such
products to assure agency purchasers that the key recovery
features operate properly. The Department of Commerce will be
establishing an industry-led advisory committee to make recommendations
regarding such a standard this Summer.</p>

<p>While we are open to other alternatives, a key recovery system
is the only approach we know of that accommodates all public
safety interests. And even it is imperfect. Some people will not
join voluntary systems, preferring to run the risk of losing
their keys and being unable to recover their encrypted information.
Although in some countries (e.g., France) mandatory key escrowing
is already in effect, we are pursuing a market-driven approach in
part because we hope and believe that key recovery will develop
as a cost-effective service in an electronic commerce
infrastructure. We are encourage in this effort by recent
discussions we have had at the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) that are leading to
international cryptography management principles which support
key recovery.</p>

<p><b>Export Controls</b></p>

<p>No matter how successful we are in realizing this vision,
American users of computer technology are demanding stronger encryption
for international use now. Although we do not control the use of encryption
within the US, we do, with some exceptions, limit the export of
non-escrowed mass market encryption to products using a key
length of 40 bits. (The length of the encryption key is one way
of measuring the strength of an encryption product. Systems using
longer keys are harder to decrypt.) US industry asserts that it
is losing overseas sales to its European and Japanese competitors because
it cannot include stronger cryptography as a component of its
commercial software and hardware products. It warns that loss of
a significant share of the world information systems market would
cause serious economic damage to the US economy, and could reduce
the US government's ability to influence the long term future of
global cryptography. It also argues that because customers do not
want to use one product in the US and a different one overseas,
export controls are causing US firms to provide an unsatisfactory
level of protection to their electronic information, making them vulnerable
to industrial espionage by their competitors and foreign
governments. </p>

<p>While 40 bit encryption products are still strong enough for
many uses, the Administration recognizes that some export liberalization
may be useful to build support for a key management regime. Accordingly,
we are actively considering measures that would provide limited,
temporary relief from cryptographic export controls in exchange
for real, measurable commitments from industry (e.g., investments
in products that support key recovery) toward the building of a
key management infrastructure. The liberalization proposals under
discussion, which would continue the current one-time review of
products by the National Security Agency, include: permitting
products using longer key lengths to be exported to specific
industry sectors such as health care or insurance (similar to
current policy for the financial sector); allowing export of
non-escrowed products to a list of trustworthy firms beyond those
sectors, with provisions for monitoring compliance to prevent
product diversion to other firms; export of cryptography-ready
operating systems; and, most dramatically, the transfer of jurisdiction
over commercial encryption products from the State Department's
munitions list to the Commerce Department's list of dual-use technologies.
Our goal is to obtain commitments from industry by the Fall.</p>

<p>We must, however, be careful in any relaxation of controls.
Other governments' law enforcement and national security needs to
access material encrypted with US products could drive them to
erect trade barriers by imposing import controls on strong non-escrow
encryption products. In addition, we do not want to do anything
that would damage our own national security or public safety by
spreading unbreakable encryption, especially given the
international nature of terrorism. Even 40 bit encryption, if widespread
and not escrowed, defeats law enforcement.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons that we oppose the legislation
(S.1726) introduced in this Congress by Senator Burns and co-sponsored
by Senator Lott and former Senator Dole. Although it contains
some provisions, such as the transfer of export control
jurisdiction for commercial cryptography to the Commerce
Department, with which we could agree if constructed with
appropriate safeguards, the bill is unbalanced, and makes no
effort to take into account the serious consequences of the proliferation
it would permit.</p>

<p>The importance of the US information technology industry, the
security stakes, and increasing Congressional interest make it clear
that there is an urgent need for clear policy and direction. The Administration's
proposed approach is broadly consistent with industry suggestions
and conclusions reached by the National Academy of Sciences in
its report. That report recognizes the need to address a complex
mix of commercial and security issues in a balanced manner. We
agree with that need. We also agree with the report's
recommendation that export controls on encryption products need
to be relaxed but not eliminated, and are actively considering
ways of providing short term relief. (We do not agree with the
report's recommendation that we eliminate most controls on 56-bit
key length products.) Finally, we agree that key escrow is a promising
but not fully tested solution, and are promoting the kinds of
testing the report recommends as a way of demonstrating the
solution's viability while providing stronger encryption
internationally.</p>

<p>We will continue discussion with industry, other members of
the private sector, the Congress, and governments at all levels
to arrive at a solution that promotes a future of safe computing
in a safe society.</p>

<p><b>Sidebar: Cracking Coded Messages</b></p>

<p>We should not underestimate how difficult is to decode
encrypted electronic information. One approach advanced in the popular
debate is to provide our law enforcement officials with more computing
power. At first glance, this suggestion seems promising, because
in theory any encrypted message can be decoded if enough
computing cycles are applied. This approach fails for five
reasons:</p>

<p>First, it relies on mathematical theory, not operational
reality. Digital technology reduces voice, faxes, images, and
text in any language to indistinguishable 1's and 0's. A great
variety of encryption products are also available. Under ideal
conditions -- if the type of communication or file, language, and encryption
algorithm are known with certainty, and a short key is used to encrypt
the information -- a large, specially-designed computer could
decode a single message relatively quickly. But State, local, and
Federal law enforcement officials do not operate in the clean
confines of a high-tech computer center. They must first capture
the 1's and 0's and discern what kind of encryption they have encountered.</p>

<p>Second, after the decoding problem is isolated, acquiring a
machine to decode a message is neither quick, easy or inexpensive.
Commercially available computers could not be used because they
will not have sufficient capacity. It would, for example, take
years for the computers used to process all social security
claims, payments and earnings years to decode one message using
the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a widely used system
originally developed by the US government that uses a 56-bit key.</p>

<p>Third, this approach betrays a misunderstanding of how crimes
are prevented. Used only in the most critical cases, legally authorized
wiretaps provide crucial information just before a crime is to
occur. Thus a near real-time ability to decode messages is
needed. Days or weeks are too long to wait to find out that a
terrorist attack is about to happen.</p>

<p>Fourth, this approach fails to acknowledge the volume of
messages that could need decoding. Each wiretap results in the collection
of thousands of messages relevant to the investigative purpose of
the wiretap. Even under the most ideal conditions, had these
messages been encrypted, the computing resources required to
decrypt them quickly would simply not be available. And this
example does not include the additional burden of decrypting, if
possible, any digital information such as computer disks that are
seized as evidence after a crime has been committed.</p>

<p>Finally, revealing the precise capabilities of law enforcement
agencies to decode messages, as would be necessary in order to present
the fruits of that work as evidence in court, could provide a
tutorial to criminal elements bent on eluding law enforcement.</p>

<hr>
<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP is one of Washington, D.C.'s oldest and largest full-service law firms.  Our attorneys provide advice and representation to private and government clients in all fields of law, including corporate transactions, tax, international trade and finance, environmental protection, intellectual property protection, general litigation (including international arbitration), telecommunications, transportation, energy, maritime, antitrust, labor and pension matters.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP currently has four lawyers in <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/almaty.htm">Almaty, Kazakstan</a> and 12 lawyers in Moscow, Russia supported by 200 attorneys in its Washington, D.C. headquarters, as well as a number of specialists and paralegals.  The firm maintains also an office in <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/phoenix.htm">Phoenix, Arizona </a>.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has an exceptionally strong international commercial practice generally, and in the former Soviet Union particularly.  Our attorneys annually handle a broad range of trade and investment matters for numerous U.S. and foreign clients in all regions of the former Soviet Union.

 <h4 align=center><a name="cis">Commonwealth of Independent States ("C.I.S.") Trade and Investment</a></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has long been at the forefront of legal and business developments in C.I.S. trade and investment.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP was one of the first U.S. law firms to establish a presence in Moscow, and it's affiliate there has doubled its practice in Russia each of the four years that it has been there.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys collectively bring decades of experience to their work in Russia and the former Soviet Union.  Several of our partners were actively involved in major trade and investment projects during the detente period of the late 1970s; and, since the early days of perestroika, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have participated, through representation of Western (and, more recently, Russian) companies, in the definition of all phases of Russia's new private sector.  This involvement has included assistance to Russian policy-makers in developing the legal framework required for the transition to a market economy as well as extensive involvement in the structuring of new business forms and the creation of a broad range of new private companies.  

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has helped negotiate and draft sales, distribution, supplier, technology transfer, production sharing and countertrade agreements -- to name a few.  

<P>The firm advises on the establishment of representative offices, branches and subsidiaries and assists U.S. companies in the negotiation of joint activities with C.I.S. partners in the form of cooperation agreements, jointly owned companies, or direct investment in privatizing enterprises.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have helped plan, negotiate and structure hundreds of joint ventures and other Western investments in Russia and other nations of the C.I.S., including Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakstan and Ukraine.  The firm also assists clients in obtaining financing or guaranties from international lending organizations ("ILO") and other financial institutions.

<P>Whatever the client's goals, Steptoe & Johnson LLP's C.I.S. Trade and Investment practice provides a full analysis of all relevant legal issues affecting those goals -- including questions arising under corporate, securities, tax, intellectual property, privatization, antitrust, currency control and labor laws, in order to provide the client with the most advantageous trade or investment structure possible.  The firm's lawyers also assist clients and the C.I.S. companies in which they invest to comply with the growing body of regulatory law in the energy, telecommunications and other sectors.  And, where appropriate, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys provide representation to clients in dispute resolution proceedings, including local litigation and international arbitration.<a href="#begin"> <font size=-2>[return to top of document]</font></a>
<hr>
 <h4 align=center><a name="priv">Privatization</a></h4>
<P>Since 1991, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has also been active in the development and implementation of C.I.S. privatization policies and has provided counsel to companies, both U.S. and C.I.S., regarding the privatization process.  Our attorneys have represented dozens of U.S. companies that are investing in privatized Russian companies or buying assets previously owned by state enterprises.  The firm has also been retained by several major high-tech Russian enterprises to provide counsel regarding their restructuring options with a view to attracting foreign investment. <a href="#begin"><font size=-2>[Return to top of document]</font></a>
<hr>
 <h4 align=center><a name="gov">Government Assistance and Public Education</a></h4>

<P>Enhancing the firm's privatization practice, Steptoe & Johnson LLP actively participates in U.S. government and ILO-sponsored programs.  The firm was awarded a three-year contract by the U.S. Agency for International Development ("AID") to assist the nations of the C.I.S. in their various privatization efforts, including assistance in discrete privatizations in key industrial sectors.  Projects under the AID contract include the privatization of the Port of Murmansk (drafting a new Seaport Authority charter and designing the stock distribution plan for ten newly privatized joint stock companies) and the drafting of implementing regulations and procedures for the Kazak and Russian Antimonopoly Committees.

<P>Similarly, Steptoe & Johnson LLP prepared a corporate governance manual for the International Finance Corporation to be distributed to the management and shareholders of newly privatized companies in Russia, and a book for the European Commission entitled, "Doing Business with the USA," for use by foreign persons.

<P>Public education is another key facet of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's C.I.S. practice.  The firm sponsors a quarterly "Roundtable" on U.S.-C.I.S. trade and investment issues to brief U.S. companies on legal and economic developments.  Our attorneys also conduct seminars on an annual basis in the C.I.S. on issues of central concern to the emerging private sector.  And, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys publish and lecture widely on C.I.S. commercial law and policy.<a href="#begin"> <font size=-2>[return to top of document]</font></a>
<hr>
 <h4 align=center><a name="struc">The Structure of the Practice</a></h4>

<P>The core of the C.I.S. Trade and Investment practice consists of six Russian speaking attorneys in Washington, D.C., and eight attorneys (U.S. and C.I.S.) in Moscow as well as two in Almaty practicing through the firm's affiliates.  The group is also assisted by area specialists and various consultants (also English/Russian speaking).  Steptoe & Johnson LLP's U.S. and C.I.S. operations are unique in that the firm's non-Russian speaking specialists in intellectual property, tax, finance, environmental protection law and other disciplines (see "Related Practice Areas" below) work as an integrated team with the D.C.-, Moscow- and Almaty-based specialists in C.I.S. law.  This integration is enhanced by a comprehensive communications system, involving satellite phone and fax links and electronic mail.  

<P>The C.I.S. Trade and Investment practice maintains extensive collections of laws for all of the C.I.S. nations in which it is active.  The firm also maintains a network of legal consultants who provide access to key government officials, assist in obtaining political support for client projects and confirm the latest legal and regulatory developments in the C.I.S. nations where Steptoe & Johnson LLP does not currently have offices, but has active client matters.<a href="#begin"> <font size=-2>[return to top of document]</font></a>

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Environmental Law Practice:  Site Remediation and Cost Allocation Supplement
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2>
<CENTER>Environmental Law Practice:</CENTER></h2>
<H2><CENTER>Site Remediation and Cost Allocation Supplement</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have been active on federal Superfund issues since the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 1980.  Currently, Steptoe attorneys are handling matters under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state programs
governing site remediation and cost allocation in a number of jurisdictions, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Virginia and Washington.  This wide range of experience provides Steptoe with the expertise to devise sound, creative approaches to remediation and related cost allocation issues in almost any setting.  We work with our clients to bring the knowledge we have gained at sites all around the nation to bear on the client's specific situation(s).

<P>Among our current and recent Superfund representations are the
following:
<ul><LI>Negotiating voluntary clean up programs with state regulatory
agencies for manufacturing facilities in California, New Jersey
and Montana, and for a former waste disposal facility in
Virginia.<P>
<LI>Working out an understanding with EPA to allow construction of
a new building to take place on a federal Superfund site.<P>
<LI>Working with consultants to convince state regulators that the
risk from a contaminated facility should be addressed through
containment, rather than other alternatives.<P>
<LI>Convincing EPA to add additional PRP's to a federal Superfund
site before consent decree negotiations.	<P>
<LI>Winning a victory for a large group of municipalities in
private cost recovery litigation arising out of the Murtha site
in Connecticut.  Steptoe attorneys successfully argued that
sending municipal solid waste to a landfill is not by itself a
sufficient basis to impose liability under Superfund.<P>
<LI>Serving as Court Appointed Liaison Counsel for a group of over
150 third-party defendants and also representing 25 parties in
private cost allocation litigation surrounding the SCP-Carlstadt
Superfund Site in New Jersey.  Our firm also represents a group
of 30 de minimis contributors to the site seeking a settlement
with the other members of the cooperating PRP Group and with
EPA.  <P>
<LI>Achieving settlement in a complex private cost recovery action
involving a site near Washington National Airport.  Representing
the plaintiff landowner, we brought an action against the
operator of a scrap yard and the approximately 25 waste
generators seeking response costs.</ul>


<P>Steptoe also is heavily involved on the legislative side of
Superfund matters.  Steptoe lawyers worked with the
Environmental Law Institute to prepare The Superfund Desk Book,
the first major publication to assess the impact of the
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA).  Since that
time, Steptoe has been in close touch with Superfund legislative
developments at the federal level and in states, such as
California and New Jersey, which are of particular interest to
our clients.  We currently are representing a major industry
association in connection with the Superfund Reauthorization
bill.<p><blockquote><CENTER><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/environ.htm">Environmental Law Practice Area Description</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pgatoc.htm">Practice Areas Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/sjbios.htm">Attorney Bios</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/welcome.htm">Home Page</a></CENTER></body></html>

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Insurance and Reinsurance Practice 
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Insurance and Reinsurance Practice </CENTER></H2>



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has one of the largest and most diverse insurance and reinsurance
practices in the country.  Since this field exploded in the late
1970s, we have represented and continue to represent numerous
insurers and reinsurers on a wide variety of coverage questions.
 Our practice involves litigation at both the trial and
appellate levels, arbitration, and client counseling and advice
regarding a broad spectrum of coverage issues.  



<P>We also have had extensive experience in representing insurers
in many large, complex declaratory judgment actions regarding
asbestos and other product claims, and environmental and
hazardous waste claims.



<P>In addition, we have one of the preeminent insurance tax
practices in the country.  This practice includes company and
product tax issues, tax controversy and tax planning, and
legislative and administrative lobbying.  





<h4><CENTER>Hazardous Products Coverage Issues</CENTER></h4>



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has represented numerous insurance companies
in litigation concerning virtually all aspects of asbestos bodily
injury and building coverage claims. Our work in this area has
made us very familiar with all of the asbestos coverage issues,
including trigger and scope of coverage, the expected and
intended defense, the notice defense, and the meaning and intent
of various asbestos-related exclusions.  These cases also have
required us to become familiar with both the technical
literature and technical experts relating to asbestos hazards
and the propriety of removing asbestos from buildings.  In
addition to asbestos, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has been involved in
litigation or advice concerning coverage for a variety of other
hazardous products including formaldehyde, Agent Orange and
termiticides.  Our practice in this area also includes a
substantial amount of non-litigation settlement negotiations,
counseling and advice.





<h4><CENTER>Environmental Coverage Litigation
</CENTER></h4>


<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP currently is representing insurance industry
clients in more than forty environmental coverage lawsuits. 
These suits involve disputes arising from EPA Superfund and
state enforcement actions as well as private lawsuits.



<P>In these actions we have addressed all major environmental
coverage issues, including the pollution exclusion, the expected
and intended defense, and the "suit" and "damages" issues.  For
example, Steptoe & Johnson LLP authored the first amicus brief filed
by IELA in the landmark Armco case, one of the first cases
decided in favor of the insurance industry on the "damages"
issues.



<P>Our expertise in handling environmental coverage issues has been
enhanced by our active participation on behalf of Aetna Casualty
& Surety Company in a series of lawsuits brought by state
attorneys general and various private plaintiffs regarding the
terms of liability insurance and reinsurance available for
environmental exposures in the 1970s and 1980s.  A principal
focus in this suit has been the development of policy language
to cover and to exclude environmental and hazardous waste risks.





<h4><CENTER>Environmental Tort Liability</CENTER></h4>



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a unique ability to handle all issues
arising out of environmental tort litigation because of the
presence of Richard Willard.  Prior to joining Steptoe a year
ago, Richard served as Assistant Attorney General in charge of
the Civil Division.  In that position Richard was responsible
for representing the government in most civil and tort suits
brought against the federal government.  A substantial portion
of the Civil Division's efforts during this period was devoted
to representing the federal government in toxic tort litigation,
including cases involving exposure to asbestos, radiation and
hazardous wastes.





<h4><CENTER>Other Coverage Issues</CENTER></h4>



<P>Beyond environmental and hazardous product coverage issues, we
have been involved in the entire gamut of coverage issues
arising under liability, property, health, life, title
insurance, professional liability, D&O policies, as well as
surety, fidelity, and financial guarantee bonds.  These included
coverage disputes arising out of antitrust, employment
discrimination, RICO, securities fraud, financial institutions,
and ERISA claims.  We have represented insurers against claims
of bad faith and unfair claims handling.  We have also
represented insurers and reinsurers on a variety of treaty and
facultative reinsurance matters.





<h4><CENTER>Insurance Tax
</CENTER></h4>


<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's insurance tax practice covers both company
and product tax issues, and involves tax controversy and tax
planning, as well as legislative and administrative lobbying. 
Our attorneys have extensive experience with prior and current
law, and are directly involved in ongoing developments affecting
taxation of the industry.



<P>In the controversy area, we represent clients at all
administrative levels within the IRS.  We assist companies in
responding to audit inquiries and proposed adjustments and in
presenting Technical Advice requests to the IRS National Office.

<P>In addition, we work with clients to prepare protests, to
effectuate settlements, and to file claims for refund.  We often
litigate cases for our clients, appearing before the United
States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims, and
other courts.  We have successfully represented insurance
company clients in several cases before the Supreme Court.  Two
of those matters, in which we successfully represented industry
groups, raised constitutional issues relating to state premium
taxes.



<P>In the tax planning area, we work with clients to devise and
implement tax strategy, to obtain private letter rulings, and to
develop return positions.  We provide advice on the structure of
transactions, including stock and asset acquisitions and
dispositions, and with respect to the application of the
consolidated return regulations.  Also, we often assist clients
with product tax matters, including questions concerning the
definition of life insurance.

<P>Our attorneys were extensively involved in the legislative
processes resulting in TEFRA and the 1984 Tax Act and are
continuously involved in legislative developments affecting the
industry.  Additionally, we often represent insurance interests
before the IRS and the Treasury Department regarding coordinated
issues, proposed regulations, and other matters of general
importance to the industry.<p><blockquote><CENTER><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pgatoc.htm">Practice Areas Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/sjbios.htm">Attorney Bios</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/welcome.htm">Home Page</a></CENTER></body></html>

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Appellate and Supreme Court Practice

</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>



<H2><Center>Appellate and Supreme Court Practice</center></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has represented clients on numerous occasions in the U.S. Supreme Court and federal courts of appeals throughout the country.

<P>Because the firm's litigation practice frequently involves cutting-edge issues leading to appellate litigation, virtually all Steptoe & Johnson LLP litigators are experienced in appellate work.  In addition to appeals arising from cases in which Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys con-ducted the trial court proceedings, the firm's litigators often handle cases brought to the firm at the appellate or Supreme Court stage.  

<P>Unlike some other firms with substantial appellate practices, however, Steptoe & Johnson LLP does not compartmentalize its appellate practitioners by placing them in a department separate from the rest of the firm.  The firm believes that its appellate clients benefit from working with litigators who also have trial experience, and that its clients with matters at the trial level often benefit from having the perspective of a litigator with appellate experience.


<h4><center>Supreme Court Litigation</center></h4>

<P>Practice before the U.S. Supreme Court, particularly at the stage of petitioning for certiorari, involves distinctive rules and procedures.  A command of the relevant substantive law is therefore only a threshold requirement in dealing with the Court.  A number of partners at our firm have considerable Supreme Court experience, both as former Supreme Court clerks and as veteran Supreme Court practitioners.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys routinely handle cases brought to the firm following a loss in a federal court of appeals or a state supreme court.  The firm's Supreme Court specialists are often asked to provide advice on petitioning for certiorari and other aspects of Supreme Court practice.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have also served as counsel or co-counsel in numerous cases for clients filing briefs amicus curiae in support of petitions for certiorari or on the merits.

<P>On a number of Supreme Court matters, we have collaborated with trial counsel in presenting a case to the Court.  We have found that this collaboration often provides enhanced representation for the client.  Typically, each set of counsel will have somewhat different insights and experiences to contribute to the case.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have briefed and argued all sorts of cases before the Supreme Court.  In recent years, challenges to state laws affecting multi-state corporations on constitutional and federal pre-emption grounds and tax cases have been especially prominent in the firm's Supreme Court practice.  The constitutional challenges have invoked the commerce clause and the equal protection clause to challenge discrimination against out-of-state companies on state and local laws; the tax cases involved such diverse issues as state insurance premium taxation, federal statutory limitations on state taxation, corporate tax issues, and ERISA preemption matters.

<P>At the Feb. 8 signing ceremony for the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, President Bill Clinton and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) both praised the legislation as a deregulatory measure that would reduce governmental oversight of the telecommunications industry. While the legislation does reduce many regulatory barriers to entry into several critical telecommunications markets, however, it also simultaneously and significantly increases the regulatory role of the Federal Communications Commission.

<P>Ever since Judge Harold Greene of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia effectively assumed regulatory control of significant portions of telecommunications policy through his administration in the early 1980s of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. consent decree in <I>United States</I> v. <I>AT&amp;T</I>, 555 F. Supp. 226 (D.D.C. 1982), Congress has been considering how to wrest dominance of telecommunications policy from the judiciary. The 1996 act marks the culmination of this decade-long legislative effort.


<h4 align=center>RAZING WALLS</h4>


<P>The act removes barriers to four major telecommunications markets: the long distance and manufacturing markets (by overriding terms of the AT&amp;T consent decree that prohibited the seven regional Bell operating companies,Baby Bells,from entering these markets); the local telephone market (by pre-empting state and local regulatory barriers); and the video market (by removing statutory barriers to Baby Bell entry that Congress itself had erected).

<P>At the same time, the new law ensures that the FCC will continue to have four essential tasks for years to come. First, the commission will play a significant &quot;gatekeeper&quot; role by regulating entry into some sectors. For example, the FCC will decide the crucial question of when the regional Bell operating companies will be permitted to originate long distance service inside their own territory. (For example, when can Bell Atlantic
provide long distance service to its customers in Virginia?) The FCC will judge Baby Bell applications for every state (except Alaska and Hawaii, which have no Baby Bells) on the basis of (1) whether the Baby Bell faces a facilities-based competitor; (2) whether the Baby Bell has met an intricate 14-point checklist for opening up the local market to competition; and (3) whether Baby Bell entry meets the amorphous &quot;public interest&quot; test.


<P>Second, and most important, the FCC will continue to operate as &quot;rule-maker,&quot; establishing the rules of the road for the newly competitive markets. The 1996 act commands the commission to conduct rule-makings on about 80 topics. These include: <P>

<blockquote>Regulations on local competition that must cover interconnections, reciprocal compensation for terminating local calls, resale, number portability (which permits a customer to keep the same phone number when switching local carriers), and access to rights-of-way and placement of competitor's equipment in facilities owned by Baby Bells; Creation (in conjunction with a joint board of the FCC and state utility commissioners, and a consumer advocate) of a new program for universal service that includes (1) expansion of the program to subsidize &quot;advanced telecommunications and information services&quot;; (2) establishment of a new funding mechanism providing discounted access for public schools, libraries, and health care institutions; and (3) designation of carriers eligible for federal support;

<p>Regulations for &quot;open video systems,&quot; which will allow video programming using common carrier regulatory principles instead of traditional cable regulation; and 

<p>Regulations for incumbent local exchange companies to share infrastructure with new entrants.</blockquote>


<P>Third, the FCC increasingly will be called on to play &quot;traffic cop&quot; in newly competitive markets. New entrants will inevitably claim that incumbent powerhouses are unfairly using their market power to squelch competition. For example, new entrants into the local exchange market are likely to contend that RBOCs are not opening up their local networks quickly enough to competitors. Similarly, new entrants in the video market may argue that cable TV companies that control a significant amount of content,such as TCI and Time-Warner [a
Legal Times' affiliate],are not making that content available on a nondiscriminatory basis. These complaints will lead to calls to revise the rules of the road and to take specific remedial action against some companies. The commission will be increasingly asked to sharpen the line between legitimate competitive advantages and unfair practices.


<P>Fourth, the FCC will continue to be the &quot;megadeal magistrate&quot; for the many transactions that will be stimulated by the act. For example, FCC approval will be needed for transfers of radio licenses, as well as for major foreign investments in companies holding radio licenses. Such transactions are likely to increase under the new act. Indeed, the recent Disney/ABC and Westinghouse/CBS transactions anticipated the legislative changes increasing the number of broadcast stations that can be under common ownership. Similarly, foreign investment is growing as U.S. carriers seek capital to position themselves for increased competition in the market sectors opened up by the 1996 act. The MCI/British Telephone and Sprint/France
Telecom/Deutsche Telekom transactions are evidence of this trend. More transactions on a similar scale,many requiring FCC review and approval,are likely as other companies strive to provide one-stop shopping for consumers' communications, information, and entertainment needs.

<h4 align=center>STRAIN ON RESOURCES</h4>

<P>The new regulatory responsibilities imposed by the 1996 act will put a major strain on commission resources. Virtually every one of the 80 mandated rule-makings has a congressional deadline. Many of the rule-makings must be completed within six months; almost all are to be finalized within two years. Indeed,
these and other time limits demonstrate that the battle between lawmakers who intended the telecommunications act to function primarily as a means of deregulating the industry and those who
wished to bolster FCC authority in order to protect consumers and companies without market power has not been resolved.

<P>For example, Congress has allotted only 90 days to consider an RBOC's application to originate long distance service from within its own territories. Yet, these reviews (and there will be one for every state the Baby Bells serve) must include a proceeding to obtain comments from interested companies and the public. It is inevitable that this will prove to be a lightning rod for attracting Baby Bell competitors complaining that insufficient steps have been taken to open up the local market to competition.

<P>Similarly, in reviewing these applications, the FCC is required to consult with state utility commissions on whether the Baby Bell has satisfied the 14-point competitive checklist for opening up the local market. The FCC also must give &quot;substantial weight&quot; to the views of the Department of Justice.


<P>A proceeding of this magnitude normally would take the commission at least one year. A timetable of 90 days precludes an exacting review, apparently, a deliberate choice by Congress.



<P>Ninety days, however, is a leisurely pace compared to the timetable for FCC consideration of local telephone company applications to provide video services through an &quot;open video system.&quot; To qualify as an open video system provider, which allows a company to avoid numerous traditional cable TV
regulatory requirements, a telephone company must certify that it meets an eight-point checklist. The FCC is given all of 10 days to pass on such a telephone company application.

<P>In addition to denying the FCC the time needed for careful analysis, some in Congress are determined to deregulate by starving the commission of necessary resources. Many commissioners and staff members have already begun working seven days a week just to plan the implementation of the act. At the same time, Congress has allowed the commission's budgetary fate to remain uncertain. The FCC is operating at a reduced funding level, and its financing beyond March is in doubt.

<h4  align=center>GOVERNMENT'S BEST BARGAIN</h4>

<P>This move to cripple the FCC certainly cannot be justified on fiscal grounds. The commission is the best bargain in government, raising more than $15 billion in revenues in the last year through spectrum auctions, more money than any other federal agency except the Internal Revenue Service.



<P>If Congress wants the FCC to discharge its important gatekeeper, rule-maker, traffic cop, and megadeal magistrate responsibilities in a manner that promotes competition and protects the public, then it should provide the commission with sufficient resources to complete the telecommunications reform task started in the 1996 act. A decision to deny these funds will be an unfortunate attempt to obtain deregulatory goals not
realized in the 1996 law through the appropriations process.

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</CENTER></H2>

<P>Over the past few years, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has successfully concluded some of its most important litigation by switching to alternative dispute resolution (ADR).  These cases have included a major antitrust suit in the railroad industry and litigation over royalties to be paid by a major Alaska North Slope oil producer to the State of Alaska.  In these examples and others, we have specially tailored ADR procedures to wind up ongoing litigation on terms that clients thought to their great advantage.  As usual with ADR, these settlements have involved major savings to the client in time and expense.  We have also drafted ADR clauses for settlement agreements and contracts to provide quick and less expensive means of solving disputes arising under such agreements.

<P>More recently, partners in the firm have served as mediators or arbitrators in cases involving professional football franchises, communications satellites, and major retail and real estate holdings.  In one instance, multiple lawsuits in three jurisdictions were settled in a mediation of three and one-half months.


<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/bouknigh.htm">Lon Bouknight</a>, <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/green.htm">Doug Green</a>, and <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/patterso.htm">Errol Patterson</a> represented Public Service Electric & Gas Company in a suit against another utility that was settled for $131,000,000 through an ADR process which included a mini-trial presided over by former Deputy Attorney General Harold Tyler.

<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/nolan.htm">John Nolan</a> was the mediator for those parts of the Haft family litigation that have settled and has served as either mediator or arbitrator in a number of other noteworthy cases.  

<P>We find that our clients' interests are best served by maintaining an ADR capability separate from our litigation group.  We screen all new litigation matters for ADR potential and work closely with the litigation team when some alternative to litigation becomes a possibility.

<P>The firm has been an active participant in the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution since its founding.  <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/nolan.htm">John Nolan</a>, <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/jordan.htm">Bob Jordan</a> and <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/meyerson.htm">Bruce Meyerson</a> are among the members of the Center for Public Resources' panels of "Distinguished Neutrals" and all are proponents of ADR in the national bar.  Several of our largest corporate clients have been leaders in the development of ADR, and we continue to work closely with them as the field develops.

<TITLE>Steptoe & Johnson LLP/Transportation Practice
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>Steptoe & Johnson LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Transportation Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>Transportation has been a key element of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's practice since the firm's
inception, and our diverse transportation practice now spans
every mode -- rail, air, water carriage and motor carriage.  The
foundation for that practice is an intimate understanding of the
nature of the transportation industry and the regulatory
structure in which it operates.  Our attorneys have extensive
experience in dealing with the federal agencies that regulate
interstate carriers, and they have litigated a broad range of
transportation issues before state and federal trial courts, the
courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States.
<h4>
<CENTER>Railroad Regulation and Litigation</CENTER> </h4>

<P>The backbone of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's railroad practice is the
representation of carriers, shippers, and state and local
governments before the Surface Transportation Board ("STB") (formerly known as the Interstate Commerce Commission).  From
complex merger and acquisition proceedings to straightforward
abandonment and construction cases, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has
provided expert advice and representation to parties seeking
regulatory action on railroad issues.  

<P>We also have taken a leadership role in litigation of railroad
rate matters; our experience over the past decade has given us
thorough understanding of this complex and developing area.

<P>We have been instrumental in securing STB approval for a number
of significant rail transactions, including acquisition of
carriers, creation of short-line carriers, and sales of rail
assets, lines, and equipment.  Our expertise in these areas has
enabled us to provide innovative advice on structuring
transactions, securing regulatory approval, and defending the
agency action from procedural or substantive challenge on
judicial review.  In addition, because of the broad nature of
Steptoe & Johnson LLP's practice, we are able to support our
regulatory advice with necessary expertise in rail finance, tax
aspects of rail transactions, and equipment recordation.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's attorneys have litigated a wide range of
rail-related issues in the state and federal courts, including
antitrust, complex contract claims, constitutional challenges to
state legislation, and RICO defense.  Well known for our
specialization in appellate matters, we have participated in a
number of recent Supreme Court cases involving rail issues,
including state taxation of railroads, creation of short-line
carriers, and regulation of employee drug use.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP regularly assists members of the industry in
business and financial planning.  We have been involved in the
corporate restructuring of a number of carriers and carrier
holding companies.  We counsel carriers, investors, and rail
equipment companies on the regulatory impact of proposed
corporate actions. 

<P>Our attorneys also have substantial experience in interpreting,
applying, and litigating the Railway Labor Act, providing advice
on the labor aspects of proposed transactions and management
programs and responding to litigation challenges by labor
representatives and individual employees.  We have been involved
in the front-line issues in this rapidly evolving area,
including employee drug testing, secondary strikes, and
bargaining and representation issues arising from acquisitions
and rail line sales.  Our attorneys also have demonstrated
knowledge of the STB's intricate jurisdiction to condition
regulatory approval of rail transactions on protection of
employee interests.

<P>In addition to these regulatory matters, Steptoe & Johnson LLP's
attorneys have handled complex equal employment opportunity
matters, including class actions, brought against carriers.  We
have also provided advice on Title VII and ADEA enforcement,
employee drug testing, AIDS concerns, and similar matters.

<h4><CENTER>Motor Carriage</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP represents  motor carriers, shippers and trade
associations in a variety of regulatory and commercial contexts.

<P>Our attorneys practice extensively before the Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Surface Transportation Board and other regulatory bodies.

<P>The firm has had considerable experience in the representation
of carriers and shippers in complex rate and tariff proceedings
in the federal trial and appellate courts and before the former Interstate Commerce Commission.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys
also counsel entities in strategies for avoiding undercharge
claims and limiting potential exposure to future damage claims.

<P>The firm has also been very active in counseling parties with
respect to contracts between motor carriers and shippers and in
drafting and reviewing such contracts and other shipping
documents that govern the relationship between carriers and
shippers.

<P>In addition to representing clients in a variety of proceedings
before the STB, such as operating rights and rate and tariff
proceedings, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys also have substantial
experience in handling major rulemaking and adjudicatory cases
before that agency and other federal agencies that regulate
highway transportation.  Our attorneys are also conversant with
the complex regulations concerning vehicle safety and hazardous
materials transportation, and in representing carriers in
related enforcement and rulemaking proceedings before the
Department of Transportation.  We have also represented various
interests in connection with cross-border trucking involving
both Mexico and Canada and have counseled clients with respect
to the myriad issues relating to the boundary between STB
regulation of interstate commerce and state regulation of
intrastate commerce.

<h4><CENTER>Aviation</CENTER></h4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's aviation practice focuses on the
representation of both domestic and foreign air carriers in a
variety of commercial and regulatory settings.  Our attorneys
bring substantial expertise and experience to the full range of
matters that relate to air transportation of passengers and
property, including the representation of carrier and other
interests before the Department of Transportation in route and
other proceedings, the taxation of air transportation services,
computer reservation systems, relationships with travel agents
and other transportation intermediaries, immigration and customs
matters, aviation safety and security issues, and federal and
local noise regulations.

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys also have expertise in a range of
commercial transactions in the aviation field, including leasing
of commercial aircraft and other financing transactions, as well
as negotiation of contracts with a variety of aviation vendors. 
The firm also represents aviation interests in litigation
matters before regulatory agencies and federal and state courts,
and in legislative matters as well.

<h4><CENTER>Maritime</CENTER></h4>

<P>The firm has substantial expertise in representing ocean
carriers and shippers in proceedings before the Federal Maritime
Commission and in other forums.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys
handle a wide range of matters for these clients, including
counseling with respect to service contracts, tax issues,
cooperative agreements, and antitrust matters.  Our attorneys
have also been involved in major FMC rulemaking proceedings of
interest to the maritime community and in advising clients on
the requirements imposed by the Shipping Act of 1984, the Jones
Act and other statutes and regulations governing maritime
commerce.

<P>The firm has also handled a number of significant and complex
intermodal matters involving arrangements between ocean carriers
and other transportation modes for the through movement of
property.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys are knowledgeable with
respect to the laws relevant to the international shipment of
property by ocean carriers or by ocean carriers jointly with
rail, motor and air carriers and regularly advise clients on
liability and other issues pertinent to joint carrier
arrangements.

<TITLE>Steptoe & Johnson LLP/International Transactional Practice 
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3 align=center>Steptoe & Johnson LLP</H3>


<H2 align=center>International Transactional Practice</H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has an  active practice in all areas of legal advice relating to
international transactions.  The firm is uniquely qualified to
handle the financial, corporate, regulatory, national security,
export control, and cross-cultural aspects of such transactions.

<P>The discussion below highlights particular specialties of the
firm's international transactional practice and summarizes a few
interesting recent representations.

<H4 align=center>Acquisitions</H4>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has represented participants in numerous
international transactions involving the sale of companies, both
publicly and privately held in whole or in part.  For example,
the firm represented Swissair, the national airline of
Switzerland, in a transaction whereby Swissair acquired $194
million of the stock of Delta Air Lines and Delta acquired $90
million of Swissair stock.  The firm also represented Inter-City
Gas, a major Canadian natural resources and manufacturing
company, regarding the U.S. financial aspects of a $700 million
sale of two business units.  Most recently, Steptoe & Johnson LLP
has assisted a major U.S. defense contractor in obtaining
U.S.government clearances for a significant foreign stock
purchase. 



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has worked on international acquisitions
involving many different industries and financing techniques and
implicating many legal specialties.  As the circumstances
require, Steptoe & Johnson LLP has taken advantage of its great
diversity of talent to call on specialists in different legal
disciplines.  Working as an interdisciplinary team, Steptoe &
Johnson LLP lawyers can identify, address, and resolve issues
quickly and comprehensively.



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP married its international financial and
telecommunications expertise in helping a Swiss corporation
acquire 5% of a leading international supplier of satellite
transmission and distribution services.  In another context, the
firm has employed its broad experience in utilities finance to
assist a major Canadian utility in concluding strategic
eight-figure investments in the United States.  The firm's
corporate department worked with its government contracts
section as counsel to an Italian conglomerate, in a delicate
proposed acquisition of a major supplier to the United States
Department of Defense.  The firm's transportation and corporate
lawyers have advised clients regarding major international
investments in railroad concerns.  The firm's intellectual
property professionals combined with corporate finance
specialists to assist an important Australian computer
networking firm in implementing its international acquisition
program.  The financial specialists brought in the law firm's
environmental and high technology specialists to represent a
manufacturer of high reliability sealing components for military
aircraft engines and environmental control systems in its
acquisition by a multinational conglomerate.  Many more
instances could be recounted, but the essential point is made: 
the firm brings to the table the whole range of legal talents
necessary to conclude an international acquisition.


<P>In sum, Steptoe & Johnson LLP's attorneys have guided companies
through a whole range of transactional, financial and regulatory
issues arising from international acquisitions. 

<H4 align=center>Privatization</H4>

<P>Privatization of activities previously performed by government
entities is a comparably recent phenomenon, not only in the
United States but throughout the world.  As counsel experienced
in regulatory matters and corporate compliance, Steptoe &
Johnson LLP attorneys have been closely involved in various aspects
of this process.  Through our administrative, corporate, and
commercial representations, we have developed a thorough understanding of the way government enterprises work, an acute sense for the needs of private business, and how to bridge the two.  We have been consulted by governmental entities, financial institutions, private participants in privatization programs, and those affected by the changes in governmental regulation.  


<P>In the last several years, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys were
prominently involved in structuring and implementing the
transfer of $1.7 billion of the United States' agricultural loan
portfolio to private investors.  This was achieved through an
innovative series of private and international public financings
that the firm was instrumental in developing.



<P>The firm also developed a menu of options to structure bids for
the purchase and servicing of a portfolio of loans by a
government agency to small rural projects.



<P>The firm is currently participating in various advisory roles in
the transition of the former Soviet Union and other Eastern
European countries from centrally planned systems to free market
economies.  Specifically, Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys assisted
clients in developing and presenting proposals for the
modernization of public services and structuring joint ventures
in areas such as telecommunications, environmental systems, and
computer applications.  We have also analyzed specific
privatization programs in Canada and the United Kingdom to
determine whether the proposed measures could be seen as
bestowing unfair competitive advantages on the newly privatized
entities.





<H4 align=center>Joint Ventures</H4>



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have assisted in the planning,
negotiation, and formation of cooperative arrangements among
companies with divergent corporate identities and
characteristics for operations in the United States and
overseas.  In addition to legal expertise, Steptoe & Johnson LLP
attorneys understand national peculiarities and idioms.  Our
attorneys have the requisite language skills and appreciate
cultural differences to assist in the forging of lasting joint
venture relationships.  We strive to document complex
transactions not only to satisfy regulatory requirements but to
accommodate individual preferences as to drafting and business
style.



<P>Much of our work involves the daily grist of international
commerce.  For instance, Steptoe & Johnson LLP recently assisted a
U.S. chemical company in its acquisition of new technology from
small research companies as well as in its dealings with a
multinational chemical concern.  Similarly, we have assisted
international companies in securing supply and requirements
arrangements with partners abroad.  The firm frequently assists
clients in the financing and other arrangements in establishing
overseas manufacturing facilities.




<P>The firm has special expertise in the area of East-West
trade and investment.  We have advised U.S. companies in a wide
variety of ventures, ranging from natural resource development
and agriculture to consumer and industrial products and services.  In this connection, we assisted a major
U.S. industrial company to develop a general approach for its
negotiations with Soviet partners of several projects ranging
from medical appliances to computer hardware with production
facilities in different parts of the former Soviet Union.



<P>Our transactional and financial experience is complemented by
expertise acquired through our handling of disputes between
private entities and state-owned enterprises.  Steptoe &
Johnson LLP's active participation in the development of U.S. law
and policy regarding investment protection and dispute resolution
allows us to spot strategic issues and deal with them
effectively.  We appreciate both sides' views on issues such as
sovereign immunity, choice of law and forum, and acts of host
government authorities.





<H4 align=center>Asset-Based Transactions</H4>



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have negotiated and documented the
financing of a significant number of asset-based projects around
the globe.  Common examples of such projects are the
construction of facilities and the acquisition of major
equipment.



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP lawyers have worked on diverse types of
international facility construction projects, some of which illustrate the broad scope of the firm's
practice.  They have represented the unregulated subsidiary of
one of the largest utilities in the United States, in the
development of its international construction projects for
electric power generation facilities.  The firm is counsel to a
major Brazilian construction and engineering company, in its
construction of educational buildings and associated
infrastructure in Africa.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP's lawyers have
assisted U.S. companies in structuring and financing
"maquiladora" facilities in Mexico.  On behalf of international
investors, firm lawyers have structured the financing of
chemical production plants in Europe.  The firm represents a
British firm in its United States real estate investments.  It
has also represented conservation groups in structuring
debt-for-nature swaps to purchase nature preserves throughout
Latin America. 



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has been extensively involved in many types of
international equipment financing.  The firm has represented
airlines in lease financing transactions ranging from DC-9
aircraft to Boeing 747 aircraft.  It has been counsel to a major
United States railroad company in transactions involving the
cross-border leasing of railcars.  The firm's lawyers have
negotiated the acquisition of steam boilers from abroad for
power generating facilities.



<P>In short, if it is a significant asset sold across borders,
Steptoe & Johnson LLP has the legal experience to structure the
financing of its construction or acquisition.





<H4 align=center>International Taxation</H4>



<P>In the course of rendering the services recounted above, the
firm has provided clients -- both individuals and corporations
-- with tax advice concerning the most advantageous ways to
structure investments and international business operations,
including establishing Foreign Sales Corporations, deferring
current taxation of income, and maximizing the availability of
foreign tax credits.  We have helped structure license
agreements and technology transfer arrangements to minimize U.S.
and foreign tax burdens.  In this regard, our tax specialists
keep closely abreast of developments in Washington so as to
advise clients of the tax legislative and regulatory climate
that may affect their transactions.



<P>In addition to representing clients in connection with the
planning of international transactions and the structuring of
operations carried out around the globe, the firm has advised a
number of foreign and domestic clients regarding the audit of
their returns by the Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax
collection agencies.  The firm has also participated in
Competent Authority matters involving government-to-government
negotiation of issues relating to the tax returns of specific
taxpayers.<p>

<blockquote><center><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/emplyben.htm">Employee Benefits</a></center></blockquote>
<hr>



<P>Melanie Nussdorf's practice spans the entire range of employee
benefits, from the tax-based rules for qualified pension plans,
to fiduciary issues, welfare benefits and nonqualified deferred
compensation.  She has particular expertise in all aspects of the
plan termination process, both with respect to plans seeking a
reversion upon termination and on issues of employer liability
for poorly funded plans terminating in or outside of a bankruptcy
proceeding.  She has done substantial legislative work on the
tax, benefits and age discrimination laws that affect employee
benefit plans, representing clients before the tax-writing and
labor committees, as well as the aging committees.  She has also
specialized in fiduciary issues, including prohibited transaction
exemption questions under ERISA.
</P>
<P>Mrs. Nussdorf was counsel for age and sex discrimination at the
Department of Labor prior to serving as Executive Assistant to
the Solicitor of Labor from 1977-81.  During this period, she had
significant oversight responsibility for the Department's legal
work under ERISA.  From 1981-84, she served as Special Counsel at
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and among other
responsibilities, drafted and negotiated the legislation which
ultimately changed the single employers plan termination program.

<TITLE>Antitrust and Trade Regulation Practice
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>


<H2><CENTER>Antitrust and Trade Regulation Practice</CENTER></H2>
<P>The antitrust practice at Steptoe & Johnson LLP has been a mainstay since the firm's inception.  Calling upon the experience of a large and diverse number of talented lawyers over the years, Steptoe's antitrust group remains committed to the highest level of competence and currency in serving the demands of its antitrust clients.  We provide a full scope antitrust and trade regulation practice, including such areas as traditional business counseling; complex litigation and jury trials; acquisition representation and related transactional services; white collar crime; specialization in various statutory antitrust exemptions; trade association counseling; state antitrust enforcement; and, consumer protection, unfair trade practices and business tort matters.  Steptoe's antitrust lawyers provide this array of substantive areas of expertise both in domestic U.S. and international contexts.

<P>The firm has also built substantial expertise on an industry-specific basis, including virtually every segment and level of the U.S. and global economy -- from the production tier (e.g., steel, automobiles, petroleum production and refining, food processing, defense systems and electronics), through distributive services (e.g., wholesale distribution of groceries, hospital supplies, pharmaceutical products, consumer electronics and various other industrial and consumer goods), to traditional and specialty retailing (e.g., supermarkets, drug store chains, tire and auto parts stores and other specialty retailers).  In addition, our antitrust practice has long included substantial representations in the insurance, telecommunications and transportation industries.

<P>In each instance, and over time, our client specific work includes one or more of the following areas of expertise:

<P><I>Antitrust Business Counseling.</I>  Antitrust business counseling with a corporate client may include, for example: acquisition planning and execution; evaluation of competitive aspects of distribution and supply arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances; technology licensing; franchisor-franchisee relations; management of government enforcement investigations; monitoring of proposed federal legislation affecting competitive positions in the U.S. and abroad; advice relating to trade association activities; and, development of antitrust compliance programs.

<P><I>Complex Antitrust Litigation and Class Actions</I>.  Antitrust litigation invariably is complex, often involving multiple cases, parties and judicial districts.  This, in turn, can require multi-district coordination and experience before the Federal Judicial Panel for Multi-district Litigation.  In addition, private cases are often brought on behalf of an entire class of plaintiffs, allegedly injured by the anticompetitive conduct of defendants.  These cases can present aggregate damage exposure in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Steptoe antitrust litigators have substantial experience with such litigation.  Currently, we are representing a major insurance company in <I>In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation</I>, MDL 767, a treble damages case brought by nineteen state attorney generals.  Steptoe antitrust litigators also represent the world's largest aquaculture farm cooperative in <I>In re Catfish Antitrust Litigation</I>, MDL 928, a treble damages class action brought by a nationwide class of direct purchasers of processed farm-raised catfish products.
<P><I>Criminal Antitrust. </I> The Steptoe & Johnson LLP antitrust group has wide experience representing both corporations and individuals throughout the country in connection with Sherman Act felony investigations.  Our extensive federal grand jury experience includes all pre- and post-indictment phases of criminal antitrust proceedings, as well as the federal, state and private treble damages actions that typically follow a criminal charge.  We also have in-depth experience handling civil fraud actions and administrative suspension and debarment proceedings, which frequently arise when the federal government itself claims to have incurred damages as a result of antitrust violations.
<P><I>Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, Antitrust Division Matters</I>.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys appear before the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and their staffs of attorneys and economists on a regular basis.  The firm's Justice Department practice centers on merger-antitrust (Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification and follow-on investigations) and criminal grand jury investigations conducted by the Division.  A number of Steptoe partners served as FTC officials prior to joining the firm.  These attorneys direct defenses of FTC investigations and adjudications originating both in the FTC's Bureau of Competition (involving traditional antitrust enforcement issues such as competitive evaluation of proposed mergers) and its Bureau of Consumer Protection (including matters such as deceptive advertising claims and other marketing practices directly relating to possible consumer injuries).  Steptoe's FTC and DOJ practices include representation before the headquarter offices in Washington and at regional offices from Seattle to Atlanta.
<P><I>State Antitrust and Trade Regulation Litigation.</I>  Most states have antitrust and trade regulation statutes patterned after the federal Sherman, Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts.  Steptoe & Johnson LLP antitrust litigators actively participate in the defense of such matters in numerous states, both as lead counsel and, on occasion, on a consultative basis with local litigation and corporate counsel.
<P><I>International Antitrust.</I>  Steptoe's antitrust group intersects with the firm's large International Law and Trade Group to produce a truly global antitrust practice.  Serving off-shore clients with U.S. interests, as well as domestic firms with multi-national concerns, Steptoe's antitrust attorneys provide the same range of antitrust business counseling outlined above in the international context.  This includes active involvement in transactions and practices subject to the jurisdiction of such entities as the European Economic Commission and the Japan Fair Trade Commission.  Steptoe's international antitrust merger and acquisition practice also includes Exxon-Florio Act filings and practice before the U.S. Commerce Department in connection with foreign acquisition of U.S. assets.

<TITLE>Steptoe & Johnson LLP/Environmental Law Practice:  Pesticides Registration and Regulations Supplement
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>Steptoe & Johnson LLP</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Environmental Law Practice:</CENTER></H2>
<H2><CENTER>Pesticides Registration and Regulations Supplement</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a nationally known and respected practice in the registration
and regulation of Pesticides products under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and its state
equivalents.  Working with the Chemical Manufacturers
Association's Biocides Program Panel and many individual
registrants, Steptoe has represented the interests of the
industrial biocides industry before EPA, OMB, Congress, courts
and several states.  We have worked on a very wide range of
issues, including registrations, reregistration, data call-ins,
data compensation and FIFRA preemption of state law tort claims.
 In all these activities, Steptoe attorneys work to ensure that
there is rational regulation of this important group of
products, which considers the economics of the industry and the
real health and safety concerns that regulators should address. 

<P>Steptoe also represents individual companies seeking to register
Pesticides products.  We have an expert staff of non-lawyer
specialists in Pesticides matters, who deal with EPA registration
officials virtually every day.  By maintaining constant contact
with EPA's Office of Pesticides Programs, Steptoe has developed a
wealth of experience on the manner in which the registration
process should work and the problems other registrants and
applicants have encountered.  Steptoe's registration specialists
also regularly work with Pesticides regulatory officials in many
states.  

<P>In connection with EPA's Reregistration Program under the 1988
Amendments to FIFRA, Steptoe has been advising registrants, and
groups of registrants formed into data generation "consortiums,"
in responding to the demands of reregistration.  In this area,
we generally work with registrants to determine whether EPA has
properly evaluated existing data, and to ensure that new data
requirements are appropriate for the products and uses involved.


<P>Steptoe is set up to handle contracts among members of a data
development consortium and between a consortium and the testing
laboratories it engages, as well as the financing and
administration aspects of data development.  We currently are
working with registrants on the following data call-ins issued
by EPA:
<dir><LI>Antimicrobial Data Call In, including the ground breaking
antimicrobial applicator exposure assessment<P>
<LI>Inorganic Arsenical Wood Preservative Data Call In<P>
<LI>Chloropicrin Data Call In<P>
<LI>Tributyltin Data Call In<P>
<LI>Copper Naphthenate Data Call In</dir>



<P>Steptoe lawyers also assist Pesticides registrants in the data
compensation activities that have become increasingly important
as the value of data submitted to EPA expands.  We work with our
clients to develop defensible demands for data compensation,
negotiate with follow-on registrants, and handle FIFRA data
compensation arbitrations.



<P>Steptoe also has been very active on Pesticides issues at the
state level.  We coordinated the industrial biocides industry's
response to California's Birth Defects Prevention Act (also
known as SB 950), by developing an approach that responded to
the state's health and safety concerns while minimizing the
additional data requirements imposed on registrants.  Steptoe
also has been active on California's Proposition 65, and on
FIFRA Section 18 registrations and ground water protection fee
programs in several states.  We currently are working on
Pesticides issues in California, Florida, Minnesota, New York,
Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin, and have strong ties with
knowledgeable attorneys in these and other jurisdictions to ensure that both local and national
issues are fully addressed.

<blockquote><center><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/intltrad.htm">International Corporate and Finance Transactions</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/intltrad.htm">International Trade Regulation</a></center></blockquote>
<hr>



<P>Olin Wethington's practice focuses on international corporate and
finance transactions, particularly related to emerging markets in
Latin America, the states of the former Soviet Union, and Asia. 
His practice is also directed to financial firms requiring
regulatory advice in the United States and assistance in accessing
foreign financial markets.  Mr. Wethington returned to Steptoe &
Johnson LLP in March 1993, after having served as Assistant
Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Department of the
Treasury and as Special Assistant to the President at the White
House. </P>

<P>As Assistant Secretary at the Treasury, Mr. Wethington worked to
encourage economic and financial market reform in developing
countries and strengthening of the private sector.  He managed U.S.
participation in the multilateral development banks, including the
World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and served on the Board of
Directors of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
</P>
<P>Mr. Wethington also has been deeply involved in U.S.-Latin American
affairs.  At the White House, he was the chief policy official
responsible for coordinating the development of President Bush's
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI).  After moving to the
Treasury in 1991, he had responsibility for implementing the debt
reduction and investment sector elements of the Initiative, which
were carried out with over a dozen Latin American countries.  He
was closely involved in the Treasury's support of commercial bank
Brady deals in Latin America.  Mr. Wethington was the chief U.S.
negotiator on the financial services chapter of the North American
Free Trade Agreement.</P>

<P>At the Treasury, Mr. Wethington worked on behalf of the
Administration's effort to support economic reform in the states of
the former Soviet Union.  He played a significant role in the U.S.-
led multilateral aid package for Russia in April 1992, was a strong
advocate of expanded technical assistance to Russia to encourage
privatization, and sought to expand Western participation in the
Russian energy sector.  Mr. Wethington is also involved in Steptoe
& Johnson LLP's Russia-related practice, which includes the firm's
affiliate, Steptoe & Johnson International, one of the most
experienced American-affiliate law offices in Moscow.
</P>
<P>At both the White House and the Treasury, Mr. Wethington had
significant responsibilities with respect to U.S. trade and
economic policy toward Asia.  At the Treasury, he was one of the
Administration's lead negotiators on the U.S.-Japan Structural
Impediments Initiative and was responsible for the U.S.-Korea
financial policy talks, the exchange rate discussions with China
and Taiwan, and various financial policy and market access issues
with Japan.</P>

the United States.  In addition, we represent, on a regular
basis, a wide variety of employer sponsors of corporate and
single employer plans (including several members of the Fortune
100), plan participants and beneficiaries, and insurance
companies, investment advisors, trustees, custodians,
recordkeepers and other services providers to employee benefit
plans.


<P>In connection with these representations, Steptoe & Johnson LLP
provides its clients a full range of advisory services.  The
firm regularly renders advice on such matters as benefits
planning, plan qualification, structuring nonqualified deferred
compensation, plan mergers and terminations, workforce
restruct-urings, fiduciary responsibility, prohibited
transactions, investment policies, withdrawal
liability,legislative developments and compliance with ERISA,
the Internal Revenue Code and other regulatory statutes.  We
prepare plan documents, as well as requests for advisory
opinions, rulings, and exemptive relief from the Department of
Labor, Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") and regularly appear before those
agencies on behalf of our clients.  We also are frequent
participants in the legislative process, most often in our
capacity as counsel to the APPWP but for other clients as well,
and thus play a role in formulating policy on employee benefit
issues.  Moreover, we are active in the regulatory process,
providing input in structuring new regulations and changing
existing regulations.  We often work with the Treasury
Department and the IRS in attempting to structure workable rules
for implementation of legislative measures, or to modify
existing regulations to accommodate new workplace structures or
new technologies.

<P>Our ability to provide advice and assistance is enhanced by the
fact that, unlike many firms in the employee benefit plan field,
we have an active ERISA litigation practice.  In this area, the
firm has litigated cases involving issues from the most mundane
to the most significant and complex under ERISA and related
statutes.  For example, we successfully represented major
insurance companies before the United States Supreme Court in two
landmark cases involving the scope of remedies under ERISA and
ERISA's preemption of state law:  <U>Massachusetts Mutual Life v. Russell</U>, 473 U.S. 134 (1985) (holding that
punitive and extra-contractual damages generally unavailable
under ERISA); <U>Pilot Life v. Dedeaux</U>, 481 U.S.
41 (1987) (holding that ERISA preempts the state tort of "bad
faith" in the benefits area and provides the exclusive means for
redressing benefit claim matters). 

<P>The firm furthermore represented the PBGC in connection with the
multi-hundred million dollar claims it asserted in the LTV
bankruptcy.  In connection therewith, we assisted the PBGC with
the litigation and ultimate settlement of these claims in the
bankruptcy proceeding.  We also represented the defendant
pension plans in a complex, multi-party action brought by the
Department of Labor and two participant classes that involved
significant investment-related issues under ERISA's fiduciary
responsibility provisions.  In addition, we recently
successfully represented the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
& Katz before the U.S. Tax Court in a major test case brought by
the Internal Revenue Service, involving the actuarial funding
assumptions used for the Wachtell partners' pension plans and,
ultimately, the deductibility of their plan contributions. 
Furthermore, we are currently representing the administrative
committee of an ESOP in an action brought by the Department of
Labor challenging the financial aspects of an employee buy-out
and merger of two companies. 

<P>Other significant cases that the firm has handled have involved
such matters as fiduciary responsibility, prohibited
transactions, retiree medical obligations, and ERISA's
preemption of state law.  This substantial litigation experience
not only assures our clients effective representation in the
event of court action, but also enables us to bring practical
considerations to bear, particularly with respect to the
avoidance of potential liability and exposure, in providing
advice and counsel on planning matters.

This and other documents on the Steptoe & Johnson LLP web page are not to be treated or relied upon as legal advice or as creating a lawyer-client relationship.  Most materials are not updated, but are maintained on the page because they are nonetheless likely to be of continuing interest. </I></CENTER><P><hr><CENTER><h3>UK Plans for Trusted Third Party Encryption</h3><P><P>by<P><P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm"><I>Stewart Baker</I></A><P></CENTER><P><P><P>
		According to sources within the British government, plans to implement &quot;trusted third party&quot; encryption services are fairly far along, although it is unlikely that any legislation would be introduced prior to the election that will occur within the next nine months.  Since the polls suggest that the election will bring Labour to power for the first time in a decade and a half, it is uncertain what the Labour Government will do about the encryption issue.  But, in the absence of firm policy guidance from political leaders, the permanent UK government seems to be reaching consensus on a plan to encourage but not mandate use of trusted third party encryption services.<P>
<P>
		The forces shaping the debate are similar to those in the United States.  British export controls on encryption are growing increasingly controversial and difficult to maintain.  The expectation that digital commerce will become a major economic force leaves governments reluctant to hamstring their entrants into the race to supply the infrastructure for digital commerce.  At the same time, the UK has a serious current terrorism problem, and it is reluctant to take actions that would make the communications of terrorists easier.  In one respect, the political situation is different from that of the United States, where the encryption debate has tapped a wellspring of &quot;get government off my back&quot; spirit.  The British public is thought to be more willing to accept regulation of encryption, particularly where that might aid the police.<P>
<P>
		In examining their options, it appears that British policymakers have ruled out either a flat ban on the use of encryption, or an effort to license encryption products, hardware, and software, sold to the public.  Similarly, the government seems uninterested in efforts to control the length of encryption keys.<P>
<P>
		British authorities appear to be contemplating a trusted third party encryption system that would be given a jumpstart by tying it to a wide variety of government services and programs, such as the National Health Service.  There is no plan to regulate encryption products.  Mass-market software producers would be free (as at present) to offer strong over-the-counter encryption.  Makers of personal computers and PC cards could apparently do the same.<P>
<P>
		How escrowed encryption will compete with these products remains uncertain.  The British government would apparently prefer to encourage escrowed encryption by &quot;bundling&quot; a variety of trusted third party services together.  Like other European governments, the British have seized on the observation that digital commerce requires an infrastructure of digital signatures, certification authorities, and assorted other services such as time-stamping.  They evidently hope to limit this role to companies that are also prepared to offer encryption and key management services and that are prepared to provide keys to the government when presented with a warrant.<P>
<P>
		Although billed as a trusted third party approach, it seems that the British government is not planning to insist that all parties escrow their keys with a third party.  The plan will allow a significant amount of &quot;self escrow,&quot; at least on the part of large companies that are willing to establish special escrow units that can be walled off from the rest of the company in the event of a criminal investigation of corporate higher-ups.<P>
<P>
		Export controls remain a subject of some controversy within the government.  They have supporters and detractors, but it is not clear how long they can be maintained in the face of aggressive foreign competition.  It is clear, however, that products and services incorporating trusted third party technology will be exportable.  In general, the British government is unlikely to use export controls as a way of achieving domestic encryption standards.  More likely is a form of regulation of encryption services that is designed to meet two goals:  (1) promote consumer welfare by ensuring that parties providing signatures and certifications meet basic standards and (2) to encourage trusted third party encryption.<P>
<P>
		I talked to British government sources about the plan and raised questions about its details.  Some simply have not been worked out.  The effort to create trusted third party services without regulating products is understandable.  The parties most likely to provide encryption services are telecommunications companies and perhaps large computer service companies.  Both of these have long-standing ties and relationships with the government and are likely to find a way to work cooperatively with the government if the government is firm in its intent.<P>
<P>
		Regulating products, on the other hand, would mean picking a fight with the large and aggressive retail software industry, as well as directly affecting purchases by individuals.  It would also expose regulators to the criticism that they are regulating software sold in stores but are unable to prevent downloading of free and unescrowed encryption software from anonymous sites in Finland and the like.  Nonetheless, free competition between unescrowed products and escrow services may raise problems for the government plan.  Trusted third party encryption is not free.  The UK government will likely have to bear some of the costs of maintaining a trusted third party infrastructure, or encryption users and providers will have an incentive to avoid escrowed encryption and instead use encryption products in order to minimize costs.  It is not clear how the government plans to deal with that possibility other than to note that products cannot provide up-to-date certification and other services.<P>
<P>
		Even with respect to third-party services, it is not clear how the government will deal with &quot;unbundling.&quot;  Certification services probably have fewer infrastructure costs than trusted third party encryption.  There may be a temptation, therefore, on the part of consumers (and service suppliers) to use (and provide) only certification rather than encryption services.  It is not clear whether the British government intends to prohibit unbundling, discourage it through regulatory action, or simply hope that it doesn't happen.<P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><hr><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart Baker</A> has an international and technology law practice in Washington.

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/International Arbitration Practice
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>


<H2><CENTER>International Arbitration Practice</CENTER></H2>



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a long history of involvement in dispute resolution and
international arbitration on behalf of U.S. and foreign clients.

<P>The firm's excellent reputation for providing service in
international trade and business transactions, its strong
litigation capability, and its expertise on numerous public
international law issues (particularly sovereign immunity, act
of state doctrine, and investment protection) have together
allowed Steptoe to remain one of the premier firms for handling
international commercial disputes.



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have a wide range of experience
before the principal arbitral forums of the world, as advisors,
counsel and members of the arbitrator rosters.  These include
proceedings under the United Nations' UNCITRAL Rules,
party-designed "ad hoc" rules, as well as various
internationally recognized arbitration centers, including the
American Arbitration Association, the International Chamber of
Commerce, the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal, the Foreign Trade
Arbitration Commission, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in
the Hague, the Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation,
the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, the International Centre for
the Settlement of Investment Disputes, and the U.S.-Canada
Bi-National Free Trade Agreement Panels.



<P>The firm's expertise stems back to the early 1960s, when it was
active in assisting U.S. clients to pursue claims against the
Cuban government after the expropriation of investments by the
Castro regime.  <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/leigh.htm">Monroe Leigh</a>, a former Legal Adviser in the U.S.
State Department, and currently a senior partner in the
international group, was one of the chief architects of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the principal U.S. legislation
for pursuing claims against foreign governments.



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP was deeply involved in a number of
arbitrations before the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal, located in
the Hague.  The firm successfully represented a large number of
U.S. companies in pursuing contract and investment claims
against the Iranian government.  A number of current partners
were responsible for pursuing the largest private commercial
claim before this Tribunal -- the Oil Consortium Claim,
involving many of the major U.S. petroleum companies and
complicated issues of liability and damage valuation.



<P>The firm's clients in international arbitration matters have
ranged from small companies and individuals to major energy,
banking, construction, defense, and supply companies operating
around the world.  A few additional representative cases include:
<DIR><LI>A major U.S. oil company in an arbitration against the
Government of Libya;
<LI>A large U.S. construction company in an ad hoc UNCITRAL
arbitration against the Egyptian government;<P>
<LI>A producer of medical equipment in connection with settling an
arbitral dispute with the World Bank involving a transaction in
the Russian Federation; <P>

<LI>The Canadian forest industry in a U.S.-Canada binational
proceeding against U.S. lumber manufacturers;<P>
<LI>A major Russian petroleum producer in an ad hoc UNCITRAL
arbitration in Sweden involving a German machinery manufacturer; <P>

<LI>Numerous U.S. energy, engineering and consumer products
companies in connection with filing claims with the U.N. Claims
Commission for damages arising from the Persian Gulf Conflict;<P>
<LI>A political subdivision and ethnic community in connection
with a high-level dispute concerning sovereignty over an island; and<P>
<LI>A major multi-national refiner and chemical producer in
obtaining resolution of its claims for expropriated property
against the Government of Vietnam.</DIR>



<P>The arbitrations handled by Steptoe & Johnson LLP have involved a
full range of complex international and commercial issues,
including nationalization, creeping expropriation, boundary
disputes, governmental breach of contracts, the proper standard
of valuation and compensation, fraudulent credit documents,
non-payment or non-delivery of goods, wrongful death, and
foreign publishing rights.  



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has also advised clients, including U.S.
government agencies and negotiators, on issues ancillary to
international investment protection and dispute resolution.  A
few of the more salient areas where Steptoe's expertise has been
sought out and utilized are:  foreign sovereign immunity and
waivers; enforcement of foreign arbitral and judicial awards;
the law of expropriation and valuation; exhaustion of local
remedies; immunity from suit of international organizations; and
organization and standards of conduct for international arbitral
tribunals.



<P>The firm provides to its clients a comprehensive range of
dispute resolution support, including organizing and marshalling
documentary and testimonial evidence, working with experts and
witnesses, crafting legal arguments based on relevant national
and international law, presentations at hearings, negotiation
and assistance with settlements, and the execution and
enforcement of arbitral awards.



<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have written articles, presented
seminars, and published treatises in the area of international
arbitration.  Among the publications are a book-length series of
articles comprehensively analyzing the application of UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, a succession of annual reports on the cases
of the Moscow Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission, a treatise
on international economic arbitration, and numerous articles. 
Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have lectured and presented papers
at U.S. and European universities, as well as for the American
Arbitration Association, the Institute of Transnational
Arbitration, and the Moscow Conference on Law and Economic
Relations.



<P>The firm's philosophy and approach in assisting clients is to
develop strategies and methods to avoid disputes at the outset,
and to vigorously represent clients when disputes become
unavoidable.  The firm can assist clients in devising
contractual mechanisms to avoid disputes or to encourage
effective mediation or conciliation prior to arbitration.  Our
experience with actual arbitrations has provided a practical
perspective on how to structure an arbitration agreement in
order to be enforceable and beneficial to the client.  Careful
planning is required to deal with such issues as
unenforceability of an arbitration clause or award, foreign
sovereign immunity defenses, inconsistent local law, and harmful
choice of law.  When pursuing claims on behalf of clients, the
firm's professionals work closely and cooperatively with
in-house counsel and client representatives to achieve the
maximum satisfaction in a cost-efficient manner.


<P>The following Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorneys have had significant
experience representing clients with respect to international
arbitrations.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/leigh.htm">Monroe Leigh</a>, Legal Adviser of the Department of State from 1975

arbitration claims on behalf of major multinational companies. 
He has served, at the request of the appointing authority under
the UNCITRAL Rules, as a party-appointed arbitrator in a dispute
arising out of an alleged expropriation and contract breach by a
West African government.  From 1975 to 1980 he was a standing
member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/baker.htm">Stewart Baker's</a> practice covers international arbitration,
international trade and appellate litigation.  He has handled
the arbitration of claims exceeding one billion dollars.  He is
an organizer of the arbitration programs of the Institute for

UNICITRAL arbitration rules.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/olmstead.htm">Cecil J. Olmstead</a> advises with respect to international law and
international trade and investment matters and is a leading
expert in the field of international arbitration.  He has been
involved with numerous arbitrations particularly involving the
nationalization of U.S. oil company development operations in
foreign countries.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/hochberg.htm">Sheldon E. Hochberg's</a> arbitration experience includes
representation of a major U.S. oil company in extensive
arbitration with Libya over several years.  This arbitration
involved claims of several million dollars and counterclaims
exceeding one billion.  He has also been involved in other major
international arbitrations involving the oil industry.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/krauland.htm">Edward J. Krauland</a> has represented clients in arbitrations
involving a foreign government's breach of military procurement
contracts and expropriation of a U.S. food products company's
foreign affiliate.  He recently represented a Russian petroleum
producer in arbitral proceedings against a German machine
manufacturer.  Mr. Krauland has also represented U.S. clients in
American Arbitration Association proceedings and frequently advises
clients on dispute resolution issues in contractual and
investment transactions.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/novick.htm">Robert Novick</a> has represented multinational companies in
complex arbitrations before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal.  The
primary issues included questions of nationalization,
government breach of international contracts, the proper
valuation of expropriated assets, and sovereign immunity.  He
actively participated in preparation of the claims for Iran's
nationalization of oil concessions and counterclaims arising out
of oil company operations in Iran.  He has published on the
subject of sovereign immunity.



<P><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/moran.htm">Mark Moran</a> has assisted in representing petroleum companies in
arbitration proceedings in the Hague.  He has represented a
major U.S. construction company in ad hoc arbitration against a
foreign government under the UNCITRAL rules.  Recently, Mr.
Moran has successfully pursued multiple appeals to the
U.S.-Canada binational panel on a trade dispute involving the
Canadian softwood lumber industry.<p><p><blockquote><CENTER><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pgatoc.htm">Practice Areas Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/sjbios.htm">Attorney Bios</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/welcome.htm">Home Page</a></CENTER></body></html>

<TITLE>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP/Corporate/Securities Practice
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Corporate/Securities Practice</CENTER></H2>

</B></I>Steptoe &amp; Johnson has an active practice in all areas of corporate/securities transactions, litigation and counseling.  The discussion below highlights particular areas of the firm's corporate/securities practice and summarizes certain recent representations.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Securities Offerings<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson represents issuers, underwriters and investors in public offerings and private placements of securities issued by corporations, partnerships, trusts, pooled investment funds, options funds and other investment vehicles. The firm's recent representations include a $270 million equity offering and a $200 million debt offering on behalf of Burlington Northern, Inc.; an $83 million initial public offering of common stock by BET Holdings, Inc., the parent of Black Entertainment Television; a $140 million public offering of senior secured notes by Inter-City Products Corporation (USA); and a $25 million public offering of common stock by Hooper-Holmes, Inc. <P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Acquisitions, Mergers <P>
and Restructurings<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson represents both purchasers and sellers in stock and asset acquisitions.  The firm recently represented Plaid Holdings Corp. in its acquisition of the men's tailored clothing business of Crystal Brands, Inc. for $50 million; Swissair in its $194 million acquisition of Delta Airlines stock; Haka Oy, a major Finnish construction company, in the acquisition of a major minority interest in a U.S. construction company; Seikaguku Corporation, a Japanese pharmaceuticals manufacturer, in its acquisition of a U.S. company; and Troy Chemical Corporation in its acquisition of 40% of the stock of a Spanish chemical manufacturer.  <P>
<P>
The firm has also represented Inter-City Products as SEC counsel in its sale of two business divisions for $700 million; Advanced Technology, Inc. in its acquisition by Emhart Corporation for $140 million; Computer Entry Systems Corporation in its acquisition by BancTec, Inc. for $42 million; Program Resources, Inc. in its acquisition by Dyncorp; Scitec, Inc. in its acquisition by TRW, Inc.; and CNW Corporation as ICC and special corporate counsel in its acquisition by Blackstone Group for $3.5 billion. <P>
<P>
The firm also counsels corporations involved in recapitalizations, stock repurchase and self-tender offers, exchange offers, reverse mergers, asset dispositions and debt restructuring.  The firm assisted Burlington Northern in a $130 million exchange offer and consent solicitation and a $34 million debt-for-debt swap, and represented Inter-City Products Corporation (USA) in the negotiation of a $135 million purchase facility from an international consortium of banks as part of a refinancing transaction.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Commercial Financing<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson represents lenders, borrowers and other participants in commercial financing transactions.  The firm provides advice in project financing, equipment financing, international financing, nonstandard collateral financing, agricultural financing, construction financing, real estate financing, leveraged sale-leaseback transactions and interest and usury issues.  <P>
<P>
Steptoe &amp; Johnson frequently represents parties in the financing of electric power generation and other utility facilities through venture capital as well as taxable and tax-exempt revenue bond offerings and the refinancing and restructuring of long-term utility debt through registered public securities offerings and private placements.  For example, Steptoe &amp; Johnson structured the refinancing by rural electric utilities of $1.7 billion in long-term, fixed-rate Federal Financing Bank loans with private loans guaranteed by the United States.<P>
<P>
The firm also has a special expertise in the leveraged leasing area, including the sale and leaseback of electric generating facilities, transportation facilities, computer equipment, and construction, manufacturing and business equipment.  Two recent representations include the sale-leaseback of a $625 million lignite-fired, steam electric unit and the sale-leaseback of a $190 million partial interest in a coal-fired steam electric generating station.<P>
<P>
The firm has also represented several publicly - owned venture capital companies that provide financing to new and emerging companies throughout the United States.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Joint Ventures<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson is actively involved in assisting U.S. and foreign clients to establish joint ventures. For example, the firm has represented Kodak, Honeywell, Merck, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in connection with joint ventures or investments in Eastern Europe, and has represented Teijin Chemical Company (Japan) in the negotiation of joint venture agreements with U.S. chemical companies.  The firm also represents U.S. and foreign clients entering into manufacturing, supply, distribution and operating agreements.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Securities Litigation<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson litigates securities cases in federal and state courts nationwide. <P>
<P>
The firm has an active securities fraud litigation practice, and has represented defendants in several major consolidated securities fraud class actions, including the Drexel Burnham litigation and the Bolar Pharmaceutical litigation in New York.  The firm currently represents a major bank holding company in a class action brought by a former shareholder of an acquired bank.<P>
<P>
The firm has also represented clients in litigation involving such issues as lender liability and enforcement of stock conversion rights and represents the litigation committee of the board of directors of a publicly traded company in several shareholder derivative actions. <P>
<P>
The firm has developed a special expertise in representing lawyers and law firms accused of negligent or intentional participation in frauds relating to securities offerings, ranging from private placements of limited partnership interests to public municipal bond offerings.  <P>
<P>
Finally, Steptoe &amp; Johnson counsels and represents takeover targets,<P>
shareholder groups, prospective acquirors and independent directors in proxy contests and battles for corporate control, developing and executing both offensive and defensive measures.  <P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Securities and Exchange <P>
Commission Proceedings<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson defends companies and individuals in SEC investigations, civil enforcement actions and administrative proceedings relating to alleged breaches of the federal securities laws.  The firm has recently represented NYSE companies in SEC investigations relating to adequacy of corporate disclosures and accounting issues, corporate officers accused of financial fraud and insider trading, and investors who were allegedly &quot;tippees&quot; of inside information regarding material corporate events. The firm also represents clients in NASD enforcement proceedings.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Internal Corporate Investigations<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>The firm conducts internal investigations on behalf of corporations regarding potential financial fraud and/or self-dealing by corporate officers and advises corporations regarding related federal securities law disclosure obligations.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>White-Collar Practice<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Because securities fraud litigation and SEC proceedings may have criminal implications, one of Steptoe &amp; Johnson's special advantages in these areas is our strong expertise in white-collar crime.  A former federal prosecutor heads the firm's white-collar practice.  He has substantial experience in defending corporations and individuals in white-collar criminal investigations involving securities and RICO allegations.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Financial Institutions<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>The firm is actively involved in the financial institutions area.  The firm assists clients with mergers, acquisitions and changes in control of financial institutions and counsels financial institutions and their officers and directors in regulatory compliance and enforcement matters.  The firm has served as counsel to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution Trust Corporation on a wide range of counseling and transactional matters and represented both FDIC and RTC in litigation.  The firm represented RTC in connection with formation of several private/governmental partnerships and their acquisition of $1.28 billion and $450 million portfolios of real estate and real estate related loans. <P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Counseling<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>The firm advises clients on a broad range of corporate/securities issues, including all aspects of compliance with federal and state securities laws and state corporate laws.  Recent issues the firm has addressed include resales of restricted securities, disclosure of material corporate events, fiduciary obligations of directors, insider reporting obligations under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and proxy requirements relating to executive compensation and shareholder communications.  The firm has expertise under all federal securities statutes, including the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act.  The firm also negotiates, prepares and reviews all types of corporate and commercial contracts.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Arbitration<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>The firm conducts an active practice in the area of arbitration of securities transactions.  We represent broker-dealers against claims brought by their customers in binding NASD arbitration proceedings, and several of our partners have served as arbitrators in proceedings for the NASD, the American Arbitration Association and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Corporate/Securities Partners<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson has a strong group of partners with substantial experience in the corporate/ securities area.  Several of these partners have previously served in various capacities at the Securities and Exchange Commission. <P>

</H3></B></CENTER><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER></B><h2>Railroad Transportation<P>
</H2></B></CENTER><P>
Steptoe &amp; Johnson has a distinguished practice in the area of railroad transportation.  Led by Betty Jo Christian, former Vice-Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission and Edmund Burke, former Executive Vice President Law and Government Affairs of Burlington Northern Railroad, a multi-talented team of Steptoe transportation lawyers regularly represents or counsels major railroads, regional and short-line carriers, start-up carriers, shippers, ports, state governments and other transportation players.  We practice extensively before the Surface Transportation Board, the Department of Transportation, federal district courts and courts of appeals, state appellate courts and the Supreme Court.  Steptoe attorneys have been prominently involved in many of the agency and court proceedings that have shaped the railroad industry since the Staggers Act of 1980.  Our expertise spans such areas of transportation law as economic and rate regulation, contract litigation and arbitration, antitrust, railway labor and employer liability matters, safety and drug testing.   Our clients prize our knowledge of the industry's economic and competitive characteristics.  This knowledge has enabled us to obtain favorable results for our clients in regulatory and other contexts involving complex economic issues.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Economic Regulation<P>
</CENTER></B><P>
<B><I>Rail transactions</I>.</B>  Our experience runs through the entire range of transactions requiring Board approval -- from mergers or consolidations between major railroads through short line sales to abandonment and construction projects.  We recently represented Burlington Northern in its successful effort to obtain the approval of the former Interstate Commerce Commission for its consolidation with Santa Fe -- the largest railroad transaction ever to have been approved by the Commission.  We guided BN through a multi-month merger proceeding that involved thousands of pages of economic testimony and dozens of protesting parties.  In that process, we successfully opposed most of the requests made by those parties for the imposition of burdensome conditions on the transaction.  We have also participated in most other significant rail merger proceedings of recent years, such as the acquisitions by Union Pacific of Chicago &amp; North Western (in 1995) and Missouri-Kansas-Texas (in 1988).  In the latter proceeding, we helped a short-line railroad obtain a major concession from the merger applicants.  In 1989, we obtained Commission exemption for the acquisition of CNW by Blackstone Capital Partners, after CNW had fought off one of the few hostile takeover attempts in the history of the industry.<P>
<P>
<B><I>Short lines.</B></I>  We have been active in the vibrant area of short line sales.  We have participated in major line sale programs, such as the sale of substantial parts of Illinois Central's network in the 1980s.  More recently, we have participated in the regulatory review of the Alameda Corridor transit project. We have made new law in the area of trackage rights that accompany a line sale and have developed specialized expertise in the area of labor protection, where the law has changed dramatically with the ICC Termination Act of 1995. We regularly advise short-line railroads on the structure of line sales, leases, trackage and operating agreements.<P>
<P>
<B><I>Trackage compensation.</B></I>  We have a thorough understanding of the complex methods for determining the rental due for the use of one railroad's tracks by another railroad.  We have advised several clients, including most recently a state-owned entity leasing its line to a major railroad, on these complex methods.<P>
<P>
<B><I>Line construction and abandonment.</B></I>  We have obtained approval for several construction projects and assisted in the process of environmental review necessary for these projects.  We have made new law on the question of a railroad's authority to build a line that crosses another rail line.  We have represented both shippers and railroads in abandonment proceedings.  Recently, we vigorously contested on behalf of a shipper the abandonment of a rail line that provided the only rail service to a major plant in Maine.  This made possible a negotiated solution that preserved rail service to the plant.  <P>
<P>
<B><I>Rate proceedings.</B></I>  We have participated in most major rate proceedings since the Staggers Act and are currently representing 26 rail carriers in a multiple-defendant rate proceeding before the STB.  Through those proceedings, we have gained a firm command of the intricacies of the market dominance concept that triggers STB rate reasonableness jurisdiction and the extremely complicated constrained market pricing standard and &quot;stand-alone cost&quot; methodology that is used by the Board to evaluate rate reasonableness.  We successfully challenged the Commission's use of a rate standard other than constrained market pricing in a major case before the court of appeals, and also successfully challenged the authority of the ICC or STB to order a railroad to publish a tariff prior to a shipper's actual need for the transportation.  <P>
<P>
<B><I>Rulemaking Proceedings.</B></I>  We have taken a leading role in representing the railroad industry in numerous agency rulemaking proceedings, such as those involving car hire rules and rate reasonableness standards.  Our in-depth knowledge of the industry and our familiarity with ICC and STB policy are particularly valuable to clients in this type of policy-making context.  <P>
<P>
<B><I>The ICC Termination Act of 1995.</B></I>  We have pioneered the analysis of the many important changes brought about by the 1995 ICCTA.  Attorneys in our Transportation Group prepared an overview and section-by-section analysis of the ICCTA which was distributed by a major transportation organization to all of its members, and we have been actively involved in speaking and writing about the new statute.  In addition to counseling clients on the implications of the new Act for railroad activities and the structure of rail transactions, we recently obtained a landmark decision from a state appellate court ruling that all state regulation of matters such as agency closings have been preempted by the new federal law.  <P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Safety Regulation<P>
</CENTER></B><P>
Steptoe attorneys have an in-depth understanding of the safety requirements imposed by the Federal Railroad Administration and regularly counsel start-up carriers with respect to compliance with FRA requirements.  We have also been actively involved in litigation concerning the preemptive effect of FRA regulations with respect to state laws in such areas as caboose requirements, walkway regulations, and grade crossing protection.  <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Contract Disputes<P>
</CENTER></B><P>
We have represented railroads in numerous contract disputes with shippers before federal and state courts and arbitration panels.  Because of our in-depth knowledge of rate matters, we have developed a special expertise in disputes relating to rate contracts between railroads and shippers.  Recently we obtained a favorable decision in a suit brought by a utility involving the interpretation of a provision of a rate contract in which hundreds of millions of dollars were at stake.  We successfully persuaded a jury that the utility had failed to prove its case with respect to its major claims, and obtained an appellate reversal on the one issue in which the jury had found in favor of the utility, resulting in a total victory for the railroad.  <P>
<P>
We have also developed significant expertise in the interpretation of leases and other agreements between railroads, including the background of arcane provisions of various 19th century agreements.  We have successfully represented smaller railroads in arbitration proceedings involving the interpretation of century-old agreements.  We have also represented railroads in negotiations with respect to the renewal of such agreements upon their expiration.  <P>
<P>
The expertise we have acquired in contract litigation and arbitration is also valuable to our clients in the negotiation context.  We regularly assist both carriers and shippers in drafting contract provisions, trackage rights agreements, leases, operating agreements, settlement agreements and similar documents. <P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Railway Labor Act<P>
</CENTER></B><P>
Our attorneys have substantial experience in interpreting, applying and litigating the Railway Labor Act.  We have handled a broad range of RLA issues, including representation and bargaining issues, grievance handling and arbitrations, injunctions and strikes.  We have also been involved in the front-line issues in the rapid evolution of the industry since deregulation, including employee drug testing, secondary strikes, and bargaining and representation issues arising from acquisitions and rail line sales.  Our attorneys regularly provide advice on the labor aspects of proposed transactions and management programs, including labor protection issues arising under the former Interstate Commerce Act and the ICC Termination Act.  <P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Trial, Appellate and Supreme Court Litigation</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
Steptoe &amp; Johnson's attorneys have litigated a wide range of rail-related issues in the state and federal courts, including antitrust, complex contract claims, constitutional challenges to state legislation, Indian law issues, federal preemption issues, statutory interpretation issues, and RICO defense. Well known for our specialization in appellate matters, we have participated in a number of recent Supreme Court cases involving rail issues, including state taxation of railroads, state venue laws, creation of short-line carriers, and regulation of employee drug use.

</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Environmental Law Practice: <br>
Defense of Environmental Criminal Matters Supplement</CENTER></h2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has a national practice in defense of white collar criminal
matters generally, and environmental crimes in particular. 
Steptoe attorneys include former federal prosecutors from a wide
variety of backgrounds, including the Department of Justice's
Environmental Crimes Section and several U.S. Attorney's
offices.  Steptoe attorneys defend both corporate and individual
clients against alleged environmental, health and safety-related
criminal matters, at both the state and federal levels. 

<P>Among the matters in which the firm recently has been involved
are the following:
<ul><LI>Defense of a company under investigation for alleged burning
of hazardous wastes without required permits;<P>
<LI>Defense of an individual accused of hazardous waste violations;<P>
<LI>Defense of an employee of a large company suspected of
violations of an applicable NPDES permit;<P>
<LI>Defense of individuals accused of fraud in the testing of
generic drugs;<P>
<LI>Representation of employees of a drug manufacturer in
connection with a grand jury investigation of the manufacturer.</ul>

<P>The firm's strong background in both criminal law and the
underlying substantive areas have combined to provide the best
possible representation in these cases.  In this context, the
firm has developed an expertise in application of the new
Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations to environmental
offenses and investigations, has commented upon the draft
Sentencing Guidelines for Environmental Crimes, and has worked
with clients to assess the adequacy of the clients' compliance
programs under the Sentencing Guidelines.  

<P>In addition, the firm has served as counsel to corporate clients
conducting independent reviews of the adequacy of their
environmental compliance systems.  Among our recent projects in
this area are compliance system investigations for a major
electronics manufacturer, a petrochemical manufacturer and a
chemical manufacturer.<p><blockquote><CENTER><a href="http://www.steptoe.com/environ.htm">Environmental Law Practice Area Description</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/pgatoc.htm">Practice Areas Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/sjbios.htm">Attorney Bios</a> | <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/welcome.htm">Home Page</a></CENTER></body></html>

<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>

<H2><CENTER>Electric Power Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP's electric power lawyers represent a number of major electric utility
companies in a wide range of subject areas, and also assist the
owners and financiers of non-utility generators of electricity.

<P>The firm represents its clients in all aspects of practice
before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"),
including transmission, power contract, and rate matters and
merger approvals. It represents a number of electric utilities
in rate and other ongoing regulatory matters before the FERC,
and is involved in rate and other regulatory matters before
state regulatory commissions.  Attorneys in the firm's electric
power group served as FERC and antitrust counsel to the
applicant (i.e., acquiring) utilities in the three most recent
contested merger hearings before the FERC (including Entergy's
recently completed acquisition of Gulf States Utilities Co.). 

<P>The firm's electric power lawyers assist clients in the
negotiation and approval of contracts for large wholesale power
and transmission service sales and in development of the
contractual documents that serve as the basis for development
and financing of joint generation and transmission ventures.

<P>The firm provides antitrust advice and representation to firms
in the electric power, natural gas, andnuclear energy
industries, including participation in antitrust litigation in
the federal courts and in matters, including merger clearances
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, before the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice.  This includes assistance with merger and acquisition
and diversification issues, as well as transmission and
wholesale power issues.  Senior lawyers in the group also have
assisted clients in commercial negotiations and disputes, and
assumed the lead role in complex commercial litigation.


<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP assists utilities, non-utility generators,
and financiers of electric power projects in regulatory and
contract matters arising out of non-utility generation projects.
 These include regulatory matters under the Public Utilities
Regulatory Policies Act, the Public Utility Holding Company Act
("PUHCA"), and the newly enacted National Energy Policy Act. 
The firm also advises electric power clients more generally
concerning regulatory matters arising under PUHCA.

<P>The electric power practice is led by <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/bouknigh.htm">J.A. ("Lon") Bouknight, Jr.</a> Other senior partners are <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/green.htm">Douglas G. Green</a> and <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/raskin.htm">David B. Raskin</a>.  <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/vasile.htm">James B. Vasile</a> heads up the firm's non-utility
generation and hydroelectric power practices. Major clients
include:  Florida Power & Light Co., Southern California Edison
Co., Entergy, Potomac Electric Power Co., Public Service Electric & Gas Co., Carolina Power & Light Co.,
ESI Energy, Inc., and Idaho Power Co.<p>

They do so nationally and internationally for a broad range of clients.  Our representations involve litigating, settling, prosecuting, counseling, auditing planning, licensing, exporting, teaming, joint venturing and regulation.

<BODY><H3><CENTER>STEPTOE & JOHNSON LLP
</CENTER></H3>


<H2><CENTER>Immigration Law Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>Steptoe & Johnson LLP has an extensive immigration and citizenship practice, covering a
full range of issues under relevant U.S. statutes administered
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department
of State, U.S. Information Agency, and the U.S. Department of
Labor.  The firm has handled all aspects of the numerous
business-related visas available to companies seeking to employ
foreign nationals for their U.S. operations.  We have counselled
clients on U.S. naturalization procedures, citizenship laws,
U.S. citizenship by descent, expatriation of U.S. citizenship,
employer sanctions and employment authorization compliance
matters.  

<P>The firm successfully has handled numerous administrative
appeals, motions to reopen or reconsider, federal district court
litigation, political asylum cases, and other controversy work
involving the INS, State Department and Labor Department.  We
have handled cases involving companies located throughout the
United States, as well as foreign nationals from twenty or more
different countries.

<P>The firm is expert and has extensive experience in handling L
(intracompany transferee), E (treatytrader/investor), H
(temporary worker), B1 (visitor for business), J (exchange
visitor), F (student) and TN (Free Trade Agreement) visa cases. 
The firm also represents individuals and companies in efforts to
obtain immigrant visas, based on sponsorship from U.S.
employers.  This work includes Labor Department labor
certifications, adjustment of status applications, visa
processing abroad, and naturalization applications.  These cases
often are follow-on representations to previous, successful
non-immigrant visa applications.

<P>The philosophy of the firm's immigration practice is to present
thoroughly documented and well-researched and argued visa
petitions and applications to U.S. government authorities.  Our
objective in any immigration matter is to obtain a positive
response in an expedited timeframe.  The firm believes in
working with its clients in structuring business transactions
and corporate relationships that anticipate and effectively deal
with U.S. visa/ immigration issues before they present problems
to the client.

<P>The principal attorneys of Steptoe & Johnson LLP's immigration
practice are:

<UL><FONT COLOR="03056B"><FONT SIZE=3>Elan is an NYSE listed global organisation  of over 1,200 skilled people which spent US$68 million during 1995 on research and development of drug delivery technology and products.<P>
Elan has rolled back the feasibility thresholds in drug delivery. Throughout it's 26 year history Elan has broken new ground with products such as Tetrabid&reg;, Theolan&reg; and Duranol&reg; in the '70s, Cardizem&reg; SR, Verelan&reg; and Nifelan&reg; in the '80s and Cardizem&reg; CD, ProStep&reg;, Naprelan&reg; and Theodur&reg; paediatric to date in the '90s.<P>
Elan has achieved a pre-eminent status as a technological innovator, a dynamic developer of new product formulations and a world-class manufacturer of cost-effective new pharmaceutical therapies. 
Elan has achieved many firsts in drug delivery.<P>

<BR Clear=All>
Elan's success in achieving "firsts" has added up  to 22 new products in over 40 of the world's markets and billions of dollars in additional sales revenues for our partners. Elan's "firsts" have also meant that many excellent therapeutic agents can be utilized more effectively in patients, extending the life cycle for drug products and adding efficiencies across the medical cost-spectrum.<P>
Elan's "firsts" have meant that patients benefit in many ways - and by getting a better therapeutic response, by finding it easier to take their medication, by experiencing less side effects and by taking less drug less frequently.<P>
Elan will continue to lead the way in the field of conventional oral and transdermal drug delivery 
as it has since 1969, and is now also on the threshold of taking drug delivery into a whole new realm of scientific and therapeutic application, of meeting a new array of biomedical challenges, and ultimately of bringing sophisticated, yet viable and effective new cures to those who need them most - patients.<P>

<p>
<br>

<a href="#table">Consolidated Balance Sheet</a>

<p>
<br>

Dear Shareholders,

<p>
<br>
I am pleased to report to you an increase in net income of 51% to $27,982,000 and earnings per share by 30% to $0.34 for the quarter ended 30th June.<P>
<br><P>
Total revenue for the first quarter was $67,620,000, an increase of 39% from $48,691,000 in the first quarter of the previous year. Revenue from product sales rose 50% to $33,301,000 from $22,186,000 for the quarter, largely reflecting the launch of Naprelan&reg; in the United States in April 1996.<P>
<br>
Royalties and fees in the quarter were $22,155,000, up from $17,503,000 in the first quarter of last year. Licence and option fees reflected 6 new agreements entered into during the quarter and revenue from agreements where milestone payments were earned in the quarter.<P>
<br>
Research revenues increased to $12,164,000 for the quarter from $9,002,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996. Research revenues included $10,596,000 received from Advanced Therapeutic Systems Limited, up from $6,391,000, reflecting a high level of payments for external work done on behalf of ATS in the quarter.<P>
<br>
The gross margin declined reflecting, primarily, the significant increase in funded research projects for which no milestone payments were achieved, and the early stages of production and the large quantities of samples of Naprelan&reg;.<P>
<br>
Unfunded research and development expenditures declined to $5,511,000 from $6,608,000 in the first quarter of the previous year reflecting the launch of products over the preceding 12 months.<P>
<br>
Interest and other income increased by 64% to $7,006,000 from $4,265,000 reflecting primarily higher levels of cash and cash equivalents in the current quarter compared to the previous year.<P>
<br>
This was an extremely important quarter in the long-term development of Elan. The approval of the merger with Athena Neurosciences during the quarter, and its completion on July 1, 1996, brings important new capabilities to Elan. For the first time, Elan will have drug discovery research and sales and marketing capability in its chosen therapeutic niche of diseases of the central nervous system. The results to June 30 do not, of course, reflect in any way the effect or benefits of the merger. The results of Athena will be consolidated from July 1.<P>
<br>
The launch of Naprelan in the United States in April by our licensing partner, the Wyeth-Ayerst division of American Home Products Corporation was a major event for the company. Naprelan continues to build market share and is well placed to become a major product in its category. The progress of Cardizem CD and Verelan is also very satisfactory in difficult market conditions. We are excited about the opportunities 
for our products in the Far East, particularly in Japan.<P>
<br>
I am optimistic about the challenges and prospects facing the enlarged Elan Corporation. The combination of our leading edge position as preferred industry partner for drug delivery technologies supported by a strong cash flow and balance sheet leaves Elan well positioned to maximise future opportunities.<P>
<br>
As previously announced, we have changed the reporting currency from Irish pounds to U.S. dollars with effect from April 1, 1996. The company's fiscal year also changed from March 31 to December 31. Therefore, for 1996 the company will report a shortened fiscal period from April 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996. Also, on August 15 the stock split was implemented (following its approval at the stockholder meeting on June 27) and the per share numbers give effect to this charge.<P>

<p>
<br>

Sincerely yours<P>

<body background="images/paper1.gif" TEXT="#03056b"><P>
<A HREF="index.html"><img border=0 SRC="images/elnmain.gif" WIDTH=525 HEIGHT=75 ISMAP USEMAP="index.html"></A><P>
<IMG SRC="images/techno.gif" WIDTH=525 HEIGHT=47><P>
<UL><FONT COLOR="03056B"><FONT SIZE=3>Elan's  unique and innovative drug delivery technologies provide the framework to meet the formidable challenges of delivering complex peptide and protein molecules, of targeting therapy to distinct tissues and cells, of tailoring pharmacological intervention to individual patient biorhythms and response-peaks. Much of Elan's technology base in this field has already entered clinical trials and we expect to register and introduce  to the market in conjunction with our partners, several innovative products by the end of this decade - we intend  to be first to do so.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>PANODERM&reg; XL</b><P></I>Transcutaneous Macromolecule Delivery</i></ul></ul><P>
Panoderm XL is Elan's patch technology that delivers drug through a concealed miniature probe which penetrates the stratum corneum. Panoderm XL is fully disposable and and is programmed to deliver drugs to preset bolus, continuous or pulsed regimen, or a combination thereof, delivering for up to 72 hours. The complexity of the device is hidden from the patient and is simple to use.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>PANODERM&reg;</b><P></I>Electro-Transdermal Drug Delivery</i></ul></ul><P>
Transdermal delivery is a more acceptable alternative to parenteral therapy for drugs where oral administration is not viable. Few compounds, however, will permeate the skin passively. Elan's PANODERM technology overcomes these barriers through the use of a low level electric current to transport the drug through the skin. Elan has completed phase I testing of products such as fentanyl, hydromorphone, calcitonin and LHRH.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>PANOJECT&reg;</b><P></I>Subcutaneous Micro-infusion Delivery</i></ul></ul><P>
Panoject is a low cost lightweight pump designed for continuous or intermittent subcutaneous delivery of small volume injectables (20 ml) for up to 72 hours. Panoject is a two-component system comprising of a reusable control unit which fits over a disposable cartridge containing  the drug solution and is attached to the body via an adhesive base or strap.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>BEODAS&reg;</b><P></I>Oral Peptide Delivery</i></ul></ul><P>
BEODAS is applied to the oral delivery of proteins, peptides  and other macromolecules. BEODAS is a matrix technology in which drug particles are trapped in a biodegradable polymer to form particles in the submicron size range.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>INDAS&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
INDAS is a unique high-energy matrix tablet designed specifically to improve the solubility and absorption characteristics of poorly water soluble drugs. The INDAS technology boty improves the inherent solubility of the drug and controls its delivery over a prolonged pre-determined period. The gel-forming erodable tablet system allows for smooth and continuous absorption, eliminating the wide peak to trough pharmacokinetic fluctuations experienced with poorly soluble drugs.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>EFVDAS&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
EFVDAS is a rapid and completely dissolving system and provides for pleasant tasting drinkable solutions which are particularly suitable for the administration of drugs to paediatric and geriatric patents. With the increasing emphasis by health regulatory authorities on the switching of many drugs from prescription to ITC status, Elan will employ its EFVDAS technology in providing new formulations of such drugs.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>MODAS&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
MODAS is specifically designed to control absorption of highly water soluble drugs. Each MODAS tablet formulation employs a differentially permeable membrane which controls drug dissolution and allows gentle diffusion from the micro environment of the tablet into the G.I. tract. This facilitates uniform drug absorption and thus avoids the attendant hazards of aggressive monodirectional of bolus delivery.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>IPDAS&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
IPDAS is a specilised multiparticulate high-density bead system which Elan has developed specifically to minimise the adverse gastro-intestinal effects commonly encountered with certain irritant drug compounds, the most notable of which are the Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) class.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>PHARMAZOMES&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
Elan's Pharmazomes drug delivery system is a highly adaptable drug/polymer micromatrix technology. Suitable for long-acting parental administration from 10-90 days duration of delivery, Pharmazomes are minute spheroidal polymer microparticles into which a wide variety of drugs may be incorporated. It provides a particularly suitable method for administering drugs to paediatric and geriatric patients.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>DERMAFLEX&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
Dermaflex is a unique passive transfermal patch system which employs a hydrogel matrix into which the drug is incorporated. Dermaflex regulates both the availability and absorption of the drug in a manner which allows for controlled and efficient systemic delivery. Dermaflex ensures efficient delivery of the dose employed at the required release rate without significant wastage of drug.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<b><ul><ul>SODAS&reg;</b><P></ul></ul>
SODAS is a multiparticulate drug delivery technology which precisely controls the release and absorption rate of the drug. Microspheroidal beads, each with a diameter in the range of 0.5mm to 2.0mm, are formulated using Elan's unique absorption optimising and rate controlling processes. The formulation techniques employed in the production of each SODAS bead caters to the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and clinical characteristics and requirements of each individual drug.<P>

<UL><FONT COLOR="03056B"><FONT SIZE=3><b>Dear Shareholders,</b><BR>

<P>
When I reported to shareholders last May I referred to the opportunities open to Elan in the coming year against the changing industry background. For me it was also a significant personal moment in that for the first time in the Company's history I was reporting to you as a non-executive chairman rather than the Company's chief executive. I am therefore pleased to report that substantial progress has been made towards achieving our objectives over the past twelve months. I would like to give proper credit to the management team under Donal Geaney's leadership which is applying itself to building the business of Elan for the medium to long term. I am very confident that they will continue to do so with great skill, enthusiasm and energy.
<P>
During the past year we have established a number of key strategic objectives. It has long been our desire to be the world leader in drug delivery technology and to be the preferred industry partner in the provision of drug delivery services. Through our broad platform of technologies, our collaborative alliances and range of marketed products I believe this objective has been accomplished. It has also been our desire to establish Elan as a fully integrated pharmaceutical company in one market niche. By full integration, we mean from drug discovery through sales and marketing. Our own development activities have led us to diseases of the central nervous system where a company such as Elan can make a significant impact and compete on the same basis as larger pharmaceutical companies. The acquisition of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. which we announced on 18 March, 1996 will assist us in achieving that objective. This is perhaps one of the single most important steps ever taken for our Company and I very much look forward to the contribution which Athena's management and research and marketing personnel will make to the enlarged group. Athena's chief executive John Groom, who has over 35 years experience in the pharmaceutical industry, will become the chief operating officer of the enlarged group. I look forward to the contribution that he will undoubtedly make to building Elan for the future. The completion of this merger will represent the fulfilment of our "Mind to Market" strategy.
<P>
The results for the year, summarised in the financial highlights on page one, represent a significant achievement by our management and staff. The growth in net income per share from $1.90 to $2.38 was particularly gratifying.
<P>
It is my responsibility as chairman to ensure the board implements appropriate procedures for corporate governance. When I became non-executive chairman I undertook a review of the structure of the board, its committees and its relationship with  management. It is my objective that our corporate governance procedures comply with best practice in Ireland. 
<P>
In addition, I initiated a review of the composition of the board to ensure that it reflects the range and skills that a Company of Elan's size requires. I was particularly pleased to welcome to the board of directors four new appointments since my last report. Mr. David Bethune who was president of the Lederle Laboratories division of the American Cyanamid Company joined the board in July 1995 and brings a substantial experience in the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical products. In February 1996 Mr. Laurence G. Crowley, the deputy governor of the Bank of Ireland and executive chairman of the Graduate Business School, University College, Dublin became a non-executive director. In March 1996, Dr. Alan R. Gillespie a partner in Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its head of UK/Irish investment banking division and Mr. Richard Thornburgh a former attorney general of the United States of America and governor of the State of Pennsylvania became non-executive directors. These appointments bring considerable governmental, business and other relevant experience to our board of directors. I look forward to their contribution to our Company as it develops.
<P>
At the Annual General Meeting, Mr. Charles Greyston a director of the Company since 1985 will retire from the board of directors. Mr. Greyston has made a remarkable contribution to the development of Elan serving throughout that period as chairman of the audit committee. His independence of mind, integrity and wide business experience will be much missed by the board.
<P>
It is with regret that I record the death on 15 March last of Mr. Andrew Casey who served as our Company secretary. In Elan's formative years, Mr. Casey's contribution was instrumental in establishing the basis for future growth. Although much debilitated by a long-term illness, Mr. Casey's interest in and commitment to Elan never faltered.
<P>
For me, last year has been a period of considerable change. Having founded Elan and led it through its first 25 years I have had  the privilege of implementing Elan's first executive succession in handing its management and direction over to Donal Geaney and his management team. They have done an excellent job for the Company and for its shareholders and have my full support. I must also acknowledge the contribution of our employees and partners throughout the world to the continuing success of our Company. Finally to you our shareholders I thank you for your continuing support. My objective with respect to enhancing shareholder value has been to ensure that the interests of management and shareholders are united for a common purpose. I believe our record of achievement is a validation of that approach.

<UL><FONT COLOR="03056B"><FONT SIZE=3>The fundamental review of our corporate strategy which was initiated in January 1995 when I became chief executive officer has yielded important and exciting results. Over this period the pharmaceutical industry has and will continue to experience major change. From Elan's perspective, it is my responsibility to ensure that we anticipate and adapt to these changes rather than allow these changes to sweep Elan along in their wake.
<P>
The two most significant corporate events in 1996 were the approval and launch of NaprelanÅ and the selection of its marketing partner and the announcement on 18 March, 1996 of the signature of a definitive merger agreement with Athena Neurosciences, Inc., a San Francisco based bio-pharmaceutical company. I will explore our reasoning behind this acquisition later in the statement.
<P>
In July 1995 I announced our agreement with the Wyeth-Ayerst division of American Home Products for the marketing of our once-daily Naprelan. Naprelan is a unique long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ("NSAID") indicated for the treatment of arthritis and analgesia. It has a superior side-effect profile to all other long-acting NSAIDs and I believe its approval and launch in 1996 represents a major medical advance in the treatment of arthritis and pain management, generally. We have had a significant business relationship with American Home Products and their commitment to Naprelan as the lead product in their arthritis specialisation strategy is a major opportunity for Elan.
<P>
The watchword in pharmaceutical production is quality and adherence to current good manufacturing practices ("cGMP"). In July 1995, we received a Warning Letter from the US Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") referencing our approach to cGMP at our Athlone, Ireland  facility in 1993 and 1994. On receipt of this letter, I initiated a review of our manufacturing operations, established an independent regulatory compliance function and subjected all of our manufacturing facilities to independent regulatory audit. A further FDA inspection of the Athlone facility in October 1995 resulted in the lifting of the Warning Letter. I would like to place on record my thanks to officials of the FDA for their support, interest and assistance during a very difficult period for Elan. Adherence to cGMP is a continuing process to which I and the management of Elan are fully committed. It is my intention that all of our facilities will continue to operate to the highest standards of quality assurance and regulatory compliance.
<P>
Manufacturing operations have come through a period of growth as we scaled up our facilities to produce Naprelan and other newly approved products. Manufacturing employment increased at our Athlone facility from 125 employees to 275 employees by 31 March, 1996. There was a substantial increase in manufacturing facilities in Athlone which have also been upgraded to comply with the highest standards of environmental protection. We are planning to extend our US manufacturing facilities at Gainesville, Georgia to provide for anticipated product approvals in 1998 and 1999.
<P>
The continued success of Cardizem&reg; CD (once-daily diltiazem) and Verelan&reg; (once-daily Verapamil) in the United States market and their equivalent products elsewhere in the world make a significant contribution to our revenue and profitability. These products were the foundation of our early success and underline the value of drug delivery technology in enhancing the clinical and medical advantages of these drugs. In Japan, the originator of the diltiazem molecule, Tanabe, has just launched Herbesser&reg; HP (a high potency once-daily formulation of diltiazem). This will enhance the market opportunity in Japan for our marketing partner. Also this year, Mitsubishi successfully launched Theodur&reg; Sprinkle which represents the second product utilising our PharmaZome&reg; technology that has been commercialised. The third product utilising this technology, Erythelan&reg; (a twice-daily formulation of erythromycin) will be launched in the United Kingdom this year, marketed by Elan Pharma Limited, our marketing affiliate and hopefully later this year by Adams Laboratories, a division of Medeva plc, in the United States of America.
<P>
Our marketing affiliates, in general, recorded a satisfactory year of trading and profitability. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Elan Pharma Limited acquired the marketing rights to Ponstan&reg; from Parke-Davis and I am pleased to report that this product is now increasing in revenue and profitability. In Taiwan, the Philippines and the Far Eastern market generally our products continued to grow satisfactorily and occupy the leading market position in a number of important market niches. In Spain, I anticipate that a number of new product launches this year will further the growth of Vita Elan Farma. In China, we expect to commence the launch of Elan developed products later this year. In all, these marketing affiliates are an important part of our future commercialisation strategy and they will be enhanced by the acquisition of Athena Neurosciences and its pipeline of products in development.
<P>
Research and development has been the cornerstone of our success. Research is primarily directed at the development of new drug delivery technologies and is conducted at our research facilities in Dublin, Ireland and Yavne, Israel. In Ireland the principal focus is on the development of new oral delivery technologies particularly in the area of bio-technology, large molecule and immunotherapeutic drugs. In Israel the primary focus is on the transcutaneous, pulmonary and iontophoretic delivery of drugs. Our research in these fields is designed to address the delivery requirements of the newer drugs which are generally administered by intra-veneous or sub-cutaneous means.
<P>
Our development activities are largely centered at our second site in Ireland at Athlone (where our principal manufacturing centre is based). Our research and development projects span pre-clinical evaluation of new technologies, pharmacokinetic and clinical determination of a range of novel dosage forms through process transfer, full validation and regulatory filings. For calendar 1996 we expect up to six regulatory filings with the FDA and a further 70 worldwide. The most important products in the near-term development pipeline include Neurelan&reg; (for the symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis);  Morphelan&reg; (once-daily morphine sulphate primarily for pain management); Verelan PM (a chronotherapeutic formulation of once-daily verapamil); Captelan&reg; (a once-daily formulation of captopril); EL 530/532 (for the treatment of certain types of cancer);  and once-daily nifedipine. 
I envisage that these products will provide the basis for the future growth of our drug delivery business.
<P>
We have also expanded our research and development through a number of research collaborative ventures. These include:
<P>
<ul><b>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</b>  Pulmonary delivery of proteins and peptides</ul>
<P>
<ul><b>Ethical Holdings, plc</b>  Solid oral dosage and transdermal delivery</ul>
<P>
<ul><b>Emisphere Technologies, Inc.</b>  Delivery of large molecular drugs</ul>
<P>
<ul><b>Cytogen Corporation</b>  Access to combinatorial library</ul>
<P>
These relationships expand our technology platform and the range of services that we can provide our clients. In the cases of Dura, Ethical and Emisphere we are shareholders at generally the 5 to 10 per cent level. These shareholdings enable us to enhance the value of our collaborations with these companies.
One of our primary objectives is to be the preferred industry provider of drug delivery services. I am therefore pleased to report that during fiscal 1996 we signed 33 agreements with 28 industry partners. In addition, we are developing fifteen complex generic products for five clients utilising the Abbreviated New Drug Application procedures of the FDA.
<P>
For 1996, our success as a Company will be determined by the successful launch and roll-out of Naprelan;  the continued performance of Cardizem CD and Verelan;  our continued success in attracting licencing and research revenues; and the completion of the acquisition, integration and achievement of the transaction benefits and synergies with respect to Athena Neurosciences, Inc. It is this transaction which I would now like to discuss.
<P>
As I mentioned at the start of this statement, shortly after becoming chief executive I undertook a comprehensive review of our corporate strategy. The timing was opportune and enabled the Company to critically review its positioning and future opportunities. The conclusions of this review were as follows:
<P>
(i)	Elan should continue to be a leading provider and developer of drug delivery technologies;
(ii)	our products would have demonstrable clinical and medical advantages;
(iii)	where appropriate, we would enhance our technology platform through strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements; and
(iv)	we would review the opportunity for Elan to access a market niche where our capability would include drug discovery through sales and marketing in North America.
<P>
The outcome of this review resulted in the conclusion that while the products in our pipeline would sustain our growth in the short to medium term it would be desirable to build critical mass in a market niche through an acquisition. We determined that diseases of the central nervous system ("CNS") were our preferred area because (i) although the neurology community was relatively small, it was influential in terms of total number of prescriptions for CNS products written by general practitioners and others and (ii) the area contained many disease conditions which are currently untreatable and where our drug delivery technologies could add significant value. In early 1996 we initiated discussions with Athena Neurosciences, Inc. (where in March 1995 we had concluded a research and development arrangement and purchased a $12 million convertible security) to further review collaborative opportunities. During these discussions, we agreed that a merger of our two businesses would provide the best available opportunity to achieve our mutual objectives. These discussions were concluded through the signature of a definitive merger agreement on 18 March, 1996. It is, in my view, the most significant transaction in our corporate history and will give Elan, for the first time, world-class drug discovery research and an influential position in the sales and marketing of CNS products to the US neurology community. When the acquisition closes Elan will be organised through three divisions:
<P>
<ul><b>Elan Technologies</b>  Drug delivery development licencing and world-wide manufacturing<P>
<b>Elan Pharma</b>  World-wide sales and marketing of Elan and ultimately Athena developed products<P>
<b>Athena Therapeutics</b>  Drug discovery research and development of CNS products</ul>
<P>
I am pleased that John Groom, the president and chief executive officer of Athena, will become the chief operating officer of Elan. In contrast to many recent transactions of this nature in the pharmaceutical industry the transaction benefits will be derived from "upsizing" the combined organisation rather than "downsizing" through plant closures and redundancies.
<P>
Elan was founded based on the vision of Donald Panoz who was among the first to see the clinical and medical benefits of improved drug absorption. Its fulfilment was achieved through many different contributions over our first twenty five years. However we must now position Elan for the 21st century. I believe that much has been achieved over the last year. In particular, the approval of Naprelan and the Athena transaction represent critical milestones in our future development. It is and will remain our strategy to expand our business through exploitation of the product pipeline, extensions to our  marketing infrastructure and, where appropriate, product acquisitions. We will remain committed to our world leadership position in drug delivery and to being the preferred industry partner.
<P>
I would like to thank our shareholders and employees for their support, interest and commitment over the past twelve months. I look forward with confidence to 1996.<P>

<UL><FONT COLOR="03056B"><FONT SIZE=3>The Elan development pipeline now reflects the mature business base of the Company and provides a balance in the terms of the number of projects, stages of development, the complexity of the delivery problem and the timeframe to commercialisation.<P>

Our new and emerging technologies being developed at our research laboratories in Trinity College, Dublin show significant progress in the area of improved delivery of macromolecules. These developments have been further augmented by a range of strategic alliances that add to Elan's core expertise. During the year 37  products were evaluated in clinical trials. Regulatory filings were prepared for 17 countries and 31 approvals for 10 products were received in 17 countries. During 1996 we anticipate making 6 FDA filings in the United States and up to 70 filings in 41 other countries. This level of activity reflects the successful conclusion of a number of our pipeline projects.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Elan's Emerging and New Technologies</H3></ul></ul>
Elan's new technologies are designed to address problems associated with many new chemical entities and products from the biotechnology sector such as site selective absorption, narrow therapeutic windows etc. As a result, we are developing a range of options to overcome these issues including enhanced oral dosage forms with biodegradable polymers, electrically assisted transdermals, long-acting injectables and pulmonary formulations for delivery to the lower lung. This has produced a rich pipeline of over 65 products spanning a broad range of therapies which are being developed both through our own research activities and together with partners in strategic alliances.<P>

BEODAS is designed to achieve oral absorption of macromolecules. A number of Phase I studies have shown encouraging bioavailability. The lead product in this group being our Beodas formulation of LMWH (low molecular weight Heparin). We are also adapting this technology to an application in pulmonary delivery where we have now completed Phase I studies.<P>

Panoderm. We have now completed two Phase II analgesia studies in Europe and have filed an IND (Investigational New Drug) application in the United States under which clinical studies in pain control are underway as part of continuing programmes to achieve macromolecule delivery across the skin. Phase I studies in Calcitonin are also now in progress.<P>

Medipad has been developed in Israel by our medical device technology division. This device delivery group has significant engineering and device experience and is developing a number of new device based delivery systems. The first of these is Medipad which provides the convenience and appearance of a transdermal product with the accuracy and consistency of parenteral systems. We are presently evaluating a number of compounds in this area including a partnership with a major pharmaceutical company to confirm the performance characteristics in this new innovative system of one of their new chemical entities.<P>

<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Key Collaborative Research Relationships</H3></ul></ul>
Our strategy of developing collaborative research relationships gives Elan access to a broad range of drug delivery technology systems.<P>

<ul><ul><b>Ethical</b></ul>	<P>
The alliance with Ethical Holdings gives Elan access to Ethical's MultiporÅ technology and broadens our ability in transdermal delivery. A range of transdermal and oral products have been identified to be developed under this alliance.</ul><P>

<ul><ul><b>Dura</b></ul><P>
The strong continuing relationship with Dura Pharmaceuticals progresses Elan's interests in the area of pulmonary delivery. Dura's DryhalerÅ device and other pulmonary expertise together with Elan's technologies will allow us to explore improved delivery of established respiratory products as well as systemic delivery of complex macromolecules.</ul><P>
<ul><ul><b>Emisphere</ul></b><P>
This collaborative research agreement to evaluate Emisphere's proprietary technology for oral macro-molecule delivery is now entering Phase I evaluation following successful filing of the relevant IND. We believe this alliance has the potential for complimentary collaboration in combining Emisphere's technology and Elan's capability in oral macromolecule absorption.</ul><P>
<ul><ul><b>Cytogen</b></ul><P>
This agreement allows us to exploit new development technologies and techniques in the area of molecular biology. We hope to develop advanced targeting and drug delivery systems focused on specific physiological barriers and receptors that play a role in drug absorption. Cytogen's combinatorial library technology and expertise in chemistry will add to Elan's programme in the development of advanced drug delivery targeted systems.</ul><P>
<ul><ul><b>Athena	</b></ul><P>
This alliance originally allowed for the application of Elan's drug delivery technology to a range of neurological products being developed by Athena Neurosciences. Under the agreement Elan had access to exciting early stage compounds and would have worked closely with Athena in developing the optimum dosage form. In addition Elan would carry out the development and manufacturing of a specific range of products. All of these features and others described elsewhere led to our announcement in March 1996 of the acquisition of Athena and its integration into the Elan group of companies.</ul><P>
<ul><ul><b>Other Alliances</b></ul><P>
Elan has initiated the development of four solid oral dosage forms for new over-the-counter presentations for an OTC division of a major pharmaceutical company and a number of other contract development projects on existing licenced products have been initiated utilising various new delivery mechanisms.</ul><P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Cardizem/Diltiazem</H3></ul></ul>
Once and twice-daily formulations of Diltiazem continue to show growth globally with sales of over $900 million in North America alone. This product has been approved in 21 countries and is awaiting approval in 13 others. It is showing strong growth in Japan where our partner Tanabe is now marketing a new and improved version developed by Elan. Similar product enhancements are now being assessed by all our licencees worldwide.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Verelan</H3></ul></ul>
We have recently introduced two line extensions to this product in the United States:-<P>
Verelan Sprinkle and Verelan High Dose (360 mg)<P>
We are also developing a chronotherapeutic formulation which takes advantage of natural circadian rhythms within the human body. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has highlighted inherent variations in blood pressure levels throughout the day. This particular profile demonstrates that blood pressure generally drops during night-time by approximately 20% and rises rapidly again in the waking hours of the morning (6a.m. to 12 noon). Elan's Verelan Chrono will be taken at night but the release rate is formulated so as to have maximum effect in the early hours of morning.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>EL530/532</H3></ul></ul>
These non-cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs preferentially inhibit the growth of cancerous cells and have shown efficiency with minimal toxicity against a variety of solid tumours and leukemias in Phase II studies conducted at multiple sites by the National Cancer Institute of the USA in conjunction with Elan.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Neurelan</H3></ul></ul>
Multiple sclerosis affects more than 250,000 people in the United States. Elan has developed a controlled absorption formulation of FampridineÅ a potassium channel blocker which addresses the toxicity issues and narrow therapeutic window of the active ingredient. This is the first treatment designed to provide symptomatic relief for sufferers of multiple sclerosis and is now entering Phase III studies. Neurelan has Orphan drug status in the U.S.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Ibuscent (Ibuprofen Effervescent)</H3></ul></ul>
Ibuprofen is a proven analgesic and antipyretic with good tolerability and was one of the first NSAIDs to achieve OTC status as an analgesic. The Elan effervescent formulation ensures rapid dissolution of the dosage form and hence allows Ibuprofen to be absorbed faster than traditional dosage forms. This ensures rapid onset of analgesic effect. Elan's Ibuscent 200mg formulation is presently approved in Sweden and Norway with approval imminent in a number of other European countries. A major launch by our European licencee is planned in the coming year.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Morphelan (Morphine Once-Daily)</H3></ul></ul>
Elan has developed a once-daily morphine sulphate formulation using its proprietary SODAS technology. This multiparticulate product is designed to provide a rapid onset of action together with a sustained therapeutic effect over 24 hours. Once daily administration will improve compliance and help eliminate breakthrough pain which is a feature of many twice daily products thereby providing better quality of pain management.<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><H3>Naprelan</H3></ul></ul>
Our once-daily version of naproxen sodium has been launched in the United States by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories (a division of American Home Products). This is the first prescription product in the United States to offer once daily dosing of the popular arthritis medication NaprosynÅ together with an analgesic claim.<P>

Naprelan offers a unique combination of rapid onset of pain relief, a sustained release mechanism allowing for once daily dosing and 24 hour effectiveness. This is made possible by Elan's innovative delivery technology IPDAS (Intestinal Protective Drug Absorption System). The sustained release component of Naprelan is designed to widely disperse the sustained release micro-particles through the gastro-intestinal tract allowing for gradual absorption and thus providing a full day's duration of activity.<P>

Currently 38 million people suffer from arthritis in the United States which is one of the leading causes of work related disability. It is estimated that by the year 2020 the number of arthritis sufferers will increase to in excess of 59 million. Many arthritis sufferers frequently switch medications because of inconvenient dosing, lack of efficacy or undesirable side effects. We believe that Naprelan with the benefits of IPDAS will provide an important new option for physicians to treat patients.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><H3>IPDAS Facts</H3></ul></ul>
Chronic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with irritation of the gastro-intestinal tract, sometimes causing bleeding, ulceration and perforation. IPDAS provides a unique delivery and dispersal profile that minimises naproxen concentration in any one area of the gastro-intestinal tract.<P>

IPDAS enables convenient once daily dosing of Naprelan by simultaneously delivering rapid onset of action and sustained release of medication over a 24 hour period. The immediate release component delivers 30% of the drug in granulate form and after ingestion this portion quickly dissolves in the gastro-intestinal tract. The extended release component consists of micro-particles coated with rate-controlling polymer membrane. These micro-particles provide an extended absorption period that prolongs therapeutic levels of the drug for 24 hours and disperses drug concentrations over a wide area of the gastro-intestinal tract to minimise local irritation.<P><P>

<b>Elan Corporation plc., 2nd Quarter Report ended September 30, 1996</b>

<p>
<br>

<a href="#table">Consolidated Balance Sheet</a>

<p>
<br>

Dear Shareholders,

<p>
<br>

I am pleased to report to you net income for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 of $28.5m and earnings per share of $0.29, before a one-time charge, compared with net income of $20.4m and earnings per share of $0.29 for the quarter ended September 30, 1995, an increase of 39% in net income. The results for the quarter include the results of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. acquired on July 1, 1996 and an increase in outstanding ordinary and equivalent shares of 39% largely reflecting shares issued to give effect to the merger, the exercise of approximately 11.6 million warrants in November 1995 and a higher number of share equivalents.

<p>
<br>

The one-time charge of $484.8m on the acquisition of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. largely represents the value of the acquired in-process research related to the Athena acquisition which has been written off in the income statement in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.2 "Accounting for Research and Development Costs". The one-time charge includes a provision of $30m for the integration, rationalisation and repositioning of certain Elan businesses including the disposal of non-strategic interests. The acquisition of Advanced Therapeutic Systems, Limited announced in September will be completed on October 30, 1996 and the accounting adjustments arising on this acquisition will be reflected in the results for the quarter to December 31, 1996.

<p>
<br>

Total revenues for the quarter were $83.3m, an increase of 70% from $49.0m in the same quarter of the previous year. Excluding the revenue contribution from Athena, the underlying revenue growth rate was 36%. Revenue from product sales rose 78% for the quarter, largely reflecting the launch of Naprelan and the inclusion of Athena revenues for the first time, including Permax, which recorded an increase of 53% compared with the comparable quarter in the preceding year.

<p>
<br>

Research revenues were $18.2m, compared to $10.0m in the same quarter of the previous year. Research revenues included $15.4m received from Advanced Therapeutics Systems, Limited, reflecting the high level of payments for external work done on behalf of ATS in the quarter.


<p>
<br>

Royalties and fees in the quarter were $27.5m, up from $17.8m in the same quarter of the previous year. The growth in royalties of 72% reflected the inclusion of Naprelan royalties together with growth in royalties from sales of Cardizem CD and Verelan offset in part by a decline in Cardizem SR royalties. Licence and option fees reflected new agreements entered into in the quarter and milestone payments from existing agreements.

<p>
<br>

Unfunded research and development expenditure increased to $12.6m from $7.4m reflecting the inclusion of Athena research activities for the first time. Selling, general and administrative costs increased to $15.2m from $8.5m also reflecting the inclusion of Athena costs for the first time including 
the  costs of its sales and marketing activities.

<p>
<br>

Interest and other income grew by 48% to $7.7m from $5.2m reflecting primarily the higher levels of cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet in the current quarter compared to the previous year.

<p>
<br>

The merger with Athena was completed on July 1 and the task of integrating the enlarged Elan group is now under-way. At the same time, a process of review and re-focusing of the drug delivery business is in progress to maximise the opportunities for our drug delivery technologies and to ensure that our manufacturing facilities operate at maximum efficiency. During the quarter, we announced with CYTOGEN Corporation the formation of Targon Corporation to develop and commercialise differentiated oncology products. The announcement in early September of the results of the Phase I trials for oral heparin carried out on behalf of the Emisphere-Elan join venture were encouraging. At our investor conference held in September, we also announced exciting progress in the Alzheimer's Disease research programmes where prototype compounds that reduce the protein which forms the plaques found in the brains 
of Alzheimer patients where shown to be orally active in Athena's model of Alzheimer's disease. These and other developments continue to broaden the scientific base and range of products marketed by the enlarged Elan group.

<p>

<a href="#table">Consolidated Balance Sheet</a>

<p>
<br>

Dear Shareholders,

<p>
<br>

I am pleased to report that Elan has achieved record earnings for the quarter ended January 5, 1996. Net income for the quarter was IR£14,430,000 (US$23,088,000) and earnings per share of IR£0.38 (US$0.61) compared with net income of IR£11,246,000 and IR£0.32 in the third quarter, fiscal 1995, increases of 28 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. Net income for the nine months was IR£38,417,000 (US$61,466,000) compared to IR£30,830,000 in the comparable period in the prior year. Per share net income increased from IR£0.87 to IR£1.06 (US$1.69).

<p>
<br>

Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 increased by 14 per cent from IR£30,124,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£34,479,000 (US$55,166,000) principally arising from the increase in revenue from royalties and fees which increased from IR£9,123,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£16,776,000 (US$26,842,000). This reflected (i) attainment of milestone payments on existing license agreements; (ii) the signing of a number of new agreements completed in the quarter; and (iii) increased royalties including contributions from new product launches in Japan. Revenue from product sales was IR£13,244,000 (US$21,190,000) in the quarter compared to IR£13,625,000 in the comparable period in fiscal 1995. This reflected principally reduced shipments of nutrition and diagnostic products. Research revenue was IR£4,459,000 (US$7,134,000) in the quarter (including IR£3,355,000 (1994: IR£5,267,000) from Advanced Therapeutic Systems, Limited (ATS)). This reflected the timing of clinical trials on a number of ATS funded projects.

<p>
<br>

The change in the gross margin on goods and services sold from 51 per cent in the third quarter of fiscal 1995 to 32per cent in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 reflected (i) costs associated with the scale-up and manufacture of pre-launch inventory requirements of Naprelanª (including personnel recruitment, training and associated facility costs) and (ii) a higher level of activity on client sponsored development projects.
I am pleased that we recorded a 28 per cent increase in net income for the quarter while absorbing heavy scale-up costs associated with Naprelanª recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing in the United States. We also shipped our first batches of pre-launch inventory at the end of the quarter and I am also pleased to note that product sales in the quarter included a contribution from two new product launches in Japan.

<p>
<br>

I look forward to the launch later this quarter of Naprelanª by the Wyeth-Ayerst division of American Home Products which will likely result in a significant increase in product sales by Elan. The conclusion in the quarter of a research alliance with Emisphere Technologies, Inc and an extended commercial arrangement with Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc were two significant corporate events in the quarter. I look forward to 1996 with confidence that we will build from our successes in 1995. I would like to thank our shareholders and employees for their support during what has been a challenging period in the companyÕs development. I am very pleased that your confidence in Elan has enabled us to achieve good financial results and a major new product approval.

<p>
<br>

<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>DUBLIN, IRELAND, (December 4, 1996): Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan") (NYSE:ELN) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Athena Neurosciences, Inc. ("Athena"), received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") an approvable letter for Diastat&reg; (diazepam rectal gel).</b><P>

Diastat is a new proprietary gel formulation of diazepam and is approvable for rectal administration in the management of selected, refractory, epileptic patients, on stable regimens of anti-epileptic drugs, who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure activity.  The conditions for approval include reaching agreement on labelling proposed by the FDA, including appropriate guidance for the use of Diastat, and the submission of a current safety update.<P>

The Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee convened by the FDA unanimously recommended  approval of the New Drug Application ("NDA") for Diastat on November 15, 1996 and the labelling proposed to the company by the FDA is consistent with the committee's recommendation.  The FDA has previously granted the company Orphan Drug designation for Diastat, providing seven years of marketing exclusivity from new drug approval for an indication previously defined as acute repetitive seizures.   Elan plans to review the indication language proposed by the FDA with the Office of Orphan Products Development to retain the company's Orphan Drug designation.<P>

Although most of the 2.5 million patients with epilepsy in the United States are controlled with daily medication, a subset of patients with severe epilepsy may suffer from a cluster of prolonged, acute seizures that, if not treated quickly, may lead to brain damage, other injury or death.
<P>
"When approved, Diastat will offer the convenience of at-home administration to help control increased seizure activity, thereby enabling patients and families to avoid visits to the emergency room and the economic and emotional costs related to those visits", said Jan Wallace, M.D., Athena's vice president of clinical and regulatory affairs.  "Diastat can provide the ability to manage this severe epileptic condition at home for the thousands of affected patients and their family members".
<P>
Elan chief executive officer, Donal Geaney, commented that, "The approvable status of Diastat is welcome news, particularly since it comes only days after the marketing approval of Zanaflex&reg; (tizanidine hydrochloride), a product indicated for the management of increased muscle tone associated with spasticity, a condition affecting the central nervous system.  Diastat's approvable FDA status underscores the company's growing neurological product line and furthers Elan's presence as a significant contributor to the neurology community".
<P>
Elan Corporation, plc is a leading worldwide drug delivery company with innovative drug absorption technologies designed to improve patient care in a cost-effective manner.  Its principal research and manufacturing facilities are in Ireland, and through its subsidiaries in the United States and Israel.  Athena Neurosciences, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elan, discovers, develops and markets product to be used primarily for the treatment and diagnosis of central nervous system diseases and disorders.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Except for historical information, the statements made in this press release contain certain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including final governmental approval, product demand, market acceptance and pricing of Diastat, as well as the other risks detailed from time to time in the SEC reports filed by Elan, including its report on Form 20-F for the year ended March, 31, 1996 as amended November 1996.</FONT><P>

<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>DUBLIN, IRELAND (November 18, 1996): Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE:ELN) ("ELAN") announced today that the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee ("Committee") convened by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") on November 15, 1996 has unanimously recommended approval of the New Drug Application ("NDA") for Diastat&reg; (diazepam rectal gel).  The NDA was submitted by Elan's wholly-owned subsidiary, Athena Neurosciences, Inc. in December 1995.</b><P>

Diastat is a proprietary gel formulation of diazepam for rectal administration and is designed for home use in the treatment of a severe epilepsy condition previously defined as acute repetitive seizures.  This condition primarily affects children and young adults, and is characterized by a predictable cluster of seizures that may lead to injury and death.  Currently these seizures are treated primarily in hospitals and home treatment will enable faster administration of the appropriate medication and the possibility of improved outcomes for lower cost.<P>

The Committee found the evidence submitted by Elan supports approval of the NDA.  At the request of the FDA the Committee recommended that certain aspects of this epilepsy condition be taken into account in arriving at the product's final labelling.  The Committee's recommendation on labelling is consistent with Elan's views on how the product should be used.<P>

While not bound by the recommendations of the Committee, the FDA often follows such recommendation in reaching its decision to approve or deny an NDA.  Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, an FDA response to the approvability of an NDA filing generally would be expected within a year of its submission.<P>

Elan Corporation, plc is a leading worldwide drug delivery and biopharmaceutical company.  Its innovative drug absorption technologies are designed to improve patient care in a cost-effective manner.

<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>DUBLIN, IRELAND, October 29, 1996: Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) today announced net income for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 of $28.5m and earnings per share of $0.29, before a one-time charge, compared with net income of $20.4m and earnings per share of $0.29 in the three months ended September 30, 1995, an increase of 39% in net income. The results for the quarter reflect the acquisition of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. on July 1, 1996 and an increase in outstanding ordinary and equivalent shares of 39 per cent.</b>
<P>
<p>
The one-time charge of $484.8m on the acquisition of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. largely represents the value of the acquired in-process research related to the Athena acquisition which has been written off in the income statement in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.2 "Accounting for Research and Development Costs". The one-time charge includes a provision of $30m for the integration, rationalisation and repositioning of certain Elan businesses including the disposal of non-strategic interests. The acquisition of Advanced Therapeutic Systems, Limited announced in September will be completed on October 30, 1996 and the accounting adjustments arising on this acquisition will be reflected in the results for the quarter to December 31, 1996.
<p>
Total revenues for the quarter were $83.3m, an increase of 70% from $49.0m in the same quarter of the previous year. Excluding the revenue contribution from Athena, the underlying revenue growth rate was 36%. Revenue from product sales rose 78% for the quarter, largely reflecting the launch of Naprelan and the inclusion of Athena revenues for the first time, including Permax, which recorded an increase of 53% compared with the comparable quarter in the preceding year.
<p>
Research revenues were $18.2m, compared to $10.0m in the same quarter of the previous year. Research revenues included $15.4m received from Advanced Therapeutics Systems, Limited, reflecting the high level of payments for external work done on behalf of ATS in the quarter.
<p>
Royalties and fees in the quarter were $27.5m, up from $17.8m in the same quarter of the previous year. The growth in royalties of 72% reflected the inclusion of Naprelan royalties together with growth in royalties from sales of Cardizem CD and Verelan offset in part by a decline in Cardizem SR royalties. Licence and option fees reflected new agreements entered into in the quarter and milestone payments from existing agreements.
<p>
Unfunded research and development expenditure increased to $12.6m from $7.4m reflecting the inclusion of Athena research activities for the first time. Selling, general and administrative costs increased to $15.2m from $8.5m also reflecting the inclusion of Athena costs for the first time including 
the  costs of its sales and marketing activities.
<p>
Interest and other income grew by 48% to $7.7m from $5.2m reflecting primarily the higher levels of cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet in the current quarter compared to the previous year.
<p>
The merger with Athena was completed on July 1 and the task of integrating the enlarged Elan group is now under-way. At the same time, a process of review and re-focusing of the drug delivery business is in progress to maximise the opportunities for our drug delivery technologies and to ensure that our manufacturing facilities operate at maximum efficiency. During the quarter, we announced with CYTOGEN Corporation the formation of Targon Corporation to develop and commercialise differentiated oncology products. The announcement in early September of the results of the Phase I trials for oral heparin carried out on behalf of the Emisphere-Elan join venture were encouraging. At our investor conference held in September, we also announced exciting progress in the Alzheimer's Disease research programmes where prototype compounds that reduce the protein which forms the plaques found in the brains 
of Alzheimer patients where shown to be orally active in Athena's model of Alzheimer's disease. These and other developments continue to broaden the scientific base and range of products marketed by the enlarged Elan group.

<h3><i>Targon Corporation To Combine Core Competencies To Achieve Accelerated Drug Development and Commercialisation Programs.</i></h3><P>
<b>PRINCETON, N.J., September 26, 1996 -- Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE:ELN) and CYTOGEN Corporation (NSADAQ:CYTO) announced today that they have entered into an agreement creating a new U.S. based company to focus exclusively on the rapid development, registration, manufacturing and commercialisation of differentiated oncology products.   The agreement calls for the establishment of Targon Corporation, which will initially be a wholly-owned subsidiary of CYTOGEN.   Elan, which has made a $20 million investment in CYTOGEN (consisting of $5 million in common stock and $15 million in a new Series A convertible preferred stock, the proceeds of which will initially capitalise Targon), will have the right to have equal ownership with CYTOGEN in the new company.</b><P>

Targon will utilise Elan's and CYTOGEN's demonstrated competencies in drug development and manufacturing in order to accelerate its global registration of oncology products.  Products for the new company will be accessed from the two principal sources: (1) Elan's and CYTOGEN's existing pipelines and (2) the in-licensing of additional late stage oncology products.   All new products to be developed by Targon will benefit from Elan's expertise in drug delivery and enhanced formulation, and CYTOGEN's strength in the clinical development and registration of cancer products.<P>

 "The new company creates a unique combination of competencies and provides an effective and efficient development channel for differentiated oncology products", said Michael Sember, Elan's Vice President of Planning, Investments and Development, who will serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Targon.<P>

At the outset, Targon will have five products in its research pipeline:<P>

<UL><i>EL530 and EL532,</i> for the treatment of solid and hematologic tumours.   These agents inhibit the growth of cells from a wide range of cancers.  This mechanism of action differs from traditional treatment approaches that are dependent on killing cancer cells rather than limiting their growth.  Currently, Phase II clinical trials are being directed by the National Cancer Institute.<P>

<i>Prostatec,</i> for use in detecting the extent and location of prostate cancer.   This diagnostic is a second generation version of CYTOGEN's ProtaScint prostate cancer diagnostic, which has been sanctioned by an FDA advisory committee and is currently under FDA review.  Oncotec, a diagnostic imaging agent for the detection of breast cancer based on OncoScint CR/OV, which has been cleared by FDA for use in detecting colorectal and ovarian cancers.   These two products, which have the potential to reduce cancer diagnostic costs and provide timelier results than available tests, are undergoing IND preparations.<P>

<i>PSMA Technology </i>(Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen), a unique approach to identifying prostate cancer in the blood.  Antibody and gene therapy products based on PSMA offer diagnostic and therapeutic applications in prostate cancer.</UL><P>

"Targon's singular focus on the oncology market enhances the company's ability to bring oncology products to market, and to do so quickly," said Donal J. Geaney, Chief Executive Officer and President of Elan.  "By combining the strengths of Elan and CYTOGEN we have created a dynamic new company with focussed strengths and exceptional capabilities in the oncology sector."<P>

"Our agreement with Elan confirms our commitment to growth through alliances and strengthens our leadership position in the development, registration and manufacturing of differentiated cancer products," said Thomas J. McKearn, CYTOGEN's President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.   "Our ongoing alliance with Elan concerning the Genetic Diversity Library technology has been extremely productive.  I am confident that this second alliance will further advance CYTOGEN's objective to build its business and create sustainable stockholder value."<P>

According to the American Cancer Society, the estimated number of cancer cases diagnosed annually in the United States (excluding certain skin cancers) increased from approximately 782,000 in 1980 to approximately 1.2 million in 1994, an increase of 53%.  This increase is attributable to a number of factors, including a growing and ageing population.  As a result, more than eight million Americans have been diagnosed with cancer.   It is expected that these trends will continue and that the number of cancer patients, and the demand for oncology services, will continue to increase.<P>

The oncology pharmaceutical market is predicted by industry experts to grow to an estimated $11 billion by the year 2002 and represents one of the fastest growing segments in the pharmaceutical industry.<P>

Elan Corporation, plc is a leading world-wide drug delivery and biopharmaceutical company.   Its innovative drug absorption technologies are designed to improve patient care in a cost effective manner.   Its Athena Neuroscience subsidiary discovers, develops and markets products to be used by neurologists for the treatment and diagnosis of neurological disorders.   Elan's principal research and manufacturing facilities are in Ireland, the United States and Israel.  Elan's shares trade on the New York, London and Dublin Stock Exchanges.<P>

CYTOGEN is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacture and commercialisation of products for the targeted delivery of diagnostics and therapeutic substances directly to disease sites.   CYTOGEN has demonstrated its ability to evolve novel technology from early discovery through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial-scale biologic manufacturing, and is focused on leveraging these core capabilities to expand and build a profitable business.<P>

<h2>Targon Corporation Fact Sheet</h2><P>
<BR Clear=All><P>

<h3>The Company</h3>
Targon Corporation will commence business with immediate access to the core competencies of Elan and CYTOGEN, and will specialise in expedited drug development programs for differentiated oncology products.<P>

Targon Corporation is established initially as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CYTOGEN and, at Elan's option, may be owned by Elan and CYTOGEN.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<h3>The Management</h3>
The new Company will have a Board of Directors that includes equal representation from Elan and CYTOGEN, as well as representation from the management of the new company and from the industry.<P>

Upon election of the Board of Directors, Michael Sember, Elan's Vice President of Planning, Investments and Development, will serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the new company.<P>

Robert Maguire CYTOGEN's Vice President of Medical Affairs, will serve as the new company's  Executive President and Chief Scientific Officer.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<h3>The Products.</h3>
Targon Corporation will have rights to five products:  EL530 and EL532 from Elan; Prostatec, Oncotec and PSMA Technology from CYTOGEN.   Additional products will be accessed through the in-licensing of late stage oncology products that can benefit from Elan's drug delivery and enhanced formulation expertise and CYTOGEN's proven strengths in the clinical development and registration of cancer products.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<h3>The Financial Structure</h3>
In connection with the formation of the new company, CYTOGEN completed a sale of registered Common Stock to Elan for $5 million, the proceeds of which formed CYTOGEN's cash contribution to the new company . In addition,the proceeds of a $15 million Series A convertible preferred stock sale to Elan will be used to fund the new company.  The new company will use $10 million of such proceeds to acquire certain products from Advanced Therapeutics Systems Ltd.<P>

The CYTOGEN Series A convertible preferred stock purchased by Elan may, at Elan's option, be either exchanged for one-half of CYTOGEN's interest in the new company or converted into shares of CYTOGEN's common stock.<P>

If Elan exchanges the Series A convertible preferred stock for ownership in the new company then Elan will additionally receive a warrant to purchase up to 1 million shares of CYTOGEN common stock with exercise price (based on the time of exercise) from between $8.40 per share to $14 over time.<P>

If Elan converts the CYTOGEN Series A convertible preferred stock into CYTOGEN common stock, a maximum of 1,785,715 shares of CYTOGEN common stock (reduced over time) would be issuable, depending on when the conversion occurs.   If Elan exercises its conversion right, CYTOGEN will retain full ownership of the new company.<P>

</h2></ul></ul><P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>Dublin, Ireland, September 10, 1996: Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE:ELN) today announced that it intends to exercise its option to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of Advanced Therapeutic Systems, Limited (AMEX: ATH) at a price of $36.00 per share payable in cash, at a total cost to Elan of $141 million pursuant to the purchase option granted by ATS in July 1993.  The transaction will be completed before the end of October 1996.  As a result of the ATS transaction, Elan will incur a one-time charge of approximately $141 million in the quarter to September 30, 1996.</b><P>

ATS was formed in May 1993 and subsequently funded through a rights offering to Elan shareholders.  It is funding both drug delivery research using Elan¹s ETDAS, BEODAS and MIDAS technologies and new chemical entity and drug development research.<P>

Commenting on this decision, Elan's President and Chief Executive Officer, Donal Geaney, said "the decision to buy back ATS follows a detailed review of the value of the ATS portfolio and represents a major vote of confidence in the future of Elan as well as giving an excellent return to those Elan shareholders who participated in the ATS offering".<P>

Elan Corporation, plc is a leading worldwide drug delivery company with innovative drug absorption technologies designed to improve patient care in a cost-effective manner.  Athena Neurosciences, a division of Elan, discovers, develops and markets products to be used primarily by neurologists for the treatment and diagnosis of neurological disorders.

<UL><FONT COLOR="03056B"><FONT SIZE=4><ul><ul><h2>Elan Corporation, plc announces net income increase of 51%</h2></ul></ul><P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>DUBLIN, IRELAND,  July 23, 1996:  Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) today announced net income for the quarter ended June 30, 1996 of $27,982,000 and earnings per share of $0.68 compared with net income of $18,588,000 and earnings per share of $0.52 in the three months ended June 30, 1995, increases of 51% and 30% respectively.</b><P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
Total revenues for the first quarter were $67,620,000, an increase of 39% from $48,691,000 in the first quarter of the previous year.  Revenue from product sales rose 50% to $33,301,000 from $22,186,000 for the quarter, largely reflecting the launch of Naprelan&reg; in the United States in April  1996.<P>

Royalties and fees in the quarter were $22,155,000, up from $17,503,000 in the first quarter of last year.  Licence and option fees reflected 6 new agreements entered into during the quarter and revenue from agreements where milestone payments were earned in the quarter.<P>

Research revenues rose to $12,164,000 for the quarter, from $9,002,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Research revenues included $10,596,000 received from Advanced Therapeutic 
 Systems, Limited, up from $6,391,000, reflecting the high level of payments for external work done on behalf of ATS in the quarter.<P>

The gross margin declined reflecting, primarily,  the significant increase in funded research projects for which no milestone payments were achieved, and the early stages of production and the large quantities of samples of Naprelan ".<P>

Unfunded research and development expenditures declined to $5,511,000 from $6,608,000 in the first quarter of the previous year  reflecting the launch of products over the preceding 12 months.<P>

Interest and other income grew by 64% to $7,006,000 from $4,265,000 reflecting primarily the higher levels of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet in the current quarter compared to the previous year.<P>

Elan's President and Chief Executive Officer, Donal Geaney, in reviewing the performance for the quarter, commented that "this was an extremely important quarter in the long-term development of Elan.  The approval of the merger with Athena Neurosciences during the quarter, and the completion of the merger on July 1, 1996, brings a new breadth and depth to Elan in terms of management, existing products, research and product pipeline and marketing skills.  The results to June 30 do not, of course, reflect in any way the effect or benefits of the merger.  The results of Athena will be consolidated from July 1".<P>

 Mr. Geaney further commented "the launch of Naprelan in the United States in April by our licensing partner, American Home Products Corporation was a major event for the company.  Naprelan continues to build market share and is well placed to become a major product in its category.  The progress of Cardizem CD and Verelan is also very satisfactory in difficult market conditions.  We are excited about the opportunities for our products in the Far East, particularly in Japan.  I am optimistic about the challenges and prospects facing the enlarged Elan Corporation.  The combination of our leading edge position in research into diseases of the central nervous system and our position as preferred industry partner for drug delivery technologies supported by a strong cash flow and balance sheet leaves Elan well positioned to maximise future opportunities". <P>

As previously announced,  Elan has changed its reporting currency from Irish pounds to U.S. dollars with effect from April 1, 1996 and has also changed its reporting year end from March 31 to December 31.<P>

Elan Corporation, plc is a leading world-wide drug delivery and biopharmaceutical company.  Its innovative drug absorption technologies are designed to improve patient care in a cost effective manner.  Its Athena Neuroscience Division discovers, develops and markets products to be used by neurologists for the treatment and diagnosis of neurological disorders.

<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>Dublin, Ireland (July 9, 1996):  Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) ("ELAN") announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Athena Neurosciences, Inc. ("Athena") has completed an agreement with Pharmavene, Inc. ("Pharmavene"), a private company based in Rockville, Maryland, to license worldwide rights to Carbatrol<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP>, a sustained-release capsule formulation of the extensively used anti-epileptic medication carbamazepine.</b><P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
Pharmavene's New Drug Application for Carbatrol was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") on April 3, 1996 and was accepted for substantive review on June 1, 1996.<P>

Carbatrol is a specially formulated capsule using Pharmavene's proprietary technology.  Carbatrol permits carbamazepine to be administered in a twice-a-day dosage regimen, compared to the conventional administration in tablet form of three to four doses per day.  Carbamazepine is one of the principal medications used to control the incidence of epileptic seizures and has been approved in the United States for treatment of this condition for over twenty years.  The FDA recently approved for marketing a two-a-day tablet formulation of carbamazepine called Tegretol&reg; XR.<P>

Mr. John Groom, Elan's chief operating officer commented, "To achieve the full therapeutic benefit of carbamazepine and its protective effect in seizures, it is important that patients 
 maintain appropriate, stable blood levels of the drug throughout the day.  This usually requires tablets to be taken three to four times per day.  We believe Pharmavene's clinical and technical data for Carbatrol demonstrates that their twice daily formulation is able to provide equivalent blood levels of carbamazepine to conventional tablet administration.  Many breakthrough seizures in epileptic patients can be attributed to missed or forgotten doses of their medication, and simplification of the dosage, especially the elimination of the need of a mid-day dose, offers true clinical benefits in compliance as well as patient convenience."<P>

Financial terms of the worldwide license were not announced but contain an upfront payment, a milestone payment on FDA approval, and royalty payments to Pharmavene.  Elan, Athena and Pharmavene will collaborate to pursue the regulatory, technical and other steps necessary to prepare for the planned introduction of Carbatrol.<P>

Elan also announced today the successful completion by Athena of a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II safety, tolerability, dose-selection and efficacy study of BotB<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> (Botulinum Toxin Type B) in patients with cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis).  Cervical dystonia is a severe condition of abnormal muscle tone and movement that can result in severe, painful abnormalities of posture or inability to flex and relax affected neck and shoulder muscles.<P>

Results from this study, involving 122 patients with cervical dystonia, revealed statistically significant clinical improvement in patients treated with a single injection of BotB, as compared to the placebo-treated patients.  In responding patients, a dose-related duration of effect was achieved lasting at the two highest doses for 3-4 months in some patients.  No unexpected, clinically significant or serious drug-related adverse events were reported for any of the doses tested.  Detailed results of this study will be reported via a satellite symposium of the American Neurological Association's Annual Meeting - The Third International Dystonia Symposium in Miami, Florida on October 9-11, 1996.<P>

Commenting on the results, Dr. Jan Wallace, Athena's vice president for clinical and regulatory affairs said, "We believe that the results of this Phase II study underscore the efficacy of BotB in the treatment of patients with cervical dystonia.  The data from this and earlier studies will enable us to select the appropriate BotB dose for following pivotal Phase III studies, which, subject to FDA review, we hope to commence later this year."<P>

Elan's chief executive officer, Donal Geaney commented, "I am pleased that we are able to announce the first product and research news following our acquisition of Athena.  These products, when approved, will expand our growing portfolio of directly marketed products and are the first steps in our program to exploit the strengths of the enlarged Elan."<P>

Elan Corporation, plc is a leading worldwide drug delivery company with innovative drug absorption technologies designed to improve patient care in a cost-effective manner.  Its principal research and manufacturing facilities are in Ireland, the United States and Israel.  Athena Neurosciences, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elan, discovers, develops and market products to be used primarily by neurologists for the treatment and diagnosis of neurological disorders.<P>

<b>
ELAN ANNOUNCES 66 PER CENT GAIN IN FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME AND 35 PER CENT GAIN FOR YEAR

</b>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<p>


Dublin, Ireland, May 2, 1996: Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) today announced net income of IR£18,027,000 (US$28,338,000) or 44 pence ($.70) per share for the quarter ended March 31, 1996, an increase of 66 per cent from net income of IR£10,852,000 or 30 pence per share for the quarter ended March 31, 1995.  Total revenues for the quarter increased by 58 per cent to IR£47,117,000 ($74,068,000) for the quarter from IR£29,749,000.

<br>
<p>

Net income for the year ended March 31, 1996 rose 35 per cent to IR£56,444,000 (US$88,730,000) or IR£1.51 ($2.38) per share from IR£41,682,000 or IR£1.17 per share for the year ended March 31, 1995.  Total revenues increased by 19 per cent to IR£141,686,000 ($222,730,000) for the year from IR£118,899,000.  For fiscal 1996, operating income increased by 25 per cent.

<br>
<p>

Product sales, which include sales from contract manufacturing activities for Elans client companies and sales of Elan-marketed products, increased by 82 per cent to IR£25,662,000 ($40,341,000) for the fourth quarter of 1996, compared to IR£14,043,000 for the fourth quarter of 1995, due to initial shipments of Naprelan® CR to the Wyeth-Ayerst division of American Home Products, our marketing partner in the United States of America; Herbesser® HP (a high potency once-daily formulation of diltiazem) to Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd, our marketing partner in Japan; and Theodur® Sprinkle to Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation our marketing partner in Japan.  For fiscal 1996, product sales increased by 15 per cent to IR£65,569,000 ($103,075,000).  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 revenue from product sales (including royalties) comprised 70 per cent of total revenues compared with 65 per cent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.

<br>
<p>

Royalties and fees for the fourth quarter of 1996 increased to IR£14,834,000 (US$23,319,000) compared to IR£12,648,000, an increase of 17 per cent.  Royalty income increased by 37 per cent over the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, reflecting primarily increased royalties from the sales of Cardizem® CD and other marketed products in Europe and Asia.

<br>
<p>

Research and development revenues, reflecting reimbursement by client companies, increased to IR£6,621,000 (US$10,408,000) for the fourth quarter of 1996 compared to IR£3,058,000 in the fourth quarter of 1995.  Research revenue received from Advanced Therapeutic Systems, Ltd (ATS) was IR£4,709,000 ($7,403,000) for the quarter where ATS is funding the development of seven new drug delivery technologies and in excess of 15 products in varying stages of clinical development from pre-clinical through Phase III clinical trials.

<br>
<p>

Research and development expenditure, not otherwise funded by Elans clients, increased to IR£7,084,000 ($11,136,000) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 compared to IR£4,966,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.  Cost of goods and services (primarily research) sold increased to IR£19,973,000 ($31,398,000) compared to IR£9,767,000 reflecting (1) the cost associated with new product launches in the United States of America and in Japan and (2) clinical trial costs on funded research activities where milestone payments pursuant to licence agreements have yet to be met.  Selling, general and administrative costs increased by 1 per cent in the fourth quarter to IR£5,362,000 ($8,429,000).

<br>
<p>
 
Reflecting all of the above, operating income increased by 52 per cent to IR£14,698,000 ($23,105,000) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 compared to IR£9,690,000 in the fourth quarter of 1995.  Reflecting essentially higher interest and similar income offset in part by a higher share of losses of associates, net income before tax for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 increased by 67 per cent to IR£18,073,000 ($28,410,000) compared to IR£10,834,000 in the fourth quarter of 1995.

<br>
<p>

The number of weighted average common and common share equivalent shares increased by 5 per cent over the preceding year and by 14 per cent over the comparable quarter in the preceding year reflecting the issuance of the 1990 Series warrants in November 1995 and the increase in the share price since December 1995 resulting in a higher number of common share equivalents in the calculation.

<br>
<p>

Elan expects its pending merger with Athena Neurosciences, Inc to close by June 30, 1996.

<BR Clear=All><P>
<b>Creates the largest integrated drug delivery company with discovery, development, marketing and manufacturing capabilities<P>
New York (March 18, 1996) -- Elan Corporation, plc (NYSE: ELN) ("Elan") and Athena Neurosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATHN) ("Athena"), announced today that they have signed a definitive merger agreement whereby Athena will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elan.</b><P>
<BR Clear=All>
<BR Clear=All><P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Athena's shareholders will receive 0.2956 Elan American Depositary Shares for each Common Share of Athena they own at the time the transaction closes.   Based on the closing price of Elan on March 15, 1996 of $61.25, the agreement values Athena at $18.25 per share.  In the all-share transaction, 9.74 million new Elan shares will be issued for the currently outstanding Athena shares.  The merger will be accounted for as a purchase and has been structured as a tax-free transaction for United States tax purposes.  The merger is expected to be completed by early Summer, subject to the approval of the shareholders of Elan and Athena, and the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals.  The transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on Elan's earnings in 1996 but should be accretive to earnings in 1997 and thereafter.<P>
Following the merger, Elan will be an integrated drug delivery and bio-pharmaceutical company with expanded capabilities in the discovery, development and marketing of treatments for CNS diseases and disorders supporting its existing strengths in drug delivery.<P>
"This merger advances our mind-to-market strategy by adding research, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities to Elan's expertise in drug delivery and development.  With Athena's complementary skills, we will now be able to employ AthenaÌs infrastructure to market products directly to providers," said Donal J. Geaney, president and chief executive officer of Elan.<P>
"We will be adding pioneering research in the CNS area to our existing multiple sclerosis program.  Additionally, we will be better positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities created by the continued consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry as well as broaden our relationships with our drug delivery clients," Mr. Geaney continued.<P>
To Elan's expertise in formulating, testing, registering and manufacturing products, Athena adds experience in drug discovery and biotechnology as well as strong marketing and distribution to neurologists.  Together, these resources comprise all elements necessary to bring innovative products to market.<P>
After the merger Elan will have strong scientific infrastructure in neurological research with marketed products for the treatment of epilepsy and ParkinsonÌs disease; products in development for multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, neuromuscular disorders and Parkinson's disease;  and potential products in discovery for the treatment and prevention of AlzheimerÌs disease and multiple sclerosis.  In addition, Athena has a diagnostic subsidiary which has recently introduced a series of testing services for the diagnosis of AlzheimerÌs disease.<P>
Elan will increase its access to neurologists in the United States through Athena's top five recognised neurology marketing force of 42 specialists in pharmaceutical sales and 12 in diagnostic services.  As a result, Elan will be able to leverage Athena's market presence potentially to introduce its own products such as Neurelan&reg (fampridine), a new treatment for multiple sclerosis currently undergoing clinical trials.  The merger also benefits Elan by enhancing its existing operations, creating new opportunities for growth and reshaping Elan's revenue mix so that a greater proportion of its revenue is based on the marketing of a strong pipeline of products.<P>
John Groom, currently president and chief executive officer of Athena will be joining Elan's existing management team, led by chief executive officer Donal J. Geaney.  Mr. Groom will serve as chief operating officer of Elan and will also continue to manage Athena.  Dennis J. Selkoe, M.D., Athena co-founder and Harvard University professor of neurology, and Mr. Groom will join the Elan board of directors.<P>
When the merger is completed, Elan will principally comprise three operating divisions, reporting to Mr. Groom:<P>
<b>Elan Technologies</b>, which will focus on the development and application of advanced drug delivery systems;<P>
<b>Elan Pharma</b>, which will conduct the company's U.S. non-neurological sales and marketing efforts and Elan's joint ventures worldwide; and<P>
<b>Athena</b>, which will continue to discover, develop and market therapeutic agents for the diagnosis and treatment of central neurological diseases and disorders.<P>
In addition, the nutrition/diagnostic division of Elan and the diagnostics division of Athena will continue as separate operating units.<P>
"This merger provides Athena the opportunity to expand our business worldwide and optimize our neurology focus through Elan's drug delivery systems, manufacturing capabilities and financial resources," said Mr. Groom.  "These vital assets will allow us to accelerate our efforts in scientific research to identify new compounds that treat neurological diseases.  Since the inception of Athena, we have focused our discovery efforts on building a leading position in the area of Alzheimer's disease.  The merger provides added opportunity for Elan's shareholders to share in the potential success of these efforts and for Athena shareholders to participate in the continued success of Elan's strong presence in drug delivery."<P>
Both Elan and Athena have had recent success in gaining regulatory clearances.  In the last two months, Elan received United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") clearance to market Naprelan&reg (naproxen sodium), an anti-arthritic treatment and Athena obtained contingent approval from the FDA for Zanaflex&reg (tizanidine hydrochloride), a potential new treatment for spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury.<P>
Athena was founded in 1986 to discover, develop and market products to be used primarily by neurologists for the treatment and diagnosis of neurological diseases and disorders.<P>
Elan's chairman Donald E. Panoz commenting on the transaction said: "On behalf of the Board, I welcome Dr. Selkoe and Mr. Groom as members of our board of directors and look forward to the merger and the benefits it will create for Elan and Athena shareholders."<P>
Elan is a leading world-wide drug delivery company with innovative drug absorption technologies designed to improve patient care in a cost-effective manner.  Its principal research and manufacturing facilities are in Ireland, Israel and the United States.  Elan is best known for developing the advanced drug delivery technology used in Cardizem SR&reg (diltiazem hydrochloride), Cardizem CD&reg (diltiazem hydrochloride), and Verelan&reg (verapamil hydrochloride) -- all anti-hypertensive treatments.<P>
Except for historical information, this press release contains certain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  In addition to the matters described in this press release, the success of integration of operations, the degree of dilution, the success of product approvals and marketing opportunities for each companyÌs products, and the success in discovery research as well as the risk factors listed from time to time in Elan and Athena's SEC reports may affect the actual results achieved by Elan and Athena.  Elan and Athena disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.<P>

ATHLONE, IRELAND, and PHILADELPHIA, PA, January 8, 1996. Naprelan&reg; (naproxen sodium), a once-a-day formulation of the popular arthritis medication Naprosyn&reg; (naproxen) has been cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Elan Corporation, plc. (NYSE:ELN) and Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories, a division of American Home Products Corporation (NYSE:AHP) announced today.

<BR Clear=All>
<BR Clear=All>
Naprelan&reg; is the first prescription product to offer convenient once-a-day dosing of naproxen, a medication long considered a standard in arthritis treatment. Naproxen or naproxen sodium-based products account for nearly one in every five prescriptions written for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the United States. (Naproxen sodium, a sodium salt formulation of naproxen, provides for more rapid absorption).<P>
Naprelan&reg; tablets use a proprietary delivery system, IPDASTM (Intestinal Protective Drug Absorption System), a matrix of naproxen sodium with immediate and controlled release components. Upon ingestion, and after rapid disintegration of the tablet matrix, an initial fraction (30% approximately) of the medication is released for rapid systemic absorption achieving onset of analgesic action within 30 minutes. In addition a sustained-release component of microparticles provide an extended absorption phase which both minimizes local gastrointestinal concentrations and prolongs therapeutic systemic levels of the drug, enabling 24-hour duration of action and once-a-day dosing<SUP><SMALL>2-4</SMALL></SUP>.<P>
 "While most once-a-day NSAIDs provide extended relief at the expense of immediate. relief, Naprelan&reg; offers patients rapid onset with sustained action, while minimising the risk of local gastrointestinal irritation" said Marc Deitch, M.D., Senior Vice President, Medical Affairs and Medical Director for Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. "This is an important therapeutic advantage for people with arthritis who desire rapid symptomatic relief but want the convenience of medication that is taken only once a day".<P>
Naprosyn<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> has been used safely and effectively worldwide for 20 years and is one of the NSAIDs most widely used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety profile of Naprosyn<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP>. Naprelan<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> offers the same efficacy and safety profile as Naprosyn<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> with the added advantage of once-a-day dosing. The most frequent complaints relate to the gastrointestinal tract. In patients treated chronically with NSAID therapy, serious gastrointestinal toxicity such as perforation, ulceration and bleeding can occur.<P>
"The approval of Naprelan<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> marks another important milestone in the development of Elan" said Donal Geaney, Elan's President & Chief Executive Officer. "This product which uses our unique IPDASTM delivery technology, will benefit Arthritis sufferers by providing safe and convenient medication to combat this debilitating disease."<P>
Robert Essner, President of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories notes that "Arthritis takes a tremendous toll on individuals, and experience tells us that no one arthritis medication is right for everyone. The approval of Naprelan<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> is very exciting because it adds another product to our well established line of NSAIDs and allows us to offer more options for physicians and patients suffering from the chronic pain of arthritis. The spectrum of products also enables us to better serve the needs of our large managed care customers, in effect offering "one-stop shopping" for all of their NSAID needs."<P>
Elan is a leading worldwide drug delivery company with innovative drug absorption technologies designed to improve patient care in a cost effective manner. Its principal research and manufacturing facilities are in Ireland and the United States of America.<P>
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories is a major research-oriented pharmaceutical company with leading products in the areas of women's health care, cardiovascular and metabolic disease therapies, central nervous system drugs, anti-inflammatory agents, vaccines, infant nutritionals and generic pharmaceuticals.<P>
American Home Products Corporation ranks among the top companies in the world in sales of pharmaceuticals and health-care products. It is also a leader in agricultural products, animal health care, medical devices and food products.<P>

<BR Clear=All><P>
<h3>General</h3></ul></ul><P>
Elan's revenues are generated by (i) licence fees relating to the attainment by Elan of milestones under existing licence arrangements, fees received pursuant to new licence arrangements and royalties from sales by third parties of Elan-developed products, (ii) the manufacturing and distribution of such drug products and of medical nutrition and diagnostic products and (iii) research revenues. In the drug delivery area, Elan carries out development projects for client companies for which Elan is remunerated or, alternatively, develops products for its own account and subsequently markets such products through licence arrangements with clients or by way of joint ventures. Elan generally manufactures the products it develops and, when such products are marketed, either by a client or through a joint venture, manufacturing revenues arise. In addition, if a client markets an Elan developed product, royalty revenues are generated.<P>
Historically, the contributions to total revenues generated from each of the three sources described above have varied considerably from period to period. In addition, each of these sources results in significantly different gross margins (for example licencing and royalty revenues generally result in significantly higher gross margins than manufacturing and research revenues) and the gross margins of each of the different products manufactured or licenced by Elan may vary significantly. Furthermore, during the initial period following the launch of a new product, gross margins relating to the sale of such newly launched product may be adversely affected by the start-up costs related to its launch. Therefore, the comparability of gross margins from period to period will be affected by the source of revenues earned, the mix of products sold and the introduction of new products during such periods.<P>
For the periods set forth below, a significant portion of Elan's revenues were derived from four products: Verelan, Cardizem SR, Naprelan and Cardizem CD. There can be no assurance that Elan's products will continue to be accepted in the market place or that Elan will be successful in developing and marketing new products.<P>
Elan's income for the periods set forth below was largely exempt from taxation pursuant to Irish legislation which exempts income which is derived from qualifying patents from Irish income taxation. Currently, there is no termination date in effect for such exemption. Elan's manufacturing income, which also receives certain tax relief pursuant to Irish legislation, was taxed at a rate of 10% in Ireland for the periods set forth below. Such relief will be available to Elan until 31 December, 2010.<P>
Elan records its transactions and prepares its financial statements in Irish pounds. To date, Elan has denominated most of its contracts in U.S. dollars. In periods when the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Irish pound, Irish pound earnings may be enhanced. However, in periods when the U.S. dollar depreciates against the Irish pound, Irish pound earnings may be reduced. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Irish pound and the U.S. dollar also affect the book value of Elan's assets and the amount of its shareholders' funds. Elan manages its foreign exchange risk primarily through forward currency contracts.<P>
Effective 1 April, 1996, the Company changed its fiscal year end from 31 March to 31 December to bring the Company's reporting schedule into line with the majority of companies quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Results of Operations 1996 Compared with 1995</h3></ul></ul><P>
Total turnover for fiscal 1996 increased by 19% to IR£141,686,000 from IR£118,899,000 for fiscal 1995. Product sales increased by 15% in fiscal 1996 to IR£65,569,000 from IR£57,070,000 in fiscal 1995. Product sales from Cardizem SR continued to decline during fiscal 1996 because Elan's licencee, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. ("HMR") has been marketing Cardizem CD in preference to Cardizem SR since the introduction of Cardizem CD in the third quarter of fiscal 1992. Elan manufactures all Cardizem SR while Cardizem CD is principally manufactured by HMR. To date, HMR's shift in marketing emphasis from Cardizem SR to Cardizem CD, since the third quarter of fiscal 1992, has not materially affected Elan's financial results and, based in part on a superior royalty with regard to Cardizem CD, Elan expects that its results in future periods should not be materially adversely impacted by such marketing shift. Royalties increased by 17% to IR£21,074,000 in fiscal 1996 from IR£18,039,000 in fiscal 1995, primarily reflecting the switch from Cardizem SR to Cardizem CD discussed above and royalties from sales of new products and sales of existing products in new markets. Licence and option fees increased by 42% to IR£32,273,000 in fiscal 1996 from IR£22,659,000 in fiscal 1995 reflecting the attainment by Elan of certain milestones pursuant to existing licence arrangements and fees received pursuant to the grant by Elan of licences or options with respect to a number of its pharmaceutical products. Research revenues increased by 8% to IR£22,770,000 in fiscal 1996 from IR£21,131,000 in fiscal 1995. Research revenues from Advanced Therapeutic Systems, Limited ("ATS") increased 1% to IR£16,913,000 in fiscal 1996 from IR£16,784,000 in fiscal 1995 and research revenues from other industry partners increased by 35% to IR£5,854,000 in fiscal 1996 from IR£4,347,000 in fiscal 1995.<P>
Cost of sales increased from IR£38,739,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£51,688,000 in fiscal 1996, an increase of 33%. The gross margin decreased from 67% in fiscal 1995 to 64% in fiscal 1996, reflecting certain costs associated with the scale-up and manufacture of pre-launch requirements of Naprelan (including personnel recruitment, training and associated facility costs) and an increased level of activity on client-sponsored development projects. Selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses decreased by 11% from IR£23,401,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£20,852,000 in fiscal 1996, reflecting on-going Company-wide cost containment efforts. Research and development expense increased from IR£17,663,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£20,311,000 in fiscal 1996, an increase of 15%.<P>
Operating profit increased 25% from IR£39,096,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£48,835,000 in fiscal 1996 as a result of the matters referred to above. Interest and other income increased 89% from IR£8,752,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£16,564,000 in fiscal 1996 reflecting improved investment returns, higher average cash and marketable investment security balances and gains arising on the disposal of securities. Interest expense increased from IR£5,776,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£5,801,000 in fiscal 1996, primarily reflecting interest on the LYONs. Share of losses of associates increased by 65% to IR£2,611,000 in fiscal 1996 from IR£1,585,000 in fiscal 1995, reflecting the inclusion of Elan's share of losses of NalÈ Laboratories, plc off-set in part by improved operating results from the Company's joint ventures.<P>
As a result of the above, profit before provision for income taxes and minority interests was IR£56,987,000 in fiscal 1996 compared to IR£40,487,000 in fiscal 1995. A provision for income taxes of IR£340,000 in fiscal 1996 was made compared to IR£433,000 in fiscal 1995. Minority interest decreased from IR£1,628,000 of losses attributable to minority interests in fiscal 1995 to IR£203,000 of profits attributable to minority interests in fiscal 1996, reflecting the acquisition in February, 1995 by the Company, of the minority interest in Elan Medical Technologies, Limited. After provision for income taxes and minority interests, Elan's retained profit for fiscal 1996 was IR£56,444,000 compared to IR£41,682,000 in fiscal 1995.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Results of Operations 1995 Compared with 1995</h3></ul></ul><P>
Total turnover for fiscal 1995 increased by 11% to IR£118,899,000 from IR£107,023,000 for fiscal 1994. Product sales decreased by 3% in fiscal 1995 to IR£57,070,000 from IR£58,865,000 in fiscal 1994. In U.S. dollar terms, product sales increased by 9% in fiscal 1995 compared with fiscal 1994. Manufacturing revenues from Cardizem SR continued to decline during fiscal 1995 because Elan's licencee, HMR has been marketing Cardizem CD in preference to Cardizem SR since the introduction of Cardizem CD in the third quarter of fiscal 1992. Elan manufactures all Cardizem SR while Cardizem CD is principally manufactured by HMR. To date, HMR's shift in marketing emphasis from Cardizem SR to Cardizem CD, since the third quarter of fiscal 1992, has not materially affected Elan's financial results and, based in part on a superior royalty with regard to Cardizem CD, Elan expects that its results in future periods should not be materially adversely impacted by such marketing shift. Royalties decreased by 10% to IR£18,039,000 in fiscal 1995 from IR£19,968,000 in fiscal 1994. In U.S. dollar terms, royalties rose by 2% from fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1995, primarily reflecting the switch from Cardizem SR to Cardizem CD discussed above and a legal settlement recorded in fiscal 1994 in which Elan received previously disputed royalties. Licence and option fees increased by 68% to IR£22,659,000 in fiscal 1995 from IR£13,477,000 in fiscal 1994 reflecting the attainment by Elan of certain milestones pursuant to existing licence arrangements and fees received pursuant to the grant by Elan of licences or options with respect to a number of its pharmaceutical products. Research revenues increased by 44% to IR£21,131,000 in fiscal 1995, of which IR£16,784,000 was contributed by ATS, from IR£14,713,000 in fiscal 1994, of which IR£4,700,000 was contributed by ATS.<P>
Cost of sales increased from IR£36,699,000 in fiscal 1994 to IR£38,739,000 in fiscal 1995, an increase of 6%. The gross margin increased from 66% in fiscal 1994 to 67% in fiscal 1995. Selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses decreased by 14% from IR£27,118,000 in fiscal 1994 to IR£23,401,000 in fiscal 1995, reflecting reduced litigation costs, the benefits from the consolidation of Elan's nutrition and diagnostic businesses, Company-wide cost containment efforts and the launch costs associated with the "Hearty Balance" range of nutrition supplements in fiscal 1994.<P>
In early fiscal 1995, Elan instituted a review of its nutrition and diagnostic businesses. This review led to a decision to integrate these businesses into a single entity organised on a divisional basis with a stronger marketing focus.<P>
Operating profit before one-time charges increased 34% from IR£29,083,000 in fiscal 1994 to IR£39,096,000 in fiscal 1995 as a result of the matters referred to above. Interest and other income decreased by 25% from IR£11,730,000 in fiscal 1994 to IR£8,752,000 in fiscal 1995 reflecting a change in investment strategy to securities with a duration of twelve months or less. Interest expense decreased from IR£5,798,000 in fiscal 1994 to IR£5,776,000 in fiscal 1995, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Irish pound and its effect on interest on the LYONs. Share of losses of associates increased by 61% to IR£1,585,000 in fiscal 1995 from IR£985,000 in fiscal 1994, primarily due to increased losses arising from the Company's joint ventures. Minority interest increased by 3% to IR£1,628,000 in fiscal 1995 from IR£1,577,000 in fiscal 1994.<P>
During fiscal 1994, the acquisition of Drug Research Corporation, plc ("DRC"), which was completed in July 1993, gave rise to a one-time charge of IR£59,329,000 representing the write-off of acquired in-process research and development pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 2 "Accounting for Research and Development Costs". There was no net effect on Elan's capitalisation due to the issuance of Elan equity in payment for the acquisition. The successful completion of the ATS Rights Offering in August 1993 gave rise to a one-time charge of IR£25,802,000 representing Elan's cash contribution to ATS.<P>
As a result of the above, profit before provision for income taxes and minority interests was IR£40,487,000 in fiscal 1995 compared to a loss before taxes and minority interests of IR£51,101,000 in fiscal 1994.  A provision for income taxes of IR£433,000 in fiscal 1995 was made compared to IR£797,000 in fiscal 1994. After provision for income taxes and minority interests, Elan's retained profit for fiscal 1995 was IR£41,682,000 compared to a retained loss of IR£50,321,000 in fiscal 1994.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h3></ul></ul><P>
The Company's working capital increased from IR£134,930,000 in fiscal 1995 to IR£272,942,000 in fiscal 1996 primarily reflecting the exercise of 5.3 million 1990 series warrants in November 1995, from which Elan received approximately US$81,000,000 and cash flow from operations. During fiscal 1996, cash and cash equivalents increased from IR£22,082,000 at 31 March, 1995 to IR£64,263,000 at 31 March, 1996 in part due to the above.<P>
During fiscal 1997, Elan has planned capital expenditure of IR£7,500,000 and anticipates that its overall capital expenditure for fiscal 1997 may equal or exceed 1996 levels.<P>
Elan believes that its current manufacturing, research, product development and corporate facilities are adequate for its current and projected needs. Elan will use its capital to make such capital expenditure as is necessary from time to time and also to make such investments in the purchase or licencing of products and technologies and in marketing and other alliances with third parties to support Elan's long-term strategic objectives.<P>
Elan has a purchase option to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of ATS. If Elan exercises its purchase option, it will be required to pay the purchase option price in cash, Elan Ordinary Shares, or in some combination thereof. In addition, in connection with the exercise of the purchase option, the Company may be required to incur a one-time charge relating to the acquisition of in-process research and development, which charge may be significant.<P>
On 18 March, 1996, Elan entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (" the Merger Agreement") to acquire Athena Neurosciences, Inc. ("Athena"). Athena is a pharmaceutical company which discovers, develops and markets therapeutic products and diagnostic services in the area of neurological disorders. Under the Merger Agreement, Athena shareholders will receive, for each Athena share, .2956 Elan ADSs (with each Elan ADS representing one Elan Ordinary share). The Merger Agreement values Athena at approximately US$600,000,000. The merger is currently subject to shareholder approval.<P>
On 28 March, 1996, Elan advanced a short term interest bearing loan of IR£91,669,000 to Warner Chilcott, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NalÈ Laboratories, plc, an associated undertaking, as a bridging loan facility, pending finalisation of financing for the acquisition of certain assets of Warner Chilcott, a division of the Warner-Lambert Company. This loan was repaid in full on 26 April, 1996. As part of the funding for this acquisition NalÈ offered, via a private placement, 69,000 units at US$1,400 per unit, each unit consisting of 35 ADSs of NalÈ and a US$1,000 Senior Subordinated Note Due 2001 of Warner Chilcott, Inc. A subsidiary of Elan purchased 26.6% of the units at a total cost of US$25,696,000. A second subsidiary of Elan committed to purchase any unsubscribed units. At 30 April, 1996 that subsidiary held 24,130 units with a total cost of US$33,782,000 and such units are expected to be disposed of in the immediate future.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Prospective Information</h3></ul></ul><P>
Certain pharmaceutical products developed by Elan may face significant exposure from competitive brand names and generic competition during the next several years. These products, principally Verelan and Cardizem CD, use delivery systems which are patent protected until 2007 and 2011 respectively. In addition, HMR holds patents over Cardizem CD which expire in 2011. Other forms of sustained-release diltiazem and verapamil are reported to be in development by other companies. It is not possible to predict the impact of possible future competitors on sales of Cardizem CD and Verelan.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Inflation</h3></ul></ul><P>
Inflation had no material impact on Elan's operations during the period.<P><P>

<BR Clear=All><P>
<h3>To the Shareholders of Elan Corporation, plc</h3></ul></ul><P>
We have audited the financial statements on pages 25 to 50, we have also examined the amounts disclosed relating to the emoluments and share options of the directors in the section "Corporate Governance".<P>
<BR Clear=All>
<ul><ul><h3>Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors in relation to the financial statements</h3></ul></ul><P>
As described on page 19, the Company¼s directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on our audit, on those statements and to report our opinion to you.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Basis of opinion</h3></ul></ul><P>
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group¼s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.<P>
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.<P>
<BR Clear=All><P>
<ul><ul><h3>Opinion</h3></ul></ul><P>
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 March, 1996 and of the profit for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990 and all Regulations to be construed as one with those Acts.<P>
We have obtained all the information and explanations we considered necessary for the purposes of our audit. In our opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the Company. The balance sheet of the Company is in agreement with the books of account.<P>
In our opinion, the information given in the directors¼ report is consistent with the financial statements.<P>
The net assets of the Company, as stated in the balance sheet, are more than half of the amount of its called up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 March, 1996 a financial situation which, under Section 40 (1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983, would require the convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the Company.<P>

<ul>
<ul><ul><h2>Reconciliation between Irish and US Accounting Principles</h2></ul></ul>


<P>
The financial statements of the Company set out on pages 25 to
50 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applicable in Ireland (&igrave;Irish GAAP&icirc;) which
differ in certain significant respects from those applicable in
the US (&igrave;US GAAP&icirc;). The significant material differences
as they apply to the Companys financial statements are
as follows:
<ul><ul><h3>(a) Financial fixed assets</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
Under Irish GAAP financial fixed assets are stated at cost less
provision for permanent diminution in value. Under US GAAP in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
115 &igrave;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities&icirc; certain financial fixed assets of the Company
would be classified as available for sale and reported at fair
value with unrealised gains and losses being excluded from earnings
and reported in a separate component of shareholders equity
(net of tax).
<ul><ul><h3>(b) Financial statement format</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
Under US GAAP the format of the financial statements and certain
note disclosures differ from those under Irish GAAP. The Company
will be preparing a US Securities and Exchange Commission Form
20-F annual report in accordance with US GAAP which will be available
on request to all shareholders on or about 30 June, 1996.
<P>
The following is a summary of the material adjustments to profit
and shareholders equity which would be required had the
financial statements been prepared in accordance with US GAAP:<p>
<strong></i>(i) Earnings per share</em></strong>

<P>
Refer to note 21 of these financial statements for details of
the basis of calculation under both Irish and US GAAP.<p>
</i>(ii) Effect on profit/(loss) for the years ended 31 March,</em>
1994, 1995 and 1996</strong>

<P>
Nil effect for the years ended 31 March, 1994, 1995 and 1996.<p>
</i>(iii) Effect on shareholders equity at 31 March,</strong></em>

<TITLE>Corporate Governance</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="images/paper1.gif" TEXT="#03056b"><p>

<ul><ul><ul>
<h2>Corporate Governance</h2>
<br><br><h3>Policies</H3></ul></ul>

<P>
Elan is committed to the highest standard of corporate governance
and compliance with best practice in Ireland. The Company complies
with all of the provisions of the Cadbury Code of Best Practice
save for the disclosure of the remuneration of the directors which
is disclosed in accordance with the Companies Act 1963 to 1990
and in compliance with the regulations of the Irish Stock Exchange.
<P>
The role of chairman and chief executive are separate and the
board includes ten non-executive directors who constitute a clear
majority of the board. The board regularly reviews the respective
responsibilities of the board, its committees and of management.
The board has reserved certain matters to its exclusive jurisdiction,
thereby maintaining its control of the company and its future
direction. All directors are appointed by the board, as nominated
by its organisation and compensation committee, and subsequently
re-appointed by the shareholders. No director has a service contract.
Procedures are in place where directors, in furtherance of their
duties, take independent professional advice if necessary, at
the Company's expense.
<ul><ul><br><br><h3>Committees of the Board</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The board has delegated authority over certain areas of the Company's
activities to three committees as more fully explained below.
In addition, a scientific advisory committee provides senior management
with an independent overview of the Company's research
and development activities.
<ul><ul><br><br><h3>Executive</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The executive committee exercises the management authority of
the board during the interval between board meetings.
<br>
<ul><ul>
D.E. Panoz, Chairman 
<br>
J. Balog
<br>
D.J. Geaney
<br>
T.G. Lynch
<br><br><h3>Audit</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The audit committee, composed entirely of non-executive directors,
helps the board oversee the Company's accounting and reporting
practices. The audit committee periodically reviews the effectiveness
of the system of internal control. It monitors the adequacy of
internal accounting practices, procedures and controls, and reviews
all significant changes in accounting policies. It also addresses
all issues raised and recommendations made by the external auditors.
<P>
<ul><ul>C. Greyston, Chairman
<br>
B.E. Boushel</ul></ul>
<ul><ul><br><br><h3>Organisation and Compensation</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The organisation and compensation committee, composed entirely
of non-executive directors, reviews the compensation philosophy
and policies of the Company with respect to executive compensation,
fringe benefits and other compensation matters. The committee
also considers nominations to the board of directors and makes
recommendations thereon, as appropriate. The committee also administers
the Company's stock option plans and determines the compensation
of the chief executive officer.
<P>
<ul><ul>D.E. Panoz, Chairman
<br>
B.E. Boushel
<br>
K. McIntyre</ul></ul>
<ul><ul><br><br><h3>Scientific Advisory</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The scientific advisory committee advises the senior management
on scientific matters that include major internal projects, interaction
with academic and other outside research organisations, and the
acquisition of technologies and products.
<P>

<br>

J.G. Devane, PhD.
<br>
D.J. Geaney
<br>
R.M. Kartzinel, M.D., PhD.
<br>
J.R. Koepke M.D.
<br>
J. Loscalzo M.D., PhD.
<br>
D.H. Mason M.D.
<br>
K. McIntyre M.D.</ul></ul>
<P>
Dr. Loscalzo is Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Biochemistry
at Boston University School of Medicine and Director of the Whitaker
Cardiovascular Institute. Dr. Koepke retired in 1994 from Duke
University where he was Professor of Pathology and an Associate
Professor of Medicine. Biographical details of other members of
the committee are included elsewhere in this report.
<ul><ul><br><br><h3>Internal Control</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the Company's
system of internal financial control. Management is responsible
for the planning and implementation of the system of internal
financial control and ensuring that these controls apply throughout
the Company. The audit committee reviews the quarterly and annual
financial statements and the nature and scope of the external
audit. Any significant findings, audit or accounting issues or
other business risks are reported by the committee to the board
of directors.

<P>
The system of internal financial control is designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement
or loss.
<P>
The Company's system is designed to provide the directors
with reasonable assurance that physical and financial assets are
safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded properly
and material irregularities are either prevented or will be detected
with the minimum of delay.
<P>
The organisation structure of the Company under the day to day
direction of its chief executive is clear. Defined lines of responsibility
and delegation of authority have been established within which
the Company's activities can be planned, executed, controlled
and monitored to achieve the strategic objectives which the board
have adopted for the Company.
<P>
The Company has a comprehensive system for reporting financial
results to the board. This includes a budgeting system with an
annual budget approved by the board. The board compare actual
results with budgeted results regularly. Management accounts are
prepared on a timely basis. They include profit and loss account,
balance sheet, cash flow and capital expenditure reporting together
with an analysis of the performance of key operating divisions
and subsidiaries.
<ul><ul><br><br><h3>Going Concern</h3></ul></ul>

<P>
The directors, having made enquiries, believe that the Company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future and that it is appropriate to continue
to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the financial statements.

<H1>Act 87 of 1986</H1>
<P>AN ACT regarding warranties on new motor vehicles; to require certain

vehicles.</P>
<P>The People of the State of Michigan enact:</P>

<H2>257.1402 Repair of defect or condition; report.</H2>
<P>Sec. 2. If a new motor vehicle has any defect or condition that impairs the
use or value of the new motor vehicle to the consumer or which prevents the new
motor vehicle from conforming to the manufacturer's express warranty, the
manufacturer or a new motor vehicle dealer of that type of motor vehicle shall
repair the defect or condition as required under section 3 if the consumer
initially reported the defect or condition to the manufacturer or the new motor
vehicle dealer within 1 of the following time periods, whichever is earlier:</P>
<P>(a) During the term the manufacturer's express warranty is  in effect.</P>
<P>b) Not later than 1 year from the date of delivery of the new motor vehicle
to the original consumer.</P>
<P><B>257.1403 Replacement of motor vehicle or refund; allowance for use;
reimbursement for towing costs and costs for rental vehicle; consent to
replacement of security interest; presumption; performing repairs after
expiration of warranty; extension of time for repair services.</B></P>
<P>Sec. 3. (1) If a defect or condition which was reported to the manufacturer
or new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to section 2 continues to exist and the new
motor vehicle has been subject to a reasonable number of repairs as determined
under subsection (3), the manufacturer shall within 30 days have the option to
either replace the new motor vehicle with a comparable replacement motor vehicle
currently in production and acceptable to the consumer or accept return of the
vehicle and refund to the consumer the full purchase price including the cost of
any options or other modifications installed or made by or for the manufacturer,
and the amount of all other charges made by or for the manufacturer, less a
reasonable allowance for the consumer's use of the vehicle not exceeding 10
cents per mile driven at the time of the initial report of the same defect or
conditions or 10% of the purchase price of the vehicle, whichever is less, and
less an amount equal to any appraised damage that is not attributable to normal
use or to the defect or condition. A reasonable allowance for use is that amount
directly attributable to use by the consumer and any previous consumer prior to
his or her first report of a defect or condition that impairs the use or value
of the new motor vehicle to the manufacturer, its agents, or the new motor
vehicle dealer. Whenever a vehicle is replaced or refunded under the provisions
of this section, in those instances in which towing services and rental vehicles
were not made available without cost to the consumer, the manufacturer shall
also reimburse the consumer for those towing costs and reasonable costs for a
comparable rental vehicle that were incurred as a direct result of the defect or
condition.</P>
<P>(2) The provisions of this act shall not affect the obligations of a
consumer under a loan or sales contract or the secured interest of any secured
party. The secured party shall consent to the replacement of the security
interest with a corresponding security interest on a replacement motor vehicle
which is accepted by the consumer in exchange for the motor vehicle having a
defect or condition pursuant to subsection (1), if the replacement motor vehicle
is comparable in value to the original motor vehicle. If for any reason the
security interest in the new motor vehicle having a defect or condition pursuant
to subsection (1) is not able to be replaced with a  corresponding security
interest on a new motor vehicle accepted by the consumer, the consumer shall
accept a refund. Refunds required under this subsection or subsection (1) shall
be made to the consumer and the secured party, if any, as their interests exist
at the time the refund is to be made.</P>
<P>(3) It shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been
undertaken to repair any defect or condition if 1 of the following occurs:</P>
<P>(a) The same defect or condition that substantially impairs the use or value
of the new motor vehicle to the consumer has been subject to repair a total of 4
or more times by the manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer and the defect or
condition continues to exist. Any repair performed on the same defect made
pursuant to subsection (4) shall be included in calculating the number of
repairs under this section. The consumer or his or her representative, prior to
availing himself or herself of a remedy provided under subsection (1), and any
time after the third attempt to repair the same defect or condition, shall give
written notification, by return receipt service, to the manufacturer of the need
for repair of the defect or condition in order to allow the manufacturer an
opportunity to cure the defect or condition. The manufacturer shall notify the
consumer as soon as reasonably possible of a reasonably accessible repair
facility. After delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility, the
manufacturer shall have 5 business days to repair the defect or condition.</P>
<P>(b) The new motor vehicle is out of service because of repairs for a total
of 30 or more days or parts of days during the term of the manufacturer's
express warranty, or within 1 year from the date of delivery to the original
consumer, whichever is earlier. It shall be the responsibility of the consumer,
or his or her representative, prior to availing himself or herself of a remedy
provided under subsection (1), and after the vehicle has been out of service for
at least 25 days in a repair facility, to give written notification by return
receipt service to the manufacturer of the need for repair of the defect or
condition in order to allow the manufacturer an opportunity to cure the defect
or condition. The manufacturer shall notify the consumer as soon as reasonably
possible of a reasonably accessible repair facility. After delivery of the
vehicle to the designated repair facility, the manufacturer shall have 5
business days to repair the defect or condition.</P>
<P>(4) Any repairs required to be made under this act shall be made even if the
repairs cannot be performed until after the expiration of the manufacturer's
express warranty. </P>
<P>(5) The term of an express warranty, and the 1-year,  30-day, and 5-day
periods of time provided for in this section shall be extended because repair
services were not available to the consumer because of war; invasion; strike; or
fire, flood, or other natural disaster.</P>
<H2>257.1404 Other legal remedies not limited or prohibited.</H2>
<P>Sec. 4. Nothing in this act shall be construed to limit or prohibit any
other legal remedy of a consumer regarding a breach of a manufacturer's express
warranty or an implied warranty for a new motor vehicle.</P>
<H2>257.1405 Informal dispute settlement procedure.</H2>
<P>Sec. 5. If a manufacturer has established or participates in an informal
dispute settlement procedure, the provisions of this act shall not apply to any
consumer who has not first resorted to such procedure, if such procedure does
all of the following:</P>
<P>(a) Complies with the Magnuson-Moss warranty--federal trade commission
improvement act, Public Law 93-637, 88 Stat. 2183, and 16 C.F.R. 703 (1975). An
informal dispute settlement procedure which the federal trade commission rules
does not comply with 16 C.F.R. 703 (1975) shall be considered as not meeting the
requirements of this subdivision.</P>
<P>(b) Requires that the manufacturer is bound by any decision reached if the
consumer agrees to it.</P>
<P>(c) Provides that the consumer is not obligated to accept the decision and
may pursue the remedies provided for under this act.</P>
<P>(d) Requires the manufacturer to initiate the process necessary to implement
any final settlement not more than 30 days after the settlement has been
reached.</P>
<H2>257.1406 Defects or conditions to which act inapplicable.</H2>
<P>Sec. 6. This act does not apply to any defect or condition that is the
result of either of the following:</P>
<P>(a) Any modification or modifications not installed or made by or for the
manufacturer.</P>
<P>(b) Abuse or neglect of the new motor vehicle or damage due to an accident
which occurred after the new motor vehicle was purchased by the consumer.</P>
<P><B>257.1407 Waiver of rights and remedies prohibited; recovery  of costs,
expenses, and attorneys' fees.</B></P>
<P>Sec. 7. (1) Any rights and remedies provided a consumer under this act may
not be waived.</P>
<P>(2) A consumer who prevails in any action brought under this act may be
allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of cost and expenses, including attorneys' fees based on actual
time expended by the attorney, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the consumer for or in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action, unless the court in its discretion shall determine
that such an award of attorneys' fees would be inappropriate.</P>
<P><B>257.1408 Written statement to be included with title; type size; form.</B></P>
<P>Sec. 8. The secretary of state shall include with any title for a new motor
vehicle a written statement, in 10-point boldface type, in substantially the
following form: &quot;IMPORTANT: IF THIS VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE YOU MAY BE
ENTITLED UNDER STATE LAW TO REPLACEMENT OF IT OR A REFUND OF ITS PURCHASE PRICE.
TO OBTAIN REPLACEMENT OR A REFUND YOU MUST FIRST REPORT THE DEFECT IN WRITING TO
THE MANUFACTURER AND YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO FIRST ARBITRATE THE DISPUTE. IN
ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LAW, YOU SHOULD:</P>
<OL>
<LI> KEEP COPIES OF ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO AND FROM THE MANUFACTURER AND THE
DEALER.
</LI>
<LI> KEEP COPIES OF ALL WORK ORDERS FOR REPAIRS ON THE VEHICLE INCLUDING THE
DATE(S) THE WORK WAS PERFORMED AND THE MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF
REPAIR.
</LI>
<LI> FOLLOW ALL REQUIREMENTS OF THE WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY REQUIREMENT THAT
THE REPAIRS MUST BE DONE BY AN AUTHORIZED DEALER SPECIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LAW, CONSULT AN
ATTORNEY OR OTHER QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL.&quot;.
</LI>
</OL>
<H2>257.1409 Applicability of act.</H2>

original consumer on or after the effective date of this act.</P>

<H2>REVISIONS TO THE MICHIGAN &quot;LEMON LAW,&quot;</H2>
<H2>MCL &#167;&#167; 257.1401-.1410</H2>  
<HR>
<P><I>Internet Editor's note:  Appendix B material, Senate and House Analyses,
is not available on this format.</I></P>
<HR>
<P>The Michigan Lemon Law was enacted in 1986 to address the perception among
purchasers of new motor vehicles that their only recourse in the event they
purchased a defective vehicle was to pursue costly lawsuits in order to either
recover the purchase price or obtain a replacement vehicle. See House Bill 4854,
Senate Analysis, attached hereto as Appendix B.  Given that perception, the
Legislature concluded that such purchasers would elect to unload the &quot;lemon&quot;
on an unsuspecting person, at a considerable loss.  The Lemon Law was therefore
enacted to correct this situation. </P>
<P>In brief, the Law requires manufacturers to replace a new motor vehicle or
refund the purchase price if either of two events occur:  (1) the manufacturer
is unable to repair the vehicle after the same defect or condition has been
subject to repair four times, or (2) the vehicle has been out of service due to
repairs for 30 or more days during the first year following delivery.  MCL &#167;
257.1403.  The Law further requires that all vehicle titles contain a statement
advising purchasers of their rights under the Lemon Law.  MCL &#167; 257.1408.</P>
<P>Considering that ten years have intervened since its original enactment, the
Commission examined the Lemon Law to determine whether it could or should be
improved.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</H3>
<P>The report that follows was prepared by Helen Melia, Tracey Prosser, and
Professor Kent Syverud, all of the University of Michigan Law School.  They
identified eight subjects for possible revision and posed the following
questions:</P>
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI> Should the scope of coverage of the Lemon Law be expanded to include lease
vehicles?  </LI>
<LI>  Should the scope of coverage of the Lemon Law be expanded to include used
vehicles?
</LI>
<LI>  Should the scope of coverage of the Lemon Law be expanded to include
commercial and recreational vehicles?
</LI>
<LI>  Should the scope of coverage of the Lemon Law be expanded to include
dual-purpose (i.e., part-time personal, part-time business use) vehicles?
</LI>
<LI>  Should the scope of coverage of the Lemon Law be expanded to include
dealer demonstration vehicles?
</LI>
<LI>  Should the Lemon Law be amended to make specific  provision for
reimbursement of taxes and fees incurred at the time of purchase?
</LI>
<LI>  Should the phrase &quot;subject to repair,&quot; which serves as the
trigger mechanism for invoking rights under the Lemon Law, be clarified?
</LI>
<LI>  Should the Lemon Law be amended to provide for effective notice to
subsequent purchasers warning them that the vehicle is a &quot;lemon&quot;?
</LI>
</OL>
<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
<P>The Michigan Law Revision Commission makes the following recommendations:</P>
<OL>
<LI>In view of the recent explosion in lease plans as a method for acquiring a
new motor vehicle, the Commission recommends that the Lemon Law be amended to
include lease vehicles within the scope of Lemon Law coverage.  The Commission
endorses this proposal in principle with no specific recommendation for a
statutory amendment.
</LI>
<LI> With regard to including used vehicles within the scope of Lemon Law
coverage, the Commission recommends that no change be made.  Purchasers of used
vehicles know that used vehicles are sold &quot;as is,&quot; with all defects,
absent express warranties by the seller to the contrary.
</LI>
<LI>With regard to including commercial and certain recreational vehicles
within the scope of Lemon Law coverage, the Commission recommends that no change
be made to the Lemon Law in connection with commercial vehicles.  All rights and
remedies under the Uniform Commercial Code are available to purchasers of
commercial vehicles, obviating the need for extending Lemon Law protection to
such purchasers.<BR>The Commission further recommends that no change be made to
the Lemon Law in connection with recreational vehicles (e.g., motor homes,
motorcycles, and mopeds).  Nevertheless, the Legislature may want to examine
whether coverage ought to be extended to motorcycles in view of their
substantial purchase price and frequent use as a primary method of personal
transportation.<BR></LI>
<LI>With regard to amending the Lemon Law to specifically include coverage for
dual-purpose vehicles (joint personal-business use), the Commission recommends
that no change be made to the Law.  Existing definitions of &quot;consumer,&quot;
&quot;person,&quot; &quot;motor vehicle,&quot; and &quot;new motor vehicle&quot;
are adequate to cover this situation.</LI>
<LI> For the same reasons identified in item 4, the  Commission recommends that
no change be made to the Lemon Law to specifically cover dealer demonstration
vehicles.  Such vehicles typically are sold with a manufacturer's express
warranty.</LI>
<LI>With regard to reimbursement of taxes and fees, the Commission recommends
that no change be made to the Lemon Law, as this subject involves fiscal matters

<H2>Revising Michigan's Lemon Law</H2>
<H2>A Report to the Michigan<BR> Law Revision Commission</H2>
<H1></H1>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>Submitted by Tracey Prosser, Helen Melia, and Professor Kent Syverud,
The University of Michigan Law School</B><BR></P>
<P>This report assesses possible modifications to Michigan's Lemon Law, which
provides warranty protection for motor vehicle purchasers.  Part I summarizes
the current Michigan statute.  Part II reviews proposed changes to the Michigan
Lemon Law, catalogues methods by which other states have incorporated these
changes into their own lemon laws, and evaluates the applicability of these
provisions to the Michigan statute.</P>
<P><B></B></P>
<H3><B>I. Michigan Law</B></H3>
<P><B>A. The Legislative Intent</B></P>
<P>Prior to the 1986 enactment of the Michigan Lemon Law, MCL &#167; 257.1401
et seq., MSA &#167; 9.2705(1) et seq.,&lt;1&gt; the Michigan Legislature was
concerned about the reluctance of dissatisfied motor vehicle purchasers to make
use of statutory remedies or informal dispute resolution.&lt;2&gt;  The
Legislature found that this was due in part to mistaken beliefs on the part of
consumers that the process of obtaining a refund or a replacement vehicle would
be necessarily costly and time consuming.  The Legislature further found that
consumers were unaware of state and federal statutory remedies or of motor
vehicle manufacturers' informal dispute resolution procedures.  Moreover, those
who were aware of and considered seeking statutory remedies under the Uniform
Commercial Code (UCC) were reluctant to do so because of the UCC's uncertain
standards.&lt;3&gt;  In addition, the Legislature cited the reluctance of
consumers to surrender the vehicle during the dispute process.  Consequently,
owners of new defective vehicles declined to pursue remedies with the
manufacturer and instead, unloaded their defective vehicles on other consumers,
absorbing often substantial financial losses.&lt;4&gt;</P>
<P>The Michigan Lemon Law attempts to educate consumers by assuring that they
will be informed of their rights under the Lemon Law.  The act mandates that a
notice of rights under the Lemon Law accompany all new motor vehicle titles. 
Legislators believed that by specifying exact procedures and time limits to be
used in repairing, replacing, or returning a defective motor vehicle, much of
the uncertainty which existed under the UCC would be eliminated.  Consequently,
the Legislature anticipated that more consumers would prefer Lemon Law remedies
over reselling their defective vehicles.&lt;5&gt;</P> 
<P><B>B. The Statute</B></P>
<P>The Michigan Lemon Law limits the type of vehicles and vehicle purchasers
covered by the act.  The statute covers only consumers who actually purchase new
motor vehicles.&lt;6&gt;  The statute does not protect lessees of new vehicles
or purchasers of used  vehicles.&lt;7&gt;  Within the scope of the act are
automobiles, pick-up trucks, and vans; excluded are motor homes, buses, other
trucks, motorcycles, and other vehicles with less than four wheels.&lt;8&gt;</P>
<P>The Michigan Lemon Law requires manufacturers to replace or refund the
purchase price, including the cost of options or other charges from the
manufacturer, if (a) the manufacturer is unable to repair the vehicle after the
same defect or condition has been subject to repair four times, or (b) the
vehicle is out of service because of repairs for 30 or more days during the
first year after delivery.&lt;9&gt;  In addition, manufacturers must reimburse
buyers for towing charges and rental vehicle costs that buyers incur as a result
of the defective vehicle.&lt;10&gt;  It is not clear, however, whether a vehicle
is &quot;subject to repair&quot; whenever work of any sort is performed on the
vehicle or only when new parts are installed.  Moreover, the manufacturer is not
required to refund taxes, fees, or other collateral or incidental costs.&lt;11&gt;</P>
<P>The statute does not require disclosure to future purchasers of the &quot;lemon,&quot;
i.e., that the vehicle was returned under the Lemon Law.  Consequently,
consumers who purchase a car that was returned as a &quot;lemon&quot; may
encounter the same problems as the original purchaser, but have no statutory
recourse under the Lemon Law.</P>
<P><B>C. Caselaw Development</B></P>
<P>Only one case involving the Lemon Law has reached the Michigan Court of
Appeals since the statute was enacted in 1986.&lt;12&gt;  However, at least one
district court case has ruled on the meaning of the statutory phrase, &quot;subject
to repair.&quot;&lt;13&gt;  Several cases have invoked the alternative remedy of
revocation of acceptance under UCC, MCL &#167; 440.2101 et seq.; MSA &#167;
19.2101 et seq.&lt;14&gt;</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3><B>II.  A Review of Proposed Changes to the Michigan Lemon Law and a Look
at Other States' Lemon Law Provisions</B></H3>
<P></P>
<P>Every state, including the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
provides some measure of protection to motor vehicle consumers through the use
of statutes governing enforcement of motor vehicle warranties.&lt;15&gt;  Since
its enactment, questions have arisen of whether or not Michigan's Lemon Law
could be more effective by further advancing the underlying legislative intent.&lt;16&gt;
 These questions include whether the Michigan Lemon Law should cover leased
vehicles and used vehicles; whether the definition of new vehicles should be
broadened; whether the law needs a clearer statutory trigger clause; and whether
the law needs a more effective disclosure provision.&lt;17&gt;  This section
considers proposed changes to Michigan's Lemon Law, examines other
jurisdictions' treatment of such proposed changes, and recommends a course of
action with respect to each change.</P>
<P><B>1. Should the Michigan law extend statutory remedies to the acquisition
of new motor vehicles under lease plans?</B></P>
<P>In recent years leases have become a popular method of acquiring new motor
vehicles.  As the acquisition costs of motor vehicles have risen, leases have
become a popular alternative by reducing the financial commitment involved in a
new car purchase.  Many of the leases available today are leases with an option
to buy, or lease-plan agreements.  These lease plans typically involve a term of
1 to 2 years with an option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease
term.&lt;18&gt;  Lease plans are an attractive alternative to a purchase because
they require a smaller down payment and allow the consumer to apply the lease
payments against the end-of-term purchase price of the vehicle.  The only
statutory relief available to the consumer of a defective vehicle under a lease
plan is under the UCC.</P>
<P>Another characteristic of new leased vehicles is that dealers often sell
leased vehicles as used vehicles to other consumers after the lease expires. 
The subsequent used motor vehicle consumer, like the original new vehicle
consumer under the lease plan, will not have the protection of the Lemon Law. 
Since leases are now a popular alternative to purchasing a new motor vehicle,
many states have chosen to amend their lemon laws to address this issue.</P>
<P><B>a. Catalogue of the methods employed by other states to incorporate
leased new motor vehicles into their lemon laws.</B></P>
<P>Thirty-one states&lt;19&gt; provide some protection to lessees of new leased
vehicles under their lemon laws.  Many states include lessees in their
definitions of consumers and/or motor vehicles.&lt;20&gt;  Maryland has enacted
a leased vehicle lemon law which is completely independent of the new motor
vehicle lemon law.&lt;21&gt; </P>
<P>Some states include lessors as well as lessees in their definition of
consumer.&lt;22&gt;  Connecticut allows a lessor to petition the court to become
a party to the proceedings.&lt;23&gt;  In addition, some states mandate a
minimum term in a lease in order to come within the scope of their lemon laws.&lt;24&gt;
 Several states expressly require that the duty of making repairs to the leased
vehicle are assumed by the lessee, or that the leased vehicle is under the
manufacturer's warranty.&lt;25&gt;</P>
<P>In the basic refund structure, the manufacturer generally pays the lessor
the vehicle purchase price, collateral charges (such as freight and accessories
added by the dealer), any fees paid to obtain the lease, insurance and other
costs paid to benefit the lessee, sales taxes, and 5% of the purchase price.&lt;26&gt;
 Some states provide for reimbursement of taxes from a state agency to the
manufacturer for any taxes refunded to the lessor.&lt;27&gt;  Several states
expressly provide that the lease terminates upon refund and that the lessor may
not assess an early termination penalty.&lt;28&gt;  In addition, New Hampshire
requires the lessor to testify or provide other evidence for the lessee in
arbitration proceedings.&lt;29&gt;</P>
<P>The statutes usually specify how manufacturers must allocate refunds between
the lessor and lessee.  Most refund schemes  provide that the manufacturer
reimburse the lessee for his initial deposit, including allowances for any
trade-in vehicles, plus the lease payments already made, less a reasonable
allowance for the use of the vehicle while it was functioning properly.&lt;30&gt;
 Some states also adjust this amount to account for lessor expenditures that
benefit the lessee, for interest that would have been earned on the payments,
and for incidental or consequential damages.&lt;31&gt; </P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of including lease provisions in the Michigan statute.</B></P>
<P>If Michigan amends the Lemon Law to cover lessees and leased vehicles, the
change would further the original purpose behind the law.  At the time of
enactment, leased vehicles were expressly excluded from the law because auto
leasing was a relatively insignificant fraction of new car purchases.  Today, in
part due to changes in tax laws, leased vehicles are much more common among
ordinary consumers.  If no lemon law remedy is available for leased vehicles,
the lessor (frequently a dealer) will certainly have a strong incentive to sell
the defective vehicle at a loss to an unknowing buyer.  The lessee (the
consumer), moreover, will still experience considerable financial costs due to
loss of use of the vehicle and the cost of alternate transportation.  The lessee
also will be less likely to enforce the uncertain remedies available under the
UCC for the same reasons the Legislature found new motor vehicle buyers did not
employ these remedies.  Inclusion in the Lemon Law would provide lessees and
lessors a defined procedure and fixed standards by which they could pursue
remedies for defective motor vehicles, and therefore make it less likely that
the vehicle will be sold by the lessor to an unsuspecting purchaser.</P>
<P>Any amendment for leases should be plain and unambiguous so as to provide
guidance to the consumer.  The Michigan law could be amended in the following
ways to include leased motor vehicles within the scope of &#167; 257.1401
remedies.  First, Michigan could enact an entirely separate lemon law to govern
leased vehicles, after the Maryland model.&lt;32&gt;  However, this route is not
recommended since many aspects of the Michigan Lemon Law will overlap for
consumers and lessees.  A more desirable method for Michigan is to include
provisions for leased vehicles in the Michigan Lemon Law that specify (1) which
lease parties are covered, and (2) the reimbursement scheme for these parties. 
Michigan should adopt a provision similar to North Carolina's statute which
clearly and concisely describes the refund scheme for leased vehicles.&lt;33&gt;
 Expanding the scope of the Lemon Law to cover leases is the best solution
because it would avoid duplicating an entirely separate lemon law.  It is
further recommended that there be no time restriction on the lease.  As long as
the motor vehicle is leased &quot;new&quot; and meets the other statutory
requirements, lemon law remedies should apply.</P>
<P>At a minimum, lease-plan agreements should be included in the statutory
coverage, even if all leases are not included in an amended Lemon Law.  Due to
the rising cost of purchasing a new  motor vehicle, many consumers find that
lease plans are the only cost effective method to buy a car.  Dealers often
encourage consumers to lease, rather than purchase, because a lower down payment
is required and lease plans involve a short-term commitment and flexibility. 
Lease plans should be included because lease-plan agreements often contain a 1-2
year term with an option to purchase at the end of the term.  If the lessee is
interested in purchasing the vehicle and has used the lease as an avenue for
ultimate purchase, the lessee of a &quot;lemon&quot; will either have to
purchase a defective vehicle, or decide not to exercise the option to buy and
forfeit the payments made on the vehicle over the entire term of the lease.  A
lessee of a defective vehicle under a lease-plan agreement is committed to the
agreement for an extended period and often only released from the agreement
after paying penalty charges. </P>
<P>Caselaw reflects the inadequacy of the UCC to provide the &quot;user
friendly&quot; remedies contained in the Lemon Law.&lt;34&gt;  An amendment to
Michigan's Lemon Law to include a section on leased vehicles will eliminate the
need to resort to ambiguous UCC remedies by extending to the lease-plan
purchaser the same lemon law protection afforded a new vehicle purchaser.</P>
<P>The refund arrangement should also be available to either the lessor (such
as a dealer) or the lessee (the consumer),&lt;35&gt; since both parties have a
financial interest in the defective motor vehicle.  In this way neither lease
party will have to rely on the other to assert refund rights.  More importantly,
the defective vehicle will more likely be returned to the manufacturer, and thus
less likely to be sold to an unsuspecting consumer.  This amendment to the
Michigan Lemon Law will further one of the primary goals of the Michigan
Legislature: to prevent the resale of a defective vehicle as a used vehicle to a
consumer who will not have any lemon law protection.</P>
<P>In summary, by expanding the scope of lemon law coverage to more new motor
vehicles, and thus reducing the possibility that defective vehicles will be sold
at a loss as a used vehicle at the end of the lease agreement, these amendments
will further the original legislative intent.  Excluding leases from the
existing lemon law remedies could potentially result in many defective vehicles
being resold at a loss, contrary to the legislative intent behind the Michigan
Lemon Law of discouraging the resale of defective vehicles.</P>
<P><B>2. Should the Michigan law include purchasers of used motor vehicles?</B></P>
<P>Currently, &#167; 257.1401 covers &quot;any other person entitled to enforce
the provisions of an express warranty,&quot; in addition to the original
purchaser.  Therefore, all new vehicles that meet the statutory specifications
seem to be covered for a given period of time, even if the vehicle is
transferred during that period.  However, &#167; 257.1401 does not provide for
lemon law coverage on vehicles sold as used which are sold after &quot;1 year
from the date of  delivery of the new motor vehicle to the original consumer&quot;
or after &quot;the term of the manufacturer's express warranty is in effect,
whichever is earlier.&quot;  Thus, Michigan's lemon law, unlike some other
states, excludes the vast majority of used vehicles.  The Legislature may wish
to reconsider this exclusion.  Providing lemon law coverage for vehicles resold
after the current statutory period would be a valuable protection for used
vehicle purchasers, but could be burdensome for manufacturers, particularly for
vehicles that have been out of the control (and repair) of manufacturers for
many years.</P>
<P><B>a. Catalogue of the methods employed by other states to incorporate
coverage of used motor vehicles into their lemon laws.</B></P>
<P>Used car warranty statutes generally hold the used car dealer or private
party seller liable for repairs, replacements and refunds of nonconforming
vehicles.&lt;36&gt;  Used car warranty statutes require sellers to provide
specific warranties to a used vehicle purchaser.  Some states list specific
parts that a used car warranty must cover.&lt;37&gt;  Massachusetts requires the
owner to pay up to $100 of any repair costs.&lt;38&gt;  The warranty does not
cover damage caused by abuse, negligence, theft, vandalism or fire.</P>
<P>The price of the car or the mileage at the time of purchase determines the
warranty term.&lt;39&gt;  Warranty terms are measured either in days (usually
30, 60 or 90) or mileage.&lt;40&gt;  Generally, used car warranty statutes set a
minimum price, a maximum mileage, or a maximum age for covered vehicles.  Some
statutes explicitly exempt dealers from having to provide warranties for special
cars, such as classic, race, rare, or junked cars.&lt;41&gt;  The consumer may
only waive the warranty if the waiver is written, conspicuous, and signed or
initialed by the buyer and seller.&lt;42&gt;</P>
<P>The consumer must notify the dealer within the warranty period of any defect
substantially affecting the value of the vehicle.&lt;43&gt;  If the dealer, or a
repair facility it designates, attempts to repair the same defect three times
and fails or if the vehicle is out of service for a certain time (usually 10,
15, or 45 days), the dealer must offer to buy back the vehicle.&lt;44&gt;  If
the dealer buys back the vehicle, it must pay the consumer the full purchase
price plus other incidental costs, less a use allowance.&lt;45&gt;  Furthermore,
all states with used car warranty statutes allow resort to courts.&lt;46&gt;</P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of including used motor vehicles provisions in the
Michigan statute.</B></P>
<P>The Michigan Legislature's concern about owners of defective motor vehicles
passing those vehicles off on other purchasers would be addressed by a used
motor vehicle lemon law applicable to commercial and private sellers.  Such a
law would offer an incentive to owners of defective vehicles to seek redress
directly from the vehicle manufacturer, rather than selling the vehicle at a
loss and risking liability for future problems with the vehicle.  In addition,
purchasers of used motor vehicles would have a defined procedure and fixed
remedies when  pursuing the seller of the motor vehicle.</P>
<P>Manufacturers may claim that including used vehicles within the scope of
lemon law remedies would be an undue burden because many things can happen to a
used car between the time of manufacture and the time of resale over which the
manufacturer has no control.  Michigan could mitigate the impact of including
used cars by including a provision similar to New Hampshire's,&lt;47&gt; which
allows the manufacturer to claim misuse as an affirmative defense to the alleged
nonconformity.  One offsetting benefit of including used vehicles in the Lemon
Law is that hopefully any defective motor vehicles that were not turned into the
manufacturer as a new defective motor vehicle would ultimately be repaired as a
used motor vehicle.</P>
<P>Another benefit of including used vehicles is to close a loophole that
exists in lemon law statutes across the country.  All laws provide that
disclosure is required when a defective vehicle is resold in the state, but they
do not discuss what happens if the vehicle is resold in another state.  Thus,
defective vehicles can be sold as used in another state without any disclosure. 
By covering used vehicles in its statute, Michigan could protect Michigan
consumers who purchase a defective vehicle in Michigan that entered Michigan
from another state.</P>
<P>This amendment would further the legislative intent behind the Michigan
statute of encouraging purchasers to return used vehicles that are lemons and
remove them from the stream of commerce, rather than sell them to someone else
as a used vehicle.  In this connection, if Michigan amends its lemon law,
Minnesota's provision could be a model.&lt;48&gt;  Providing for lemon law
coverage like Minnesota's, coupled with an affirmative defense clause for
manufacturers to claim intervening misuse like New Hampshire's, would reduce the
burden on manufacturers and would be very beneficial to used car purchasers. 
Similarly, this amendment would be consistent with the legislative intent behind
&#167;257.1401 because it would encourage used car consumers to employ lemon law
relief rather than sell the vehicle.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the longer a vehicle has been in
the hands of successive consumers, the harder it will be to prove whether it was
the manufacturer or those who made repairs who are responsible for any defects. 
One alternative to amending the law to apply to used vehicles might be to
include mandatory disclosure provisions concerning vehicles identified as lemons
when they were new (see Part 7, below).</P>
<P><B>3. Should the Michigan law be extended to cover more types and sizes of
new motor vehicles?</B></P>
<P><B>a. Catalogue of the methods employed by other states to incorporate
coverage of various types and sizes of new motor vehicles into their lemon laws.</B></P>
<P>Many types of vehicles are excluded by Michigan and other state lemon law
provisions.  Twenty-eight states, including Michigan, exclude from coverage some
type of vehicle with less than four wheels.&lt;49&gt;  Twenty-seven states
exclude vehicles in excess of a certain minimum weight which ranges from 6,000
lbs. to 19,000 lbs., 10,000 lbs. being the most common weight.&lt;50&gt; 
Kentucky excludes vehicles with more than two axles.&lt;51&gt;  Five states
place a maximum passenger capacity on vehicles that receive lemon law coverage.&lt;52&gt;</P>
<P>Some states have included coverage of vehicles that are easier to resell
than the large vehicles described above.  Some states include coverage for
motorcycles or motorcycles and mopeds,&lt;53&gt; while others do not specify
whether motorcycles, mopeds, or motorbikes are covered.  Similarly, eleven
states cover the chassis portion of a motor home, but exclude living areas.&lt;54&gt;</P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of adding these type and size provisions to the Michigan
statute.</B></P>
<P>Given the original purpose of the Michigan Lemon Law to protect consumers,
extending the Michigan Lemon Law remedies to more types and sizes of vehicles is
unnecessary, in the case of commercial vehicles, such as buses and large trucks
(other than pickups).  The Legislature in 1987 may have assumed that purchasers
of these other types of vehicles are more likely to be businesses and
organizations who are more sophisticated about UCC remedies and thus more likely
to invoke these remedies.  This assumption still seems a valid one.  The intent
of the Michigan Lemon Law was to provide a user-friendly remedy for consumers
who may be less knowledgeable and less likely to invoke UCC remedies due to
their complexity or ambiguity.&lt;55&gt;</P>
<P>These arguments are less convincing, however, in the case of vehicles such
as motor home chassis and motorcycles.  It can be argued that motor home chassis
should be included because these vehicles traditionally are purchased for
personal travel purposes by consumers with the same level of sophistication as
those who purchase vehicles currently covered under the Michigan Lemon Law
remedies.&lt;56&gt;  The same argument applies to motorcycles, if the other
statutory requirements are met (e.g., used for household purposes).&lt;57&gt;</P>
<P><B>4. Should the scope of Michigan law be limited by the intended use of
the new motor vehicle?</B></P>
<P><B>a. Catalogue of the methods employed by other states to include new
motor vehicle purchases for &quot;other than household use&quot; into their
lemon laws.</B></P>
<P>Seven states expressly limit coverage to vehicles used for personal, family,
or household use.&lt;58&gt;  Some states require some personal, family, or
household use but allow other uses as well.&lt;59&gt;  Thirty-two states require
that covered vehicles be used primarily  on public roads or specifically exclude
tractors and other farm or construction machinery.&lt;60&gt;  South Carolina
does not cover vehicles used for compensation, except for those used for school
or church activities.&lt;61&gt;  Many states cover dealer demonstrator vehicles.&lt;62&gt;
 Six states cover all vehicles required to be registered in that state that meet
other statutory requirements.&lt;63&gt;</P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of including these &quot;other use&quot; provisions in the
Michigan statute.</B></P>
<P>Extending the scope of uses allowed under the Michigan Lemon Law seems
unnecessary to a large extent.  The Lemon Law is primarily designed to be a
statute of convenience for consumers who might not employ complicated UCC
remedies.  It is important to remember that the UCC remedies are still available
for vehicles used for other than &quot;household purposes.&quot;  However, there
is some merit in expanding the &quot;use&quot; provision of the Michigan Lemon
Law to include coverage of &quot;gray area&quot; vehicles not used solely for
household purposes, but which are more alienable (and thus more likely to be
resold if defective) than most commercial vehicles.&lt;64&gt;</P>
<P>The strongest case exists for extending the Michigan Lemon Law to
demonstration vehicles and multiple use vehicles.  After vehicles are used as
demonstration cars, dealers often sell them to consumers as used vehicles.  The
dealer may sell a defective demonstration car at a loss as a used demonstration
car to an unknowing purchaser.  Similarly, many people own dual-purpose vehicles
for both personal and business use who may &quot;cut their losses&quot; and
resell the vehicle, rather than invoke UCC remedies.</P>
<P>The best example of a lemon law covering multiple use vehicles and
demonstration vehicles is Hawaii.&lt;65&gt;  If the scope of uses is extended,
the Legislature should clearly state exactly which uses (or proportion of uses)
are covered to avoid abuse -- and in particular to avoid swallowing up the
current exception for commercial vehicles.</P>
<P><B>5. Should the Michigan law contain a reimbursement scheme for taxes and
collateral fees incurred as part of the purchase of a defective motor vehicle?</B></P>
<P>The reimbursement of taxes and collateral fees is a necessary part of any
effective remedy.  Any lemon remedy that does not provide for the recovery of
these expenses undercuts the goal of having a lemon law that provides a complete
remedy.  As described below, many states provide for reimbursement of taxes and
other collateral fees specifically in their lemon laws.  A lemon law that
includes a clear method for reimbursement of taxes and fees incurred with the
purchase of a defective motor vehicle will be more &quot;user friendly.&quot; 
As a result, consumers will be more likely to utilize the lemon law remedy.</P>
<P><B>a. Catalogue of the methods employed by other states to incorporate into
their lemon laws reimbursement  schemes for all collateral fees associated with
the purchase of a defective new motor vehicle.</B></P>
<P>Of the remedies offered to purchasers of defective vehicles, most states
give the consumer the option of seeking a refund upon returning the vehicle to
the manufacturer.  The manufacturer, in turn, must refund to the consumer the
full purchase price of the vehicle, plus collateral costs and incidental damages
to varying degrees, depending on the state.  Thirty-five states explicitly
require that the manufacturer refund to the consumer any sales, use, or excise
taxes, in addition to the purchase price, when the consumer returns the vehicle.&lt;66&gt;</P>
<P>In the event the consumer elects vehicle replacement, eleven states require
that the manufacturer reimburse the consumer for any additional taxes or fees
incurred in acquiring the new vehicle.&lt;67&gt;  Five states authorize a
consumer to seek a tax refund directly from a state agency.&lt;68&gt;  Other
states require manufacturer refunds of licensing, registration or title fees,&lt;69&gt;
but do not provide a mechanism by which the consumer can recover fees directly
from the state government.</P>
<P>In addition to taxes and fees, various states also allow refunds for the
following collateral expenses:  unrefundable portions of extended warranties and
service contracts, value of trade-in vehicles, shipping to the repair facility
or manufacturer, finance charges, foreseeable loss of income or use, personal
injury  resulting from the nonconformity, alternative transportation, towing
costs, and storage fees.</P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of including collateral reimbursement schemes in the
Michigan statute.</B></P>
<P>Although the Michigan statute does allow for the reimbursement of some
specific expenses associated with the purchase of a defective vehicle, it is far
from complete.&lt;70&gt;  The result is that the consumer still experiences a
loss even after enforcing the lemon law.  Preventing purchasers of defective
vehicles from recovering all their losses may discourage purchasers from
employing lemon law relief.</P>
<P>If Michigan's Lemon Law were to include reimbursement of taxes, fees and
other costs, the law would reduce the financial loss of a consumer who purchases
a defective vehicle.  Michigan could either allow a consumer to request tax and
fee reimbursement directly from a state agency, or the law could provide that
the manufacturer request reimbursement from the state.  Either amendment to the
Michigan Lemon Law will further the legislative intent of the original law by
providing the consumer with complete relief for the purchase of a defective
vehicle.</P>
<P>If such expenses are not compensable then consumers of defective vehicles
may be encouraged to &quot;cut their losses&quot; by selling the vehicle as soon
as the defect occurs, rather than incur additional collateral expenses when
exercising their rights  under the lemon law.  The Michigan statute could
include a clause similar to that employed in California.&lt;71&gt;</P>
<P><B>6. Should the Michigan Lemon Law provide a clearer explanation of which
events trigger statutory relief?</B></P>
<P>Lemon laws create a statutory presumption of what constitutes a reasonable
number of repairs before the consumer is permitted to demand a refund or a
replacement vehicle.  However, the statutes do not define &quot;subject to
repair.&quot;  It is uncertain whether &quot;subject to repair&quot; includes
replacing parts or whether performance of any kind of service, diagnostic or
corrective, will suffice to meet the statutory standard.  Since clarity is so
important to the effective implementation of the lemon law remedies, having an
unclear statutory trigger is undesirable.</P>
<P><B>a. Other jurisdictions provide a possible solution to the statutory
ambiguity in Michigan's law.</B></P>
<P>Many lemon laws around the country employ the terminology &quot;subject to
repair.&quot;  The reported case law focuses on the number of times a consumer
brings a motor vehicle to a repair facility, rather than on the type of services
performed.  Several states have concluded that visits to a repair facility for
wheel alignment, cleaning of parts, or unsuccessful attempts to diagnose a
problem are instances of a motor vehicle being &quot;subject to repair.&quot;&lt;72&gt;
 In Chmill v. Friendly Ford-Mercury of Janesville, Inc.,&lt;73&gt; the Wisconsin
Court of Appeals held that the presentation of a vehicle to a repair facility
constitutes a repair attempt, even if the facility does not actually attempt a
repair because it is unable to diagnose the defective condition.&lt;74&gt;</P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of including similar statutory clarification provisions in
the Michigan statute.</B></P>
<P>Although on its face MCL &#167; 257.1401 seems to clearly outline when
statutory remedies are triggered, the phrase &quot;subject to repair&quot; needs
clarification.&lt;75&gt;  This statutory language is critical to the proper
functioning of the lemon law since the number of times a vehicle is &quot;subject
to repair&quot; may determine when the statutory remedy under MCL &#167;
257.1401 is triggered.  Clarifying language would eliminate any ambiguity
regarding when statutory relief is available.  The statutory trigger is one of
the most important aspects of the lemon law.  If it is not clear when a remedy
is available, the law is not any easier for consumers to use than UCC relief,
and the primary legislative purpose for the lemon law is thereby frustrated.</P>
<P>It would be desirable to amend the definitions section of the Lemon Law, MCL
&#167; 257.1401, to insert a definition of &quot;subject to repair&quot; as that
term is used in MCL &#167; 257.1403(3)(a).  One clear definition, taken from the
North Carolina statute, is &quot;presented to the manufacturer or the new motor
vehicle dealer for service, repair, or correction.&quot;&lt;76&gt;</P>
<P><B>7. Should the Michigan law require disclosure of a  defective motor
vehicle to all subsequent purchasers?</B></P>
<P><B>a. Catalogue of the methods employed by other states to include
disclosure provisions in their lemon laws.</B></P>
<P>Other jurisdictions employ a number of different disclosure provisions to
curb deception perpetrated against both the consumer and the seller of a
defective motor vehicle.  At least thirty-one states require some kind of
warning to future purchasers that a vehicle has been returned under a lemon law.&lt;77&gt;
 North Carolina's statute contains a typical disclosure provision.&lt;78&gt;</P>
<P>Jurisdictions vary on the manner of disclosure.  Twenty-five states require
that the disclosure be written.&lt;79&gt;  Minnesota requires oral disclosure
during the sales presentation as well.&lt;80&gt;  Some states only require
disclosure that the motor vehicle was returned to the manufacturer because of a
nonconformity.&lt;81&gt;  In Indiana, manufacturers must also disclose all
repair attempts.&lt;82&gt;  Connecticut does not require direct disclosure by
the seller to the subsequent purchaser but instead brands the title of the
vehicle with a legend indicating the car's return under the lemon law.&lt;83&gt;</P>
<P>Eleven states require a manufacturer to report to a state agency the return
of a motor vehicle under a lemon law.&lt;84&gt;  Texas publishes an annual
report of such vehicles and provides a toll free telephone number (which the
seller must give to the consumer) that prospective purchasers can call for more
information about specific returned vehicles.&lt;85&gt;  Minnesota allows the
Attorney General to examine and publicize the results of informal dispute
settlements.&lt;86&gt;</P>
<P>In many states, branding the certificate of title of vehicles returned under
lemon laws effectively discloses the motor vehicle's history to any future
purchasers by putting that person on inquiry notice.&lt;87&gt;  The statement
imprinted on the title usually warns that the vehicle has been returned to the
manufacturer due to the manufacturer's failure to remedy a nonconformity.  Other
jurisdictions place certain time restrictions on disclosure.&lt;88&gt;  North
Carolina, however, applies the disclosure provision to all subsequent sellers.&lt;89&gt;</P>
<P>Another route taken by some states is to require the seller to provide a
warranty on the defective vehicle in order to resell it.  In that way buyers of
the defective vehicle will have warranty protection even though they are
purchasing the vehicle used, rather than new.  In some states the warranty must
be the same warranty that the manufacturer originally issued to the new car
purchaser.&lt;90&gt;  Others mandate full coverage of the nonconformity for
which the motor vehicle was returned.&lt;91&gt;  Most of these states require a
warranty for 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever occurs first.&lt;92&gt;</P>
<P>Another important factor that is often overlooked with disclosure provisions
is enforcement.  A statutory provision  requiring disclosure will be less
effective if it does not provide for meaningful enforcement and punishment of
violations.  Some states have provisions that impose fines for a manufacturer's
violation of resale disclosure provisions.&lt;93&gt;  North Dakota has
criminalized lemon law violations as misdemeanors.&lt;94&gt;</P>
<P><B>b. Evaluation of including similar disclosure provisions in the Michigan
statute.</B></P>
<P>The current Michigan Lemon Law contains no provision mandating disclosure
that a vehicle was returned under the Law.  This lacuna undercuts one of the
main purposes behind the Michigan law of removing defectively manufactured
vehicles from the stream of commerce.</P>
<P>An amendment to the Michigan Lemon Law requiring disclosure to future
consumers is consistent with the current Lemon Law's emphasis on consumer
education and empowerment.  In addition, while a disclosure requirement causes
greater financial loss to the seller of a defective vehicle, it would prevent
sellers from unloading defective vehicles on unknowing consumers.  There are
good reasons for Michigan to adopt the disclosure provision of North Carolina&lt;95&gt;
and the agency notification provision of Texas.&lt;96&gt;  By branding the title
and also allowing the consumer to call a neutral agency to get information on
the nature of the defect, Michigan law would contain a very effective means of
protecting subsequent purchasers of defective motor vehicles.</P>
<P>Two objectives would be achieved with a branding provision.  First, the need
for enforcing disclosure provisions would be lessened because the brand would be
a permanent part of the title.&lt;97&gt;  Second, there would be less of a need
to amend the law to include used vehicles if a mandatory disclosure provision
was included.  A branded title will warn used vehicle purchasers that the
vehicle has or has had problems,&lt;98&gt; thereby furthering the consumer
protection goal of the Michigan Lemon Law.</P>
<H3><B>III.  Conclusion</B></H3>
<P>Other jurisdictions have found the need to update and amend their lemon laws
regularly to meet with the ever changing environment of motor vehicle
acquisitions.&lt;99&gt;  Changes in the marketing and sale of motor vehicles
have made revision of the Michigan Lemon Law overdue.</P>

<P>&lt;12&gt;In Aver v. Ford Motor Co., 200 Mich. App. 337, 503 N.W.2d 767
(1993), the manufacturer violated the lemon law statute where the new motor
vehicle was out of service because of repairs for 30 days during initial three
months of ownership and failure to repair the pickup resulted from lack of
repair parts.  The Michigan Court of Appeals emphasized that there is a strong
presumption that a reasonable number of repair attempts have been made and that
this presumption is irrebuttable absent delay in repairs due to war, invasion,
strike, fire, flood or other natural disaster, conditions which are explicitly
provided in the statute.  Id.</P>

<P>&lt;66&gt;See, e.g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#167; 1345.71(F): &quot;'Full
Purchase Price' means the contract price for the motor vehicle, including
charges for transportation, dealer-installed accessories, dealer services,
dealer preparation and delivery and collateral charges; all finance, credit
insurance, warranty and service contract charges incurred by the buyer; and all
sales tax, license and registration fees, and other government charges and
1345.72(B).  If the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer is unable
to conform the motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or
correcting any defect or condition that substantially impairs the use, safety,
or value of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of
repair attempts, the manufacturer shall, at the consumer's option, and subject
to division (D) of this section replace the motor vehicle with a new motor
vehicle acceptable to the consumer or accept return of the vehicle from the
consumer and refund each of the following: (1) The full purchase price
including, but not limited to, charges for undercoating, transportation, and
installed options; (2) All collateral charges, including but not limited to,
sales tax, license and registration fees, and similar government charges; (3)
All finance charges incurred by the consumer; (4) All incidental damages,
including any reasonable fees charged by the tender for making or cancelling the
loan.&quot;</P>
<P>&lt;67&gt;See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code &#167; 1793.2(d)(2)(A): &quot;In the
case of restitution, the manufacturer shall make restitution in an amount equal
to the actual price paid or payable by the buyer, including any charges for
transportation and manufacturer-installed options, but excluding
non-manufacturer items installed by a dealer or the buyer, and including any
collateral charges such as sales tax, license fees, registration fees, and other
official fees, plus any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under
Section 1794, including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and
rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.&quot;</P>

addressed by the courts in other jurisdictions.  See, e.g., Webb v. Polk
Chevrolet, Inc., 509 So.2d 139 (La. App. 1987); Chmill v. Friendly Ford-Mercury
of Janesville, Inc., 424 N.W.2d 747 (Wis. App. 1988); Canterbury v.
Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 928 F.2d 399 (4th Cir. 1991); Baker v.
Chrysler Corp., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 727 (E.D. Pa. 1993).</P>
<P>&lt;73&gt;The Court of Appeals noted that a contrary result would be
unreasonable because it would leave the consumer without recourse for an
acknowledged, but undiagnosed, nonconformity.  424 N.W.2d 747 (Wis. App. 1988).</P>
<P>&lt;74&gt;Id.</P>
<P>&lt;75&gt;See Appendix A, MCL &#167; 257.1403(3).  See also supra note 13,
describing a case where an Oakland County jury deadlocked 3 to 3 on the meaning
of &quot;subject to repair.&quot;</P>
<P>&lt;76&gt;N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; 20-351.3(a):  &quot;It is presumed that a
reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to
the applicable express warranties if: (1) The same nonconformity has been
presented for repair to the manufacturer . . . four or more times but the same
nonconformity continues to exist.&quot;</P>

manufacturer provides the dealer a separate document with a written statement
identifying the vehicle conditions that formed the basis for the previous
owner's or lessee's dissatisfaction and the steps taken to deal with that
dissatisfaction in 10-point all capital type.&quot;</P>

disclosure statement must include a toll-free telephone number of the Commission
that will enable a purchaser of a repurchased or replaced vehicle to obtain
information about the condition or defect that was the basis of the order for
repurchase or replacement.</P>
<P>&lt;86&gt;See Minn. Stat. &#167; 325F.665.</P>
<P>&lt;87&gt;See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. &#167; 42-179(g)(2):  &quot;manufacturer

<P>&lt;96&gt;See Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 4413(36).</P>
<P>&lt;97&gt;The neutral agency could be incorporated into a section of the
Department of Motor Vehicles or another state agency.  This agency would have a
complete record of the defective motor vehicle, including the current status of
the vehicle.  If the non-conformity is fixed, the agency would relay this
information, however, the brand would remain as a warning to all future
consumers of the vehicle.</P>
<P>&lt;98&gt;Note, however, that this would not catch the defective vehicles
which are not discovered before the end of the lemon law's statutory period for
relief.  These vehicles would never be branded and, therefore, there would be no
disclosure to the subsequent purchaser. The statutory intent behind preventing
resale of defective vehicles would not be entirely achieved.</P>
<P>&lt;99&gt;See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. &#167; 42-179, originally enacted in
1984, and amended in 1985, 1987, and 1988.</P>
