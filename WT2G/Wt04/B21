I talked to Trueman today.

He told me Shea's victory was "not unexpected."

"The ACLU did some forum shopping. If I were going to file a suit like they
did, I'd go to Manhattan," he said, adding that NYC is much more permissive
than most parts of the country.

When I told him that Shea rather strongly dislikes the ACLU and refused to
join the ACLU lawsuit, Trueman was incredulous. Said that Shea must have
received some help from the ACLU in preparing briefs or whatnot.

Not quite.

This isn't a big change since the old address at CMU has been forwarded to
the above address for months. You should notice no changes in the list --
except some improvements in performance. The old address will be forwarded
to the MIT address for the forseeable future.

&gt;Let's keep this list about government censorship, please.

I like the way Tom Edwards, an avowed Libertarian, described it:

Institutional restrictions on speech also are often wrong, but the response
to them is different. Such muzzling attempts are not illegal, just
misguided.

However, we should keep in mind the very fuzzy difference distinction
between editing and censorship. Should, for instance, Jim Thomas be forced
to include off-topic rants in CuD? Should the National Coalition Against
Censorship be forced to publish similar materials in their quarterly
newsletter? Editing != censorship. The ALA has a definition of censorship
that may be useful here.

But perhaps we can agree that the most vile form of censorship remains that
done by governments, which buttress their laws with the power of guns,
tanks, and gallows.

	For the record, we didn't forum-shop.  Also, I don't strongly
dislike the ACLU, and I certainly agree with them on the CDA.  Finally,
our case landed in NY because the correspondent firm that was going to
handle the case here backed out at the last moment -- on Feb. 7, the night
before we filed.  Our judges were relatively conservative.  We were not
assoisted by the ACLU, with whom we had a short-lived feud.

ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace;
New Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Wednesday, July 31, 1996

    NEW YORK, NY--Despite a second federal court decision affirming
that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today
warned of  persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and
internationally, to censor electronic communications and regulate
privacy technology.   

    At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known
as "G-7," government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate
the Internet and other electronic communications in an effort to
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing
incident at the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight
800, which is being investigated as a possible terrorist bombing.
Participants included France, Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany,
Canada, Russia and the United States. 

    Although not all details were made public, proposed measures
apparently include investigations of charities and political
organizations with radical political points of view -- threatening
their rights to free speech -- and using the Internet to "monitor"
terrorist communications.  There was also agreement to adopt a U.S.
plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed encryption, which would mean that
individuals and companies would be barred from using encryption
technology to electronically lock up their most private and
sensitive information unless they make the keys available to their
government.  

    In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and
electronic privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed
last month at a meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal.    The
group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition
with organizations from around the world to share information and
protect free speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the
global Internet.  GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the Internet
Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and human
rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding member of the group.

    "GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and
that decisions made by international bodies like the G-7 nations
affect all Internet users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate
director of the ACLU.  "The U.S. government may not accomplish
through an international end-run what the U.S. Congress and the
U.S. Courts have rejected."
    
    Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges
in New York declaring that censorship in cyberspace is
unconstitutional.  The decision marked another win in the ongoing
battle for free speech in cyberspace, which saw its first major
victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a Philadelphia court
granted a motion for preliminary injunction on "indecency"
provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed its
challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed
into law.

    "We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their
Philadelphia colleagues in protecting the Internet from
governmental intrusion," said Steinhardt, who testified in the
Philadelphia case.  "But we remain concerned about the government's
continuing efforts to censor electronic speech, not only in the
United States but internationally."

    In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal
that would make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-
making in print, radio, television or in cyberspace.   Violations
would be punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine,
or both. 

    "This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last
year, would criminalize everything from a high school chemistry
teacher explaining basic scientific principles, to a newspaper
carrying an illustration of a bomb's construction, to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture manual describing how to make fertilizer
bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's Steinhardt said. 

    In addition, President Clinton this week announced an
initiative to increase the powers of federal investigators,
including an expanded wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has
commended the Clinton Administration and law enforcement
authorities for their investigation into recent tragic incidents,
it urged President Clinton and Congress in a letter sent to the
White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit" by
safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss
continuing civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
generalized libertarian baiting. I for one would appreciate it if you'd
knock it off in this forum; distortions, insults, and amateur
psychoanalysis are not only not helpful, they're actively harmful in
sidetracking discussion and creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one
another.

If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please
do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list. Thank
you.

If someone refuses to do business with another person based on disagreement

but I can't see a single such incident as a problem. An inconvenience for
the artist who in this case has to find another, more reliable developer,
but no more than that. And I don't agree that it's wrong to refuse to do
business with someone, assuming you're not deceptive about it.

If we see a situation develop in which it's impossible to find developers
or printers to do certain work, or if there is an indication that this
developer refused this work because of intimidation or fear of legal
consequences, then it starts to become a censorship issue. But I didn't see
any such indications in the original message.

Yesterday in Paris government ministers from the G-7 countries met and
approved a 25-point plan calling for close cooperation in moving to
"intensify exchange of operational information," particularly "the use
of communications technologies by terrorist groups."

In a HotWired column, Kenneth Cukier writes: "In case there is any
question about the United States's position, Attorney General Janet
Reno said: 'We obtained the agreement of the eight (countries at the
conference) to develop means of lawful government access to and
decoding of scrambled or coded communication transmitted by
terrorists.'" German delegates also blasted the Internet.

The ACLU reports that: "Proposed measures apparently include
investigations of charities and political organizations with radical
political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech."

I've attached part of a cover story I have in the latest _Internet
Underground_ magazine (http://www.underground-online.com/) that talks
about the G-7 process and how countries around the globe are moving to
stifle the Net. Pick up a copy of the physical mag for the full text of

"PLAGUE OF FREEDOM"
The Internet's being disinfected for your protection
(pages 28-33)

By Declan McCullagh
declan@well.com


Call it an unlikely parable for today's Internet.

Daniel Defoe's "A Journal of the Plague Years" isn't about cyberspace.
Written in 1665, the book sketches a ghastly picture of a London under
seige.

Defoe tells how rats from foreign ships have invaded the city, carrying
with them the bubonic plague. Authorities resort to desperate measures,
barricading families inside their homes in a desperate attempt to halt
the onslaught.

It doesn't work. "Setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was,
first of all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by
force or by strategm, even almost as often as they pleased," Defoe
wrote.

So it is with the sprawling expanse of cyberspace in 1996. Governments
around the globe are rushing to barricade their borders, dam the flow
of foreign data, and create a new world information order. For good
reason: an uncensored 'net connection can be as deadly to a 20th
century government as the plague was three centuries ago.

And it may be just as infectious.

[...]

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The most influential international body involved in cyberrulemaking is
the G-7 group of industrialized nations. Truth be told, it's obscure
outside financial circles and is seen even inside them as becoming
irrelevant in a global financial system dominated by multinational
corporations, not by governments.

Yet the seven member nations have already started using the G-7
umbrella to engage in a sort of joint head-scratching about what to do
with cyberspace.

It started in February 1995 in Brussels, at a meeting called the "G-7
Ministerial Conference on the Information Society." There the telecom
honchos from G-7 nations and several smaller countries gathered to chat
about online copyright, cultural pollution, universal access, free
speech, and encryption policies.

At least the principles were lofty. "While the rhetoric of the
conference was progressive, there was no serious discussion of free
expression or other human rights concerns," wrote one American who
attended the conference.

Instead, the G-7 nations said they were considering how to deal with
inappropriate material on the 'net. Canada reminded the other countries
that it wasn't as permissive as the U.S. in dealing with
"hate-mongering materials," saying that when such publications appear
online "they are much easier to obtain but are more difficult to
monitor and take action against." The European Union decried copyright
pirates: "Some form of international cooperation is necessary to
supplement the existing legal systems governing intellectual property
rights." Saying the 'net is "not without risks," France stressed that
cyberspace "must not result in a standardization in content, or a
leveling of cultures."

Only Vice President Al Gore tossed a bone to cyber-rights advocates.
"[Cyberspace] is about protecting and enlarging freedom of expression
for all our citizens... Ideas should not be checked at the border,"
said Gore.

Gore didn't do this in a vacuum. "Our big victory at Brussels was that
we pressured them enough so that Al Gore in his keynote address made a
big point of stressing the importance of free speech on the Internet,"
says Ann Beeson of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Beeson should know -- she's been one of the few cybersavvy activists
who has been fighting globally for an unshackled Internet. Now a
principal attorney on the ACLU's legal team challenging the
Communications Decency Act, Beeson previously worked at Human Rights
Watch and crafted a letter the group sent to Gore before the Brussels
conference. Citing Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, it said: "Everyone has the right... to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Unfortunately, the only G-7 voices supporting this today are a silent
chorus.

The G-7 information ministers met again in South Africa in May 1996 and
plan to meet in Egypt later this year, but no international
'net-advocacy group has been tracking the proposals discussed at the
meetings. U.S. cyberliberty groups have been preoccupied with the CDA
battle, and they have no international counterparts.

That's finally about to change. Two global 'net-alliances are emerging
and have held their initial planning meetings at Internet conferences
this summer in Canada.

The ACLU co-founded one group, called the Global Internet Liberty
Campaign. "We have to face the fact that while ultimately it's
extraordinarily difficult for governments to control the 'net, they're
going to try," says Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.
"The best thing that governments can do is to stay out if it."

Not so, says Bruce Taylor, the chief architect of the CDA and a
professional cyber-scaremonger. The former Federal porn-prosecutor
believes that "not all censorship is bad."

"Foreign countries have an obligation to restrict obscenity and child
pornography on the Internet by the treaty of 1911," says Taylor. "It's
an agreement between the states to cooperate and to use international
laws to prosecute obscenity." And to Taylor, books and copies of
Penthouse magazine can be obscene.

FUTURE REGULATIONS

David Post is a likeable, bearded fellow who once studied yellow
babboons in Kenya and wears tennis shoes with his suits. Now the
co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute, Post is one of the
few lawyers who's made a serious study of the international
evolution of the 'net.

To Post, the 'net is at a fork in its development: the two paths are
self-regulation or an international government crackdown.

"It's the central problem the 'net faces today," says Post. "How does
it relieve itself of the conflicting claims of soverigns whose power is
based on geographical boundaries -- something the 'net doesn't
recognize?"

Eric Freedman, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra Law School, is
anything but optimistic. Freedman remembers how governments already
have crafted a complex constellation of little-known treaties and
agreements governing everything from satellite placement to the world
banking system and postal services.

"I'm worried that the governments are ahead of us," says Freedman.
"There's a humongous potential to get absolutely screwed here... If 100
countries agreed on this, they could get this done in a week. It's
easier for them to coordinate, agree, and implement than it is for us
to stop them from doing so."

That's why the ACLU/American Library Association lawsuit challenging
the CDA is vital. If the Supreme Court upholds the law, Congress and
the White House can craft international "decency" agreements for
cyberspace. But if the high court slams the law as unconstitutional,
Clinton would be barred from signing a CDA-type treaty. "It's a
principle of constitutional law that any treaty has to conform to the
Constitution," says Freedman.

A victory in the CDA case would, in a sense, turn the U.S. into a safe
haven for controversial content from all over the world.

Freedman urges 'netizens in every country to launch similar fights
against government 'net-censorship. "Win as many national victories as
possible to get ahead of the governments of the world," he says. "If
the German or Australian supreme courts were to rule that freedom of
speech principles apply to the 'net as they do to a newspaper, that
would be very helpful."

In the near future, that's the best way to forestall the world
information order. The first time a country proposes such a formal
treaty, it has to die from lack of support.

But pressure to regulate the 'net will always exist, and a new way of
looking at cyberspace may have to emerge. Some precedents exist.
Maritime law, for example, says that no single nation has jurisdiction
over the oceans. Medieval Europe recognized a separate law for
merchants that had its own judicial system. Antarctica is not governed
by any single country's laws. The Catholic Church is a multinational
institution that largely rules itself.

The Cyberspace Law Institute's Post argues for this model. "We should
treat cyberspace as a distinct location and allow our own distinct
legal and moral systems to evolve," he says.

He's right. As the 'net matures, no other solution will work.

Daniel Defoe described governments locking citizen inside their homes,
to no avail: "It was impossible for one man so to guard all the
passages as to prevent the escape of people made desperate... And that
which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the
infection farther."

The infection cyberspace spreads today is far more virulent than the
bubonic plague. Anathema to government, the 'net carries the virus of
freedom.

Look Rich, I have listened to your lies and rhetoric for long enough.

Please point to a single URL on my website where there is "anti-semetic

While your at it, please point to some URLs that you consider "obvious

BTW, are you still claiming on your website that Ernst Zundel has complete
control over my "cd making" operations and my now censored Pathway

If you believe that, you need look no further than the mirror to find a

&gt; Does a free speech advocate break into other people's voicemail and delete

In fairness to Marc, I should explain that the Grant Bristow he was talking
about was a government informant. The point of his affidavit was to say he
was set up. You really need to read the whole SIRC report, and all of the
rebuttals on Zundel's web page, the counter-rebuttals on Nizkor, and all of
the press reports if you want to have the foggiest idea what is going on. It
wouldn't bother me one bit if you didn't care to do that, but it would bug
me if you presumed to pass judgement without doing that.

Since we're obviously not going to do that on this list, forget the larger
issues. They do not concern fight-censorship.

&gt; Rich's point is well put, to me.  It's wrong to censor Lemire, and the
&gt; attempts tro censor him should be exposed.  But people should also be aware
&gt; of who he is and what he represents.  I'm guessing that the SWC Canada is
&gt; well aware of Lemire's extracurricular activities, and that those activities
&gt; are at least part of the reason they have tried to silence him.  Whether
&gt; that's right or not (I think not), it's important to understand, IMHO.

Actually, I disagree. Unless you happen to live in Toronto, or to be Jewish,
I see no particular reason to be interested in the larger issues. You can't
expect us as free-speech activists to investigate the background of every
censorship victim.

My point was that absent a THOROUGH investigation, which one usually cannot
do, it is improper to comment on the merits of a particular site, or even to
characterize it in any but the most general terms. 

Wiesenthal Center-Canada (not sure of the position of the US org) wants to
shut down the web site of a political opponent. Wearing our free-speech
activist hat, we can say that that is wrong. But that's all we should say
without donning another hat. 

I apologize to Marc and Declan for bringing in other issues. Backlashes
breed more backlashes. If you're interested in my opinion of and experiences
with Marc, I'd be more than happy to talk to you off the list, but my point
is precisely that such extraneous discussions, for or against any viewpoint,
do not concern fight-censorship.

Some conflicts that hit the internet censorship scene verge on actual
warfare. The Zambia newspaper case, the Basque separatist web site, and this
case are viewed by their participants as real battles. The Wiesenthal Center
probably sees its battle with neo-Nazis as a covert war, and vice versa --
and rightfully so. I know people on both sides who have "gone underground," 
at considerable risk to life and limb. The role of a free-speech/peace
activist in such a situation is to enforce the "rules of war," and try to
foster real discussion. I don't think the Nazis should be excluded from the
political system; I see no reason to wage war on them. Obviously, the
Wiesenthal Center (and a few other groups, but not the ADL or Nizkor)
disagrees. 

[An extreme case to ponder: When the UN coalition bombed and jammed the
Iraqi communications infrastructure, was that censorship? That's how Lemire 
and certain people in the Wiesenthal Center view this "battle."]

&gt;From: jaed@best.com (Jeanne A. E. DeVoto)
&gt;Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
&gt;generalized libertarian baiting. 

	Is it the place for trolls and generalized Libertarian ranting?

&gt; I for one would appreciate it if you'd knock it off in this forum; 

	Similarly, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to hear the
"Libertarian" view of the proper use of the word censorship over and over
again. But given that it's inevitable that that happens, and I think
it's distracting and politically annoying, what do you suggest I do?
Keep silent about it?

&gt; distortions, insults, and amateur psychoanalysis are not only not
&gt; helpful, they're actively harmful in sidetracking discussion and
&gt; creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one another.

	I think the rifts and ugly feelings are created initially by the
harsh criticism of the person holding a non-Libertarian view. I think if
you'll examine the record of this thread, you'll see that's the history.

&gt;If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
&gt;something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
&gt;after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please

	??? I cannot imagine how you can say this. Let's take it to e-mail.

&gt;do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list.
&gt;Thank you.

	To be frank, I think very little of Libertarianism as a
political philosophy.  But more importantly, and somewhat relevant to
this list, I've come to believe that the habits of thought it engenders
are downright harmful, that they tend to keep people from thinking
effectively about the real world - which is a very complicated mix of
government, business, social customs, and so on, all interacting with
each other. In fact, I just wrote a long article where these very points
took up much of the space. Check out, at the Ethical Spectacle webzine,
(http://www.spectacle.org/)
   Linkname: Internet Blocking Programs and Privatized Censorship
        URL: http://www.spectacle.org/896/finkel.html

	Thus, I very much want to argue against such a worldview. I
don't view this as "flamebaiting", but as "political argument" (although
I am rough at times, but this is somewhat in anticipation of stock stuff
like being called a thief and a Stalinist). Given this background, what
are your suggestions as to what should be done?

 [None of the below is really on-topic for fight-censorship, but because
 Lemire posed specific questions here, I'll answer them here. 

 As far as the topic of fight-censorship goes, Marc Lemire strongly
 disagrees with Sol Littman's campaign to shut down his web site, and so do
 the Nizkor folks and I. Obviously, we disagree concerning the value and
 importance of the content of Mr. Lemire's web pages, but that's a matter of
 free speech -- in other, more appropriate forums.

 If anyone wishes to pursue these off-topic issues, please cross-post to
 alt.fan.ernst-zundel. I no longer read alt.revisionism; not really my
 forte, and I'm too busy with other things.]

I don't believe I ever claimed either of those. I did say "Zundel's

Zundelsite files to my mirror site because the person who claims to be the
webmaster didn't know how, and you've sent at least seven "Zundelgrams." For

No need to look that far. My Zundelgram archive is right here. Was it you or

I apologize for getting the chronology backwards. Your friend Wolfgang

     The rather extended arugument over this mailing list concerning
     the Liberarian view of free speech has been extremely informative
     for me. I never felt that there was flaming involved, just heated
     discussion, which is often the best way to learn for the
     observer of an argument, because the participants are throwing
     thier best shots.
     From being a nominal supporter of Libertarian views, I have grown
     increasingly aware of the dangers involved in that position. It
     is entirely possible that another subcscriber to this list has
     been pulled in exactly the opposite direction, but hey, that's
     what free speech is about, isn't it?

Perhaps I should add - a great, pithy response that, like all pithy
statements, needs a great number of auxiliary premises and background in
order to work.  The vast majority of newsgroups are not moderated - they
are a form of expression open to all.  The question is: are citizens
subject to prior restraint or chilling effect censorship when they try to
post to these newsgroups?  If so, they're not being "moderated" - they're
being censored!

But I acknowledge - the difference between content selection and
censorship *can* get a little hazy.  Fortunately, current government
censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Yes, things can get hazy even with selection of articles for academic
journals get a bit hazy.  Complaints that journals are favouring
certain kinds of approaches over others, or some people (or countries)
over others are not uncommon.  Of course whoever owns a journal is
entitled to print what they like (?), but the problem is that some
journals have a status due to external forces (ie they are included in
citation listings, or libraries subscribe to them).  Censorship is
definitely a possibility when this is the case.  (It's all very well
being able to publish on the Internet, but if your job prospects depend
on publication in certain journals it doesn't help much.)

&gt;Fortunately, current government
&gt;censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Indeed.

(1) CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS PROPOSE SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORISM
    INITIATIVES

In the wake of the recent bombing at the Olympics and the suspected
terrorist involvement in the TWA crash, the Clinton Administration and
members of Congress are proposing a set of sweeping counter-terrorism
initiatives. If enacted into law, these proposals will dramatically
increase law enforcement surveillance authority over the Internet and other
advanced communications technologies. An outline of the Administration's
proposal was circulated on Capitol Hill on Monday July 29.

President Clinton has urged Congress to pass new counter-terrorism
legislation before the Congressional recess at the end of this week.  While
several prominent Republican members of Congress, including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), have said publicly that Congress should not rush into
any new counter-terrorism legislation, most observers believe there is a
strong possibility that some or all of the Administration's proposal will
be enacted before the August recess.

The draft proposal contains several measures which were rejected by
Congress as part of the previous counter-terrorism initiative proposed
last year after the Oklahoma City bombing, as well as several new measures
including as-yet unspecified changes to U.S. encryption policy and funding
for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a.
Digital Telephony).

CDT is concerned that the latest counter-terrorism efforts on Capitol Hill
are occurring without appropriate deliberation.  Major policy decisions
expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement should not be made
without careful consideration of the necessity of such proposals and the
relative benefit to society. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work
with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to
ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet
are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
________________________________________________________________________

MAJOR POINTS OF THE COUNTER-TERRORISM PROPOSALS CIRCULATING ON THE HILL

The administration's new counter-terrorism initiative and other amendments
circulating this week in Congress contain numerous provisions, but four
are of particular concern to the net.community:

* New Threats to Encryption, Opposition to the Pro-CODE Bill
* Funding for Digital Telephony Without Public Accountability
* Amendment to Criminalize 'Bomb-Making' Information on the Internet
* Expanded Authority for Multi-Point, "Roving" Wiretaps

The full text of the Administration's proposal and background information
are available at CDT's counter-terrorism Web Page:

    http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/

       --------------------------------------------------------

I. NEW THREATS TO ENCRYPTION, OPPOSITION TO THE PRO-CODE BILL

The Administration's outline contains the following statement on encryption:

 "* Encryption -- We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement.  We oppose legislation that would eliminate
    current export barriers and encouraging the proliferation of encryption
    which blocks appropriate access to protect public safety and the
    national security."

While no specific legislative language has yet been proposed, this
represents the first statement by the Administration that they will seek
legislation to further restrict encryption.  Even more troubling, the
Administration is clearly attempting to use the recent suspected terrorist
incidents to push for a new and more restrictive encryption policy.

This new proposal comes as Congress is finally beginning to seriously
consider major changes in U.S. encryption policy. Bipartisan legislation
in both the House and Senate to relax encryption export controls is gaining
momentum.  The Senate Commerce Committee has held 3 hearings in the last 6
weeks, and is preparing to vote to send the Burns/Leahy "Pro-CODE" bill (S.
1726) to the floor of the Senate.  The Administration's attempt to leverage
the public's concern about terrorism to block passage of the Pro-CODE bill
is disturbing, and poses a significant threat to privacy and security on the
Internet.

CDT is working with members of Congress, privacy advocates, and the
communications and computer industries to oppose any attempt by the
Administration to impose new restrictions on encryption, and we continue to
work to move the bipartisan export relief legislation through Congress.

       --------------------------------------------------------

II. FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

The Administration is also seeking to override the public accountability
provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA
- a.k.a. 'Digital Telephony') by providing a funding for the law in a way
that prevents public oversight of the FBI's surveillance ability.

Enacted in October of 1994, granted law enforcement new authority to
influence the design of telecommunications networks (the Internet,
Commercial online services, and BBS's were exempted) in order to preserve
their ability to conduct court authorized electronic surveillance.

Congress balanced this new authority with a number of mechanisms to ensure
public accountability over law enforcement surveillance ability.
While complicated, the public accountability mechanisms are designed to
work as follows:

* Law enforcement provides telecommunications carriers, the Congress,
  and the public with notice of its surveillance capacity needs (i.e.,
  the number of simultaneous wiretaps in a given geographic location)
  with an opportunity for public comment.

* Based on an assessment of the reasonableness of the law enforcement
  surveillance capacity request, Congress appropriates money to cover
  the cost of modifications.  If Congress does not believe law
  enforcement has adequately justified its request, money will not be
  appropriated.

* Telecommunications carriers are not obligated to comply with the
  statute or make any capacity modifications without government
  reimbursement.

In October 1995, the FBI published its first notice of surveillance
capacity (see CDT Policy Post Vol. 1, No. 26).  The telecommunications
industry and privacy advocates used the public accountability provisions of
CALEA to respond to the FBI's request and argued that the FBI had not
adequately justified the extensive surveillance capability contained in the
request.  As a result, Congress has not yet appropriated funds and no
modifications have been made.

The FBI clearly believes that the public accountability provisions of CALEA
are working **too well**, and appears to be using the recent focus on
terrorism to push for a new funding mechanism which does not contain public
oversight.

CDT is fighting hard to ensure that the public accountability provisions of
CALEA, which have until now prevented the FBI from acquiring unnecessary
surveillance capacity, remain a part of the law, and will vigorously oppose
any effort by the FBI and the Clinton Administration to remove the last
opportunity for public oversight over law enforcement power.

       --------------------------------------------------------

III. THE AVAILABILITY OF 'BOMB-MAKING' INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has reintroduced an amendment to make it
illegal to disseminate information on how to construct explosives knowing
that the information will be used in furtherance of a federal crime.  The
amendment was adopted by the Senate earlier this month as part of a
Department of Defense Appropriations bill.  CDT believes that the vague
provisions of the Feinstein amendment could have a chilling effect on online
speech, needlessly duplicate existing criminal statutes, and should be
removed.

Feinstein first proposed the amendment as part of the 1995
counter-terrorism bill. The initial Feinstein amendment was extremely broad
and would have resulted in a flat ban on certain constitutionally protected
speech online.  After civil liberties advocates objected, Feinstein
narrowed her amendment substantially, although it was ultimately dropped
from the final terrorism bill signed in April 1996.

       --------------------------------------------------------

IV.  EXPANDED WIRETAP AUTHORITY

The Administration's proposal would also significantly expand current
wiretapping authority to allow multi-point (or "roving") wiretaps. This
would dramatically change surveillance authority to include wiretaps of
INDIVIDUALS instead of LOCATIONS.

This proposal would do away with the delicate balance between privacy and
law enforcement that Congress has struck over 30 years of wiretapping
legislation. Federal law has always required that wiretaps issue for a
specific location, to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. In 1986 Congress
introduced a narrow exception to this rule, only for cases where it could
be shown that the target was intentionally evading wiretaps by changing
facilities. The Administration proposal would completely remove this
standard, allowing so-called "roving taps" for any persons whose behavior
makes wiretapping difficult for law enforcement.

The administration proposed similar provisions in the spring of 1995 in the
wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. These provisions proved controversial in
Congress and were dropped from the final bill.

&gt;&gt; Seth, I'm no libertarian, but I do have a problem with any system that says
&gt;&gt; a private individual or business can't select, edit, censor, or whatever you
&gt;&gt; want to call it. I mean, what exactly are you suggesting?  Would we
&gt;&gt; *require* the operators of web servers to post any materials submitted ...
&gt;
&gt;	There's a whole range of actions that could take place that don't
&gt;*require* anything. The fact that this is an immediate, knee-jerk
&gt;reaction along the same lines, now yet another person, says something
&gt;very significant. As I said, it's a real mental tick. Anytime something
&gt;negative is said about private action, bang, are-you-proposing-to-compel...

But Seth, I think the line must be drawn clearly between public and private.
I don't know that it's 'kneejerk' to make that distinction.

&gt;	We could begin by not having this immediate flaming at the
&gt;critic whenever a business is criticized. Bad publicity can have a very
&gt;potent effect on private conduct, but actions are less likely to be
&gt;changed if any complainant seeking assistance has to pass through a gauntlet
&gt;of "business is holy, how dare you question it".

You certainly won't get that from me. However, when you're discussing an
issue of possible non-government censorship, I think the strategies for
handling differ (as you imply below). Again, the line between public and
private is important, because when you're in the public context of
government & court enforcement, you have force rather than volition, as you
would have in a private context. I'm not behind a libertarian critique of
government enforcement as an inherent evil, but I would certainly agree that
force should be used judiciously, minimally, and would not apply to a
process of selection in a private context that one might construe as censorship.

&gt;	The typical tactics of influencing business are publicity
&gt;campaigns and boycotts. Boycotts are sometimes criticized themselves,
&gt;but for the scope of this discussion, I'll just point out that they are
&gt;a type of private action that doesn't require any government
&gt;intervention, We've got to get past the idea that business conduct can't
&gt;be opposed, and the immediate leap into absurdity at the very thought is
&gt;a symptom of how deeply this blindness is rooted.

Agreed. If, for instance, you think that AOL is committing egregious acts of
censorship and exclusion, drop your AOL account, fuss at/about AOL, but
don't seek government involvement or court resolution.

thx
Jon

And it would be useful to get a good working definition of censorship that

For the sake of brevity, I will not quote Jon's reply to Seth's post.

Jon makes the valid point, which I'm sure Seth agrees with, that different
responses are appropriate for state and private censorship.  Most
importantly, when dealing with private censorship, one must not run to the
government for help.  If NBC suppresses a story critical of GE (its
owner), than the public has been denied access to important information.
But if we ask the government to dictate to NBC what they can and cannot
broadcast, then we trample upon the First Amendment.  The First Amendment
_protects_ private censorship (providing no other laws are broken).  Thus
when we respond to private censorship, we must respect the First Amendment
rights of the censors.  We can publicize the censorship incident, write
letters of protest, boycott, etc.  But  we must not involve the state in
regulating speech.

Cheers,
Bob

You're right, of course.  These are muddy waters, to say the least, and I
should have dome more research before passing any judgement.

I will look at the sources you have recommended.

Thanks :)

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

	         CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
	              NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

	SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

	Dear _________,

	Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
	I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
	considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

	Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use
the tragic events in Atlanta and New York to erode the basic rights of
citizens.

The Global Internet Liberty Coalition (GILC) said that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the
Internet.  GLIC urged users of the Internet to oppose legislative
measures that could restrict the free flow of information or limit the
ability of citizens to engage in private communication.

Members of GILC include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Human Rights Watch
(HRW), the Internet Society (ISOC), Privacy International (PI), and
other organizations.

The GILC was formed in June at the annual meeting of the Internet
Society in Montreal. A temporary web page for the Global Internet
Liberty Campaign has been established at:

   http://www.aclu.org/gilc/index1.html.

A permanent home for GILC will soon be established at

=======================================================================
[2] #005#New Domestic Surveillance Provisions Proposed
=======================================================================

In the wake of the recent tragedies in Atlanta and New York, the White
House and the FBI are again calling for new federal powers to expand
wiretapping authority, even in the absence of any evidence that
inability to wiretap led to the two tragedies.  The provisions were
originally introduced as part of the counterterrorism bill but were
struck out after objection from a coalition of liberal and
conservative groups.

The White House is trying to rush the proposal through Congress this
week before the August recess.

The new measure would allow prosecutors to use of "roving wiretaps."
The Administration proposal would allow prosecutors to tap multiple
telephones in an area if they suspect that the target in switching
phones. Other recommendations include allowing for 48 hour warrantless
"emergency" wiretaps, easier access to consumer records including
phone and travel records, and restrictions on the use of encryption.

Several members of Congress were critical of the proposal. Rep. Bob
Barr (R-GA) told CNN that the proposals created "vast powers" and that
there was "no case for emergency wiretaps and roving wiretaps." Rep.
Ike Skelton (D-MO) called for greater human intelligence noting that
law enforcement and intelligence agencies "seem to rely too much on
technology". Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and others met with
President Clinton on July 29, after which Gingrich expressed tentative
support for the proposals.

The American public also remains divided on the desirability of giving
federal law enforcement new wiretapping authority. In a USA
Today/CNN/Gallop poll taken July 29, 50 percent of those polled said
that "[i]ncreasing surveillance of U.S. citizens by the government"
was "going too far." According to the poll, 45 percent supported the
measures and five percent were undecided. The New York times
editorialized on June 30 that "the proposal to expand the Government's
wiretapping authority is excessive."

A House/Senate conference committee meeting on the Defense
Appropriations bill is also reviewing a provision introduced by
Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) that would ban the dissemination of
bomb-related information on the Internet. This provision had also been
rejected in the counterterrorism bill on First Amendment grounds.

More information on wiretapping is available from:

    http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/

=======================================================================
[3]  Digital Telephony Funding Approved by House
=======================================================================

The House of Representatives approved on July 25 funding for the
Justice Department that includes a provision to fund the "digital
telephony" bill.

The bill would establish a permanent "Telecommunications Carrier
Compliance Fund" with contributions from "any agency of the United
States with law enforcement or intelligence responsibilities". Thus
agencies such as the CIA and NSA, with their secret "black budgets"
will be able to fund the wiretap program without public oversight. A
previous draft of the bill had also allowed agencies with "national
security" roles to contribute.

Funding for the proposal was rejected in two earlier attempts: the FY
1996 appropriations bill and the 1996 counter-terrorism bill. It now
goes to the Senate where advocates will attempt to remove the funding
provision.

A copy of the House bill and more information on wiretapping is
available from:

=======================================================================
[4] Another Court Enjoins CDA
=======================================================================

Another federal court has ruled that the Communications Decency Act is
unconstitutional and has prohibited its enforcement.  This follows the
decision earlier this month by a federal court in Pennsylvania
striking down two provisions in a case brought by the ACLU, EPIC, ALA
and others.

In this case, Joe Shea, editor of the American Reporter an online
newspaper, challenged the CDA in US District in New York city. Shea
published an "indecent" article by Judge Steve Matthews, a Texas state
judge and law professor, and then challenged the CDA.

The court ruled that the section prohibiting the dissemination of
"indecent" speech was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and
affected protected speech between adults. The court also found that
presently there was no practical way to block the material using
currently available blocking software and thus the affirmative defense
were not adequate to save the law: "there is no persuasive evidence
that a substantial proportion of Internet content providers can make
available material potentially within the scope of the CDA without
fear of prosecution and criminal liability."

Unlike the ACLU case, however, the court rejected the challenge to the
CDA as being overly vague. It ruled that there was substantial case
law available on what was "indecent" that has been upheld by the
courts. It also rejected the assertion that because of the global
nature of the Internet, online providers could not be expected to know
what was indecent everywhere:

   "We have no basis for concluding that Internet content providers are
   any less capable than those subject to obscenity laws or other
   indecency restrictions to acquire a general familiarity with the
   relevant standards; indeed, one might conclude that a content
   provider's contact with others around the country and around the world
   through interactive computer services would cultivate a heightened
   awareness of regional and cultural differences."

The US Justice Department has twenty days to appeal this decision to the
US Supreme Court. DOJ has already filed a petition for appealing the
Pennsylvania case to the Court, which will hear it in its fall session.

In a case raising similar issues brought before a French court, the French
Conseil Constitutionnel on July 24 struck down a recently enacted French
law Internet censorship law known as the "Fillon amendment". The court
ruled that placing Internet regulations under the control of the Conseil
Superieur de l'Audiovisuel and requiring Internet service providers to
take the advice of the CSA was a violation of free speech rights.

=======================================================================
[5] Congressional Hearing Critical of US Crypto Policy
=======================================================================

Senators at the July 25 hearing of the Commerce Committee on S. 1726, the
PRO-Code legislation were openly critical of current US policy on
cryptography.  Senators Burns, Pressler, Ashcroft openly questioned the
viability of key escrow and the effects of export controls on American
business.

The first panel of the hearing included FBI Director Louis Freeh, William
Reinch, Undersectrary of the Bureau of Export Administration for the US
Department of Commerce, and William Crowell, Deputy Director of the
National Security Agency. The panelists opposed S. 1726 and supported the
implementation of an international key escrow system. Freeh claimed that
five percent of all cases show evidence of cryptography.

Many of the Senators were openly critical of the current export controls
and the viability of creating a comprehensive international key escrow
system. Senator Pressler held up a copy of Applied Cryptography and a disk
and described the restrictions on the disk as "somewhat absurd." Sen. Ron
Wyden noted "The terrorists and drug merchants of the 21st century are not
going to be encryption simpletons."  Senator Burns described the
international key escrow system as a "pipe dream." When Undersecretary
Reinsch claimed that "there's a very clear commercial interest in having
hardware and/or software with a back door" to prevent a "electronic tower
of Babel", Senator Ashcroft forced him to admit that the only real use
would be for government access and then questioned the Constitutionality of
the proposal and invoked the Filegate incident as an example of the
potential abuses.

Under questioning by Senator Burns, FBI Director Louis Freeh acknowledged
that if the current "voluntary" policy failed, he would seek mandatory
domestic controls on cryptography. Freeh told the Committee:

  I don't think I'm at that point yet.  I believe that the policy
  that is enunciated here is a doable policy, but there could come a
  point where that policy, the voluntary policy, is not a viable
  one.  And then I would certainly look at more mandatory controls.
  Not that that might work, but backing up my position that's where
  ultimately I would be.

A second panel was made up of industry representatives who supported S.
1726. James Barkesdale of Netscape Communications testified that his
company has lost 30 percent of its business to foreign competitors who have
stronger security systems. He described the Clipper III proposal as "most
massive computer infrastructure on the planet . . . beyond belief." Ron
Pieper of Tandem Computers described the key escrow system as "an absolute
show stopper" for electronic commerce.

The bill may now be considered by the Commerce Committee this week and then
sent to the full Senate for a vote in September after the Congressional
recess. More information, including Freeh's written testimony, is available

        On August 1, 1996 Canuck Soup ONLINE will mirror a controversial
white supremacist Internet web site that is dedicated to hosting
controversial groups.
        I am the webmaster for CSO and a 15 year old British Columbian. I
decided to mirror the "Freedom Site" because of B.C.'s misguided attempt to
censor the Internet -- a decision sparked by hate groups.
        I do not agree with the Freedom Site's content, but I do agree that
they have a fundamental right to express their political opinions, both on and
off the Internet. The B.C. government has no experience or understanding of
cyberspace, or a right to censor or suppress legal expression, even if it's
on a web site.
        I'm also requesting that other people who are interested in
mirroring the Freedom Site contact freedom@netcom.ca (the webmaster at
freedom site) and e-mail me at dnedre@netshop.net to inform me that you are
setting up a mirror of the Freedom Site.

ELECTRONIC FRONTIER CANADA (EFC) --- PRESS RELEASE
(For immediate release --- Thursday, August 1, 1996
---------------------------------------------------


   BC teenager takes on BC government in bold free speech battle


A 15-year-old boy in Smithers, BC, says he will be "mirroring" the
controversial web pages that had prompted the BC Attorney General
to call for controls on the flow of "hate" through the Internet.

Frank Sayre, who acts as webmaster for the `Canuck Soup' web pages says,
"I decided to mirror the `Freedom Site' because of B.C.'s misguided
attempt to censor the Internet".

"I do not agree with the Freedom Site's content," he continues,
"but I do agree that they have a fundamental right to express
their political opinions, both on and off the Internet."

"The B.C. government has no experience or understanding of cyberspace,
... nor does it have any right to censor or suppress legal expression,
even if it's on a web site," says the young cyber-activist.

Sayre says he's encouraging other like-minded individuals to help him
make his point by setting up their own "mirror sites" -- something he's
facilitated by packaging up the information into a downloadable
"ZIP file" that his web pages boasts will enable anyone to
"Set up your own Freedom-Site in 5 minutes or less!"

"It's a controversial approach," admits David Jones, president of
Electronic Frontier Canada, who recalls that a similar tactic was
successful earlier this year in getting Germany's Deutsche Telekom
to back down when it started blocking access to Ernst Zundel's web
pages based in southern California.

Although Electronic Frontier Canada is a staunch defender of free speech
in cyberspace, the organization won't be setting up a mirror site of
its own.  "I want to be clear that we don't endorse the views expressed
in any of these so-called `hate' web pages," says Jeffrey Shallit,
EFC vice-president, acknowledging that many Canadians find them
offensive and distasteful.

"We do agree, however, that attempts to censor web pages are pointless
and misguided.  First, attempts at censorship just give more media
attention to these people, who desperately crave attention, and second,
the end result tends to be that the information gets copied around
the Internet to these mirror sites -- which can hardly be considered
an improvement."

Both Shallit and Sayre make reference to the approach advocated by
US Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas: "The way to combat noxious
ideas is with other ideas.  The way to combat falsehood is with truth."
(from 1958 interview with Mike Wallace)

The Nizkor Project, run by B.C.'s own Ken McVay, is a notable example
of this approach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

                 CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
                      NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use

Free speech isn't only for those with dangerous ideas; privacy isn't just
for suspected criminals.

As Internet users, we all have a stake in standing up for free speech *and*
privacy.

With your indulgence, I'm passing along an important alert regarding
several telecommunications surveillance proposals that Congress may
adopt... perhaps as soon as FRIDAY.

If you can, please call Congress on Friday to insist that our legislators
carefully consider the privacy implivations of any proposal to expland the
FBI's wiretap authority.  Your call can make a very big difference.

Full details follow below.

Work the network!

surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

 If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to know there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

Thank you for calling attention to the need for clarification.  By running to
the government to help I meant asking the government to intervene in a way
contrary to the First Amendment--e.g. by forcing a newspaper to print something
it does not want to print.  Using the courts is a  perfectly valid way of asking the 
government for help in cases where private institutions are trampling on the First 
Amendment rights of others.  If I didn't believe in the appropriateness of using
the courts, I never would have involved the National Writers Union as a plaintiff
in the suit to invalidate the CDA.  (Granted, this is a case of state censorship.)

Anyway, my original message certainly left me open to misinterpretation.  Forgive
my sloppiness and thank you for calling this to my attention.

Cheers,
Bob

*  CYBER-LIBERTIES ALERT: Anti-Terrorism Measure Threatens Net Liberty 
 
The latest understanding from ACLU's legislative representatives is that
the "Anti Terrorism" bill that is expected to be acted on today and
tomorrow will include government controls on encryption -- a scheme for key
escrow of private keys for encryption. It is also likely to include
expanded use of wiretapping without a Court order. 
 
There is absolutely no evidence at this time to show that either the TWA
tragedy or the Olympic Park bombing could have been prevented or any crimes
solved by increased government power to control the use of encryption or to
wiretap.  
 
Please call your Congress member and Senators immediately and ask them to
oppose these measures.

* Congress Attacks Our Medical Privacy 
 
The House-Senate Conference Committee has reported out H.R. 3103, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill. The U.S. House conferees pushed
for and achieved the inclusion of their deceptively-labeled "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments (which were not in the Senate's
version). The bill is scheduled to go to the House floor for a vote today,
and to the Senate floor for a vote tomorrow.  It then would still require
the President's signature. 
 
With "Administrative Simplification" and its related amendments included,
this bill is profoundly destructive to the Medical Privacy Rights of each
and every person in the United States. 
 
Specifically: 
 
1.)  Medical Records will be computerized in vast databases run by the
government and/or large corporations, including consumer credit reporting
companies whose problems with both privacy and accuracy are
well-documented. 
 
This will create, without any consent or control by patients (all of us), a
COMPUTERIZED "LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OF OUR MEDICAL RECORDS. Just as the
Social Security Administration and the U.S. military can't protect their
computers from unauthorized access, so too the new Medical Records "Lending
Library" will not be secure. 
 
2.)  Each of us will have a "UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFIER" NUMBER assigned to
us by the government, and the government will force this number to be used
in connection with any and all health care. 
 
3.) Although the bill does not formally preempt state laws protecting our
medical privacy, it establishes a structure and creates conditions that
will make it unlikely for such state laws to survive. 
 
IF YOU VALUE YOUR MEDICAL PRIVACY, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. 
 
Call your own U.S. Senators (202-224-3121) and U.S. Representative
(202-225-3121) and tell them to "KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY MEDICAL RECORDS". 
 
Urge your Representative and Senators to oppose passing any Health Care
bill that violates our medical privacy by having "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments.  Tell them to SEND IT BACK TO THE
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, and to JUST SAY NO TO "ADMINISTRATIVE
SIMPLIFICATION." 
 
You can also reach the Capital Switchboard at 1-800-962-3524. 
 
----- 
 
For your convenience, we supply the following talking points: 
 
H.R. 3103 (the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill) should be opposed
because it includes the deceptively labeled "administrative simplification"
section and its related provisions. 
 
For example: 
 
1. The bill would give government and corporations access to confidential
medical information about individuals without their consent.  Violating the
privacy of medical patients is very unpopular.  The Time/CNN Poll found
that 87% of Americans "believe patients should be asked for permission
every time any information about them is used." (Time, May 6, 1996, p. 61) 
 
2. The bill creates the framework for a national medical data collection
and data transfer system, beginning with claims and billing data and
proceeding to the entire medical record.  The system will include data
processing clearinghouses, which may also serve as repositories for data. 
This would create, without any consent or control by the patient, a
"COMPUTERIZED LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OUR MEDICAL RECORDS, vulnerable to
being accessed by unauthorized unsuitable parties. 
 
3. The bill has THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING A UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFICATION
NUMBER UPON EVERY PATIENT, health provider, health plan, and employer,
thereby establishing a vast, bureaucracy-dictated, national ID regime, with
the new government numbers being the key to everyone's private Medical
Records. 
 
4. The bill gives new powers and duties to the National Committee on Vital
and Health Statistics, authorizing extensive new statistical studies,
including "health status" studies.  These studies no doubt will make use of
the large stores of individually identified medical information which will
now be easily obtainable (especially by this committee; see what follows). 
 
5. The bill has the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
advising the Secretary of HHS on privacy regulations, a responsibility in
conflict with its duties of data collection and analysis.  The committee,
which will be composed largely of statisticians, epidemiologists, health
services researchers and experts on computerized medical information
systems, is ill suited for protecting the patient's right to privacy and
medical record confidentiality. 
 
6. The bill will undercut state laws that protect medical privacy. 
 
HR 3103 should be rejected so long as it includes any "administrative
simplification" or related provisions. Such provisions cannot be fixed;
they must be deleted from the bill.

* ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace; New
Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats 
 
NEW YORK:  Despite a second federal court decision affirming that
censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today warned of
persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and internationally, to censor
electronic communications and regulate privacy technology. 
 
At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known as "G-7,"
government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate the Internet and
other electronic communications in an effort to 
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing incident at
the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight 800, which is being
investigated as a possible terrorist bombing. Participants included France,
Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany, Canada, Russia and the United States.  
 
Although not all details were made public, proposed measures apparently
include investigations of charities and political organizations with
radical political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech
-- and using the Internet to "monitor" terrorist communications.  There was
also agreement to adopt a U.S. plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed
encryption, which would mean that individuals and companies would be barred
from using encryption technology to electronically lock up their most
private and sensitive information unless they make the keys available to
their government.   
 
In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and electronic
privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed last month at a
meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal. [See the GILC release below.] 
The group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition with
organizations from around the world to share information and protect free
speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the global Internet. 
GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
Human Rights Watch, the Internet Society, Privacy International, and other
civil liberties and human rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding
member of the group. 
 
"GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and that decisions
made by international bodies like the G-7 nations affect all Internet
users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.  "The U.S.
government may not accomplish through an international end-run what the
U.S. Congress and the U.S. Courts have rejected." 
 
Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges in New York
declaring that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional.  The decision
marked another win in the ongoing battle for free speech in cyberspace,
which saw its first major victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a
Philadelphia court granted a motion for preliminary injunction on
"indecency" provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed
its challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed into
law. 
 
"We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their Philadelphia
colleagues in protecting the Internet from governmental intrusion," said
Steinhardt, who testified in the Philadelphia case.  "But we remain
concerned about the government's continuing efforts to censor electronic
speech, not only in the United States but internationally." 
 
In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal that would
make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-making in print, radio,
television or in cyberspace.   Violations would be punishable by up to 20
years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. 
 
"This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last year, would
criminalize everything from a high school chemistry teacher explaining
basic scientific principles, to a newspaper carrying an illustration of a
bomb's construction, to a U.S. Department of Agriculture manual describing
how to make fertilizer bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's
Steinhardt said. 
 
In addition, President Clinton this week announced an initiative to
increase the powers of federal investigators, including an expanded
wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has commended the Clinton
Administration and law enforcement authorities for their investigation into
recent tragic incidents, it urged President Clinton and Congress in a
letter sent to the White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit"
by safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss continuing
civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

*  GILC Opposes Efforts to Regulate Internet; Group Calls G-7 Efforts
Anti-Democratic 
 
The Global Internet Liberty Coalition said today that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the Internet. 
The announcement follows a meeting of G-7 leaders in Paris where plans were
announced to regulate the Internet in ways that threaten the Free Speech
and Privacy rights of it users. 
 
The G-7 countries include the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also participates in the meetings of the
G-7. 
 
The G-7 proposal, while couched in careful diplomatic terms, appears to
endorse a U.S. Government initiated plan to require key escrowed encryption
on the Internet -- a scheme where the keys for decryption would be
accessible to governments.  There is also language which suggests plans to
restrict the electronic publication of information by unpopular political
organizations. 
 
Earlier attempts by officials in the US Administration to pass similar
measures through Congress have failed. 
 
Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director of the ACLU, said "The US government
may not accomplish through an international end-run what the US Congress
and the US Courts have rejected." 
 
The ACLU was lead plaintiff in the successful challenge to the
Communications Decency Act.  In that case, a US federal court held that the
government may not regulate speech on the Internet. 
 
Simon Davies, director general of Privacy International, said that the
human rights community must not permit national governments to seize
control of privacy enhancing technologies.  "National governments will use
the horrendous incidents in the States to build a international web of
surveillance to the detriment of their citizens." 
 
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, said that the proposals would meet with fierce opposition from
the Internet community.  "Net users will simply not allow governments to
trample on the rights of citizens.  Our rights to privacy and free speech
are clearly protected by international law." 
 
EPIC organized the Internet petition against the Clipper encryption scheme.

 
Cynthia Brown, program director of Human Rights Watch, said, "Free speech
on the Internet is already under attack from states like Saudi Arabia,
China and Singapore, and with this agreement, the G7 countries are only
reinforcing that negative trend." 
 
Human Rights Watch has produced a report on threats to Liberty on the
Internet. 
 
The GILC was formed at the annual meeting of the Internet Society in
Montreal.  Members of the coalition include the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the
Internet Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and
human rights organizations.

It's not over yet....

The House has scheduled a vote on "suspension" for a 'counter-terrorism'
bill TODAY (Friday).

Despite media reports that the negotiations had stalled out, house
Republicans have apparently worked out their differences and are set to
vote on the bill today.  The Senate may or may not vote on the measure on
Saturday.

No one I've talked to knows for sure what's in the bill, though I have
heard that there are no encryption provisions and that some of the wiretap
proposals have been scaled back.

I will post details as I get them. In the mean time, keep those calls
coming into Congress.

The outline below is from a document produced by the House Republican
Conference.  It is ONLY A SUMMARY of the proposed bill and is NOT actual
legislation.  No one I have spoken with has seen any specific legislative
language yet.

The outline is confusing on several points, particularly the "FBI DIGITAL
TELEPHONY" Section, which says:

 "The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to
  investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding for equipment purchase was
  provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier this
  year."

The first sentence above is not at all clear, and probably won't be until
we can get our hands on the actual text of the bill. It could be additional
wiretap authority (ie, roving wiretaps), or it could be nothing.  As far as
the funding goes, the "1996 omnibus appropriations measure" DID NOT contain
funding for implementation of the law - but it did appropriate $37 million
to cover new equipment for the FBI.

The rest looks like it is a scaled back version of a measure the
Administration and members of Congress were pushing earlier this week, but
the scope of the new bill depends a lot on what the actual text says.

I will post additional information as soon as I get it.

                Bipartisan Antiterrorism Initiative
                                HR__

                     Committee on the Judiciary
                          No Report Filed
                         To Be Introduced

Floor Situation:

The House is scheduled to consider HR__ on Friday August 2, 1996. On
Thursday August 1, the Rules Committee granted a rule to allow the bill to
be considered under suspension of the rules. It is debatable for 40
minutes, may not be amended, and requires a two-thirds vote for passage.

Summary:

HR__ includes several bipartisan initiatives intended to bolster federal
efforts to combat domestic terrorism in addition to those already enacted
earlier this year as part of the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132).  The bill contains the following
counter-terrorism provisions:

Aviation SECURITY MEASURES: The bill enables domestic airports to
aggressively search for and prevent explosives from causing destruction and
harm to individuals or property through enhanced explosive detection
procedures, baggage and passenger screening, and FBI authority to improve
airport security training and standards to ensure that provisions of the
1990 Aviation Security Act (P.L 101-604) are implemented expeditiously.
Specifically, the bill (1) requires the FAA to implement increased
explosives section methods immediately, (2) strengthen the level of
training and expertise possessed by security personnel who are assigned to
domestic airports, (3) allows airports to use available funding to
reinforce such training for security personnel, and (4) extends criminal
background requirements to include a greater number of airport employees.

IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS: The bill urges
implementation of provisions enacted in the 1996 Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132), such as designating and
freezing the assets of foreign terrorist organizations and implementing
expedited removal procedures for aliens convicted of a crime.

BIPARTISAN "BLUE RIBBON" COMMISSION: The bill establishes a special
commission to review all aspects of U.S. anti-terrorism policy and make
legislative recommendations about methods to most effectively establish a
long-term defense against terrorist threats, including enhancing the
nation's human intelligence capabilities.

PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENTS: The bill includes provisions which grant a cause of
action against the U.S. if in the course of a wiretap investigation
damaging information is willfully disclosed to the detriment of an innocent
party by the federal government.  The cause of action includes monetary
damages to the plaintiff if a favorable decision is rendered in federal
court.

EXPLOSIVES STUDY: The bill authorizes a study on black and smokeless powder
by an independent agency selected by the National Institute of Justice.

FEDERAL RACKETEERING STATUTE CRIMES: The bill permits federal prosecutors
to deem those acts determined to be terrorist in nature as substantial
enough to invoke criminal prosecution under existing criminal racketeering
(RICO) statutes.

FBI DIGITAL TELEPHONY: The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced
telephone technology to investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding
for equipment purchase was provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations
measure enacted earlier this year.

Check out this quote by Rep. Charles Schumer I found in an article by CNN:

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

The article also reports:

"Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

"They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties."

U.S. anti-terrorism talks collapse
But proposals could resurface

August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 9:30 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) --
Congressional efforts to draft new anti-terrorism legislation before the
August recess a the end of the week collapsed Thursday night in a partisan
stalemate. But lawmakers said
there is hope for agreement after the monthlong break.

Key members of the Senate blamed House conservatives for the failure,
saying they had insisted on linking proposed new wiretapping authority
for the FBI to an expansion of privacy laws.

"There's no possibility of anything to be signed before the recess," Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Delaware, said after the last series of meetings on the
issue broke up.

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

Although Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
and Biden, the panel's top Democrat, said there no longer seemed to be a
possibility of passing a bill before the recess, they thought it could be
done before Congress adjourns for the year.

Hatch said negotiators had agreed on a dozen issues, but key requests by
the administration for new wiretap authority and for a broader study of
using chemicals in gunpowder to help trace it were not among them.

Worries about privacy

Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties.

"The White House is not free of blame here. They want it immediately;
we can give it to them in early September," said Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, who heads the bipartisan task force that has been negotiating
with administration officials.

Craig, who had hoped for House and Senate votes on a new
anti-terrorism package before the recess, declined to declare defeat
Thursday evening. Asked whether passage was still possible, he said, "I
hope so."

President Clinton has urged Congress to take quick action, because of the
Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta and the crash of TWA
=46light 800, suspected to have been caused by a bomb.

The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

The House passed a revised counter-terrorism bill this afternoon by a
substantial majority.  The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate
on Saturday 8/3, and is likely to pass.

The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening
provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from
the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI
objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap
authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed
bill.

In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. Earlier
in the week, the Administration had circulated an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. It's nice to finally have a number of powerful
allies joining the usual defenders of net.freedom on Capitol Hill.

The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a controvertial provisions expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.

The bill also contains a small but not insigificant privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.

This is not over yet -- many of these issues, particularly encryption and
Digital Telephony funding, are likely to be back before the Congress in
September, so stay tunned...

Thanks to everyone who called Congress today to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
mave had really made a difference in this debate.

More as it comes...

Stop the presses -- the other shoe didn't drop. Despite a flurry of
last-minute hyperbole, the House passed an anti-terrorism bill this
afternoon without the ominous encryption or wiretap provisions. Now
the bill lies in the lap of the Senate, which probably will approve it
later today or tomorrow before they leave town for the August recess.

In the wake of the dual bombings, Congress wanted to be seen as taking
*some* action before they adjourned, and last weekend Clinton and the
Dems started lobbying hard for the heinous measures they wanted in an
anti-terrorism bill. Vastly expanded state-snooping capabilities:
multipoint wiretaps, warrantless short-term wiretaps, dialed-phone
number recorders, and black and smokeless powder taggants. Even
possible of anti-crypto language that Jamie Gorelick, deputy attorney
general, has been shopping around for months.

The Net owes its thanks to the House Republicans for stopping these
fool Dems in a fine backroom political maneuver late last night.

They did it through the House Rules Committee, which in the wee hours
of the morning reported a rule allowing the GOP leadership to introduce
the terrorism bill on the floor today -- without letting Democrats see
it, amend it, or even send it back to committee. It was a good plan --
coordinated by Rep. Chris Cox -- keeping the legislation away from the
hands of the Big Brother Dems.

The Democrats waxed pissy. Rep. David Bonior, the party's whip, called
the majority's maneuvering "extrordinary." John Conyers, the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, blasted Gingrich and the
Republican leadership for "bringing a meaningless bill to the House
floor."

Conyers said to reporters at 1 pm: "It's a hoax on the American
people. It is all bark and no bite... This bill is missing the
important wiretapping provisions that would allow law enforcement to
find and stop terrorists before they kill. The House Republicans and
the NRA say we should not have emergency authority for surveillance
even if we know terrorists are about to blow a plane out of the sky.
They also say that we should not have wiretap authority for terrorists who
use more than one telephone to make their deadly plans."

Of course, this is political grandstanding at its finest -- or worst.
Conyers conveniently neglected to add that law enforcement officers
already have the right to use roving wiretaps with court approval.

Also, there was a mixup over Digital Telephony funding, compounded by
the text of the legislation's being kept secret until the last minute.
Summaries distributed to reporters early this afternoon said: "The bill
authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to investigate
suspected terrorist activity. Funding for equipment purchase was
provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier
this year." But the DT provisions weren't in the final draft of the bill.

Silly Congressperns. The House had *already* approved the DT slushfund
on July 24 as part of the 1997 Commerce, Justice, State departments
appropriations bill.

Now the 1997 CJS appropriations bill goes to the Senate, which will
decide how much cash to give Digital Telephony when they return in early
September.

What's going to happen? Well, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), a former
prosecutor and longtime proponent of Digital Telephony, said yesterday
at the Intelligence Committee hearing on terrorism: "I was proud to
have worked with the FBI director to ensure passage of the
Communications Assisatance for Law Enforcement Act, sometimes called
the digital telephony law."

With Republicans like the ones in the House, who needs so-called "civil
libertarian" Democrats?

Joe, I was a staffer on Jerry Brown's 1992 presidental campaign in Santa 
Monica and NYC. I'm hardly an uncritical supporter of the Republicans.

However, I believe in giving credit where it is due, and they deserve our 
thanks this week. Next week the opposite may be true when the Republicans 
conspire to trample on our free expression rights.

But the undercurrent of political posturing worked in our favor for a
change and we should welcome the reprive. Why are the Dems being
anti-civil-lib suddenly? My first thought is because one of their own is
in the White House, overseeing the DoJ, running for re-election, so Dems
are closing ranks. They also seem truly to enjoy being the "law-and-order"
party for a change.

This was picked up by the local Fox affiliate, Channel 5, and headlined 
on the 10 pm news yesterday.

I was sitting in my living room with a friend -- we had just finished
watching a rather poor episode of X-Files -- and we looked at each other
and sighed as Fox detailed how the investigation had shifted to a small
Georgia college where Jewell was a security guard. "Investigators are
trying to determine whether he downloaded bomb-making information from the
Internet while working at the college." 

This is a very virulent meme.

The Senate left without voting on the anti-terrorism bill. This is not

  County Accuses Four of Using the Internet to Access Child Porn
  --------------------------------------------------------------

By Ronald K. Fitten
Seattle Times Staff Reporter

Four men, including two former Microsoft employees, have been charged
with allegedly using computers to access child pornography on the
Internet, said King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.

"Traditional law-enforcement efforts against child pornography have
focused on magazines, movies, and tangible materials," Maleng said
yesterday.  "But law enforcement faces new challenges with the
emergence of new technology.  The Internet, with its millions of
international web sites, has become the new underground highway for
illegal child pornography."

The two former Microsoft engineers, Michael Seaman, 37, of Kirkland,
and Ronald Rosul Jr., 31, of Seattle, allegedly used Microsoft
computers to access and copy child pornography from the Internet,
according to prosecutors.

[...]

Both Seaman and Rosul will be arraigned next week in King County
Superior Court.  If convicted, both could receive up to one year in
jail.

Maleng, who said police and prosecutors worked cooperatively with
Microsoft throughout the investigation, said law-enforcement officers
had confiscated computer hard drives, CD-ROMs, and printed materials
as evidence.

Found this buried deep in the long version of an AP story about the
Atlanta pipe bomb suspect:

      Bomb-making instructions available through the global computer
      network have contributed to an increase in bombings in the United
      States, authorities say. 

Did I miss the news story where that contribution was identified?  Or is 
the AP mis-stating what their FBI "expert" said on Monday.

Incidentally, the source for the oft-repeated statement that the FBI was 
"trying to determine whether Jewell may have had access to the campus
Internet" [sic] is not in the FBI; it's someone on the campus who believes
that that's what the FBI is doing.

House approves anti-terrorism bill
By Rose Aguilar

August 2, 1996, 6:15 p.m. PST

          The United States House of Representatives tonight approved the
          Anti-Terrorism act of 1996 by a sweeping 389 to 22 vote, but to
          the relief of Net activists passed a version free of amendments
          that would have regulated Net content, restricted encryption
          technology, and expanded the use of wiretapping.

          The Democrats fought hard for the encryption, Internet, and
          wiretapping provisions, but lost to arguments from
          conservatives and libertarians that the provisions would be an
          infringement of citizens' First Amendments rights. The law that
          was approved by the house also did not include the amendment
          re-introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would have made
          it a felony to publish information about bombs and bomb-making
          on the Internet.

[...]

          The anti-terrorism section of the bill adds several
          terrorism-related crimes to the list of offenses included in
          the federal antiracketeering law. Under this section, the
          penalty for unlawful disclosure of information obtained from a
          wiretap doubles from 5 to 10 years.

          The bill went to the Senate today. Supporters would like the
          bill to be approved without changes and then sent to the
          President. The Senate may vote as early as Saturday or may
          decide to make changes and wait to approve its own version
          until next month.

          "I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said online
          activist Declan McCullagh. "The Senate may or may not act
          tomorrow, but I think the Net has a reprieve from the Net
          crackdown in terms of bomb information until September," he
          said.

Louis Freeh beats his fear-mongering drum while singing his wiretap tune....


From: http://www.cnn.com

FBI chief: U.S. 'under attack' by terrorists
August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 6:05 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States may face "a very difficult time"
coping with terrorists, and new counter-terrorism weapons are needed,
FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.

On expanded wiretap powers being sought by the FBI as part of that
defense, he said: "We're simply trying to catch up with technology. And
that is critical."

[ ... ]

He referred to the two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 24
servicemen; the bombing that killed one woman at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta; and the still-unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800.

Although the combined incidents have "completely consumed" law
enforcement personnel, Freeh said the wiretap proposals would not give
the government "expansive powers" and would not lead to "an avalanche of
new electronic surveillance."

"The United States and its interests both here and around the world are
clearly under attack. And we may be in for a very difficult time with
respect to continuation of these types of things," Freeh said.

Anti-terrorism negotiations

Freeh spoke a day after the White House, after wrangling with key
Republican lawmakers, won tentative agreement on a package of
anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority.

[ ... ]

The negotiators, led by Craig and White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, hoped to have a package ready for a vote by the end of the
week.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders summoned
Attorney General Janet Reno, Panetta and Freeh to a private meeting
Thursday to explain why some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't
been spent.

"We have been somewhat behind in the hiring of people" for
anti-terrorism programs, because of the time needed to screen applicants
for such sensitive work, Freeh explained during his Senate testimony
Thursday.

NETCOM SETTLES SUIT WITH CHURCH

Out-of-court deal with Scientologists

BY MARK LEIBOVICH
Mercury News Staff Writer

A lawsuit that many in the online community feared would set a
precedent restricting freedom of expression on the internet was
resolved quitely Saturday in an out-of-court settlement in San
Jose.

Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc. announced it has
settled the intellectual property dispute initiated by
Religious Technology Center, the publishing wing of the Church
of Scientology.

RTC had brought a claim against Netcom, seeking to prohibited
what is viewed as illegal postings of sacred church writings,
some of which it claimed were protected under US copyright
laws.  Both parties agreed not to disclose specific details
of the settlement.

According to a statement, Netcom as set up a protocol on its
company home page for handling future intellectual property
disputes.

[...]

The full text of the protocol can be found on Netcom's home
page, at
http://www.netcom.com/about/protectcopy.html

[...]

"I would hate to see Netcom be put in the position of having
to police the material posted on its service," says Howard
Rheingold, a well-known digital community guru, and author of
the 1993 book Virtual Community, who is not familiar with the
details of the case.

AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into
the computers of the European parliament and
European commission as part of an international
espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and
political secrets, according to investigators, write
Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. 

The European parliament has called in British
communications experts to improve its security and
to block further attempts by American govern ment
agents to spy on its workings. 

Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg
offices say they have discovered several recent
instances in which its communications system was
compromised by American hacking. They have also
found evidence that the Americans used information
obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations
last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). 

Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the
European parliament, said he was shocked by the
disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the
American ambassador [to the European Union]," he
said. 

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese
and French governments of hacking into their
communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets. 

The European parliament's computer network links
more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and
other staff to each other, and to the European
commission headquarters in Brussels and the council
of ministers. 

Traffic across the network by telephone and
computers includes details of the private medical
and financial records of many MEPs and officials,
and discussion documents on confidential issues,
including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The
records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE
and fraud are also stored on the system. 

European parliament sources say the Americans
accessed the network by compromising the
information exchanges that link the parliament's
internal networks with the Internet and external
users. 

The devices, called "routers", filter entry to the
European parliament's network. It is understood the
Americans were able to obtain access to what is
called the simple network management protocol
(SNMP), the language that enables the networks to
talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact
that parts of the system were manufactured by two
American firms. 

The breach came to light when officials believed
that American negotiators had been given advance
warning of confidential European Union positions
in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established
that the system had been penetrated just days before
the talks," an EU source said. "Our principal
concern is not to establish what has already been
copied but to ensure that it does not happen again.
This is an on-going problem." 

A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of
data processing at the commission, confirmed that
allegations of hacking had been investigated.
However, she said she was unable to provide any
details.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of 
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.
                  
   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

This is the truly astonishing thing to me about terrorism in America. If,
at least for the sake of argument, the goal of terrorism in America is to
weaken the country through such attacks, it's phenomenally stupid to hand
terrorists a victory on a silver platter by gutting our Constitution as our
response.

Why bother to bring down the American government when the American
government can do a pretty good job of peeling way the nation's alleged
principles all on it own in the name of political brownie points?

           O'REILLY ANNOUNCES "NETACTIVISM" GUIDE TO
           USING THE INTERNET IN GRASSROOTS POLITICS
  Veteran Grassroots Activist Shares the Secrets of Online Success

SEBASTOPOL, CA--It's no secret that the American citizen is fed up with
politics as usual. Fewer people are voting in every election, and those
who do vote aren't sure it matters. During this presidential primary
season, noted Internet publisher O'Reilly & Associates is releasing in
"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet," a book that will show
ordinary people who want to reclaim politics--from the neighborhood to
the national level--how to use the power of the Internet to make a
difference.

Written by veteran political activist and former Philadelphia city
councilman Ed Schwartz, "NetActivism" is a no-hype guide that shows
readers how to use the Internet to find out what the government really
does, as well as how to organize around a cause or a community with
online tools like electronic mailing lists, online debates, and Web
sites.

A leader in citizen movements for more than 30 years, author Schwartz
embraced the Internet not because it's cool, but because it gets the
job done. He has an extensive online presence: a Web site
(http://libertynet.org/community/phila/natl.html) that serves community
activists across the country, a mailing list that discusses civic
values, and ties to a community network that organizes citizens across
the city of Philadelphia. "NetActivism" features real-world examples
from Schwartz's Institute for Civic Values and a host of other citizen
groups, including the Downtown Minneapolis Residents Association and
Project VoteSmart.

Community activists, politicians--and any concerned citizens who care
about their community--will find "NetActivism" packed with advice on
conducting online research, getting the right equipment and software,
using online networks in local communities, and crafting political
campaigns on the Net.

"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet" will be released on
September 24. Produced by O'Reilly affiliate Songlione Studios for
O'Reilly's Songline Guide imprint, "NetActivism" includes a CD-ROM with
Internet software and limited free online time.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ed Schwartz, founder and president of the Institute for the Study of
Civic Values, has been a national leader in movements to revitalize
neighborhoods and expand citizen participation in government for more
than 25 years.  In the 1970s, he built a city-wide coalition of
community organizations that led to his upset election to the
Philadelphia City Council as a councilman-at-large in 1984. Between
1987 and 1992, he served as director of Philadelphia's Office of
Housing and Community Development, overseeing the rehabilitation of
more than 4,000 houses and apartments for low-income residents of the
City. In 1992, he returned to the Institute for the Study of Civic
Values full-time to develop new models for community planning and
citizen empowerment for the 1990's.

Dr. Schwartz, who received his Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers
University, has written widely on problems related to civic
participation, neighborhood development, and America's democratic
heritage. His first book, "Will the Revolution Succeed?" has been
followed by articles and reviews in The New York Times Book Review, The
Nation, The American Prospect, Shelterforce, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
and The Philadelphia Daily News. The work of the Institute for the
Study of Civic Values itself is profiled extensively in Robert Bellah's
award-winning book, "Habits of the Heart."

Bryan,

I've taken the liberty of forwarding your note, along with my prepended
comments, to the fight-censorship mailing list.

I confess I'm not sure what recourse you have now that GeoCities has killed
your web site's graphics. Their current policy says that "nudity or
pornographic material of any kind" is verboten. Do you have the URLs to
other nude sites that remain on GeoCities?

At http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homeguide.html, I found:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a summary of things that are not permitted as part of
the GeoCities free Personal Home Page Program:

1.Material that is grossly offensive to the Web community including
blatant expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity

2.Pages that promote or provide instructional information about illegal
activities

3.Pages that promote physical harm or injury against any group or
individual

4.The use of free Personal Home Pages for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the following:

Soliciting for advertisers or sponsors

Displaying a sponsorship banner of any kind, including those that are
generated by "banner exchange" services

Displaying banners for services that provide cash or cash-equivalent
prizes to users in exchange for hyperlinks to their web site.

Conducting raffles or contests that require any type of entry fee

5.Pages that contain nudity or pornographic material of any kind

6.Pages that exploit images of children under 18 years of age

7.Restricted or Password-only access pages

8.Hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible
page)

9.Use of the page (or directory) as storage for remote loading

10.Use of the page as a door or signpost to another server

11.Use of copyrighted material without the prior permission from the
author
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.

Does anyone else have any insights?

Subject: censorship at www.geocities.com

Over a month ago I responded to a soliciation for a free personal home page
from www.geocities.com (which is advertised on their home page). They are
promoting theme-based neighborhoods for the home pages. The only content
guidelines were that nothing injurious to any person or group is permitted.
Based on those guidlelines, I felt the server a safe place to display my art
work and I placed my drawings of male nudes on an available address in
GeoCities' WestHollywood neighborhood. I have noticed other sites on
GeoCities with an equal amount of nudity. The only difference was my site
displayed the blue ribbon online freedom icon with a link to the EFF site.

Well, 30 days  and 10,000 hits to my site later (I heavily promoted my site
with listings in many art related directories), I awakened one morning to a
barage of e-mail from people informing me my site had been stripped of all
its graphics--everything from the blue ribbon icon to my nude art work, only
part of which contained male frontal nudity, to the photo of myself
fully-clothed. Later I was to receive an impersonal e-mail notification from
 GeoCities informing me that I was violating their content guidelines which
they now claim prohibit nudity (which I did not find in their posted
guidelines all the while other nude sites remain on GeoCities).

I am very distressed that after all my work and sincere efforts to produce a
tasteful site (which I received many e-mail compliments on wordwide),  I
would have it stripped bare in Nazi style of all the graphics, the essence of
my artistic energy.

Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
of expression in art and lifestyles.

Usually, tracking international net-censorship efforts is depressing.
However, this UPI report on the pissing match between N. Korea and S. Korea
made me laugh aloud. The North Koreans are posturing brilliantly -- truly
trying to force Seoul's hand, and using the Net to do it.

        TOKYO, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea's official news agency blasted
South Korea Tuesday for allegedly blocking its citizens' access to a new
Internet page sponsored by Pyongyang, a report monitored in Tokyo said.
        ``What they (Seoul) should block is not the North Korean Page but the
U.S. channel dealing with methods of murder and robbery and pornographic
scenes too shameful to watch,'' the Korean Central News Agency dispatch
said.
        The KCNA report quoted researcher Kim Hyong-sok of the Information
and Culture Center of North Korea as saying the history of the Internet
has seen no example of people being punished for monitoring certain
sites.
        ``Such punishment would cause bitter condemnation from the
international community,'' said Kim.
        Bristling with slogans about the ``great leader comrade Kim Il-sung,''
the Internet page has upset South Korean leaders, said KCNA, to the
point of having access to the site banned.
        ``The puppet Agency for National Security Planning and Prosecution
officially asked the Internet service organ in South Korea to block the
channel,'' said the KCNA report.
        The North Korean mouthpiece said the officials in Seoul should not
``trouble themselves'' because they do not have the equipment to block
the Internet page anyway.

[So Malaysia will censor only material that some government bureaucrat
finds "offensive?" What a commitment to free speech! Cynically, Declan]


         KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Reuter) - Malaysia on Thursday
unveils plans for a ``multimedia super corridor'' (MSC), which it
hopes will attract a new breed of foreign investors and propel
the country into the 21st century.

[...]

         [Proj director] Azzman said Malaysia would guarantee the
free flow of information. Sceptics have questioned that commitment in
a country where newspapers are licensed and the Printing and
Publications Act has been used to muzzle dissent.
         ``We have not censored the Internet, so the free flow of
information is very much the order of the day,'' said Azzman who
is director general of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronic Systems, a government agency that provides sole
access to the Internet in the country.
         ``We won't police what they do as long as it is within the
confines of the company,'' he said, adding companies in the MSC
can receive information from abroad, process it and then
transmit it out of the country without interference.
         The government would act only if illegal or offensive
materials like pornography were distributed within Malaysia.
         Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had agreed to set up a
regional office after meeting Mahathir last month. A ``couple of
dozen'' others have expressed ``keen interest'', Azzman said.
         The corridor would link the new airport and the futuristic
Putrajaya federal capital with the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a
mammoth office highrise project featuring the Petronas Towers,
the world's tallest buildings.

   BEIJING -- When it comes to controlling the Internet, China is
trying to learn from a little neighbor.
   In June, Beijing sent Zeng Jianhui, a top official, to Singapore to
pick up tips on expanding the use of the Internet within strict
limits. Singapore, a critic of unfettered dissent and Western culture,
is trying to become the network's model censor.
   ``China has a lot to learn from Singapore's experience,'' says a
Chinese government official studying Internet restrictions.

[...]

   Worried that the new electronic communications medium is spinning
out of its control and could undermine Communist propaganda, the
Chinese leadership decided in February to put teeth into Internet
regulations and prevent computer-disseminated pornography and
antigovernment material.
   The government is uneasy about cyberspace connections between
overseas democracy activists and Chinese dissidents, which blossomed
during political protests on the streets of Beijing and other major
cities during the spring of 1989. The few Chinese activists who are
not imprisoned or under detention are closely watched amid a
government crackdown on crime and political unrest.

[...]

   ``This is not having any negative effect on the Internet's
development in China,'' says Wang Jun, an official in the
telecommunications ministry's data communication bureau. ``It's just a
precautionary procedure.''

[...]

   In May, China launched a nationwide computer network that allows
only limited access to the Internet. The venture aims to avoid
breaking China's censorship laws by creating its own content and
making available only information useful for businesses.
   The new edited network, which is 60 percent owned by the official
New China News Agency and was launched in conjunction with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, does not face a censorship
problem because ``there is nothing illegal on the network,'' says
Joyce Wong, an executive with the Hong Kong-based China Internet Corp.

CSIS Calls Itself Canadas Political Police & States ARA Torched
Zundels House

Since the outrageously biased Heritage Front Affair Report published by
the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), a group of appointed
political has-beens and bagmen, we have had serious concerns that
Canadas security apparatus is utterly out of control and is spying
wholesale and contrary to the CSIS Act on legitimatre, non-violent
dissent. Some very disturbing confirmation of our fears has recently
come our way.

In February of this year, Kitchener, Ontario electronics businessman
Michael Rothe  was interviewed by two CSIS agents, who identified
themselves to him as such and showed ID. They were identified as Peter
and Angela. Rothe had organized several meetings in Kitchener for
British historian David Irving, who has since, under pressure from the
censorship lobby been banned from Canada, while planeloads of Tamil
terrorists and Jamican drug pushers and gunsels seem to have open access
to this country. The interview was taped. The revelations on thios tape
are staggering.

ANGELA: Have you heard of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
PETER: You can bet its real!.... Ill explain what we are. First, the
Canadian Security Intelligence service is like the BFK in Germany.
These are the dreaded so-called Federal  Constitution Protection  Police
(Bundesverfassungsschutz), which spy on the German right and are
blatantly a political police force. Just in case the frightened German
immigrant didnt get the point, Peter added: Were the political
police. Angela and I are from the counter-terrorism branch. ... We are
interested in the Heritage Front. He was then asked a number of
questions as to how he got involved in politics, how hed been contacted
by the Hereitage Front andf what he thought of this group, which CSIS,
through its agent Grant Bristow had helped fund and lead!
PETER: Did you ever meet Paul Fromm. Hes C-FAR and CAFE. The school
teacher from Mississauga. He would have been at the this David Irving
[meeting]. False!!!. Fromm was actually in Vancouver that day.
PETER: In Toronto, Wolfgang [Droege of the Heritage Front] has beren
much troubled by a group that calls itself Anti-Racist Action, ARA. This
is a collection of anarchists, Trotskyists, Stalinists.
ANGELA: The ARA that Peter described firebombed Ernst Zundel. Im sure
youve heard about the problem various leaders of the so-called right
wing have received firebombs. Shes apparently referring to the May 7,
1995 arson attack on Ernst Zundels Toronto residence/office, and
firebombings of Don Andrews and Nicola Polinuk.
PETER: So, were interested to know, ... were there ever  threats made
to you? That ought to put the fear of the Lord into him,

So, here we have CSISs descriptin of themselves as a political
police. Frightening! Then. theres the clear assertion that the
perpetratrors of the fire at Zundels and the firebombings in spring,
1995, were the ARA. If so, why havent they been arrested? Are they
being protected by the Canadian security establishment? Readers should
contact Solicitor-General Herb Gray and ask these questions. Ontario
readers should contact Solicitor-General Bob Runciman and ask why, in
light of this information, no charges have been laid by the Metropolitan
Toronto Police in these clearly political acts of terrorism. Had such an
attack been perpetrated on the offices of one the currently privileged
minoiorities, is there any doubt that every rightwinger to the starboard
of Joe Clark would have been hauled in for questioning?

______________________________________________________________________
SUMMARY

On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.

This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.

* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.

* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.

* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.

BACKGROUND

This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.

Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.

In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.

Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.

Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export.
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography.
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.

What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.

2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this
   release for contact information for several such organisations.

3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:

&gt; What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
&gt; to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else have any insights?

I have a friend whose site containing nudity was treated in a very
similar way:  Wendy.

	http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4750

She had some beautifully tasteful partial nudes of herself on her
page; I would consider them erotic, not pornographic.  Unlike 
thie site in question here, I'd say that the main intent was to
show viewers a good time; there was essentially no content other
than the pictures.

When the hit counter went through the roof, they found her site and
apparently warned her a couple of times about its content not being
acceptable.  But she also played a mean trick on another Internet
user, which probably also contributed to her deletion.  It was apparently
some sort of revenge thing; I'm not sure who's right and who's wrong.
In my communications with her, I considered her a rather sweet lady
but not too frightfully verbal.  She certainly talked quite clearly
with her pictures, which revealed a stunningly perfect body.

I helped organize a brief protest campaign to Geocities which apparently
resulted in the reinstatement of her page, sans a few of the "best"
pictures.  And there, as far as I know, it remains.

The lesson from this would seem to be that you can probably get
Geocities to bend if you have enough friends.  (I probably don't
need to tell any of you here that being a gorgeous 25 year old girl
who loves to show off her body is one great way of acquiring
instant friends &lt;grin&gt;).

I hope this helps!

Best

&gt;Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
&gt;space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
&gt;sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
&gt;"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom

As a free service, Geocities has the right to determine which pages it

Two prime examples of site with PHOTOS  containng male frontal nudity on
GeoCities are:

Rob's Bound & Gagged
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3100

contains graphic photos of sadomaochism showing male genetalia

Nude Celebrities
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3102

My site only contained abstract pencil drawings with no sexual activity
portrayed.

There are dozens of sites containing nudity on GeoCities and obviously
something else is going on here.

Certainly, GeoCities has the right to determine which pages it decides to
sponsor. It may even have the right to offer the pages on on basis and then
pull them off under a new set of rules, after the page creator has invested
time in making them and publicizing their location. (I have the impression
from the initial message that this is what happened - can someone who knows
clarify this point?)

However, that does not mean they're not slimy for causing this kind of
unnecessary inconvenience, and it doesn't mean they shouldn't be called on
their acts and others who might be considering dealing with them alerted to
the possibility of a problem.

I personally would like to hear from GeoCities on why they chose to pull
the pages off. Did their policy change at any point, and if so, why did
they change it?

Yes, but it's not necessarily something sinister.  From the evidence
I've seen GeoCities is just responding to the "squeaky wheels."  When
a page gets a pile of hits they check it out.  I'm not especially
impressed with the actions they're taking, but I doubt there's any
plot to stifle free thinking on the net.

Get this one.  I just heard it on the afternoon news.  Two young boys were
seriously burned after a failed attempt at making napalm on their kitchen
stove.  Sounds like the normal fun activities of bored youth on summer break
right?  But hey - where did they get the recipe?  From the Anarchists
Cookbook in the library?  No - they got it from -- GASP -- the Anarchists
Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
-- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some

just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

Law Professor Sues Federal Government
Over Computer Privacy Issues

Federal Civil Rights Action Seeks Injunction Against 
State Department And National Security Agency

Cleveland Scholar Attacks Prohibition On Discussing 
Cryptographic Software With Foreign Students And Colleagues

     A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
     federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict
     his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a
     twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a
     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

     The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military
     technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which
     encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet,
     is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control.
     The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by
     defining "export" to include discussing technical information about
     non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students
     registered for Professor Junger's course.

     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

     Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on
     the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans
     to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this
     fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach,
     and to whom.

     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Folks, I apologize for the mail problems. I still haven't quite figured 
out exactly what happened -- I'm not at home, but in NYC on business, so 
I wasn't able to log on this evening until now.

Seems as though the problem happened when I forwarded a fight-censorship
message to cypherpunks, which has among its subscribers a nonexistent
address at axcess.net.in. For some reason, a poorly-configured machine at
axcess.net.in started repeatedly resending the forwarded message back to
fight-censorship. Odd. I think I've blocked it from doing it again. 

I blame the problem on AOL, of course.

On a topic more germane to the list, I was in Times Square with Glenn and
some NYC webperns this evening, having dinner in a delightful greasy
burger joint. For no apparent reason, a woman sitting next to me started
to describe, in painstaking detail, how to kill someone with a hatpin. (A
jab to the nerve center in the solar plexus, if you must know.)

I started to think to myself, especially after Dara's note earlier, that 
this kind of material should be banned! Censor biology texts on the Net!

Yours in protecting children from dangerous knowledge,

Declan

        Sure, I'll get flamed....


        But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?), and
therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
weapon every year...

        ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the

extrapolation) dangerous?

Subject: Washington Post letter by Sen. Burns

     Sen. Burns' letter to The Washington Post today contained something of 
     an error, in case you couldn't tell.
     
     A line from the original letter was deleted.
     
     The line that read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights" 
     should instead read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of current wiretapping authority, it is a drastic expansion. 
     it lays the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights."
     
     Fortunately, the overall meaning of the letter is left largely intact.


[Attached is Burns' letter. --Declan]
   


                      `SPEAKING IN CODE ON THE INTERNET'
   
   Friday, August 9 1996; Page A16
   The Washington Post
   
   
   The Post's editorial July 27 on my Pro-CODE bill to ease restrictions
   on encoded, or "encrypted," computer messages ["Speaking in Code on
   the Internet"] was generally balanced but deleted a couple of key
   points.
   
   First, my bill would not "lift" restrictions on the export of strong
   encryption technology, which is designed to allow people to protect
   their computer files and messages. Instead, it would allow the
   Commerce Department merely to ease export restrictions to a level of
   computer security that it deems is "generally available" in the
   nations we trade with.
   
   This bill does not open the floodgates. Instead, it is an
   acknowledgment of the real world and that high-tech U.S. companies
   must be allowed to compete in an increasingly vital sector of the
   world economy. One trade group stated the United States stands to lose
   $60 billion in market share and 216,000 jobs under the current
   restrictions.
   
   Second, the administration's proposal to seek a copy of decoder "keys"
   for our electronic information is not simply an extension of the
   groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights. Imagine a Craig
   Livingstone or an Aldrich Ames being designated the "trusted third
   party" who holds the keys.
   
   Supporters of my bill have never maintained that some criminals will
   not attempt to use encryption to evade law enforcement. But the bill
   is an attempt to address the encryption status quo, not some long-ago
   world to which the FBI would like to return. (FBI Director Louis Freeh
   stated in the hearing July 25 that he would even like to restrict
   encryption imports.)
   
   While the White House indicates it might be willing to give people
   stronger encryption, it insists that the trade-off must be a copy of
   our decoder keys. It's a deal Americans will never accept and a plan
   that has yet to be proven feasible.
   
   Denying millions of law-abiding people the use of a legitimate and
   increasingly necessary security product for "law enforcement" reasons
   is like banning deadbolt locks because they make it a little harder to
   kick down the doors of a few drug dealers.

&gt; &gt; Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
&gt; &gt; -- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
&gt; &gt; sort of convention)
Excuse me?  Last I heard, Feinstein (who wouldn't be caught dead in SD this
week&gt;, was sponsoring the worst censorship bill currently in Congress.  
And, lest we forget, Sen. Exon was (and is) a Democrat.  Sure, there are 
censors in the Republican Party (can you say Christian Coalition?), but 
that's a rather wide brush you're painting the Republicans with.  On the 
net, party lines don't quite fit.  As I think we've discussed here and 
elsewhere, it's net.experience that is the divider.

&gt; &gt; just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
&gt; &gt; morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.
No truer words were ever spoken &lt;g&gt;, speaking as one of the corrupted 
myself... :)

&gt;         But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
&gt; you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?)
Uhhhh... no.  The last time I went to Computer City, I didn't have to 
have a criminal background check or wait five days.  Actually, in VA, we 
don't have to wait 5 days, but that doesn't matter.  Back-of-the-truck 
sales, like you must be referring to, are illegal anyway, and if the 
police would enforce current laws, we might not have to worry about that.

&gt; therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
&gt; weapon every year...
More like &lt;maximum&gt; a few thousand over several years.  Remember, there 
are a hell of a lot more accidental car deaths than accidental gun 
deaths, though.  There's your few dozen thousand.

&gt;         ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
&gt; Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
&gt; extrapolation) dangerous?
Good point.  Guns, though, in a way like computers, require a 
mis-intentioned person to become dangerous.  Computers aren't designed to 
put holes in people or things (as Kurt Vonnegut would say).  In both 
cases, though, an unreasonable person has to make an irrational decision 
in order to cause harm.

&lt;/rant&gt;
&gt;         Just wondering....

Purchasing an AK47 is illegal in several states, and in those which do
allow machine gun ownership by citizens, you must receive an OK from
local law enforcement and obtain a BATF special permit.  

Modems do not require local law enforcement sign offs...yet.

             CLINTON: GOP LISTENING TO 'GUN LOBBY OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'
                                          
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) -- President Clinton on Saturday
   accused the Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts to fight terrorism
   by kowtowing to the gun lobby.
   
   In his weekly radio address from Jackson, where the president and his family
   are vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had stripped his anti-terrorism
   bill of valuable tools "that law enforcement needs to help them find out,
   track down and shut down terrorists."
   
   The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
   anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and marking
   explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to the dealer who
   sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill and the assault weapons
   ban.

[...]
   
   Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti- terrorism
   legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and explosive taggant
   issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism bill of its own that
   excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not vote on the measure before
   adjourning for its August recess.
   
   The Republicans, the president said, were listening to "the gun lobby over
   law enforcement."
   
   "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
   country and the safety of our people," he said.

August 9, 1996
  
After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?

   By VIVIENNE WALT 
   THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
   
   At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
   Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.
   
   Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship from
   his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a white
   supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service provider, the
   teenager posted the site's entire contents in a compressed "mirror" file...
   
   Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a task
   force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech -- something the
   Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe, has laws against.

[...]
   
   One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
   virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) pushed his
   proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony,
   punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
   
   "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
   of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
   the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
   how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
   can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

[...]
   
   In a last-minute maneuver on Aug. 2, House members dropped the Internet
   controls and wiretapping provisions from their Anti-Terrorism Act, approved
   it by 389-22, and went home for the rest of the summer, leaving the Senate
   in a quandary about what to do after Labor Day. "We just couldn't come up
   with a bipartisan bill," says Sen. Feinstein's press secretary Susan
   Kennedy.
   
   Like Washington, Paris empties out in August for la vacance. But on Sept.
   26, the fight picks up in the French capital at a top-level meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   
   Justice Department officials, and 'Net activists, are set to travel to Paris
   to argue about key escrow...

   "This is an example of the Justice Department trying to dictate foreign
   policy," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center in Washington, who sits on the OECD's advisory panel on encryption.

[...]
   
   "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
   subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
   Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
   of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
   the Web.
   
   Rabbi Cooper and others have lobbied Internet providers to expel the
   extremist sites. "Will they eventually find somewhere else? Probably. But
   that still makes it a worthwhile thing to do," he says.

The face of net-activism is changing. I'm writing this from a science
fiction writers' and editors' party in upstate New York, where we've been
talking about net-politics and online communities.

The fronts we face now are three: national, state, and international. 
We've fought the national fight in the CDA, Clipper, and recent crypto and
terrorist debates. It's been where most of our efforts have focused. 

State politics lags behind that of Capitol Hill. State legislators are
starting to try to ram through bills similar to the CDA -- and, worse yet,
ones that are substantially different. We've discussed some on
fight-censorship.

The ACLU is the only cyber-liberties group tracking them. Yesterday I
stopped by Ann Beeson's office in Manhattan to talk about the Georgia bill
and other laws the group is planning to challenge. 

(Congratulations are in order. No longer a temporary ACLU fellow, Ann is
now a full-time staff attorney in the national office. It's a
well-deserved promotion!)

Then I walked across Bryant Park to the headquarters of Human Rights
Watch, an international civil rights group. They don't have a substantial
online presence now, but they did publish a fabulous global
net-restrictions report ("Silencing the Net") this spring -- and they have
what the Net needs right now: expertise in dealing with international
groups like G-7 and an extensive network of affiliates around the world. 
They seemed interested in doing more online work, which is wonderful. 

Afterwards Charles Platt and Ann, Glenn and their SOs and I went to dinner
at Sam's Noodle Shop on 29th and chatted about our CDA lawsuit and the
human genome project. 

The two aren't necessarily related, unless you count discerning what
congenital defects DoJ attorney Jason "The Weasel" Baron has. Yes, I'm
hardly unbiased. Anyone who threatens to have me arrested for interviewing
government witnesses is a splendid example of a censorhappy Fed
bureaucrat. As a side note, the weasel has been showing up to more and
more DC cyber-regulation events, like the Freedom Forum's panel on crypto
and censorship, and the FTC's panel on net-regulation and privacy. (Wonder
what he's up to?)

So the growing net-involvement of ACLU and HRW is just in time. They have
the well-established state and international affiliates, respectively,
that other groups lack. Hopefully, the affiliates can forward reports
uphill to the parent groups and help in fighting laws and policies locally. 

We need all the help and international expertise we can get -- as we've
seen recently at the Paris summit, governments have this annoying,
persistent habit of working backroom deals. The G-7 resolution (also
endorsed by Russia) said: 

  We call on all States to:

  6. note the risk of terrorist using electronic or wire communications
       systems and networks to carry out criminal acts and the need to
       find means, consistent with national law, to prevent such
       criminality.

  11. accelerate consultation, in appropriate bilateral or multilateral fora,
       on the use of encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
       government access to data and communications in order, inter alia,
       to prevent or investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the
       privacy of legitimate communications.

I've been putting whatever international information I come across at
&lt;http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/&gt;. Check it out for more background.

Congress may be in recess, but Bill Clinton is still dreaming of expanded
FBI wiretap authority.  In this week's radio address, Clinton sought to
paint the GOP into a corner by depicting the opponents of his
"anti-terrorism" plan as "gun nuts."

Expect the White House to continue beating this drum throughout September.

      Clinton: GOP Listening To 'Gun
      Lobby Over Law Enforcement'

      JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) --
      President Clinton on Saturday accused the
      Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts
      to fight terrorism by kowtowing to the gun
      lobby.

      In his weekly radio address from Jackson,
      where the president and his family are
      vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had
      stripped his anti-terrorism bill of valuable tools "that law
      enforcement needs to help them find out, track down and shut down
      terrorists."

      The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
      anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and
      marking explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to
      the dealer who sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill
      and the assault weapons ban.

      [ ... ]

      Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti-
      terrorism legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and
      explosive taggant issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism
      bill of its own that excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not
      vote on the measure before adjourning for its August recess.

      [ ... ]

      "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
      country and the safety of our people," he said.

      The United States, he said, is not immune to terrorism, citing the
      Oklahoma City bombing and last month's bombing in Centennial
      Olympic Park in Atlanta as "brutal evidence."

Seems to me that it would be just as well to be discriminating in what we 
say and to distinguish between the taggant provisions -- which strike me 
as being perfectly appropriate legislation that is being blocked by 
various groups including the NRA -- and the wiretap ones. -EMF

Um, well, except that
- there are serious safety questions concerning adding taggants to black
and smokeless powder
- a taggant provision is of dubious utility in catching terrorist bombers,
since black powder is not difficult to make (and presumably anyone serious
about planting pipe bombs and not getting caught would take this small
additional step for self-protection)
- it's hard to see how taggants would help LE track powder anyway, since
powder from a given manufacturing lot can be and commonly is shipped to
dealers all over the country.

I do think the issues are separable, and the wiretapping provisions are
obviously of considerably greater relevance to this list (and to
free-speech activism) than the taggant nonsense is. But I wanted to correct
the misapprehension; as we know from bitter experience with the CDA,
getting non-facts accepted as conventional wisdom is one of the first steps
in promulgating bad laws and in demonizing those who oppose them.

&gt; After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?
&gt; 
&gt;    By VIVIENNE WALT 
&gt;    THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
&gt;    
&gt;    At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
&gt;    Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.

I believe this is false. As far as I know, no one has objected, other than
by calling him naive. Frank is on vacation and off the net until early
September, so I imagine the WSJ was unable to reach him for this story. 
People reacted to his action the same way they did to our Zundelsite mirrors
- -- despite the fact that Zundel is just a harmless neo-Nazi propagandist,
while Lemire is a bit more... activist. For *his* side of the story, see
http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html

&gt;    Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship
&gt;    from his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a
&gt;    white supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service
&gt;    provider,

This is false. He heard that they were being protested. Lemire has not been
kicked off. His site remains at http://www.ftcnet.com/~freedom, and the site
that the SWC-Canada was far more concerned about, www.ftcnet.com/~skinhds,
is still online, too. Oddly, none of the stores in the US press even mention
the skinheads site. The initial reports in the Canadian press didn't even
mention Lemire, because it really wasn't about him.

Funny... the Skinheads site admits that they won and will not be censored. 
Take a look at http://alpha.ftcnet.com/~skinhds/ -- "Well my site has
weathered the storm of controversy and is still afloat.  Despite the best
efforts of some of the enemies of free speech my service provider did not
capitulate."

I wonder how long Lemire plans to milk the publicity. Maybe trolling the
Wall Street Journal was enough.

&gt;    the teenager posted the site's entire contents in a
&gt;    compressed "mirror" file... 

This is false. Lemire created and posted the archive, soliciting mirror
sites. The first one online was www.alpha.org, but they've been having
technical problems, so Frank's was announced first. Frank's web page simply
links to Lemire's archive on ftcnet.com. Frank did not compile and is not
distributing the site's entire contents. 

&gt;    Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a
&gt;    task force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech --
&gt;    something the Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe,
&gt;    has laws against. 

This is highly misleading; I assume it was taken from either Declan's
article or Lemire's press release, as it shows a lack of understanding of
the political and legal situation in Canada.

I don't suppose the WSJ will admit that they were trolled? Frank has, but I
know that Declan won't. In fact, if it weren't for this sentence and the
fact that I'm Bcc'ing it to Vivian, I doubt Declan would allow this message
to hit fight-censorship at all.

&gt;    One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
&gt;    virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.)
&gt;    pushed his proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the
&gt;    Internet a felony, punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
&gt;    
&gt;    "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
&gt;    of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
&gt;    the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
&gt;    how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
&gt;    can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

...and thanks to Biden, that recipe is now available through thomas.loc.gov.
What a moron.

&gt;    "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
&gt;    subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
&gt;    Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
&gt;    of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
&gt;    the Web.

No, Cyberwatch does no such thing. It just moans about it, giving no
specific examples. They don't even acknowledge the existence of other
organizations with policies that are both more effective and more respective
of freedom of speech, such as the Anti-Defamation League (which is larger
and older than the Wiesenthal Center, but strangely absent from press
reports of "jewish reaction to hate on the net") and Nizkor (which has far
more experience than either, but isn't jewish).

Subject: Column, Aug. 7


    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED Aug. 7, 1996
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Reading our mail

    Only in a nation already enormously out of touch with its founding
principle - that individual citizens and businesses have the right to do
just about any peaceful thing, while it's the powers of (start
ital)government(end ital) that are sharply restricted - could Congress find
itself debating whether to "allow" American computer firms to maintain
their lead in the multi-million-dollar overseas market for software
encryption.

  In plainer language, outfits like Netscape Communications and Tandem
Computers want "permission" to sell overseas programs like Pretty Good
Privacy - to which savvy American netsters now have free access - programs
which allow private e-mail messages and files to be encoded so government
snoops can't read them.

  The Clinton administration proposes that such exports be allowed only if
a decoding "key" is entrusted to a third party - such as a bank or
insurance company - which would then be subject to a court order or
subpoena should law enforcement personnel wish to break the code and
secretly read this electronic "mail."

  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in favor of such restrictions July 25,
arguing that "Uncontrolled export of U.S. computer codes may help
international criminals and terrorists hide their activities from law
enforcement."

  Well, yes, they probably do. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in New York on
charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners, used a laptop computer
containing files the FBI still hasn't been able to decode.
  But note the past tense. Terrorists have already got this stuff. Anything
in the possession of an American teenager can be (likely has been) uploaded
onto the Internet, and then downloaded without anyone being the wiser in
Baghdad, Tripoli, or Tangiers.

  The real goal here is to control the ability of American citizens to
communicate with one another without government snoops reading over their
shoulders. When Director Freeh warns that "Encryption products used
unchecked by criminals and terrorists for their illegal activities pose an
extremely serious threat," it's worth remembering that federal agencies
have, in recent years, used the terms "criminal" and "terrorist" to
describe peaceful worshippers and their children at the Branch Davidian
Church in Waco, MOVE activists in Philadelphia, an unarmed Idaho mother
with a nursing baby in her arms, and any number of perhaps misguided but
far-from-violent tax protesters, home schoolers, barter exchange operators,
and practitioners of alternative medicine, to name just a few.

  Once the possessor of such stuff can be arrested and jailed for years on
charges of "exporting a munition" for the mere act of posting the
mathematical formula on the Internet, does it make sense to pretend
Americans will still be free to use such encryption domestically?
  Those who favor an authoritarian, hierarchical society have grown
accustomed to the fact that the political opinions available to most
American government-school graduates have long been "filtered" through the
news desks of a few television networks and major wire services. The
unregulated, spontaneous nature of Internet communications frightens such
souls with dark nightmares of anarchy, the same way King George hated the
colonial "Committees of Correspondence."

  As Stephen Chapman of the Chicago Tribune pointed out in his nationally
syndicated column June 19, "We can be grateful that ink and paper didn't
make their first appearance the day before yesterday . Otherwise, Congress
and the president would be scrambling frantically to make sure that these
communication tools would not be used for purposes unapproved by the
government."

  If the idea of a government service delivering letters between private
citizens were being introduced today, wouldn't Director Freeh similarly
argue against the "extremely serious threat" that criminals and terrorists
might use this new "mail" system to keep their secrets, should the
government allow the use of glue-flapped "envelopes"?
  But wait, you say: The secret "keys" would only be available upon
issuance of a "court order."

  And this guarantee would be enforced, I presume, by the same courts that
today regularly excuse the short-circuiting of any and all such existing
safeguards so long as the federals assert a "compelling government
interest" in hunting drug dealers, nabbing  "money-launderers," or whatever
dastardly new crime of the week they care to allege?

  It's understandable that repressive regimes like China are pulling out
every stop to register and track private users of the Internet. When
legislators show similar instincts in what was once the "Land of the Free,"
it's their own premises which they ... and we ... should re-examine.

U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the
proposed action as ineffective:  "This is not a solution, it is just hiding
the problem."  (Financial Times 10 Aug 96)

        It was hard to wake up, that morning. The pillow to the right
of her was bewildered at its own unaccustomed chill. She had gathered
all the blankets around herself and no one had been there to pull them
back; this more than anything reminded her of her aloneness and she
very nearly turned back onto her side to weep herself to sleep.

I'm not sure this is the most effective or noticeable action, but what 
the heck.  Personally, I'd advocate doing whatever you think is most 
useful, just do it on the 31st, and let local media know with a short fax 
soon that Aug. 31 is Internet Censorship Protest Day.  If you've been of 
a mind to organize a rally, make it snappy. No better time.  I don't 
think this short alert has gone out very far yet.

Got a note this morning from a U.K. journalist who spoke with PSInet:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversation this am with a leading light at a large ISP here (subsidiary
of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and
essentially said, either you do something about it, or we'll do something
about it.  The guy said they'd pulled the groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups were "pedophile" areas. But the
FT report talks about Scotland Yard pressuring Internet providers to block
"hard-core pornography."

A meme on the rise: like cyberporn, "cybergangs" can reach into your living

"cybergangs" as a pretext for a crackdown -- not a war on drugs, but a War
on the Net?

&gt;
&gt; Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups are "pedophile" areas. But the

Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child
pornographic newsgroups. I have side accounts at 3 major ISPs that all
have as close to a full newsfeed as is physically possible, I think.
They all have almost an identical roster of available newsgroups (other
than local ones of course, very few of which anywhere are pornographic in
nature.)  Out of those, only the following newsgroups would appear to
qualify at first blush:

alt.sex.pedophilia
alt.sex.pedophilia.boys
alt.sex.pedophilia.girls
alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male

[I admit the possibility of missing a keyword. I did a search for
"child", "kid", "teen", "lolita", "young", "youth" and "pedo". There
might be, say, a "nambla" match, now that I think about it, but obscure
keywords like that are unlikely to find enough newsgroups to strongly
affect the outcome of this quick examination.]

Of these, many can be immediately eliminated, as they are discussion
groups, not binaries group, or are typos ("binaires") and ergo not carried
by 99% or so of usenet (though available on a few sites like the WELL where
the admins allow the automatic availability of every newsgroup known to
the system, even ones created just to create a stupid-named newsgroup
with no intention that it will ever be used.)

This leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

Now, of these all the "young" and "teen" groups have to be eliminated,
since "young" is to vague to mean anything more specific that "younger
than middle aged", and teen can refer to 18 or 19 (or even younger legal
ages, if the UK is like Australia and sets age of consent at 16 instead
of US & Canada's 18).  If you actually look in these groups there appears
to be nothing but flames, blather, and BBS ads, almost none, if any, of
which will be childporn, since that would be a major cop magnet.
Lolita.misc and pedophilia.swaps also have be dropped, as too vague to
clearly indicate child pornographic visual content.  The de. newsgroup is
also probably not carried by many sites outside of Germany. (WELL had it,
but my other ISPs didn't. Probably WELL is trading news with a site in
Germany for some reason - maybe the .de site can't get a decent news
feed? I dunno).

That leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking


Six likely suspect newsgroups for genuine illegal content in the form of
child pornography.  It's highly questionable whether real child porn
shows up on any such newsgroup with any regularity, if at all. Again, the
content seems to consist of flames and blatant BBS ads (though I'm not
dumb enough to actually download the material, since that could count as
"possession" if some of it is really child porn.)  I even recall the
creation of a few of these - they were newgrouped simply to piss people
off with no intention of actually using the newsgroups. They were
instantly rmgrouped, and are unavailable on all sites that honor
"official" alt.config rmgroups, which is probably the vast majority of
news servers.

Much ado about nothing.

Also, none of this even touches the question of whether liability adheres
to providing access to something that happens to contain child porn
simply becuase is *sounds* child pornographic. By this logic, even if is
eventually established that an ISP could not be held liable for child
porn content in general, absent guilty knowledge, an ISP could be held
liable for it if someone posted a message with "child porn" in the
subject line, and it actually did contain child porn, regardless of the
fact that any message by that name is more likely to be a discussion
thread about child porn and the problems it causes, that to be actual
child porn.

The UK cops are making the mistake of assuming that every label is.
first, always accurate, and second, non-ambigious.  That's a very stupid
set of assumptions.

Either way you look at it, this is ridiculous.

Either:

a) the UK police bureucrats have taken all newsgroup names at face
value and have targetted most of the initial long list near the top of this
message, even though most are obviously intended to be discussion areas
and don't carry child porn itself, or

b) they are going after 5 or so newsgroups that are, at least in name,
definitely child pornographic, PLUS a buch of others (the rest of the 20)
like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.male, or whatever, that have nothing at
all, even in name, to do with child porn, as the article Declan quotes
seems to suggest (I think this quite possible, since it's unlikely that
many if any UK hosts have this many pedophillic-sounding newsgroups. Only
the biggest and most bandwidth rich US ISPs carry them all, so the UK
cops probably don't even know about the majority of the newsgroups in the
top, large, list.)

A and B are *both* stupid and indefensible.

The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the
contents of the newgroups in question and worked to locate those posting
any genuine child porn, and prosecute them (with an eye to the fact that
its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

August 13, 1996

BY FAX: +65-375-7765

Mr. George Yeo
Minister for Information and the Arts
460 Alexandra Road, 37th Story
PSA Building
Singapore 119963

Dear Mr. Yeo,

     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the recent
decision by the Singapore government to establish strict controls on Internet
use. The implementation of the Class License Scheme, which, according to a
July 11 government news release, "will focus on content which may undermine
public morals, political stability and religious harmony,"ensures a leading
role for Singapore among international promoters of online censorship. This is
a particularly unfortunate role for Singapore, which has been a leader in the
development and promotion of Internet use in Asia. It places Singapore in the
same category as countries like China, where Internet users must endure
onerous restrictions.

     One of the most unique and valuable characteristics of the Internet is
its ability to establish easy, inexpensive and practically instantaneous
communication between the farthest points of the earth. By prohibiting
connections between its citizens and various Web sites outside its borders,
Singapore is in essence removing itself from the global Internet. If, as will
surely happen, its example is followed in other countries, the Internet, which
held such promise as the world's first truly global medium, will be nothing
more than a set of country-specific networks where local prejudices and fears
are reinforced by technology.

     Our specific objections concern Singapore's decision to regulate the
Internet as if it were a broadcast medium. Unlike broadcast media, the
Internet is the first truly mass medium. Through e-mail, it allows individuals
with nothing more than a computer and a modem to express their views to an
international audience. Even the World Wide Web differs significantly from a
broadcast medium in that individuals are not confronted with a particular site
upon connecting to the Web--they may choose whichever sites they choose to
visit. As with other forms of Internet communication, anyone may put up his or
her own site on the Web. The Singapore government's own use of Web pages
demonstrates how the Internet can be used to propound a particular point of
view. Its citizens, so long as they are not using their site to incite to
violence, should have the same opportunity to express views as their
government. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights:

     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
     to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
     media and regardless of frontiers.

     We are particularly concerned that restrictions have been placed on
Singaporeans who wish to discuss religious and political ideas online. It is
only through unrestricted discussions of such serious topics by all members of
society, no matter how unpopular their views, that these subjects become less
explosive. Forbidding discussion--in effect, treating its citizens like
children--will, on the other hand, ensure that dangerous topics remain just
that.

     We are also concerned that the extraordinarily broad categories of
forbidden content, as outlined by the SBA, will encourage arbitrary
restrictions on communication. According to the Internet Content Guidelines,
the following topics are banned.

     Public Security and National Defense

          a.   Contents which jeopardize public security or national
               defense.
          b.   Contents which undermine the public confidence in the
               administration of justice.
          c.   Contents which present information or events in such a
               way that alarms or misleads all or any of the public.
          d.   Contents which tend to bring the Government into
               hatred or contempt, or which excite disaffection
               against the Government.

     Racial and Religious Harmony

          a.   Contents which denigrate or satirize any racial or
               religious group.
          b.   Contents which bring any race or religion into hatred
               or resentment.
          c.   Contents which promote religious deviations or occult
               practices such as Satanism.

          Public Morals

          a.        Contents which are pornographic or otherwise obscene.
          b.        Contents which propagate permissiveness or
                    promiscuity.
          c.        Contents which depict or propagate gross exploitation
                    of violence, nudity, sex or horror.
          d.   Contents which depict or propagate sexual perversions
               such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia.

By banning such subjects a chill will be sent through the online community in
Singapore, and will render the Internet essentially useless in allowing any
kind of serious discussion.

     In addition to forbidding particular content, the government has also
announced that some sites will be banned. Internet service providers were
given the deadline of September 14, 1996,  to begin using proxy
servers--devices that can prohibit connections to specified sites--to
connect all their
subscribers.

     Although the government has promised to use a light hand in regulating
the Internet, its activities even at this early stage indicate otherwise. A
July 12 posting in the Usenet newsgroup "soc.culture.singapore" was reportedly
removed at the request of the SBA, who asked local Internet service providers
for its removal because it alleged that lawyers at a local law firm were
incompetent. The request came, according to the Straits Times, after the law
firm complained to the government. Despite the removal from the newsgroup, the
message is still widely available to Singaporeans through other Internet
sources, indicating that content control will be difficult unless Internet
access is restricted even further.

     We hope that the Singapore government will retract these repressive new
regulations, and support the development of an unfettered Internet. Instead of
using its power to restrict Internet use, the government could play a truly
useful role by devising ways to expand its use to even the most disaffected
members of its population.

                                   Sincerely,
                                   Sidney Jones
                                   Executive Director

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

You're forgetting the tortuous British obscenity laws.  For example, it's

Free Speech 101: ACLU Gives Princeton University an "F"  
for Barring Political Speech on its Network 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             
Wednesday, August 15, 1996 
 
Contact: Ann Beeson, ACLU National (212) 944-9800, x788 
David Rocah, ACLU of New Jersey (201) 642-2084 
 
NEW YORK--In a letter sent today to Princeton University officials,  the
American Civil Liberties Union urged them to reconsider a policy barring
students and staff from using the computer network for "political
purposes."  
   
The letter was sparked by complaints the ACLU national office received over
a recent memo from Princeton officials advising faculty, staff and
students, "especially in this year of a presidential election," that the
school's not-for-profit status barred it from allowing use of the computer
network "for political purposes." 
 
The ACLU called this conclusion mistaken, pointing out in its letter that
the Internal Revenue Code specifies that only the University itself is
barred from political activity -- not faculty, staff, or students acting
independently.  In fact, the ACLU said, the IRS has previously held that
statements in support of political candidates appearing on the editorial
page of a student newspaper would not be considered violations of a
university's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. 
 
"Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network," the ACLU letter
stated, "it is an unjustified content-based restriction on the free
expression rights of students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is
not only unworthy of a great university like Princeton, it is in violation
of the New Jersey State Constitution."  The letter was signed by ACLU
national staff attorney Ann Beeson and David Rocah, staff attorney of the
ACLU of New Jersey. 
   
"We understand the university's concerns regarding it's tax-exempt status,"
Rocah said.  "But this is free speech 101.  Sadly, Princeton is not making
the grade."    
 
Rocah said the ACLU would consider legal action if the university refuses
to drop its censorship policy. 
 
"Traditionally, college campuses are the center of political discussion and
debate," said Beeson.  "The fact that the debate is taking place on the
Internet does not mean that the speech is any less deserving of
protection."  
 
Beeson added that the policy could bar students and staff from a wide range
of protected expression, including downloading position papers from the
Dole or Clinton website; sending e-mail to their parents urging them to
vote for Ralph Nader; and organizing online discussion groups for  student
chapters of politically active groups such as Greenpeace.   In short, Rocah
said, "Everything that would be acceptable, even welcome, off-line, becomes
off-limits on the Internet."  
   
In its letter, the ACLU called on the school to take a leadership role in
the academic community:  "As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a
leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to
promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its
community, to the very limits of the law," the letter said. 
 
Beeson added that the ACLU  is working to develop model guidelines for 
colleges and universities to help sort out the confusion in academia
regarding free expression on the Internet.  Many schools have already put
in place "Appropriate Use Policies" to police student and faculty computer 
use, some of which violate rights of free expression, Beeson said.

Mr. Harold Shapiro 
President                 BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, & REGULAR MAIL 
1 Nassau Hall 
Princeton University 
Princeton NJ 85044 
 
RE: Computer Use Policy 
 
Dear President Shapiro: 
 
In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton
University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ)
to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University
from using the Princeton's computer network for "political purposes."  We
believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding
the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic
freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.

 
Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students
widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet
greatly expanded the resources available for academic research.  It also
provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas.  In
contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for
"political purposes" unjustifiably interferes with the right of the
University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.

 
Princeton's current computer use policy holds that "the Computing and
network resources of the University may not be used by members of the
University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial
gain . . . ."  Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter "Rights," attached
as Appendix A).  On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent
an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use
of the Internet or computer network for "any participation in, or
intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
public office" would result in disciplinary action.  See Office of the
General Counsel, "Internet use and Politics," E-mail of July 19, 1996,
attached as Appendix B. 
 
We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a
concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to
use the computer network for political purposes.  We believe that this
concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal
Revenue Service. 
 
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization
will be tax-exempt as long as it "does not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office."  The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to
constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the
political activity must be that of the University itself and not the
individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students.  See Internal
Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for
1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C.  Thus, any personal
communication by University members over the computer network cannot
threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the
communication takes place does not change this conclusion.  The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether
the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political
activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the
university under Internal Revenue Code  501(c)(3), is whether the
facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for
non-political reasons.  Id. at 427.  Princeton provides fair and equal
access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access,
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes.  See Rights at 11.  Thus, political speech over the
network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with
a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status.  The
Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that
required its students in a certain political science course to participate
in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during
the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the
meaning of Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  See Revenue Ruling 75-512,
1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D. 
 
In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on
the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not
participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political
candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper.  This was
true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities
to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were
clearly those of the students and not of the university itself.  See
Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E. 
 
Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by
allowing University members to use its computer network for political
purposes.  We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for
official positions of the University.  At most, the only permissible
regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the
University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a
reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official
position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the
opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone.
 Compare Rights, "Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the
University and Political Activities," at Section 3. 
 
Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an
unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of
students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of
a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of
the New Jersey Constitution. 
 
Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey
Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been
sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to
honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression.  See State v.
Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against
the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994)
(holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive
use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet).  Princeton's
computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton "campus" as are the
lawns and buildings.  Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its
students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the
Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech
in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus. 
 
Political expression has always received the highest degree of
constitutional protection.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). 
The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship
those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for
political candidates.  Indeed, "where political speech is involved, our
tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion,
the narrowest range for restriction.'"  State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412
(1980).  As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in
American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and
defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to
the very limits of the law. 
 
The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free
speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive
information.  Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (right
to receive information precludes government from labeling certain
publications "propaganda") (Brennan, J., concurring); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) ("right of freedom of speech . . .
includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . .
receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of
thought, and freedom to teach . . . .  Without these peripheral rights the
specific rights would be less secure."); Kreimer v. Bur. of Police for Town
of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1350-55 (3d Cir. 1992) (listing cases).  This
is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the
Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community.  See
ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996).  They
provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access
information on virtually any topic, including politics. 
 
Finally, the computer use policy is in conflict with other University
policies and practices.  Princeton recognizes that 
 
     "the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the
discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching
and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and
learning to society at large.  Free inquiry and free expression within the
academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. 
The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate
conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in
classrooms and lecture halls." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 
With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it
has a fundamental responsibility to ensure 
 
    "the opportunity for all members of the University community to
exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . .  Encouragement of an
interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social
responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal
education.  The University continues to consider self-chosen participation
in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable
part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage.  Such activities
on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to,
imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or
point of view." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Guidelines Relating to Tax Exempt Status." 
 
For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal the existing
ban on use of the computer network for political purposes, and we look
forward to your early reply.

Bomb info OK in books but G-7 wants it off Net

By COLMAN JONES

While the fury over child porn on the net appears to be losing steam
after the defeat of the Communications Decency Act in June, there's a a
growing new cyber-backlash against terrorists.  

At a meeting in Paris last month, just before the downing of TWA flight
800 and the bombing in Atlanta, Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers
and security ministers struck an agreement to target terrorists using
the internet.  

The pact calls for international controls on the net to cut off access
to sites containing "dangerous" information, restrict electronic speech
by unpopular political organizations and allow governments to decode
privately encrypted communications.

The Paris meeting ended with a commitment to have reports ready by the
end of the year on ways of instituting such restrictions.

[...]

Bomb info

Many press accounts fume about bomb-making information available
online, without mentioning that the "offensive'' material being
targeted is no different from identical material easily obtained in
public libraries, college libraries and bookstores. A case in point is
the World's Biggest Bookstore, which stocks the Anarchist Cookbook, a
virtual how-to guide to subversive activity, also available online.  

Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who helped to draw
up the Paris agreement, cited the fact that his his 11-year-old son
showed him how to access extremist literature from the World Wide Web.
Axworthy's spokesperson, Catherine Lappe, says the pact is "not an
issue of trying to censor people" .  

"If you look at the communique, it says very clearly that all this
would have to be in compliance with national laws, so the issues of
privacy would be of utmost importance.''

they'll have to go after these sites too:

I've set up a web page at http://www.well.com/~declan/huskers.html and
registered the URL with AltaVista and HotBot. It's called: "Husker web

I wonder what the university will do, if anything? This message is copied

Husker Web Pages Must Cease

Subject: Husker Web Pages Must Cease
From: mfricke@serv01.net-link.net (Mark E. Fricke)
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:59:55 -0400

I hate to be the bearer of real bad news, but if you have a personal
web site on the internet that features any logos, graphics, audio or
even the page name of Cornhusker or Husker (like the Husker Press Box)
be prepared to get a Cease and desist letter from the University of
Nebraska's attorney's. The problem is simple. A lot of money has been
paid to license the name and logo's of the Huskers and there are many
business interests to protect. Pinnacle Broadcasting is the exclusive
rights holder for internet usage of the name and logos (and you thought
the live broadcasts were all good).

Now..there are a couple of things we can do. #1 remove all references
to Huskers, Big Red, Cornhuskers etc. from THE PAGES TITLE. You can
still talk about, mention, berate or praise the team within the page,
just not in the page title. The reason here is that the University
wants all search engines (yahoo, excite, infoseek etc.) to send
searches for the Huskers to their site (huskerwebcast)

#2 remove all licensed logo's, pictures of Herbie audio of the band
etc. from your site.

#3 There is one more solution. Huskerwebcast will allow pages to exist
as they are if they are housed within THEIR page. Wether that mean they
will have hyperlinks to these hidden pages or if you will actually have
to set up an account and an FTP site to their server I'm not clear on.
I'm awaiting confirmation on this.

Okay, now my personal views. Yeah it's a bummer...a great big bummer. I
really don't see how private personal pages could possibly infringe on
the marketing dollars of the University (except for logos, you got me
there) But PAGE NAMES?!?!. They seem a little greedy fo rthe traffic.
I'm no lawyer (maybe some of you out there are and know something about
public domain)so I will do what I must with the Husker Press Box.  I
will still provide the page in some manner, either changing the name or
joining the University page. Luckily I have already been extended an
offer to do that. I will wait and see. My advise to other Husker wep
page masters. Be ready for a letter and be ready to reacte. this is a
big University with lots of money and lots of attorney's

Recently the London police sent a letter to U.K. Internet providers saying
that 133 Usenet newsgroups must be banned.

&gt;From observations at &lt;http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship&gt;, it's clear that:

       the Police regard ISPs as publishers
       the publication of obscene materials is an offence
       the Police expect ISPs to continuously monitor newsgroups and
           to remove those which contain illegal materials

More ominously, the letter says "Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive
and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups identifying and taking
necessary action against those others found to contain such material...
This list is only the starting point..." Also, the police have said they
have the power to arrest Internet providers and seize their equipment.

This move by the Brits is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising. I have
background about many more international net-censorship attempts at:

Our upstream provider, VBCNet, has informed us that today, they, and

recently, in a thread in the waverider.support newsgroup, Wave Rider

opposed to such censorship as a matter of principle - as I know many

The letter from the Met makes it clear that this is only the
beginning - they plan to ban whatever newsgroups they see fit over the
coming months.

We urge you all to protest this action - use the media, contact your
MPs, generate whatever protest you see fit - or the UK Internet is going
to be operated by the whim of the Clubs & Vice unit of the Metropolitan
Police.

At present, Wave Rider Internet Plc have received no such notification from
the police, and will therefore not be removing any groups. However, as
we're not being fed them anymore, that's academic - there will shortly be
nothing in them.

I am enclosing the copy of the letter from the Met, that we have been

Like other UK ISPs, VBCnet today received a demand from the Metropolitan
Police that some 134 news groups be deleted from our news machines.
The letter makes it clear that this is only the beginning, that they
will be banning more groups and requiring ISPs to enforce their
dictats.  We have with great reluctance complied with their demand.

While we do not disagree that the articles in some of these groups are
often objectionable, we disagree in principle with this form of censorship.

We urge all of you to make it clear to your customers why these news
groups have been withdrawn and we urge you to contact your MPs and
the media about this arbitrary action by the police.  If there is no
protest, if a precedent is established, the UK Internet is going to
fall under the control of the Clubs and Vice Unit at Charing Cross
Police Station.

VBCnet is setting up a Web page to protest this action.  It should be
available at

Dear Sir / Madam

Pornographic Material on the Internet

Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.

We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.

This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.

We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.

Yours Faithfully

A longtime anti-porn crusader, Phyllis Schlafly generally is no friend of
free speech -- but I welcome her insightful and timely comments, attached
below. Privacy does cut through ideological lines. I seem to recall that
the Christian Coalition, a fiery supporter of the CDA, opposed the Clipper

                    Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother


     August 8, 1996                             by Phyllis Schlafly

     We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
     recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all
     Americans who care about civil liberties should vigorously resist
     President Clinton's attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an
     excuse to carry on his all-out war against the personal privacy of
     law-abiding Americans.

     This mind-set was first revealed in the Clinton health care bill,
     which would have given the government computer access to the
     medical records of all Americans. Fortunately, that totalitarian
     takeover of the health care industry was rejected.

     The Clinton Administration's education legislation now pending in
     Congress would put personal information about all schoolchildren
     -- academic, medical, attitudinal, behavioral, and family -- into
     an expanded Labor Market Information database available to the
     government, as well as to prospective employers.

     Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for
     individual Americans to have private conversations with one
     another. That's the real meaning of its effort to control
     encryption technology, and it's a direct assault on the First
     Amendment.

     It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First
     Amendment guarantees our right to speak in public but not in
     private. It would be just as ridiculous to say that we have
     freedom to speak in words that the government can understand, but
     not in words the government can't decipher.

     Americans have the right to speak to one another in private,
     behind closed doors, and we should likewise have the right to
     speak to one another in code and to put our coded messages on
     computer in a process called encryption. Americans would not
     tolerate the government opening and reading the letters we send
     through the mails, and we should not tolerate the government
     opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
     computer.

     Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and
     Vice President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our
     encrypted messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of
     California, Reno bluntly stated her demand for "ensuring law
     enforcement access to encrypted data.''

     Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government
     should create a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly
     "neutral third party''), to which all Americans should be forced
     to "entrust'' the keys to their encrypted messages, and to which
     the government would have access. On the contrary, there is no
     such consensus.

     Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do
     you trust the FBI to keep your files confidential?

     The Clinton Administration is already doing 30 to 40 percent more
     federal telephone wiretaps and other electronic surveillance than
     the last year of the Bush Administration. Those figures don't even
     include national security wiretaps or the hundreds of extensions
     granting more time for wiretap orders already issued.

     FBI Director Freeh wrote the New York Times last November that
     "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the
     extent of wiretapping." Four months later, FBI documents revealed
     that the FBI does, in fact, plan to increase electronic
     surveillance 54 percent by 1998 and 130 percent by 2004.

     On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will
     continue to push for the adoption of a massive public key
     infrastructure to give the government access to all encrypted
     communications. In a blatant bid for a police-state surveillance
     society, Gore warned about "the dangers of unregulated encryption
     technology."

     A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to
     make policy recommendations about encryption. The panel called on
     the government to abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.

     The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would
     enhance our national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of
     its 16 members had security clearances with access to secret
     information, and they saw no national security reason to justify
     the Clinton policy.

     The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private
     encryption on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping.
     However, the NSC panel concluded that the ability of the private
     sector to transfer confidential financial and other data over the
     information highway without interception is far more important.

     New technologies have given government awesome power to spy on
     individuals. The Filegate investigation accidentally uncovered the
     shocking news that, as soon as Bill Clinton entered the White
     House in 1993, he secretly spent $400,000 on software to create a
     highly sophisticated computer database to track detailed
     political, financial, attitudinal, and personal biographical
     information on 200,000 people, including members of Congress and
     the media. Known as WHODB for White House Office Data Base, the
     system was nicknamed Big Brother.

     Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the
     Clinton Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would
     be the biggest expansion of federal power since the passage of the
     Income Tax Amendment in 1913.

I talked to Trueman today.

He told me Shea's victory was "not unexpected."

"The ACLU did some forum shopping. If I were going to file a suit like they
did, I'd go to Manhattan," he said, adding that NYC is much more permissive
than most parts of the country.

When I told him that Shea rather strongly dislikes the ACLU and refused to
join the ACLU lawsuit, Trueman was incredulous. Said that Shea must have
received some help from the ACLU in preparing briefs or whatnot.

Not quite.

The address you now should use for submitting posts to the fight-censorship
list is:

    fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

This isn't a big change since the old address at CMU has been forwarded to
the above address for months. You should notice no changes in the list --
except some improvements in performance. The old address will be forwarded
to the MIT address for the forseeable future.

If you want to subscribe or unsubscribe, check out the instructions at:

     http://www.eff.org/~declan/fight-censorship/

The above URL will exist until John and I recreate the fight-censorship
archive this weekend. (This means the international section will be back
online, which is now at http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/)

I'd also like to thank Jered for hosting the fight-censorship mailing list
at MIT.

&gt;Let's keep this list about government censorship, please.

I like the way Tom Edwards, an avowed Libertarian, described it:

Institutional restrictions on speech also are often wrong, but the response
to them is different. Such muzzling attempts are not illegal, just
misguided.

However, we should keep in mind the very fuzzy difference distinction
between editing and censorship. Should, for instance, Jim Thomas be forced
to include off-topic rants in CuD? Should the National Coalition Against
Censorship be forced to publish similar materials in their quarterly
newsletter? Editing != censorship. The ALA has a definition of censorship
that may be useful here.

But perhaps we can agree that the most vile form of censorship remains that
done by governments, which buttress their laws with the power of guns,
tanks, and gallows.

	For the record, we didn't forum-shop.  Also, I don't strongly
dislike the ACLU, and I certainly agree with them on the CDA.  Finally,
our case landed in NY because the correspondent firm that was going to
handle the case here backed out at the last moment -- on Feb. 7, the night
before we filed.  Our judges were relatively conservative.  We were not
assoisted by the ACLU, with whom we had a short-lived feud.

ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace;
New Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Wednesday, July 31, 1996

    NEW YORK, NY--Despite a second federal court decision affirming
that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today
warned of  persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and
internationally, to censor electronic communications and regulate
privacy technology.   

    At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known
as "G-7," government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate
the Internet and other electronic communications in an effort to
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing
incident at the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight
800, which is being investigated as a possible terrorist bombing.
Participants included France, Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany,
Canada, Russia and the United States. 

    Although not all details were made public, proposed measures
apparently include investigations of charities and political
organizations with radical political points of view -- threatening
their rights to free speech -- and using the Internet to "monitor"
terrorist communications.  There was also agreement to adopt a U.S.
plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed encryption, which would mean that
individuals and companies would be barred from using encryption
technology to electronically lock up their most private and
sensitive information unless they make the keys available to their
government.  

    In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and
electronic privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed
last month at a meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal.    The
group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition
with organizations from around the world to share information and
protect free speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the
global Internet.  GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the Internet
Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and human
rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding member of the group.

    "GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and
that decisions made by international bodies like the G-7 nations
affect all Internet users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate
director of the ACLU.  "The U.S. government may not accomplish
through an international end-run what the U.S. Congress and the
U.S. Courts have rejected."
    
    Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges
in New York declaring that censorship in cyberspace is
unconstitutional.  The decision marked another win in the ongoing
battle for free speech in cyberspace, which saw its first major
victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a Philadelphia court
granted a motion for preliminary injunction on "indecency"
provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed its
challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed
into law.

    "We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their
Philadelphia colleagues in protecting the Internet from
governmental intrusion," said Steinhardt, who testified in the
Philadelphia case.  "But we remain concerned about the government's
continuing efforts to censor electronic speech, not only in the
United States but internationally."

    In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal
that would make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-
making in print, radio, television or in cyberspace.   Violations
would be punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine,
or both. 

    "This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last
year, would criminalize everything from a high school chemistry
teacher explaining basic scientific principles, to a newspaper
carrying an illustration of a bomb's construction, to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture manual describing how to make fertilizer
bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's Steinhardt said. 

    In addition, President Clinton this week announced an
initiative to increase the powers of federal investigators,
including an expanded wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has
commended the Clinton Administration and law enforcement
authorities for their investigation into recent tragic incidents,
it urged President Clinton and Congress in a letter sent to the
White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit" by
safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss
continuing civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
generalized libertarian baiting. I for one would appreciate it if you'd
knock it off in this forum; distortions, insults, and amateur
psychoanalysis are not only not helpful, they're actively harmful in
sidetracking discussion and creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one
another.

If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please
do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list. Thank
you.

If someone refuses to do business with another person based on disagreement

but I can't see a single such incident as a problem. An inconvenience for
the artist who in this case has to find another, more reliable developer,
but no more than that. And I don't agree that it's wrong to refuse to do
business with someone, assuming you're not deceptive about it.

If we see a situation develop in which it's impossible to find developers
or printers to do certain work, or if there is an indication that this
developer refused this work because of intimidation or fear of legal
consequences, then it starts to become a censorship issue. But I didn't see
any such indications in the original message.

Yesterday in Paris government ministers from the G-7 countries met and
approved a 25-point plan calling for close cooperation in moving to
"intensify exchange of operational information," particularly "the use
of communications technologies by terrorist groups."

In a HotWired column, Kenneth Cukier writes: "In case there is any
question about the United States's position, Attorney General Janet
Reno said: 'We obtained the agreement of the eight (countries at the
conference) to develop means of lawful government access to and
decoding of scrambled or coded communication transmitted by
terrorists.'" German delegates also blasted the Internet.

The ACLU reports that: "Proposed measures apparently include
investigations of charities and political organizations with radical
political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech."

I've attached part of a cover story I have in the latest _Internet

about the G-7 process and how countries around the globe are moving to
stifle the Net. Pick up a copy of the physical mag for the full text of

"PLAGUE OF FREEDOM"
The Internet's being disinfected for your protection
(pages 28-33)

By Declan McCullagh
declan@well.com


Call it an unlikely parable for today's Internet.

Daniel Defoe's "A Journal of the Plague Years" isn't about cyberspace.
Written in 1665, the book sketches a ghastly picture of a London under
seige.

Defoe tells how rats from foreign ships have invaded the city, carrying
with them the bubonic plague. Authorities resort to desperate measures,
barricading families inside their homes in a desperate attempt to halt
the onslaught.

It doesn't work. "Setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was,
first of all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by
force or by strategm, even almost as often as they pleased," Defoe
wrote.

So it is with the sprawling expanse of cyberspace in 1996. Governments
around the globe are rushing to barricade their borders, dam the flow
of foreign data, and create a new world information order. For good
reason: an uncensored 'net connection can be as deadly to a 20th
century government as the plague was three centuries ago.

And it may be just as infectious.

[...]

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The most influential international body involved in cyberrulemaking is
the G-7 group of industrialized nations. Truth be told, it's obscure
outside financial circles and is seen even inside them as becoming
irrelevant in a global financial system dominated by multinational
corporations, not by governments.

Yet the seven member nations have already started using the G-7
umbrella to engage in a sort of joint head-scratching about what to do
with cyberspace.

It started in February 1995 in Brussels, at a meeting called the "G-7
Ministerial Conference on the Information Society." There the telecom
honchos from G-7 nations and several smaller countries gathered to chat
about online copyright, cultural pollution, universal access, free
speech, and encryption policies.

At least the principles were lofty. "While the rhetoric of the
conference was progressive, there was no serious discussion of free
expression or other human rights concerns," wrote one American who
attended the conference.

Instead, the G-7 nations said they were considering how to deal with
inappropriate material on the 'net. Canada reminded the other countries
that it wasn't as permissive as the U.S. in dealing with
"hate-mongering materials," saying that when such publications appear
online "they are much easier to obtain but are more difficult to
monitor and take action against." The European Union decried copyright
pirates: "Some form of international cooperation is necessary to
supplement the existing legal systems governing intellectual property
rights." Saying the 'net is "not without risks," France stressed that
cyberspace "must not result in a standardization in content, or a
leveling of cultures."

Only Vice President Al Gore tossed a bone to cyber-rights advocates.
"[Cyberspace] is about protecting and enlarging freedom of expression
for all our citizens... Ideas should not be checked at the border,"
said Gore.

Gore didn't do this in a vacuum. "Our big victory at Brussels was that
we pressured them enough so that Al Gore in his keynote address made a
big point of stressing the importance of free speech on the Internet,"
says Ann Beeson of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Beeson should know -- she's been one of the few cybersavvy activists
who has been fighting globally for an unshackled Internet. Now a
principal attorney on the ACLU's legal team challenging the
Communications Decency Act, Beeson previously worked at Human Rights
Watch and crafted a letter the group sent to Gore before the Brussels
conference. Citing Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, it said: "Everyone has the right... to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Unfortunately, the only G-7 voices supporting this today are a silent
chorus.

The G-7 information ministers met again in South Africa in May 1996 and
plan to meet in Egypt later this year, but no international
'net-advocacy group has been tracking the proposals discussed at the
meetings. U.S. cyberliberty groups have been preoccupied with the CDA
battle, and they have no international counterparts.

That's finally about to change. Two global 'net-alliances are emerging
and have held their initial planning meetings at Internet conferences
this summer in Canada.

The ACLU co-founded one group, called the Global Internet Liberty
Campaign. "We have to face the fact that while ultimately it's
extraordinarily difficult for governments to control the 'net, they're
going to try," says Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.
"The best thing that governments can do is to stay out if it."

Not so, says Bruce Taylor, the chief architect of the CDA and a
professional cyber-scaremonger. The former Federal porn-prosecutor
believes that "not all censorship is bad."

"Foreign countries have an obligation to restrict obscenity and child
pornography on the Internet by the treaty of 1911," says Taylor. "It's
an agreement between the states to cooperate and to use international
laws to prosecute obscenity." And to Taylor, books and copies of
Penthouse magazine can be obscene.

FUTURE REGULATIONS

David Post is a likeable, bearded fellow who once studied yellow
babboons in Kenya and wears tennis shoes with his suits. Now the
co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute, Post is one of the
few lawyers who's made a serious study of the international
evolution of the 'net.

To Post, the 'net is at a fork in its development: the two paths are
self-regulation or an international government crackdown.

"It's the central problem the 'net faces today," says Post. "How does
it relieve itself of the conflicting claims of soverigns whose power is
based on geographical boundaries -- something the 'net doesn't
recognize?"

Eric Freedman, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra Law School, is
anything but optimistic. Freedman remembers how governments already
have crafted a complex constellation of little-known treaties and
agreements governing everything from satellite placement to the world
banking system and postal services.

"I'm worried that the governments are ahead of us," says Freedman.
"There's a humongous potential to get absolutely screwed here... If 100
countries agreed on this, they could get this done in a week. It's
easier for them to coordinate, agree, and implement than it is for us
to stop them from doing so."

That's why the ACLU/American Library Association lawsuit challenging
the CDA is vital. If the Supreme Court upholds the law, Congress and
the White House can craft international "decency" agreements for
cyberspace. But if the high court slams the law as unconstitutional,
Clinton would be barred from signing a CDA-type treaty. "It's a
principle of constitutional law that any treaty has to conform to the
Constitution," says Freedman.

A victory in the CDA case would, in a sense, turn the U.S. into a safe
haven for controversial content from all over the world.

Freedman urges 'netizens in every country to launch similar fights
against government 'net-censorship. "Win as many national victories as
possible to get ahead of the governments of the world," he says. "If
the German or Australian supreme courts were to rule that freedom of
speech principles apply to the 'net as they do to a newspaper, that
would be very helpful."

In the near future, that's the best way to forestall the world
information order. The first time a country proposes such a formal
treaty, it has to die from lack of support.

But pressure to regulate the 'net will always exist, and a new way of
looking at cyberspace may have to emerge. Some precedents exist.
Maritime law, for example, says that no single nation has jurisdiction
over the oceans. Medieval Europe recognized a separate law for
merchants that had its own judicial system. Antarctica is not governed
by any single country's laws. The Catholic Church is a multinational
institution that largely rules itself.

The Cyberspace Law Institute's Post argues for this model. "We should
treat cyberspace as a distinct location and allow our own distinct
legal and moral systems to evolve," he says.

He's right. As the 'net matures, no other solution will work.

Daniel Defoe described governments locking citizen inside their homes,
to no avail: "It was impossible for one man so to guard all the
passages as to prevent the escape of people made desperate... And that
which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the
infection farther."

The infection cyberspace spreads today is far more virulent than the
bubonic plague. Anathema to government, the 'net carries the virus of
freedom.

Look Rich, I have listened to your lies and rhetoric for long enough.

Please point to a single URL on my website where there is "anti-semetic

While your at it, please point to some URLs that you consider "obvious

BTW, are you still claiming on your website that Ernst Zundel has complete

In fairness to Marc, I should explain that the Grant Bristow he was talking
about was a government informant. The point of his affidavit was to say he
was set up. You really need to read the whole SIRC report, and all of the
rebuttals on Zundel's web page, the counter-rebuttals on Nizkor, and all of
the press reports if you want to have the foggiest idea what is going on. It
wouldn't bother me one bit if you didn't care to do that, but it would bug
me if you presumed to pass judgement without doing that.

Since we're obviously not going to do that on this list, forget the larger
issues. They do not concern fight-censorship.

&gt; Rich's point is well put, to me.  It's wrong to censor Lemire, and the
&gt; attempts tro censor him should be exposed.  But people should also be aware
&gt; of who he is and what he represents.  I'm guessing that the SWC Canada is
&gt; well aware of Lemire's extracurricular activities, and that those activities
&gt; are at least part of the reason they have tried to silence him.  Whether
&gt; that's right or not (I think not), it's important to understand, IMHO.

Actually, I disagree. Unless you happen to live in Toronto, or to be Jewish,
I see no particular reason to be interested in the larger issues. You can't
expect us as free-speech activists to investigate the background of every
censorship victim.

My point was that absent a THOROUGH investigation, which one usually cannot
do, it is improper to comment on the merits of a particular site, or even to
characterize it in any but the most general terms. 

Wiesenthal Center-Canada (not sure of the position of the US org) wants to
shut down the web site of a political opponent. Wearing our free-speech
activist hat, we can say that that is wrong. But that's all we should say
without donning another hat. 

I apologize to Marc and Declan for bringing in other issues. Backlashes
breed more backlashes. If you're interested in my opinion of and experiences
with Marc, I'd be more than happy to talk to you off the list, but my point
is precisely that such extraneous discussions, for or against any viewpoint,
do not concern fight-censorship.

Some conflicts that hit the internet censorship scene verge on actual
warfare. The Zambia newspaper case, the Basque separatist web site, and this
case are viewed by their participants as real battles. The Wiesenthal Center
probably sees its battle with neo-Nazis as a covert war, and vice versa --
and rightfully so. I know people on both sides who have "gone underground," 
at considerable risk to life and limb. The role of a free-speech/peace
activist in such a situation is to enforce the "rules of war," and try to
foster real discussion. I don't think the Nazis should be excluded from the
political system; I see no reason to wage war on them. Obviously, the
Wiesenthal Center (and a few other groups, but not the ADL or Nizkor)
disagrees. 

[An extreme case to ponder: When the UN coalition bombed and jammed the
Iraqi communications infrastructure, was that censorship? That's how Lemire 
and certain people in the Wiesenthal Center view this "battle."]

&gt;From: jaed@best.com (Jeanne A. E. DeVoto)
&gt;Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
&gt;generalized libertarian baiting. 

	Is it the place for trolls and generalized Libertarian ranting?

&gt; I for one would appreciate it if you'd knock it off in this forum; 

	Similarly, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to hear the
"Libertarian" view of the proper use of the word censorship over and over
again. But given that it's inevitable that that happens, and I think
it's distracting and politically annoying, what do you suggest I do?
Keep silent about it?

&gt; distortions, insults, and amateur psychoanalysis are not only not
&gt; helpful, they're actively harmful in sidetracking discussion and
&gt; creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one another.

	I think the rifts and ugly feelings are created initially by the
harsh criticism of the person holding a non-Libertarian view. I think if
you'll examine the record of this thread, you'll see that's the history.

&gt;If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
&gt;something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
&gt;after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please

	??? I cannot imagine how you can say this. Let's take it to e-mail.

&gt;do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list.
&gt;Thank you.

	To be frank, I think very little of Libertarianism as a
political philosophy.  But more importantly, and somewhat relevant to
this list, I've come to believe that the habits of thought it engenders
are downright harmful, that they tend to keep people from thinking
effectively about the real world - which is a very complicated mix of
government, business, social customs, and so on, all interacting with
each other. In fact, I just wrote a long article where these very points
took up much of the space. Check out, at the Ethical Spectacle webzine,
(http://www.spectacle.org/)
   Linkname: Internet Blocking Programs and Privatized Censorship
        URL: http://www.spectacle.org/896/finkel.html

	Thus, I very much want to argue against such a worldview. I
don't view this as "flamebaiting", but as "political argument" (although
I am rough at times, but this is somewhat in anticipation of stock stuff
like being called a thief and a Stalinist). Given this background, what
are your suggestions as to what should be done?

 [None of the below is really on-topic for fight-censorship, but because
 Lemire posed specific questions here, I'll answer them here. 

 As far as the topic of fight-censorship goes, Marc Lemire strongly
 disagrees with Sol Littman's campaign to shut down his web site, and so do
 the Nizkor folks and I. Obviously, we disagree concerning the value and
 importance of the content of Mr. Lemire's web pages, but that's a matter of
 free speech -- in other, more appropriate forums.

 forte, and I'm too busy with other things.]

I don't believe I ever claimed either of those. I did say "Zundel's

Zundelsite files to my mirror site because the person who claims to be the

&gt; These two sentences alone make me really question your sanity.

I apologize for getting the chronology backwards. Your friend Wolfgang
Droege smuggled drugs AFTER his release from prison, where he had been put

     The rather extended arugument over this mailing list concerning
     the Liberarian view of free speech has been extremely informative
     for me. I never felt that there was flaming involved, just heated
     discussion, which is often the best way to learn for the
     observer of an argument, because the participants are throwing
     thier best shots.
     From being a nominal supporter of Libertarian views, I have grown
     increasingly aware of the dangers involved in that position. It
     is entirely possible that another subcscriber to this list has
     been pulled in exactly the opposite direction, but hey, that's

Perhaps I should add - a great, pithy response that, like all pithy
statements, needs a great number of auxiliary premises and background in
order to work.  The vast majority of newsgroups are not moderated - they
are a form of expression open to all.  The question is: are citizens
subject to prior restraint or chilling effect censorship when they try to
post to these newsgroups?  If so, they're not being "moderated" - they're
being censored!

But I acknowledge - the difference between content selection and
censorship *can* get a little hazy.  Fortunately, current government
censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Yes, things can get hazy even with selection of articles for academic
journals get a bit hazy.  Complaints that journals are favouring
certain kinds of approaches over others, or some people (or countries)
over others are not uncommon.  Of course whoever owns a journal is
entitled to print what they like (?), but the problem is that some
journals have a status due to external forces (ie they are included in
citation listings, or libraries subscribe to them).  Censorship is
definitely a possibility when this is the case.  (It's all very well
being able to publish on the Internet, but if your job prospects depend
on publication in certain journals it doesn't help much.)

&gt;Fortunately, current government
&gt;censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Indeed.

Danny.

(1) CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS PROPOSE SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORISM
    INITIATIVES

In the wake of the recent bombing at the Olympics and the suspected
terrorist involvement in the TWA crash, the Clinton Administration and
members of Congress are proposing a set of sweeping counter-terrorism
initiatives. If enacted into law, these proposals will dramatically
increase law enforcement surveillance authority over the Internet and other
advanced communications technologies. An outline of the Administration's
proposal was circulated on Capitol Hill on Monday July 29.

President Clinton has urged Congress to pass new counter-terrorism
legislation before the Congressional recess at the end of this week.  While
several prominent Republican members of Congress, including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), have said publicly that Congress should not rush into
any new counter-terrorism legislation, most observers believe there is a
strong possibility that some or all of the Administration's proposal will
be enacted before the August recess.

The draft proposal contains several measures which were rejected by
Congress as part of the previous counter-terrorism initiative proposed
last year after the Oklahoma City bombing, as well as several new measures
including as-yet unspecified changes to U.S. encryption policy and funding
for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a.
Digital Telephony).

CDT is concerned that the latest counter-terrorism efforts on Capitol Hill
are occurring without appropriate deliberation.  Major policy decisions
expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement should not be made
without careful consideration of the necessity of such proposals and the
relative benefit to society. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work
with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to
ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet
are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
________________________________________________________________________

MAJOR POINTS OF THE COUNTER-TERRORISM PROPOSALS CIRCULATING ON THE HILL

The administration's new counter-terrorism initiative and other amendments
circulating this week in Congress contain numerous provisions, but four
are of particular concern to the net.community:

* New Threats to Encryption, Opposition to the Pro-CODE Bill
* Funding for Digital Telephony Without Public Accountability
* Amendment to Criminalize 'Bomb-Making' Information on the Internet
* Expanded Authority for Multi-Point, "Roving" Wiretaps

The full text of the Administration's proposal and background information
are available at CDT's counter-terrorism Web Page:

    http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/

       --------------------------------------------------------

I. NEW THREATS TO ENCRYPTION, OPPOSITION TO THE PRO-CODE BILL

The Administration's outline contains the following statement on encryption:

 "* Encryption -- We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement.  We oppose legislation that would eliminate
    current export barriers and encouraging the proliferation of encryption
    which blocks appropriate access to protect public safety and the
    national security."

While no specific legislative language has yet been proposed, this
represents the first statement by the Administration that they will seek
legislation to further restrict encryption.  Even more troubling, the
Administration is clearly attempting to use the recent suspected terrorist
incidents to push for a new and more restrictive encryption policy.

This new proposal comes as Congress is finally beginning to seriously
consider major changes in U.S. encryption policy. Bipartisan legislation
in both the House and Senate to relax encryption export controls is gaining
momentum.  The Senate Commerce Committee has held 3 hearings in the last 6
weeks, and is preparing to vote to send the Burns/Leahy "Pro-CODE" bill (S.
1726) to the floor of the Senate.  The Administration's attempt to leverage
the public's concern about terrorism to block passage of the Pro-CODE bill
is disturbing, and poses a significant threat to privacy and security on the
Internet.

CDT is working with members of Congress, privacy advocates, and the
communications and computer industries to oppose any attempt by the
Administration to impose new restrictions on encryption, and we continue to
work to move the bipartisan export relief legislation through Congress.

       --------------------------------------------------------

II. FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

The Administration is also seeking to override the public accountability
provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA
- a.k.a. 'Digital Telephony') by providing a funding for the law in a way
that prevents public oversight of the FBI's surveillance ability.

Enacted in October of 1994, granted law enforcement new authority to
influence the design of telecommunications networks (the Internet,
Commercial online services, and BBS's were exempted) in order to preserve
their ability to conduct court authorized electronic surveillance.

Congress balanced this new authority with a number of mechanisms to ensure
public accountability over law enforcement surveillance ability.
While complicated, the public accountability mechanisms are designed to
work as follows:

* Law enforcement provides telecommunications carriers, the Congress,
  and the public with notice of its surveillance capacity needs (i.e.,
  the number of simultaneous wiretaps in a given geographic location)
  with an opportunity for public comment.

* Based on an assessment of the reasonableness of the law enforcement
  surveillance capacity request, Congress appropriates money to cover
  the cost of modifications.  If Congress does not believe law
  enforcement has adequately justified its request, money will not be
  appropriated.

* Telecommunications carriers are not obligated to comply with the
  statute or make any capacity modifications without government
  reimbursement.

In October 1995, the FBI published its first notice of surveillance
capacity (see CDT Policy Post Vol. 1, No. 26).  The telecommunications
industry and privacy advocates used the public accountability provisions of
CALEA to respond to the FBI's request and argued that the FBI had not
adequately justified the extensive surveillance capability contained in the
request.  As a result, Congress has not yet appropriated funds and no
modifications have been made.

The FBI clearly believes that the public accountability provisions of CALEA
are working **too well**, and appears to be using the recent focus on
terrorism to push for a new funding mechanism which does not contain public
oversight.

CDT is fighting hard to ensure that the public accountability provisions of
CALEA, which have until now prevented the FBI from acquiring unnecessary
surveillance capacity, remain a part of the law, and will vigorously oppose
any effort by the FBI and the Clinton Administration to remove the last
opportunity for public oversight over law enforcement power.

       --------------------------------------------------------

III. THE AVAILABILITY OF 'BOMB-MAKING' INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has reintroduced an amendment to make it
illegal to disseminate information on how to construct explosives knowing
that the information will be used in furtherance of a federal crime.  The
amendment was adopted by the Senate earlier this month as part of a
Department of Defense Appropriations bill.  CDT believes that the vague
provisions of the Feinstein amendment could have a chilling effect on online
speech, needlessly duplicate existing criminal statutes, and should be
removed.

Feinstein first proposed the amendment as part of the 1995
counter-terrorism bill. The initial Feinstein amendment was extremely broad
and would have resulted in a flat ban on certain constitutionally protected
speech online.  After civil liberties advocates objected, Feinstein
narrowed her amendment substantially, although it was ultimately dropped
from the final terrorism bill signed in April 1996.

       --------------------------------------------------------

IV.  EXPANDED WIRETAP AUTHORITY

The Administration's proposal would also significantly expand current
wiretapping authority to allow multi-point (or "roving") wiretaps. This
would dramatically change surveillance authority to include wiretaps of
INDIVIDUALS instead of LOCATIONS.

This proposal would do away with the delicate balance between privacy and
law enforcement that Congress has struck over 30 years of wiretapping
legislation. Federal law has always required that wiretaps issue for a
specific location, to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. In 1986 Congress
introduced a narrow exception to this rule, only for cases where it could
be shown that the target was intentionally evading wiretaps by changing
facilities. The Administration proposal would completely remove this
standard, allowing so-called "roving taps" for any persons whose behavior
makes wiretapping difficult for law enforcement.

The administration proposed similar provisions in the spring of 1995 in the
wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. These provisions proved controversial in
Congress and were dropped from the final bill.

&gt;&gt; Seth, I'm no libertarian, but I do have a problem with any system that says

&gt;&gt; *require* the operators of web servers to post any materials submitted ...
&gt;
&gt;	There's a whole range of actions that could take place that don't
&gt;*require* anything. The fact that this is an immediate, knee-jerk
&gt;reaction along the same lines, now yet another person, says something
&gt;very significant. As I said, it's a real mental tick. Anytime something
&gt;negative is said about private action, bang, are-you-proposing-to-compel...

But Seth, I think the line must be drawn clearly between public and private.
I don't know that it's 'kneejerk' to make that distinction.

&gt;	We could begin by not having this immediate flaming at the
&gt;critic whenever a business is criticized. Bad publicity can have a very
&gt;potent effect on private conduct, but actions are less likely to be
&gt;changed if any complainant seeking assistance has to pass through a gauntlet
&gt;of "business is holy, how dare you question it".

You certainly won't get that from me. However, when you're discussing an
issue of possible non-government censorship, I think the strategies for
handling differ (as you imply below). Again, the line between public and
private is important, because when you're in the public context of
government & court enforcement, you have force rather than volition, as you
would have in a private context. I'm not behind a libertarian critique of
government enforcement as an inherent evil, but I would certainly agree that
force should be used judiciously, minimally, and would not apply to a
process of selection in a private context that one might construe as censorship.

&gt;	The typical tactics of influencing business are publicity
&gt;campaigns and boycotts. Boycotts are sometimes criticized themselves,
&gt;but for the scope of this discussion, I'll just point out that they are
&gt;a type of private action that doesn't require any government
&gt;intervention, We've got to get past the idea that business conduct can't
&gt;be opposed, and the immediate leap into absurdity at the very thought is
&gt;a symptom of how deeply this blindness is rooted.

Agreed. If, for instance, you think that AOL is committing egregious acts of
censorship and exclusion, drop your AOL account, fuss at/about AOL, but
don't seek government involvement or court resolution.

thx
Jon

And it would be useful to get a good working definition of censorship that

For the sake of brevity, I will not quote Jon's reply to Seth's post.

Jon makes the valid point, which I'm sure Seth agrees with, that different
responses are appropriate for state and private censorship.  Most
importantly, when dealing with private censorship, one must not run to the
government for help.  If NBC suppresses a story critical of GE (its
owner), than the public has been denied access to important information.
But if we ask the government to dictate to NBC what they can and cannot
broadcast, then we trample upon the First Amendment.  The First Amendment
_protects_ private censorship (providing no other laws are broken).  Thus
when we respond to private censorship, we must respect the First Amendment
rights of the censors.  We can publicize the censorship incident, write
letters of protest, boycott, etc.  But  we must not involve the state in
regulating speech.

Cheers,
Bob

You're right, of course.  These are muddy waters, to say the least, and I
should have dome more research before passing any judgement.

I will look at the sources you have recommended.

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

	         CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
	              NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

	SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

	Dear _________,

	Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
	I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
	considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

	Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use
the tragic events in Atlanta and New York to erode the basic rights of
citizens.

The Global Internet Liberty Coalition (GILC) said that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the
Internet.  GLIC urged users of the Internet to oppose legislative
measures that could restrict the free flow of information or limit the
ability of citizens to engage in private communication.

Members of GILC include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Human Rights Watch
(HRW), the Internet Society (ISOC), Privacy International (PI), and
other organizations.

The GILC was formed in June at the annual meeting of the Internet
Society in Montreal. A temporary web page for the Global Internet
Liberty Campaign has been established at:

   http://www.aclu.org/gilc/index1.html.

A permanent home for GILC will soon be established at

=======================================================================
[2] #005#New Domestic Surveillance Provisions Proposed
=======================================================================

In the wake of the recent tragedies in Atlanta and New York, the White
House and the FBI are again calling for new federal powers to expand
wiretapping authority, even in the absence of any evidence that
inability to wiretap led to the two tragedies.  The provisions were
originally introduced as part of the counterterrorism bill but were
struck out after objection from a coalition of liberal and
conservative groups.

The White House is trying to rush the proposal through Congress this
week before the August recess.

The new measure would allow prosecutors to use of "roving wiretaps."
The Administration proposal would allow prosecutors to tap multiple
telephones in an area if they suspect that the target in switching
phones. Other recommendations include allowing for 48 hour warrantless
"emergency" wiretaps, easier access to consumer records including
phone and travel records, and restrictions on the use of encryption.

Several members of Congress were critical of the proposal. Rep. Bob
Barr (R-GA) told CNN that the proposals created "vast powers" and that
there was "no case for emergency wiretaps and roving wiretaps." Rep.
Ike Skelton (D-MO) called for greater human intelligence noting that
law enforcement and intelligence agencies "seem to rely too much on
technology". Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and others met with
President Clinton on July 29, after which Gingrich expressed tentative
support for the proposals.

The American public also remains divided on the desirability of giving
federal law enforcement new wiretapping authority. In a USA
Today/CNN/Gallop poll taken July 29, 50 percent of those polled said
that "[i]ncreasing surveillance of U.S. citizens by the government"
was "going too far." According to the poll, 45 percent supported the
measures and five percent were undecided. The New York times
editorialized on June 30 that "the proposal to expand the Government's
wiretapping authority is excessive."

A House/Senate conference committee meeting on the Defense
Appropriations bill is also reviewing a provision introduced by
Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) that would ban the dissemination of
bomb-related information on the Internet. This provision had also been
rejected in the counterterrorism bill on First Amendment grounds.

More information on wiretapping is available from:

    http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/

=======================================================================
[3]  Digital Telephony Funding Approved by House
=======================================================================

The House of Representatives approved on July 25 funding for the
Justice Department that includes a provision to fund the "digital
telephony" bill.

The bill would establish a permanent "Telecommunications Carrier
Compliance Fund" with contributions from "any agency of the United
States with law enforcement or intelligence responsibilities". Thus
agencies such as the CIA and NSA, with their secret "black budgets"
will be able to fund the wiretap program without public oversight. A
previous draft of the bill had also allowed agencies with "national
security" roles to contribute.

Funding for the proposal was rejected in two earlier attempts: the FY
1996 appropriations bill and the 1996 counter-terrorism bill. It now
goes to the Senate where advocates will attempt to remove the funding
provision.

A copy of the House bill and more information on wiretapping is
available from:

=======================================================================
[4] Another Court Enjoins CDA
=======================================================================

Another federal court has ruled that the Communications Decency Act is
unconstitutional and has prohibited its enforcement.  This follows the
decision earlier this month by a federal court in Pennsylvania
striking down two provisions in a case brought by the ACLU, EPIC, ALA
and others.

In this case, Joe Shea, editor of the American Reporter an online
newspaper, challenged the CDA in US District in New York city. Shea
published an "indecent" article by Judge Steve Matthews, a Texas state
judge and law professor, and then challenged the CDA.

The court ruled that the section prohibiting the dissemination of
"indecent" speech was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and
affected protected speech between adults. The court also found that
presently there was no practical way to block the material using
currently available blocking software and thus the affirmative defense
were not adequate to save the law: "there is no persuasive evidence
that a substantial proportion of Internet content providers can make
available material potentially within the scope of the CDA without
fear of prosecution and criminal liability."

Unlike the ACLU case, however, the court rejected the challenge to the
CDA as being overly vague. It ruled that there was substantial case
law available on what was "indecent" that has been upheld by the
courts. It also rejected the assertion that because of the global
nature of the Internet, online providers could not be expected to know
what was indecent everywhere:

   "We have no basis for concluding that Internet content providers are
   any less capable than those subject to obscenity laws or other
   indecency restrictions to acquire a general familiarity with the
   relevant standards; indeed, one might conclude that a content
   provider's contact with others around the country and around the world
   through interactive computer services would cultivate a heightened
   awareness of regional and cultural differences."

The US Justice Department has twenty days to appeal this decision to the
US Supreme Court. DOJ has already filed a petition for appealing the
Pennsylvania case to the Court, which will hear it in its fall session.

In a case raising similar issues brought before a French court, the French
Conseil Constitutionnel on July 24 struck down a recently enacted French
law Internet censorship law known as the "Fillon amendment". The court
ruled that placing Internet regulations under the control of the Conseil
Superieur de l'Audiovisuel and requiring Internet service providers to
take the advice of the CSA was a violation of free speech rights.

[5] Congressional Hearing Critical of US Crypto Policy
=======================================================================

Senators at the July 25 hearing of the Commerce Committee on S. 1726, the
PRO-Code legislation were openly critical of current US policy on
cryptography.  Senators Burns, Pressler, Ashcroft openly questioned the
viability of key escrow and the effects of export controls on American
business.

The first panel of the hearing included FBI Director Louis Freeh, William
Reinch, Undersectrary of the Bureau of Export Administration for the US
Department of Commerce, and William Crowell, Deputy Director of the
National Security Agency. The panelists opposed S. 1726 and supported the
implementation of an international key escrow system. Freeh claimed that
five percent of all cases show evidence of cryptography.

Many of the Senators were openly critical of the current export controls
and the viability of creating a comprehensive international key escrow
system. Senator Pressler held up a copy of Applied Cryptography and a disk
and described the restrictions on the disk as "somewhat absurd." Sen. Ron
Wyden noted "The terrorists and drug merchants of the 21st century are not
going to be encryption simpletons."  Senator Burns described the
international key escrow system as a "pipe dream." When Undersecretary
Reinsch claimed that "there's a very clear commercial interest in having
hardware and/or software with a back door" to prevent a "electronic tower
of Babel", Senator Ashcroft forced him to admit that the only real use
would be for government access and then questioned the Constitutionality of
the proposal and invoked the Filegate incident as an example of the
potential abuses.

Under questioning by Senator Burns, FBI Director Louis Freeh acknowledged
that if the current "voluntary" policy failed, he would seek mandatory
domestic controls on cryptography. Freeh told the Committee:

  I don't think I'm at that point yet.  I believe that the policy
  that is enunciated here is a doable policy, but there could come a
  point where that policy, the voluntary policy, is not a viable
  one.  And then I would certainly look at more mandatory controls.
  Not that that might work, but backing up my position that's where
  ultimately I would be.

A second panel was made up of industry representatives who supported S.
1726. James Barkesdale of Netscape Communications testified that his
company has lost 30 percent of its business to foreign competitors who have
stronger security systems. He described the Clipper III proposal as "most
massive computer infrastructure on the planet . . . beyond belief." Ron
Pieper of Tandem Computers described the key escrow system as "an absolute
show stopper" for electronic commerce.

The bill may now be considered by the Commerce Committee this week and then
sent to the full Senate for a vote in September after the Congressional
recess. More information, including Freeh's written testimony, is available

ELECTRONIC FRONTIER CANADA (EFC) --- PRESS RELEASE
(For immediate release --- Thursday, August 1, 1996
---------------------------------------------------


   BC teenager takes on BC government in bold free speech battle


A 15-year-old boy in Smithers, BC, says he will be "mirroring" the
controversial web pages that had prompted the BC Attorney General
to call for controls on the flow of "hate" through the Internet.

Frank Sayre, who acts as webmaster for the `Canuck Soup' web pages says,
"I decided to mirror the `Freedom Site' because of B.C.'s misguided
attempt to censor the Internet".

"I do not agree with the Freedom Site's content," he continues,
"but I do agree that they have a fundamental right to express
their political opinions, both on and off the Internet."

"The B.C. government has no experience or understanding of cyberspace,
... nor does it have any right to censor or suppress legal expression,
even if it's on a web site," says the young cyber-activist.

Sayre says he's encouraging other like-minded individuals to help him
make his point by setting up their own "mirror sites" -- something he's
facilitated by packaging up the information into a downloadable
"ZIP file" that his web pages boasts will enable anyone to
"Set up your own Freedom-Site in 5 minutes or less!"

"It's a controversial approach," admits David Jones, president of
Electronic Frontier Canada, who recalls that a similar tactic was
successful earlier this year in getting Germany's Deutsche Telekom
to back down when it started blocking access to Ernst Zundel's web
pages based in southern California.

Although Electronic Frontier Canada is a staunch defender of free speech
in cyberspace, the organization won't be setting up a mirror site of
its own.  "I want to be clear that we don't endorse the views expressed
in any of these so-called `hate' web pages," says Jeffrey Shallit,
EFC vice-president, acknowledging that many Canadians find them
offensive and distasteful.

"We do agree, however, that attempts to censor web pages are pointless
and misguided.  First, attempts at censorship just give more media
attention to these people, who desperately crave attention, and second,
the end result tends to be that the information gets copied around
the Internet to these mirror sites -- which can hardly be considered
an improvement."

Both Shallit and Sayre make reference to the approach advocated by
US Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas: "The way to combat noxious
ideas is with other ideas.  The way to combat falsehood is with truth."
(from 1958 interview with Mike Wallace)

The Nizkor Project, run by B.C.'s own Ken McVay, is a notable example
of this approach.

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

                 CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
                      NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use

Free speech isn't only for those with dangerous ideas; privacy isn't just
for suspected criminals.

As Internet users, we all have a stake in standing up for free speech *and*
privacy.

With your indulgence, I'm passing along an important alert regarding
several telecommunications surveillance proposals that Congress may
adopt... perhaps as soon as FRIDAY.

If you can, please call Congress on Friday to insist that our legislators
carefully consider the privacy implivations of any proposal to expland the
FBI's wiretap authority.  Your call can make a very big difference.

Full details follow below.

Work the network!

Thank you for calling attention to the need for clarification.  By running to
the government to help I meant asking the government to intervene in a way
contrary to the First Amendment--e.g. by forcing a newspaper to print something
it does not want to print.  Using the courts is a  perfectly valid way of asking the 
government for help in cases where private institutions are trampling on the First 
Amendment rights of others.  If I didn't believe in the appropriateness of using
the courts, I never would have involved the National Writers Union as a plaintiff
in the suit to invalidate the CDA.  (Granted, this is a case of state censorship.)

Anyway, my original message certainly left me open to misinterpretation.  Forgive
my sloppiness and thank you for calling this to my attention.

Cheers,
Bob

*  CYBER-LIBERTIES ALERT: Anti-Terrorism Measure Threatens Net Liberty 
 
The latest understanding from ACLU's legislative representatives is that
the "Anti Terrorism" bill that is expected to be acted on today and
tomorrow will include government controls on encryption -- a scheme for key
escrow of private keys for encryption. It is also likely to include
expanded use of wiretapping without a Court order. 
 
There is absolutely no evidence at this time to show that either the TWA
tragedy or the Olympic Park bombing could have been prevented or any crimes
solved by increased government power to control the use of encryption or to
wiretap.  
 
Please call your Congress member and Senators immediately and ask them to
oppose these measures.

* Congress Attacks Our Medical Privacy 
 
The House-Senate Conference Committee has reported out H.R. 3103, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill. The U.S. House conferees pushed
for and achieved the inclusion of their deceptively-labeled "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments (which were not in the Senate's
version). The bill is scheduled to go to the House floor for a vote today,
and to the Senate floor for a vote tomorrow.  It then would still require
the President's signature. 
 
With "Administrative Simplification" and its related amendments included,
this bill is profoundly destructive to the Medical Privacy Rights of each
and every person in the United States. 
 
Specifically: 
 
1.)  Medical Records will be computerized in vast databases run by the
government and/or large corporations, including consumer credit reporting
companies whose problems with both privacy and accuracy are
well-documented. 
 
This will create, without any consent or control by patients (all of us), a
COMPUTERIZED "LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OF OUR MEDICAL RECORDS. Just as the
Social Security Administration and the U.S. military can't protect their
computers from unauthorized access, so too the new Medical Records "Lending
Library" will not be secure. 
 
2.)  Each of us will have a "UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFIER" NUMBER assigned to
us by the government, and the government will force this number to be used
in connection with any and all health care. 
 
3.) Although the bill does not formally preempt state laws protecting our
medical privacy, it establishes a structure and creates conditions that
will make it unlikely for such state laws to survive. 
 
IF YOU VALUE YOUR MEDICAL PRIVACY, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. 
 
Call your own U.S. Senators (202-224-3121) and U.S. Representative
(202-225-3121) and tell them to "KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY MEDICAL RECORDS". 
 
Urge your Representative and Senators to oppose passing any Health Care
bill that violates our medical privacy by having "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments.  Tell them to SEND IT BACK TO THE
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, and to JUST SAY NO TO "ADMINISTRATIVE
SIMPLIFICATION." 
 
You can also reach the Capital Switchboard at 1-800-962-3524. 
 
----- 
 
For your convenience, we supply the following talking points: 
 
H.R. 3103 (the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill) should be opposed
because it includes the deceptively labeled "administrative simplification"
section and its related provisions. 
 
For example: 
 
1. The bill would give government and corporations access to confidential
medical information about individuals without their consent.  Violating the
privacy of medical patients is very unpopular.  The Time/CNN Poll found
that 87% of Americans "believe patients should be asked for permission
every time any information about them is used." (Time, May 6, 1996, p. 61) 
 
2. The bill creates the framework for a national medical data collection
and data transfer system, beginning with claims and billing data and
proceeding to the entire medical record.  The system will include data
processing clearinghouses, which may also serve as repositories for data. 
This would create, without any consent or control by the patient, a
"COMPUTERIZED LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OUR MEDICAL RECORDS, vulnerable to
being accessed by unauthorized unsuitable parties. 
 
3. The bill has THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING A UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFICATION
NUMBER UPON EVERY PATIENT, health provider, health plan, and employer,
thereby establishing a vast, bureaucracy-dictated, national ID regime, with
the new government numbers being the key to everyone's private Medical
Records. 
 
4. The bill gives new powers and duties to the National Committee on Vital
and Health Statistics, authorizing extensive new statistical studies,
including "health status" studies.  These studies no doubt will make use of
the large stores of individually identified medical information which will
now be easily obtainable (especially by this committee; see what follows). 
 
5. The bill has the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
advising the Secretary of HHS on privacy regulations, a responsibility in
conflict with its duties of data collection and analysis.  The committee,
which will be composed largely of statisticians, epidemiologists, health
services researchers and experts on computerized medical information
systems, is ill suited for protecting the patient's right to privacy and
medical record confidentiality. 
 
6. The bill will undercut state laws that protect medical privacy. 
 
HR 3103 should be rejected so long as it includes any "administrative
simplification" or related provisions. Such provisions cannot be fixed;
they must be deleted from the bill.

* ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace; New
Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats 
 
NEW YORK:  Despite a second federal court decision affirming that
censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today warned of
persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and internationally, to censor
electronic communications and regulate privacy technology. 
 
At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known as "G-7,"
government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate the Internet and
other electronic communications in an effort to 
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing incident at
the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight 800, which is being
investigated as a possible terrorist bombing. Participants included France,
Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany, Canada, Russia and the United States.  
 
Although not all details were made public, proposed measures apparently
include investigations of charities and political organizations with
radical political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech
-- and using the Internet to "monitor" terrorist communications.  There was
also agreement to adopt a U.S. plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed
encryption, which would mean that individuals and companies would be barred
from using encryption technology to electronically lock up their most
private and sensitive information unless they make the keys available to
their government.   
 
In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and electronic
privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed last month at a
meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal. [See the GILC release below.] 
The group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition with
organizations from around the world to share information and protect free
speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the global Internet. 
GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
Human Rights Watch, the Internet Society, Privacy International, and other
civil liberties and human rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding
member of the group. 
 
"GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and that decisions
made by international bodies like the G-7 nations affect all Internet
users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.  "The U.S.
government may not accomplish through an international end-run what the
U.S. Congress and the U.S. Courts have rejected." 
 
Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges in New York
declaring that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional.  The decision
marked another win in the ongoing battle for free speech in cyberspace,
which saw its first major victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a
Philadelphia court granted a motion for preliminary injunction on
"indecency" provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed
its challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed into
law. 
 
"We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their Philadelphia
colleagues in protecting the Internet from governmental intrusion," said
Steinhardt, who testified in the Philadelphia case.  "But we remain
concerned about the government's continuing efforts to censor electronic
speech, not only in the United States but internationally." 
 
In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal that would
make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-making in print, radio,
television or in cyberspace.   Violations would be punishable by up to 20
years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. 
 
"This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last year, would
criminalize everything from a high school chemistry teacher explaining
basic scientific principles, to a newspaper carrying an illustration of a
bomb's construction, to a U.S. Department of Agriculture manual describing
how to make fertilizer bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's
Steinhardt said. 
 
In addition, President Clinton this week announced an initiative to
increase the powers of federal investigators, including an expanded
wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has commended the Clinton
Administration and law enforcement authorities for their investigation into
recent tragic incidents, it urged President Clinton and Congress in a
letter sent to the White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit"
by safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss continuing
civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

Campaign has been established at &lt;http://www.aclu.org/gilc/index1.html&gt;.

*  GILC Opposes Efforts to Regulate Internet; Group Calls G-7 Efforts
Anti-Democratic 
 
The Global Internet Liberty Coalition said today that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the Internet. 
The announcement follows a meeting of G-7 leaders in Paris where plans were
announced to regulate the Internet in ways that threaten the Free Speech
and Privacy rights of it users. 
 
The G-7 countries include the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also participates in the meetings of the
G-7. 
 
The G-7 proposal, while couched in careful diplomatic terms, appears to
endorse a U.S. Government initiated plan to require key escrowed encryption
on the Internet -- a scheme where the keys for decryption would be
accessible to governments.  There is also language which suggests plans to
restrict the electronic publication of information by unpopular political
organizations. 
 
Earlier attempts by officials in the US Administration to pass similar
measures through Congress have failed. 
 
Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director of the ACLU, said "The US government
may not accomplish through an international end-run what the US Congress
and the US Courts have rejected." 
 
The ACLU was lead plaintiff in the successful challenge to the
Communications Decency Act.  In that case, a US federal court held that the
government may not regulate speech on the Internet. 
 
Simon Davies, director general of Privacy International, said that the
human rights community must not permit national governments to seize
control of privacy enhancing technologies.  "National governments will use
the horrendous incidents in the States to build a international web of
surveillance to the detriment of their citizens." 
 
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, said that the proposals would meet with fierce opposition from
the Internet community.  "Net users will simply not allow governments to
trample on the rights of citizens.  Our rights to privacy and free speech
are clearly protected by international law." 
 
EPIC organized the Internet petition against the Clipper encryption scheme.

 
Cynthia Brown, program director of Human Rights Watch, said, "Free speech
on the Internet is already under attack from states like Saudi Arabia,
China and Singapore, and with this agreement, the G7 countries are only
reinforcing that negative trend." 
 
Human Rights Watch has produced a report on threats to Liberty on the
Internet. 
 
The GILC was formed at the annual meeting of the Internet Society in
Montreal.  Members of the coalition include the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the
Internet Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and
human rights organizations.

(please forward where appropriate)

It's not over yet....

The House has scheduled a vote on "suspension" for a 'counter-terrorism'
bill TODAY (Friday).

Despite media reports that the negotiations had stalled out, house
Republicans have apparently worked out their differences and are set to
vote on the bill today.  The Senate may or may not vote on the measure on
Saturday.

No one I've talked to knows for sure what's in the bill, though I have
heard that there are no encryption provisions and that some of the wiretap
proposals have been scaled back.

I will post details as I get them. In the mean time, keep those calls
coming into Congress.

The outline below is from a document produced by the House Republican
Conference.  It is ONLY A SUMMARY of the proposed bill and is NOT actual
legislation.  No one I have spoken with has seen any specific legislative
language yet.

The outline is confusing on several points, particularly the "FBI DIGITAL
TELEPHONY" Section, which says:

 "The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to
  investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding for equipment purchase was
  provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier this
  year."

The first sentence above is not at all clear, and probably won't be until
we can get our hands on the actual text of the bill. It could be additional
wiretap authority (ie, roving wiretaps), or it could be nothing.  As far as
the funding goes, the "1996 omnibus appropriations measure" DID NOT contain
funding for implementation of the law - but it did appropriate $37 million
to cover new equipment for the FBI.

The rest looks like it is a scaled back version of a measure the
Administration and members of Congress were pushing earlier this week, but
the scope of the new bill depends a lot on what the actual text says.

I will post additional information as soon as I get it.

                                HR__

                     Committee on the Judiciary
                          No Report Filed
                         To Be Introduced

Floor Situation:

The House is scheduled to consider HR__ on Friday August 2, 1996. On
Thursday August 1, the Rules Committee granted a rule to allow the bill to
be considered under suspension of the rules. It is debatable for 40
minutes, may not be amended, and requires a two-thirds vote for passage.

Summary:

HR__ includes several bipartisan initiatives intended to bolster federal
efforts to combat domestic terrorism in addition to those already enacted
earlier this year as part of the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132).  The bill contains the following
counter-terrorism provisions:

Aviation SECURITY MEASURES: The bill enables domestic airports to
aggressively search for and prevent explosives from causing destruction and
harm to individuals or property through enhanced explosive detection
procedures, baggage and passenger screening, and FBI authority to improve
airport security training and standards to ensure that provisions of the
1990 Aviation Security Act (P.L 101-604) are implemented expeditiously.
Specifically, the bill (1) requires the FAA to implement increased
explosives section methods immediately, (2) strengthen the level of
training and expertise possessed by security personnel who are assigned to
domestic airports, (3) allows airports to use available funding to
reinforce such training for security personnel, and (4) extends criminal
background requirements to include a greater number of airport employees.

IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS: The bill urges
implementation of provisions enacted in the 1996 Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132), such as designating and
freezing the assets of foreign terrorist organizations and implementing
expedited removal procedures for aliens convicted of a crime.

BIPARTISAN "BLUE RIBBON" COMMISSION: The bill establishes a special
commission to review all aspects of U.S. anti-terrorism policy and make
legislative recommendations about methods to most effectively establish a
long-term defense against terrorist threats, including enhancing the
nation's human intelligence capabilities.

PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENTS: The bill includes provisions which grant a cause of
action against the U.S. if in the course of a wiretap investigation
damaging information is willfully disclosed to the detriment of an innocent
party by the federal government.  The cause of action includes monetary
damages to the plaintiff if a favorable decision is rendered in federal
court.

EXPLOSIVES STUDY: The bill authorizes a study on black and smokeless powder
by an independent agency selected by the National Institute of Justice.

FEDERAL RACKETEERING STATUTE CRIMES: The bill permits federal prosecutors
to deem those acts determined to be terrorist in nature as substantial
enough to invoke criminal prosecution under existing criminal racketeering
(RICO) statutes.

FBI DIGITAL TELEPHONY: The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced
telephone technology to investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding
for equipment purchase was provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations
measure enacted earlier this year.

Check out this quote by Rep. Charles Schumer I found in an article by CNN:

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

The article also reports:

"Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

"They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties."

U.S. anti-terrorism talks collapse
But proposals could resurface

August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 9:30 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) --
Congressional efforts to draft new anti-terrorism legislation before the
August recess a the end of the week collapsed Thursday night in a partisan
stalemate. But lawmakers said
there is hope for agreement after the monthlong break.

Key members of the Senate blamed House conservatives for the failure,
saying they had insisted on linking proposed new wiretapping authority
for the FBI to an expansion of privacy laws.

"There's no possibility of anything to be signed before the recess," Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Delaware, said after the last series of meetings on the
issue broke up.

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

Although Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
and Biden, the panel's top Democrat, said there no longer seemed to be a
possibility of passing a bill before the recess, they thought it could be
done before Congress adjourns for the year.

Hatch said negotiators had agreed on a dozen issues, but key requests by
the administration for new wiretap authority and for a broader study of
using chemicals in gunpowder to help trace it were not among them.

Worries about privacy

Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties.

"The White House is not free of blame here. They want it immediately;
we can give it to them in early September," said Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, who heads the bipartisan task force that has been negotiating
with administration officials.

Craig, who had hoped for House and Senate votes on a new
anti-terrorism package before the recess, declined to declare defeat
Thursday evening. Asked whether passage was still possible, he said, "I
hope so."

President Clinton has urged Congress to take quick action, because of the
Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta and the crash of TWA
=46light 800, suspected to have been caused by a bomb.

The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

The House passed a revised counter-terrorism bill this afternoon by a
substantial majority.  The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate
on Saturday 8/3, and is likely to pass.

The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening
provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from
the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI
objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap
authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed
bill.

In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. Earlier
in the week, the Administration had circulated an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. It's nice to finally have a number of powerful
allies joining the usual defenders of net.freedom on Capitol Hill.

The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a controvertial provisions expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.

The bill also contains a small but not insigificant privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.

This is not over yet -- many of these issues, particularly encryption and
Digital Telephony funding, are likely to be back before the Congress in
September, so stay tunned...

Thanks to everyone who called Congress today to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
mave had really made a difference in this debate.

More as it comes...

Stop the presses -- the other shoe didn't drop. Despite a flurry of
last-minute hyperbole, the House passed an anti-terrorism bill this
afternoon without the ominous encryption or wiretap provisions. Now
the bill lies in the lap of the Senate, which probably will approve it
later today or tomorrow before they leave town for the August recess.

In the wake of the dual bombings, Congress wanted to be seen as taking
*some* action before they adjourned, and last weekend Clinton and the
Dems started lobbying hard for the heinous measures they wanted in an
anti-terrorism bill. Vastly expanded state-snooping capabilities:
multipoint wiretaps, warrantless short-term wiretaps, dialed-phone
number recorders, and black and smokeless powder taggants. Even
possible of anti-crypto language that Jamie Gorelick, deputy attorney
general, has been shopping around for months.

The Net owes its thanks to the House Republicans for stopping these
fool Dems in a fine backroom political maneuver late last night.

They did it through the House Rules Committee, which in the wee hours
of the morning reported a rule allowing the GOP leadership to introduce
the terrorism bill on the floor today -- without letting Democrats see
it, amend it, or even send it back to committee. It was a good plan --
coordinated by Rep. Chris Cox -- keeping the legislation away from the
hands of the Big Brother Dems.

The Democrats waxed pissy. Rep. David Bonior, the party's whip, called
the majority's maneuvering "extrordinary." John Conyers, the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, blasted Gingrich and the
Republican leadership for "bringing a meaningless bill to the House
floor."

Conyers said to reporters at 1 pm: "It's a hoax on the American
people. It is all bark and no bite... This bill is missing the
important wiretapping provisions that would allow law enforcement to
find and stop terrorists before they kill. The House Republicans and
the NRA say we should not have emergency authority for surveillance
even if we know terrorists are about to blow a plane out of the sky.
They also say that we should not have wiretap authority for terrorists who
use more than one telephone to make their deadly plans."

Of course, this is political grandstanding at its finest -- or worst.
Conyers conveniently neglected to add that law enforcement officers
already have the right to use roving wiretaps with court approval.

Also, there was a mixup over Digital Telephony funding, compounded by
the text of the legislation's being kept secret until the last minute.
Summaries distributed to reporters early this afternoon said: "The bill
authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to investigate
suspected terrorist activity. Funding for equipment purchase was
provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier
this year." But the DT provisions weren't in the final draft of the bill.

Silly Congressperns. The House had *already* approved the DT slushfund
on July 24 as part of the 1997 Commerce, Justice, State departments
appropriations bill.

Now the 1997 CJS appropriations bill goes to the Senate, which will
decide how much cash to give Digital Telephony when they return in early
September.

What's going to happen? Well, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), a former
prosecutor and longtime proponent of Digital Telephony, said yesterday
at the Intelligence Committee hearing on terrorism: "I was proud to
have worked with the FBI director to ensure passage of the
Communications Assisatance for Law Enforcement Act, sometimes called
the digital telephony law."

With Republicans like the ones in the House, who needs so-called "civil
libertarian" Democrats?

Joe, I was a staffer on Jerry Brown's 1992 presidental campaign in Santa 
Monica and NYC. I'm hardly an uncritical supporter of the Republicans.

However, I believe in giving credit where it is due, and they deserve our 
thanks this week. Next week the opposite may be true when the Republicans 
conspire to trample on our free expression rights.

But the undercurrent of political posturing worked in our favor for a
change and we should welcome the reprive. Why are the Dems being
anti-civil-lib suddenly? My first thought is because one of their own is
in the White House, overseeing the DoJ, running for re-election, so Dems
are closing ranks. They also seem truly to enjoy being the "law-and-order"
party for a change.

This was picked up by the local Fox affiliate, Channel 5, and headlined 
on the 10 pm news yesterday.

I was sitting in my living room with a friend -- we had just finished
watching a rather poor episode of X-Files -- and we looked at each other
and sighed as Fox detailed how the investigation had shifted to a small
Georgia college where Jewell was a security guard. "Investigators are
trying to determine whether he downloaded bomb-making information from the
Internet while working at the college." 

This is a very virulent meme.

The Senate left without voting on the anti-terrorism bill. This is not

and then fight the House Repubs over it in conference committee. 

We have a one-month reprieve. I seem to recall Congress returns from its

  County Accuses Four of Using the Internet to Access Child Porn
  --------------------------------------------------------------

By Ronald K. Fitten
Seattle Times Staff Reporter

Four men, including two former Microsoft employees, have been charged
with allegedly using computers to access child pornography on the
Internet, said King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.

"Traditional law-enforcement efforts against child pornography have
focused on magazines, movies, and tangible materials," Maleng said
yesterday.  "But law enforcement faces new challenges with the
emergence of new technology.  The Internet, with its millions of
international web sites, has become the new underground highway for
illegal child pornography."

The two former Microsoft engineers, Michael Seaman, 37, of Kirkland,
and Ronald Rosul Jr., 31, of Seattle, allegedly used Microsoft
computers to access and copy child pornography from the Internet,
according to prosecutors.

[...]

Both Seaman and Rosul will be arraigned next week in King County
Superior Court.  If convicted, both could receive up to one year in
jail.

Maleng, who said police and prosecutors worked cooperatively with
Microsoft throughout the investigation, said law-enforcement officers
had confiscated computer hard drives, CD-ROMs, and printed materials
as evidence.

Found this buried deep in the long version of an AP story about the
Atlanta pipe bomb suspect:

      Bomb-making instructions available through the global computer
      network have contributed to an increase in bombings in the United
      States, authorities say. 

Did I miss the news story where that contribution was identified?  Or is 
the AP mis-stating what their FBI "expert" said on Monday.

Incidentally, the source for the oft-repeated statement that the FBI was 
"trying to determine whether Jewell may have had access to the campus
Internet" [sic] is not in the FBI; it's someone on the campus who believes
that that's what the FBI is doing.

	Police wanted to secure the building. Reporters wanted to file

House approves anti-terrorism bill
By Rose Aguilar

August 2, 1996, 6:15 p.m. PST

          The United States House of Representatives tonight approved the
          Anti-Terrorism act of 1996 by a sweeping 389 to 22 vote, but to
          the relief of Net activists passed a version free of amendments
          that would have regulated Net content, restricted encryption
          technology, and expanded the use of wiretapping.

          The Democrats fought hard for the encryption, Internet, and
          wiretapping provisions, but lost to arguments from
          conservatives and libertarians that the provisions would be an
          infringement of citizens' First Amendments rights. The law that
          was approved by the house also did not include the amendment
          re-introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would have made
          it a felony to publish information about bombs and bomb-making
          on the Internet.

[...]

          The anti-terrorism section of the bill adds several
          terrorism-related crimes to the list of offenses included in
          the federal antiracketeering law. Under this section, the
          penalty for unlawful disclosure of information obtained from a
          wiretap doubles from 5 to 10 years.

          The bill went to the Senate today. Supporters would like the
          bill to be approved without changes and then sent to the
          President. The Senate may vote as early as Saturday or may
          decide to make changes and wait to approve its own version
          until next month.

          "I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said online
          activist Declan McCullagh. "The Senate may or may not act
          tomorrow, but I think the Net has a reprieve from the Net
          crackdown in terms of bomb information until September," he
          said.

Louis Freeh beats his fear-mongering drum while singing his wiretap tune....


From: http://www.cnn.com

FBI chief: U.S. 'under attack' by terrorists
August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 6:05 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States may face "a very difficult time"
coping with terrorists, and new counter-terrorism weapons are needed,
FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.

On expanded wiretap powers being sought by the FBI as part of that
defense, he said: "We're simply trying to catch up with technology. And
that is critical."

[ ... ]

He referred to the two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 24
servicemen; the bombing that killed one woman at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta; and the still-unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800.

Although the combined incidents have "completely consumed" law
enforcement personnel, Freeh said the wiretap proposals would not give
the government "expansive powers" and would not lead to "an avalanche of
new electronic surveillance."

"The United States and its interests both here and around the world are
clearly under attack. And we may be in for a very difficult time with
respect to continuation of these types of things," Freeh said.

Anti-terrorism negotiations

Freeh spoke a day after the White House, after wrangling with key
Republican lawmakers, won tentative agreement on a package of
anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority.

[ ... ]

The negotiators, led by Craig and White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, hoped to have a package ready for a vote by the end of the
week.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders summoned
Attorney General Janet Reno, Panetta and Freeh to a private meeting
Thursday to explain why some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't
been spent.

"We have been somewhat behind in the hiring of people" for
anti-terrorism programs, because of the time needed to screen applicants
for such sensitive work, Freeh explained during his Senate testimony
Thursday.

NETCOM SETTLES SUIT WITH CHURCH

Out-of-court deal with Scientologists

BY MARK LEIBOVICH
Mercury News Staff Writer

A lawsuit that many in the online community feared would set a
precedent restricting freedom of expression on the internet was
resolved quitely Saturday in an out-of-court settlement in San
Jose.

Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc. announced it has
settled the intellectual property dispute initiated by
Religious Technology Center, the publishing wing of the Church
of Scientology.

RTC had brought a claim against Netcom, seeking to prohibited
what is viewed as illegal postings of sacred church writings,
some of which it claimed were protected under US copyright
laws.  Both parties agreed not to disclose specific details
of the settlement.

According to a statement, Netcom as set up a protocol on its
company home page for handling future intellectual property
disputes.

[...]

The full text of the protocol can be found on Netcom's home
page, at
http://www.netcom.com/about/protectcopy.html

[...]

"I would hate to see Netcom be put in the position of having
to police the material posted on its service," says Howard
Rheingold, a well-known digital community guru, and author of
the 1993 book Virtual Community, who is not familiar with the
details of the case.

&gt;From the Sunday times:-

AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into
the computers of the European parliament and
European commission as part of an international
espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and
political secrets, according to investigators, write
Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. 

The European parliament has called in British
communications experts to improve its security and
to block further attempts by American govern ment
agents to spy on its workings. 

Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg
offices say they have discovered several recent
instances in which its communications system was
compromised by American hacking. They have also
found evidence that the Americans used information
obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations
last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). 

Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the
European parliament, said he was shocked by the
disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the
American ambassador [to the European Union]," he
said. 

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese
and French governments of hacking into their
communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets. 

The European parliament's computer network links
more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and
other staff to each other, and to the European
commission headquarters in Brussels and the council
of ministers. 

Traffic across the network by telephone and
computers includes details of the private medical
and financial records of many MEPs and officials,
and discussion documents on confidential issues,
including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The
records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE
and fraud are also stored on the system. 

European parliament sources say the Americans
accessed the network by compromising the
information exchanges that link the parliament's
internal networks with the Internet and external
users. 

The devices, called "routers", filter entry to the
European parliament's network. It is understood the
Americans were able to obtain access to what is
called the simple network management protocol
(SNMP), the language that enables the networks to
talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact
that parts of the system were manufactured by two
American firms. 

The breach came to light when officials believed
that American negotiators had been given advance
warning of confidential European Union positions
in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established
that the system had been penetrated just days before
the talks," an EU source said. "Our principal
concern is not to establish what has already been
copied but to ensure that it does not happen again.
This is an on-going problem." 

A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of
data processing at the commission, confirmed that
allegations of hacking had been investigated.
However, she said she was unable to provide any
details.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense authorization appropriations bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of 
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.
                  
   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

This is the truly astonishing thing to me about terrorism in America. If,
at least for the sake of argument, the goal of terrorism in America is to
weaken the country through such attacks, it's phenomenally stupid to hand
terrorists a victory on a silver platter by gutting our Constitution as our
response.

Why bother to bring down the American government when the American
government can do a pretty good job of peeling way the nation's alleged
principles all on it own in the name of political brownie points?

           O'REILLY ANNOUNCES "NETACTIVISM" GUIDE TO
           USING THE INTERNET IN GRASSROOTS POLITICS
  Veteran Grassroots Activist Shares the Secrets of Online Success

SEBASTOPOL, CA--It's no secret that the American citizen is fed up with
politics as usual. Fewer people are voting in every election, and those
who do vote aren't sure it matters. During this presidential primary
season, noted Internet publisher O'Reilly & Associates is releasing in
"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet," a book that will show
ordinary people who want to reclaim politics--from the neighborhood to
the national level--how to use the power of the Internet to make a
difference.

Written by veteran political activist and former Philadelphia city
councilman Ed Schwartz, "NetActivism" is a no-hype guide that shows
readers how to use the Internet to find out what the government really
does, as well as how to organize around a cause or a community with
online tools like electronic mailing lists, online debates, and Web
sites.

A leader in citizen movements for more than 30 years, author Schwartz
embraced the Internet not because it's cool, but because it gets the
job done. He has an extensive online presence: a Web site
(http://libertynet.org/community/phila/natl.html) that serves community
activists across the country, a mailing list that discusses civic
values, and ties to a community network that organizes citizens across
the city of Philadelphia. "NetActivism" features real-world examples
from Schwartz's Institute for Civic Values and a host of other citizen
groups, including the Downtown Minneapolis Residents Association and
Project VoteSmart.

Community activists, politicians--and any concerned citizens who care
about their community--will find "NetActivism" packed with advice on
conducting online research, getting the right equipment and software,
using online networks in local communities, and crafting political
campaigns on the Net.

"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet" will be released on
September 24. Produced by O'Reilly affiliate Songlione Studios for
O'Reilly's Songline Guide imprint, "NetActivism" includes a CD-ROM with
Internet software and limited free online time.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ed Schwartz, founder and president of the Institute for the Study of
Civic Values, has been a national leader in movements to revitalize
neighborhoods and expand citizen participation in government for more
than 25 years.  In the 1970s, he built a city-wide coalition of
community organizations that led to his upset election to the
Philadelphia City Council as a councilman-at-large in 1984. Between
1987 and 1992, he served as director of Philadelphia's Office of
Housing and Community Development, overseeing the rehabilitation of
more than 4,000 houses and apartments for low-income residents of the
City. In 1992, he returned to the Institute for the Study of Civic
Values full-time to develop new models for community planning and
citizen empowerment for the 1990's.

Dr. Schwartz, who received his Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers
University, has written widely on problems related to civic
participation, neighborhood development, and America's democratic
heritage. His first book, "Will the Revolution Succeed?" has been
followed by articles and reviews in The New York Times Book Review, The
Nation, The American Prospect, Shelterforce, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
and The Philadelphia Daily News. The work of the Institute for the
Study of Civic Values itself is profiled extensively in Robert Bellah's
award-winning book, "Habits of the Heart."

Bryan,

I've taken the liberty of forwarding your note, along with my prepended
comments, to the fight-censorship mailing list.

I confess I'm not sure what recourse you have now that GeoCities has killed
your web site's graphics. Their current policy says that "nudity or
pornographic material of any kind" is verboten. Do you have the URLs to
other nude sites that remain on GeoCities?

At http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homeguide.html, I found:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a summary of things that are not permitted as part of
the GeoCities free Personal Home Page Program:

1.Material that is grossly offensive to the Web community including
blatant expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity

2.Pages that promote or provide instructional information about illegal
activities

3.Pages that promote physical harm or injury against any group or
individual

4.The use of free Personal Home Pages for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the following:

Soliciting for advertisers or sponsors

Displaying a sponsorship banner of any kind, including those that are
generated by "banner exchange" services

Displaying banners for services that provide cash or cash-equivalent
prizes to users in exchange for hyperlinks to their web site.

Conducting raffles or contests that require any type of entry fee

5.Pages that contain nudity or pornographic material of any kind

6.Pages that exploit images of children under 18 years of age

7.Restricted or Password-only access pages

8.Hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible
page)

9.Use of the page (or directory) as storage for remote loading

10.Use of the page as a door or signpost to another server

11.Use of copyrighted material without the prior permission from the
author
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.

Does anyone else have any insights?

Subject: censorship at www.geocities.com

Over a month ago I responded to a soliciation for a free personal home page
from www.geocities.com (which is advertised on their home page). They are
promoting theme-based neighborhoods for the home pages. The only content
guidelines were that nothing injurious to any person or group is permitted.
Based on those guidlelines, I felt the server a safe place to display my art
work and I placed my drawings of male nudes on an available address in
GeoCities' WestHollywood neighborhood. I have noticed other sites on
GeoCities with an equal amount of nudity. The only difference was my site
displayed the blue ribbon online freedom icon with a link to the EFF site.

Well, 30 days  and 10,000 hits to my site later (I heavily promoted my site
with listings in many art related directories), I awakened one morning to a
barage of e-mail from people informing me my site had been stripped of all
its graphics--everything from the blue ribbon icon to my nude art work, only
part of which contained male frontal nudity, to the photo of myself
fully-clothed. Later I was to receive an impersonal e-mail notification from
 GeoCities informing me that I was violating their content guidelines which
they now claim prohibit nudity (which I did not find in their posted
guidelines all the while other nude sites remain on GeoCities).

I am very distressed that after all my work and sincere efforts to produce a
tasteful site (which I received many e-mail compliments on wordwide),  I
would have it stripped bare in Nazi style of all the graphics, the essence of
my artistic energy.

Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
of expression in art and lifestyles.

Usually, tracking international net-censorship efforts is depressing.
However, this UPI report on the pissing match between N. Korea and S. Korea
made me laugh aloud. The North Koreans are posturing brilliantly -- truly
trying to force Seoul's hand, and using the Net to do it.

        TOKYO, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea's official news agency blasted
South Korea Tuesday for allegedly blocking its citizens' access to a new
Internet page sponsored by Pyongyang, a report monitored in Tokyo said.
        ``What they (Seoul) should block is not the North Korean Page but the
U.S. channel dealing with methods of murder and robbery and pornographic
scenes too shameful to watch,'' the Korean Central News Agency dispatch
said.
        The KCNA report quoted researcher Kim Hyong-sok of the Information
and Culture Center of North Korea as saying the history of the Internet
has seen no example of people being punished for monitoring certain
sites.
        ``Such punishment would cause bitter condemnation from the
international community,'' said Kim.
        Bristling with slogans about the ``great leader comrade Kim Il-sung,''
the Internet page has upset South Korean leaders, said KCNA, to the
point of having access to the site banned.
        ``The puppet Agency for National Security Planning and Prosecution
officially asked the Internet service organ in South Korea to block the
channel,'' said the KCNA report.
        The North Korean mouthpiece said the officials in Seoul should not
``trouble themselves'' because they do not have the equipment to block
the Internet page anyway.

[So Malaysia will censor only material that some government bureaucrat
finds "offensive?" What a commitment to free speech! Cynically, Declan]


         KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Reuter) - Malaysia on Thursday
unveils plans for a ``multimedia super corridor'' (MSC), which it
hopes will attract a new breed of foreign investors and propel
the country into the 21st century.

[...]

         [Proj director] Azzman said Malaysia would guarantee the
free flow of information. Sceptics have questioned that commitment in
a country where newspapers are licensed and the Printing and
Publications Act has been used to muzzle dissent.
         ``We have not censored the Internet, so the free flow of
information is very much the order of the day,'' said Azzman who
is director general of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronic Systems, a government agency that provides sole
access to the Internet in the country.
         ``We won't police what they do as long as it is within the
confines of the company,'' he said, adding companies in the MSC
can receive information from abroad, process it and then
transmit it out of the country without interference.
         The government would act only if illegal or offensive
materials like pornography were distributed within Malaysia.
         Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had agreed to set up a
regional office after meeting Mahathir last month. A ``couple of
dozen'' others have expressed ``keen interest'', Azzman said.
         The corridor would link the new airport and the futuristic
Putrajaya federal capital with the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a
mammoth office highrise project featuring the Petronas Towers,
the world's tallest buildings.

   BEIJING -- When it comes to controlling the Internet, China is
trying to learn from a little neighbor.
   In June, Beijing sent Zeng Jianhui, a top official, to Singapore to
pick up tips on expanding the use of the Internet within strict
limits. Singapore, a critic of unfettered dissent and Western culture,
is trying to become the network's model censor.
   ``China has a lot to learn from Singapore's experience,'' says a
Chinese government official studying Internet restrictions.

[...]

   Worried that the new electronic communications medium is spinning
out of its control and could undermine Communist propaganda, the
Chinese leadership decided in February to put teeth into Internet
regulations and prevent computer-disseminated pornography and
antigovernment material.
   The government is uneasy about cyberspace connections between
overseas democracy activists and Chinese dissidents, which blossomed
during political protests on the streets of Beijing and other major
cities during the spring of 1989. The few Chinese activists who are
not imprisoned or under detention are closely watched amid a
government crackdown on crime and political unrest.

[...]

   ``This is not having any negative effect on the Internet's
development in China,'' says Wang Jun, an official in the
telecommunications ministry's data communication bureau. ``It's just a
precautionary procedure.''

[...]

   In May, China launched a nationwide computer network that allows
only limited access to the Internet. The venture aims to avoid
breaking China's censorship laws by creating its own content and
making available only information useful for businesses.
   The new edited network, which is 60 percent owned by the official
New China News Agency and was launched in conjunction with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, does not face a censorship
problem because ``there is nothing illegal on the network,'' says
Joyce Wong, an executive with the Hong Kong-based China Internet Corp.

CSIS Calls Itself Canadas Political Police & States ARA Torched
Zundels House

Since the outrageously biased Heritage Front Affair Report published by
the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), a group of appointed
political has-beens and bagmen, we have had serious concerns that
Canadas security apparatus is utterly out of control and is spying
wholesale and contrary to the CSIS Act on legitimatre, non-violent
dissent. Some very disturbing confirmation of our fears has recently
come our way.

In February of this year, Kitchener, Ontario electronics businessman
Michael Rothe  was interviewed by two CSIS agents, who identified
themselves to him as such and showed ID. They were identified as Peter
and Angela. Rothe had organized several meetings in Kitchener for
British historian David Irving, who has since, under pressure from the
censorship lobby been banned from Canada, while planeloads of Tamil
terrorists and Jamican drug pushers and gunsels seem to have open access
to this country. The interview was taped. The revelations on thios tape
are staggering.

ANGELA: Have you heard of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
PETER: You can bet its real!.... Ill explain what we are. First, the
Canadian Security Intelligence service is like the BFK in Germany.
These are the dreaded so-called Federal  Constitution Protection  Police
(Bundesverfassungsschutz), which spy on the German right and are
blatantly a political police force. Just in case the frightened German
immigrant didnt get the point, Peter added: Were the political
police. Angela and I are from the counter-terrorism branch. ... We are
interested in the Heritage Front. He was then asked a number of
questions as to how he got involved in politics, how hed been contacted
by the Hereitage Front andf what he thought of this group, which CSIS,
through its agent Grant Bristow had helped fund and lead!
PETER: Did you ever meet Paul Fromm. Hes C-FAR and CAFE. The school
teacher from Mississauga. He would have been at the this David Irving
[meeting]. False!!!. Fromm was actually in Vancouver that day.
PETER: In Toronto, Wolfgang [Droege of the Heritage Front] has beren
much troubled by a group that calls itself Anti-Racist Action, ARA. This
is a collection of anarchists, Trotskyists, Stalinists.
ANGELA: The ARA that Peter described firebombed Ernst Zundel. Im sure
youve heard about the problem various leaders of the so-called right
wing have received firebombs. Shes apparently referring to the May 7,
1995 arson attack on Ernst Zundels Toronto residence/office, and
firebombings of Don Andrews and Nicola Polinuk.
PETER: So, were interested to know, ... were there ever  threats made
to you? That ought to put the fear of the Lord into him,

So, here we have CSISs descriptin of themselves as a political
police. Frightening! Then. theres the clear assertion that the
perpetratrors of the fire at Zundels and the firebombings in spring,
1995, were the ARA. If so, why havent they been arrested? Are they
being protected by the Canadian security establishment? Readers should
contact Solicitor-General Herb Gray and ask these questions. Ontario
readers should contact Solicitor-General Bob Runciman and ask why, in
light of this information, no charges have been laid by the Metropolitan
Toronto Police in these clearly political acts of terrorism. Had such an
attack been perpetrated on the offices of one the currently privileged
minoiorities, is there any doubt that every rightwinger to the starboard
of Joe Clark would have been hauled in for questioning?

______________________________________________________________________
SUMMARY

On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.

This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.

* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.

* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.

* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.

______________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND

This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.

Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.

In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.

Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.

Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export.
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography.
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.

What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.

2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this
   release for contact information for several such organisations.

3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:

&gt; What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
&gt; to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else have any insights?

I have a friend whose site containing nudity was treated in a very
similar way:  Wendy.

	http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4750

She had some beautifully tasteful partial nudes of herself on her
page; I would consider them erotic, not pornographic.  Unlike 
thie site in question here, I'd say that the main intent was to
show viewers a good time; there was essentially no content other
than the pictures.

When the hit counter went through the roof, they found her site and
apparently warned her a couple of times about its content not being
acceptable.  But she also played a mean trick on another Internet
user, which probably also contributed to her deletion.  It was apparently
some sort of revenge thing; I'm not sure who's right and who's wrong.
In my communications with her, I considered her a rather sweet lady
but not too frightfully verbal.  She certainly talked quite clearly
with her pictures, which revealed a stunningly perfect body.

I helped organize a brief protest campaign to Geocities which apparently
resulted in the reinstatement of her page, sans a few of the "best"
pictures.  And there, as far as I know, it remains.

The lesson from this would seem to be that you can probably get
Geocities to bend if you have enough friends.  (I probably don't
need to tell any of you here that being a gorgeous 25 year old girl
who loves to show off her body is one great way of acquiring
instant friends &lt;grin&gt;).

I hope this helps!

Best
D

&gt;Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
&gt;space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
&gt;sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
&gt;"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
&gt;of expression in art and lifestyles.

As a free service, Geocities has the right to determine which pages it
decides to sponsor.  This is not a good incident to espouse free speech
principles.

Two prime examples of site with PHOTOS  containng male frontal nudity on
GeoCities are:

Rob's Bound & Gagged
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3100

contains graphic photos of sadomaochism showing male genetalia

Nude Celebrities
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3102

My site only contained abstract pencil drawings with no sexual activity
portrayed.

There are dozens of sites containing nudity on GeoCities and obviously
something else is going on here.

Certainly, GeoCities has the right to determine which pages it decides to
sponsor. It may even have the right to offer the pages on on basis and then
pull them off under a new set of rules, after the page creator has invested
time in making them and publicizing their location. (I have the impression
from the initial message that this is what happened - can someone who knows
clarify this point?)

However, that does not mean they're not slimy for causing this kind of
unnecessary inconvenience, and it doesn't mean they shouldn't be called on
their acts and others who might be considering dealing with them alerted to
the possibility of a problem.

I personally would like to hear from GeoCities on why they chose to pull
the pages off. Did their policy change at any point, and if so, why did
they change it?

Um... and what would that be? Please go on. Obviously there is some
conspiracy forcing you to pay $7.50/month or so for unrestricted web
service, rather than getting it for free, but which conspiracy?

Yes, but it's not necessarily something sinister.  From the evidence
I've seen GeoCities is just responding to the "squeaky wheels."  When
a page gets a pile of hits they check it out.  I'm not especially
impressed with the actions they're taking, but I doubt there's any
plot to stifle free thinking on the net.

Get this one.  I just heard it on the afternoon news.  Two young boys were
seriously burned after a failed attempt at making napalm on their kitchen
stove.  Sounds like the normal fun activities of bored youth on summer break
right?  But hey - where did they get the recipe?  From the Anarchists
Cookbook in the library?  No - they got it from -- GASP -- the Anarchists
Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
-- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
sort of convention) are deciding whether or not to press charges.  See -
just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the

comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

     The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military
     technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which
     encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet,
     is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control.
     The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by
     defining "export" to include discussing technical information about
     non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students
     registered for Professor Junger's course.

     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

     Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on
     the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans
     to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this
     fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach,
     and to whom.

     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Folks, I apologize for the mail problems. I still haven't quite figured 
out exactly what happened -- I'm not at home, but in NYC on business, so 
I wasn't able to log on this evening until now.

Seems as though the problem happened when I forwarded a fight-censorship
message to cypherpunks, which has among its subscribers a nonexistent
address at axcess.net.in. For some reason, a poorly-configured machine at
axcess.net.in started repeatedly resending the forwarded message back to
fight-censorship. Odd. I think I've blocked it from doing it again. 

I blame the problem on AOL, of course.

On a topic more germane to the list, I was in Times Square with Glenn and
some NYC webperns this evening, having dinner in a delightful greasy
burger joint. For no apparent reason, a woman sitting next to me started
to describe, in painstaking detail, how to kill someone with a hatpin. (A
jab to the nerve center in the solar plexus, if you must know.)

I started to think to myself, especially after Dara's note earlier, that 
this kind of material should be banned! Censor biology texts on the Net!

Yours in protecting children from dangerous knowledge,

Declan

Subject: Washington Post letter by Sen. Burns

     Sen. Burns' letter to The Washington Post today contained something of 
     an error, in case you couldn't tell.
     
     A line from the original letter was deleted.
     
     The line that read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights" 
     should instead read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of current wiretapping authority, it is a drastic expansion. 
     it lays the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights."
     
     Fortunately, the overall meaning of the letter is left largely intact.


[Attached is Burns' letter. --Declan]
   


                      `SPEAKING IN CODE ON THE INTERNET'
   
   Friday, August 9 1996; Page A16
   The Washington Post
   
   
   The Post's editorial July 27 on my Pro-CODE bill to ease restrictions
   on encoded, or "encrypted," computer messages ["Speaking in Code on
   the Internet"] was generally balanced but deleted a couple of key
   points.
   
   First, my bill would not "lift" restrictions on the export of strong
   encryption technology, which is designed to allow people to protect
   their computer files and messages. Instead, it would allow the
   Commerce Department merely to ease export restrictions to a level of
   computer security that it deems is "generally available" in the
   nations we trade with.
   
   This bill does not open the floodgates. Instead, it is an
   acknowledgment of the real world and that high-tech U.S. companies
   must be allowed to compete in an increasingly vital sector of the
   world economy. One trade group stated the United States stands to lose
   $60 billion in market share and 216,000 jobs under the current
   restrictions.
   
   Second, the administration's proposal to seek a copy of decoder "keys"
   for our electronic information is not simply an extension of the
   groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights. Imagine a Craig
   Livingstone or an Aldrich Ames being designated the "trusted third
   party" who holds the keys.
   
   Supporters of my bill have never maintained that some criminals will
   not attempt to use encryption to evade law enforcement. But the bill
   is an attempt to address the encryption status quo, not some long-ago
   world to which the FBI would like to return. (FBI Director Louis Freeh
   stated in the hearing July 25 that he would even like to restrict
   encryption imports.)
   
   While the White House indicates it might be willing to give people
   stronger encryption, it insists that the trade-off must be a copy of
   our decoder keys. It's a deal Americans will never accept and a plan
   that has yet to be proven feasible.
   
   Denying millions of law-abiding people the use of a legitimate and
   increasingly necessary security product for "law enforcement" reasons
   is like banning deadbolt locks because they make it a little harder to
   kick down the doors of a few drug dealers.

Excuse me?  Last I heard, Feinstein (who wouldn't be caught dead in SD this
week&gt;, was sponsoring the worst censorship bill currently in Congress.  
And, lest we forget, Sen. Exon was (and is) a Democrat.  Sure, there are 
censors in the Republican Party (can you say Christian Coalition?), but 
that's a rather wide brush you're painting the Republicans with.  On the 
net, party lines don't quite fit.  As I think we've discussed here and 
elsewhere, it's net.experience that is the divider.

&gt; &gt; just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the

No truer words were ever spoken &lt;g&gt;, speaking as one of the corrupted 
myself... :)

&gt;         But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
&gt; you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?)
Uhhhh... no.  The last time I went to Computer City, I didn't have to 
have a criminal background check or wait five days.  Actually, in VA, we 
don't have to wait 5 days, but that doesn't matter.  Back-of-the-truck 
sales, like you must be referring to, are illegal anyway, and if the 
police would enforce current laws, we might not have to worry about that.

&gt; therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
&gt; weapon every year...
More like &lt;maximum&gt; a few thousand over several years.  Remember, there 
are a hell of a lot more accidental car deaths than accidental gun 
deaths, though.  There's your few dozen thousand.

&gt;         ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
&gt; Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
&gt; extrapolation) dangerous?
Good point.  Guns, though, in a way like computers, require a 
mis-intentioned person to become dangerous.  Computers aren't designed to 
put holes in people or things (as Kurt Vonnegut would say).  In both 
cases, though, an unreasonable person has to make an irrational decision 
in order to cause harm.

Purchasing an AK47 is illegal in several states, and in those which do
allow machine gun ownership by citizens, you must receive an OK from
local law enforcement and obtain a BATF special permit.  

Modems do not require local law enforcement sign offs...yet.

   JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) -- President Clinton on Saturday
   accused the Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts to fight terrorism
   by kowtowing to the gun lobby.
   
   In his weekly radio address from Jackson, where the president and his family
   are vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had stripped his anti-terrorism
   bill of valuable tools "that law enforcement needs to help them find out,
   track down and shut down terrorists."
   
   The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
   anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and marking
   explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to the dealer who
   sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill and the assault weapons
   ban.

[...]
   
   Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti- terrorism
   legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and explosive taggant
   issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism bill of its own that
   excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not vote on the measure before
   adjourning for its August recess.
   
   The Republicans, the president said, were listening to "the gun lobby over
   law enforcement."
   
   "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
   country and the safety of our people," he said.

After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?

   By VIVIENNE WALT 
   THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
   
   At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
   Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.
   
   Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship from
   his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a white
   supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service provider, the
   teenager posted the site's entire contents in a compressed "mirror" file...
   
   Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a task
   force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech -- something the
   Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe, has laws against.

[...]
   
   One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
   virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) pushed his
   proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony,
   punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
   
   "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
   of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
   the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
   how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
   can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

[...]
   
   In a last-minute maneuver on Aug. 2, House members dropped the Internet
   controls and wiretapping provisions from their Anti-Terrorism Act, approved
   it by 389-22, and went home for the rest of the summer, leaving the Senate
   in a quandary about what to do after Labor Day. "We just couldn't come up
   with a bipartisan bill," says Sen. Feinstein's press secretary Susan
   Kennedy.
   
   Like Washington, Paris empties out in August for la vacance. But on Sept.
   26, the fight picks up in the French capital at a top-level meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   
   Justice Department officials, and 'Net activists, are set to travel to Paris
   to argue about key escrow...

   "This is an example of the Justice Department trying to dictate foreign
   policy," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center in Washington, who sits on the OECD's advisory panel on encryption.

[...]
   
   "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
   subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
   Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
   of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
   the Web.
   
   Rabbi Cooper and others have lobbied Internet providers to expel the
   extremist sites. "Will they eventually find somewhere else? Probably. But
   that still makes it a worthwhile thing to do," he says.

The face of net-activism is changing. I'm writing this from a science
fiction writers' and editors' party in upstate New York, where we've been
talking about net-politics and online communities.

The fronts we face now are three: national, state, and international. 
We've fought the national fight in the CDA, Clipper, and recent crypto and
terrorist debates. It's been where most of our efforts have focused. 

State politics lags behind that of Capitol Hill. State legislators are
starting to try to ram through bills similar to the CDA -- and, worse yet,
ones that are substantially different. We've discussed some on
fight-censorship.

The ACLU is the only cyber-liberties group tracking them. Yesterday I
stopped by Ann Beeson's office in Manhattan to talk about the Georgia bill
and other laws the group is planning to challenge. 

(Congratulations are in order. No longer a temporary ACLU fellow, Ann is
now a full-time staff attorney in the national office. It's a
well-deserved promotion!)

Then I walked across Bryant Park to the headquarters of Human Rights
Watch, an international civil rights group. They don't have a substantial
online presence now, but they did publish a fabulous global
net-restrictions report ("Silencing the Net") this spring -- and they have
what the Net needs right now: expertise in dealing with international
groups like G-7 and an extensive network of affiliates around the world. 
They seemed interested in doing more online work, which is wonderful. 

Afterwards Charles Platt and Ann, Glenn and their SOs and I went to dinner
at Sam's Noodle Shop on 29th and chatted about our CDA lawsuit and the
human genome project. 

The two aren't necessarily related, unless you count discerning what
congenital defects DoJ attorney Jason "The Weasel" Baron has. Yes, I'm
hardly unbiased. Anyone who threatens to have me arrested for interviewing
government witnesses is a splendid example of a censorhappy Fed
bureaucrat. As a side note, the weasel has been showing up to more and
more DC cyber-regulation events, like the Freedom Forum's panel on crypto
and censorship, and the FTC's panel on net-regulation and privacy. (Wonder
what he's up to?)

So the growing net-involvement of ACLU and HRW is just in time. They have
the well-established state and international affiliates, respectively,
that other groups lack. Hopefully, the affiliates can forward reports
uphill to the parent groups and help in fighting laws and policies locally. 

We need all the help and international expertise we can get -- as we've
seen recently at the Paris summit, governments have this annoying,
persistent habit of working backroom deals. The G-7 resolution (also
endorsed by Russia) said: 

  We call on all States to:

  6. note the risk of terrorist using electronic or wire communications
       systems and networks to carry out criminal acts and the need to
       find means, consistent with national law, to prevent such
       criminality.

  11. accelerate consultation, in appropriate bilateral or multilateral fora,
       on the use of encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
       government access to data and communications in order, inter alia,
       to prevent or investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the
       privacy of legitimate communications.

I've been putting whatever international information I come across at

Congress may be in recess, but Bill Clinton is still dreaming of expanded
FBI wiretap authority.  In this week's radio address, Clinton sought to
paint the GOP into a corner by depicting the opponents of his
"anti-terrorism" plan as "gun nuts."

Expect the White House to continue beating this drum throughout September.

      Clinton: GOP Listening To 'Gun
      Lobby Over Law Enforcement'

      JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) --
      President Clinton on Saturday accused the
      Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts
      to fight terrorism by kowtowing to the gun
      lobby.

      In his weekly radio address from Jackson,
      where the president and his family are
      vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had
      stripped his anti-terrorism bill of valuable tools "that law
      enforcement needs to help them find out, track down and shut down
      terrorists."

      The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
      anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and
      marking explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to
      the dealer who sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill
      and the assault weapons ban.

      [ ... ]

      Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti-
      terrorism legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and
      explosive taggant issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism
      bill of its own that excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not
      vote on the measure before adjourning for its August recess.

      [ ... ]

      "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
      country and the safety of our people," he said.

      The United States, he said, is not immune to terrorism, citing the
      Oklahoma City bombing and last month's bombing in Centennial
      Olympic Park in Atlanta as "brutal evidence."

Um, well, except that
- there are serious safety questions concerning adding taggants to black
and smokeless powder
- a taggant provision is of dubious utility in catching terrorist bombers,
since black powder is not difficult to make (and presumably anyone serious
about planting pipe bombs and not getting caught would take this small
additional step for self-protection)
- it's hard to see how taggants would help LE track powder anyway, since
powder from a given manufacturing lot can be and commonly is shipped to
dealers all over the country.

I do think the issues are separable, and the wiretapping provisions are
obviously of considerably greater relevance to this list (and to
free-speech activism) than the taggant nonsense is. But I wanted to correct
the misapprehension; as we know from bitter experience with the CDA,
getting non-facts accepted as conventional wisdom is one of the first steps
in promulgating bad laws and in demonizing those who oppose them.

&gt;    Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.

I believe this is false. As far as I know, no one has objected, other than
by calling him naive. Frank is on vacation and off the net until early
September, so I imagine the WSJ was unable to reach him for this story. 
People reacted to his action the same way they did to our Zundelsite mirrors
- -- despite the fact that Zundel is just a harmless neo-Nazi propagandist,
while Lemire is a bit more... activist. For *his* side of the story, see
http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html

&gt;    Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship
&gt;    from his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a
&gt;    white supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service
&gt;    provider,

This is false. He heard that they were being protested. Lemire has not been
kicked off. His site remains at http://www.ftcnet.com/~freedom, and the site
that the SWC-Canada was far more concerned about, www.ftcnet.com/~skinhds,
is still online, too. Oddly, none of the stores in the US press even mention
the skinheads site. The initial reports in the Canadian press didn't even
mention Lemire, because it really wasn't about him.

Funny... the Skinheads site admits that they won and will not be censored. 
Take a look at http://alpha.ftcnet.com/~skinhds/ -- "Well my site has
weathered the storm of controversy and is still afloat.  Despite the best
efforts of some of the enemies of free speech my service provider did not
capitulate."

I wonder how long Lemire plans to milk the publicity. Maybe trolling the
Wall Street Journal was enough.

&gt;    the teenager posted the site's entire contents in a
&gt;    compressed "mirror" file... 

This is false. Lemire created and posted the archive, soliciting mirror
sites. The first one online was www.alpha.org, but they've been having
technical problems, so Frank's was announced first. Frank's web page simply
links to Lemire's archive on ftcnet.com. Frank did not compile and is not
distributing the site's entire contents. 

&gt;    Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a
&gt;    task force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech --
&gt;    something the Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe,
&gt;    has laws against. 

This is highly misleading; I assume it was taken from either Declan's
article or Lemire's press release, as it shows a lack of understanding of
the political and legal situation in Canada.

I don't suppose the WSJ will admit that they were trolled? Frank has, but I
know that Declan won't. In fact, if it weren't for this sentence and the
fact that I'm Bcc'ing it to Vivian, I doubt Declan would allow this message
to hit fight-censorship at all.

&gt;    "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
&gt;    of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
&gt;    the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
&gt;    how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
&gt;    can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

...and thanks to Biden, that recipe is now available through thomas.loc.gov.
What a moron.

&gt;    "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
&gt;    subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
&gt;    Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
&gt;    of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
&gt;    the Web.

No, Cyberwatch does no such thing. It just moans about it, giving no
specific examples. They don't even acknowledge the existence of other
organizations with policies that are both more effective and more respective
of freedom of speech, such as the Anti-Defamation League (which is larger
and older than the Wiesenthal Center, but strangely absent from press
reports of "jewish reaction to hate on the net") and Nizkor (which has far
more experience than either, but isn't jewish).

Subject: Column, Aug. 7


    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED Aug. 7, 1996
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Reading our mail

    Only in a nation already enormously out of touch with its founding
principle - that individual citizens and businesses have the right to do
just about any peaceful thing, while it's the powers of (start
ital)government(end ital) that are sharply restricted - could Congress find
itself debating whether to "allow" American computer firms to maintain
their lead in the multi-million-dollar overseas market for software
encryption.

  In plainer language, outfits like Netscape Communications and Tandem
Computers want "permission" to sell overseas programs like Pretty Good
Privacy - to which savvy American netsters now have free access - programs
which allow private e-mail messages and files to be encoded so government
snoops can't read them.

  The Clinton administration proposes that such exports be allowed only if
a decoding "key" is entrusted to a third party - such as a bank or
insurance company - which would then be subject to a court order or
subpoena should law enforcement personnel wish to break the code and
secretly read this electronic "mail."

  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in favor of such restrictions July 25,
arguing that "Uncontrolled export of U.S. computer codes may help
international criminals and terrorists hide their activities from law
enforcement."

  Well, yes, they probably do. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in New York on
charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners, used a laptop computer
containing files the FBI still hasn't been able to decode.
  But note the past tense. Terrorists have already got this stuff. Anything
in the possession of an American teenager can be (likely has been) uploaded
onto the Internet, and then downloaded without anyone being the wiser in
Baghdad, Tripoli, or Tangiers.

  The real goal here is to control the ability of American citizens to
communicate with one another without government snoops reading over their
shoulders. When Director Freeh warns that "Encryption products used
unchecked by criminals and terrorists for their illegal activities pose an
extremely serious threat," it's worth remembering that federal agencies
have, in recent years, used the terms "criminal" and "terrorist" to
describe peaceful worshippers and their children at the Branch Davidian
Church in Waco, MOVE activists in Philadelphia, an unarmed Idaho mother
with a nursing baby in her arms, and any number of perhaps misguided but
far-from-violent tax protesters, home schoolers, barter exchange operators,
and practitioners of alternative medicine, to name just a few.

  Once the possessor of such stuff can be arrested and jailed for years on
charges of "exporting a munition" for the mere act of posting the
mathematical formula on the Internet, does it make sense to pretend
Americans will still be free to use such encryption domestically?
  Those who favor an authoritarian, hierarchical society have grown
accustomed to the fact that the political opinions available to most
American government-school graduates have long been "filtered" through the
news desks of a few television networks and major wire services. The
unregulated, spontaneous nature of Internet communications frightens such
souls with dark nightmares of anarchy, the same way King George hated the
colonial "Committees of Correspondence."

  As Stephen Chapman of the Chicago Tribune pointed out in his nationally
syndicated column June 19, "We can be grateful that ink and paper didn't
make their first appearance the day before yesterday . Otherwise, Congress
and the president would be scrambling frantically to make sure that these
communication tools would not be used for purposes unapproved by the
government."

  If the idea of a government service delivering letters between private
citizens were being introduced today, wouldn't Director Freeh similarly
argue against the "extremely serious threat" that criminals and terrorists
might use this new "mail" system to keep their secrets, should the
government allow the use of glue-flapped "envelopes"?
  But wait, you say: The secret "keys" would only be available upon
issuance of a "court order."

  And this guarantee would be enforced, I presume, by the same courts that
today regularly excuse the short-circuiting of any and all such existing
safeguards so long as the federals assert a "compelling government
interest" in hunting drug dealers, nabbing  "money-launderers," or whatever
dastardly new crime of the week they care to allege?

  It's understandable that repressive regimes like China are pulling out
every stop to register and track private users of the Internet. When
legislators show similar instincts in what was once the "Land of the Free,"
it's their own premises which they ... and we ... should re-examine.

U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the
proposed action as ineffective:  "This is not a solution, it is just hiding
the problem."  (Financial Times 10 Aug 96)

        It was hard to wake up, that morning. The pillow to the right
of her was bewildered at its own unaccustomed chill. She had gathered
all the blankets around herself and no one had been there to pull them
back; this more than anything reminded her of her aloneness and she
very nearly turned back onto her side to weep herself to sleep.

I'm not sure this is the most effective or noticeable action, but what 
the heck.  Personally, I'd advocate doing whatever you think is most 
useful, just do it on the 31st, and let local media know with a short fax 
soon that Aug. 31 is Internet Censorship Protest Day.  If you've been of 
a mind to organize a rally, make it snappy. No better time.  I don't 
think this short alert has gone out very far yet.

Got a note this morning from a U.K. journalist who spoke with PSInet:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversation this am with a leading light at a large ISP here (subsidiary
of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and
essentially said, either you do something about it, or we'll do something
about it.  The guy said they'd pulled the groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups were "pedophile" areas. But the
FT report talks about Scotland Yard pressuring Internet providers to block
"hard-core pornography."

&gt; &gt;CYBERGANGS
&gt; &gt;The head of the gang task force for the Arizona Department of Public Safety
&gt; &gt;reports that a Web site established in Detroit offers a how-to guide for
&gt; &gt;gangster wannabes and is urging gang members everywhere to unite under its
&gt; &gt;umbrella to form the first cyberspace gang.  The official says:  "Now it's
&gt; &gt;in your home, your living room, your den... Unfortunately, these guys can
&gt; &gt;talk about anything they want and there's nothing law enforcement can do
&gt; &gt;about it."  (Atlanta Journal-Constitution 8 Aug 96 F3)

A meme on the rise: like cyberporn, "cybergangs" can reach into your living
room and corrupt Junior. Perhaps grandstanding politicans may use
"cybergangs" as a pretext for a crackdown -- not a war on drugs, but a War
on the Net?

&gt; who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;
&gt; Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups are "pedophile" areas. But the
&gt; FT report paints the situation much more broadly -- Internet providers are
&gt; blocking "pornography."

Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child
pornographic newsgroups. I have side accounts at 3 major ISPs that all
have as close to a full newsfeed as is physically possible, I think.
They all have almost an identical roster of available newsgroups (other
than local ones of course, very few of which anywhere are pornographic in
nature.)  Out of those, only the following newsgroups would appear to
qualify at first blush:

alt.sex.pedophilia
alt.sex.pedophilia.boys
alt.sex.pedophilia.girls
alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.sex.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.d
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.sex.pre-teens
alt.sex.teens
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

[I admit the possibility of missing a keyword. I did a search for
"child", "kid", "teen", "lolita", "young", "youth" and "pedo". There
might be, say, a "nambla" match, now that I think about it, but obscure
keywords like that are unlikely to find enough newsgroups to strongly
affect the outcome of this quick examination.]

Of these, many can be immediately eliminated, as they are discussion
groups, not binaries group, or are typos ("binaires") and ergo not carried
by 99% or so of usenet (though available on a few sites like the WELL where
the admins allow the automatic availability of every newsgroup known to
the system, even ones created just to create a stupid-named newsgroup
with no intention that it will ever be used.)

This leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

Now, of these all the "young" and "teen" groups have to be eliminated,
since "young" is to vague to mean anything more specific that "younger
than middle aged", and teen can refer to 18 or 19 (or even younger legal
ages, if the UK is like Australia and sets age of consent at 16 instead
of US & Canada's 18).  If you actually look in these groups there appears
to be nothing but flames, blather, and BBS ads, almost none, if any, of
which will be childporn, since that would be a major cop magnet.
Lolita.misc and pedophilia.swaps also have be dropped, as too vague to
clearly indicate child pornographic visual content.  The de. newsgroup is
also probably not carried by many sites outside of Germany. (WELL had it,
but my other ISPs didn't. Probably WELL is trading news with a site in
Germany for some reason - maybe the .de site can't get a decent news
feed? I dunno).

That leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking


Six likely suspect newsgroups for genuine illegal content in the form of
child pornography.  It's highly questionable whether real child porn
shows up on any such newsgroup with any regularity, if at all. Again, the
content seems to consist of flames and blatant BBS ads (though I'm not
dumb enough to actually download the material, since that could count as
"possession" if some of it is really child porn.)  I even recall the
creation of a few of these - they were newgrouped simply to piss people
off with no intention of actually using the newsgroups. They were
instantly rmgrouped, and are unavailable on all sites that honor
"official" alt.config rmgroups, which is probably the vast majority of
news servers.

Much ado about nothing.

Also, none of this even touches the question of whether liability adheres
to providing access to something that happens to contain child porn
simply becuase is *sounds* child pornographic. By this logic, even if is
eventually established that an ISP could not be held liable for child
porn content in general, absent guilty knowledge, an ISP could be held
liable for it if someone posted a message with "child porn" in the
subject line, and it actually did contain child porn, regardless of the
fact that any message by that name is more likely to be a discussion
thread about child porn and the problems it causes, that to be actual
child porn.

The UK cops are making the mistake of assuming that every label is.
first, always accurate, and second, non-ambigious.  That's a very stupid
set of assumptions.

Either way you look at it, this is ridiculous.

Either:

a) the UK police bureucrats have taken all newsgroup names at face
value and have targetted most of the initial long list near the top of this
message, even though most are obviously intended to be discussion areas
and don't carry child porn itself, or

b) they are going after 5 or so newsgroups that are, at least in name,
definitely child pornographic, PLUS a buch of others (the rest of the 20)
like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.male, or whatever, that have nothing at
all, even in name, to do with child porn, as the article Declan quotes
seems to suggest (I think this quite possible, since it's unlikely that
many if any UK hosts have this many pedophillic-sounding newsgroups. Only
the biggest and most bandwidth rich US ISPs carry them all, so the UK
cops probably don't even know about the majority of the newsgroups in the
top, large, list.)

A and B are *both* stupid and indefensible.

The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the
contents of the newgroups in question and worked to locate those posting
any genuine child porn, and prosecute them (with an eye to the fact that
its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

BY FAX: +65-375-7765

Mr. George Yeo
Minister for Information and the Arts
460 Alexandra Road, 37th Story
PSA Building
Singapore 119963

Dear Mr. Yeo,

     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the recent
decision by the Singapore government to establish strict controls on Internet
use. The implementation of the Class License Scheme, which, according to a
July 11 government news release, "will focus on content which may undermine
public morals, political stability and religious harmony,"ensures a leading
role for Singapore among international promoters of online censorship. This is
a particularly unfortunate role for Singapore, which has been a leader in the
development and promotion of Internet use in Asia. It places Singapore in the
same category as countries like China, where Internet users must endure
onerous restrictions.

     One of the most unique and valuable characteristics of the Internet is
its ability to establish easy, inexpensive and practically instantaneous
communication between the farthest points of the earth. By prohibiting
connections between its citizens and various Web sites outside its borders,
Singapore is in essence removing itself from the global Internet. If, as will
surely happen, its example is followed in other countries, the Internet, which
held such promise as the world's first truly global medium, will be nothing
more than a set of country-specific networks where local prejudices and fears
are reinforced by technology.

     Our specific objections concern Singapore's decision to regulate the
Internet as if it were a broadcast medium. Unlike broadcast media, the
Internet is the first truly mass medium. Through e-mail, it allows individuals
with nothing more than a computer and a modem to express their views to an
international audience. Even the World Wide Web differs significantly from a
broadcast medium in that individuals are not confronted with a particular site
upon connecting to the Web--they may choose whichever sites they choose to
visit. As with other forms of Internet communication, anyone may put up his or
her own site on the Web. The Singapore government's own use of Web pages
demonstrates how the Internet can be used to propound a particular point of
view. Its citizens, so long as they are not using their site to incite to
violence, should have the same opportunity to express views as their
government. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights:

     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
     to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
     media and regardless of frontiers.

     We are particularly concerned that restrictions have been placed on
Singaporeans who wish to discuss religious and political ideas online. It is
only through unrestricted discussions of such serious topics by all members of
society, no matter how unpopular their views, that these subjects become less
explosive. Forbidding discussion--in effect, treating its citizens like
children--will, on the other hand, ensure that dangerous topics remain just
that.

     We are also concerned that the extraordinarily broad categories of
forbidden content, as outlined by the SBA, will encourage arbitrary
restrictions on communication. According to the Internet Content Guidelines,
the following topics are banned.

     Public Security and National Defense

          a.   Contents which jeopardize public security or national
               defense.
          b.   Contents which undermine the public confidence in the
               administration of justice.
          c.   Contents which present information or events in such a
               way that alarms or misleads all or any of the public.
          d.   Contents which tend to bring the Government into
               hatred or contempt, or which excite disaffection
               against the Government.

     Racial and Religious Harmony

          a.   Contents which denigrate or satirize any racial or
               religious group.
          b.   Contents which bring any race or religion into hatred
               or resentment.
          c.   Contents which promote religious deviations or occult
               practices such as Satanism.

          Public Morals

          a.        Contents which are pornographic or otherwise obscene.
          b.        Contents which propagate permissiveness or
                    promiscuity.
          c.        Contents which depict or propagate gross exploitation
                    of violence, nudity, sex or horror.
          d.   Contents which depict or propagate sexual perversions
               such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia.

By banning such subjects a chill will be sent through the online community in
Singapore, and will render the Internet essentially useless in allowing any
kind of serious discussion.

     In addition to forbidding particular content, the government has also
announced that some sites will be banned. Internet service providers were
given the deadline of September 14, 1996,  to begin using proxy
servers--devices that can prohibit connections to specified sites--to
connect all their
subscribers.

     Although the government has promised to use a light hand in regulating
the Internet, its activities even at this early stage indicate otherwise. A
July 12 posting in the Usenet newsgroup "soc.culture.singapore" was reportedly
removed at the request of the SBA, who asked local Internet service providers
for its removal because it alleged that lawyers at a local law firm were
incompetent. The request came, according to the Straits Times, after the law
firm complained to the government. Despite the removal from the newsgroup, the
message is still widely available to Singaporeans through other Internet
sources, indicating that content control will be difficult unless Internet
access is restricted even further.

     We hope that the Singapore government will retract these repressive new
regulations, and support the development of an unfettered Internet. Instead of
using its power to restrict Internet use, the government could play a truly
useful role by devising ways to expand its use to even the most disaffected
members of its population.

                                   Sincerely,
                                   Sidney Jones
                                   Executive Director

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

&gt;Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child

&gt;The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the

&gt;That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
&gt;anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

You're forgetting the tortuous British obscenity laws.  For example, it's
illegal to show an erect penis in Britain.  The police are just trying
enforce the censorious powers the government has always given them.

News Release   August 15, 1996 
---------------------------------------------------- 
 
Free Speech 101: ACLU Gives Princeton University an "F"  
for Barring Political Speech on its Network 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             
Wednesday, August 15, 1996 
 
Contact: Ann Beeson, ACLU National (212) 944-9800, x788 
David Rocah, ACLU of New Jersey (201) 642-2084 
 
NEW YORK--In a letter sent today to Princeton University officials,  the
American Civil Liberties Union urged them to reconsider a policy barring
students and staff from using the computer network for "political
purposes."  
   
The letter was sparked by complaints the ACLU national office received over
a recent memo from Princeton officials advising faculty, staff and
students, "especially in this year of a presidential election," that the
school's not-for-profit status barred it from allowing use of the computer
network "for political purposes." 
 
The ACLU called this conclusion mistaken, pointing out in its letter that
the Internal Revenue Code specifies that only the University itself is
barred from political activity -- not faculty, staff, or students acting
independently.  In fact, the ACLU said, the IRS has previously held that
statements in support of political candidates appearing on the editorial
page of a student newspaper would not be considered violations of a
university's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. 
 
"Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network," the ACLU letter
stated, "it is an unjustified content-based restriction on the free
expression rights of students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is
not only unworthy of a great university like Princeton, it is in violation
of the New Jersey State Constitution."  The letter was signed by ACLU
national staff attorney Ann Beeson and David Rocah, staff attorney of the
ACLU of New Jersey. 
   
"We understand the university's concerns regarding it's tax-exempt status,"
Rocah said.  "But this is free speech 101.  Sadly, Princeton is not making
the grade."    
 
Rocah said the ACLU would consider legal action if the university refuses
to drop its censorship policy. 
 
"Traditionally, college campuses are the center of political discussion and
debate," said Beeson.  "The fact that the debate is taking place on the
Internet does not mean that the speech is any less deserving of
protection."  
 
Beeson added that the policy could bar students and staff from a wide range
of protected expression, including downloading position papers from the
Dole or Clinton website; sending e-mail to their parents urging them to
vote for Ralph Nader; and organizing online discussion groups for  student
chapters of politically active groups such as Greenpeace.   In short, Rocah
said, "Everything that would be acceptable, even welcome, off-line, becomes
off-limits on the Internet."  
   
In its letter, the ACLU called on the school to take a leadership role in
the academic community:  "As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a
leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to
promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its
community, to the very limits of the law," the letter said. 
 
Beeson added that the ACLU  is working to develop model guidelines for 
colleges and universities to help sort out the confusion in academia
regarding free expression on the Internet.  Many schools have already put
in place "Appropriate Use Policies" to police student and faculty computer 
use, some of which violate rights of free expression, Beeson said.

Mr. Harold Shapiro 
President                 BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, & REGULAR MAIL 
1 Nassau Hall 
Princeton University 
Princeton NJ 85044 
 
RE: Computer Use Policy 
 
Dear President Shapiro: 
 
In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton
University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ)
to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University
from using the Princeton's computer network for "political purposes."  We
believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding
the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic
freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.

 
Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students
widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet
greatly expanded the resources available for academic research.  It also
provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas.  In
contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for
"political purposes" unjustifiably interferes with the right of the
University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.

 
Princeton's current computer use policy holds that "the Computing and
network resources of the University may not be used by members of the
University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial
gain . . . ."  Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter "Rights," attached
as Appendix A).  On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent
an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use
of the Internet or computer network for "any participation in, or
intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
public office" would result in disciplinary action.  See Office of the
General Counsel, "Internet use and Politics," E-mail of July 19, 1996,
attached as Appendix B. 
 
We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a
concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to
use the computer network for political purposes.  We believe that this
concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal
Revenue Service. 
 
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization
will be tax-exempt as long as it "does not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office."  The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to
constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the
political activity must be that of the University itself and not the
individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students.  See Internal
Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for
1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C.  Thus, any personal
communication by University members over the computer network cannot
threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the
communication takes place does not change this conclusion.  The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether
the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political
activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the
university under Internal Revenue Code  501(c)(3), is whether the
facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for
non-political reasons.  Id. at 427.  Princeton provides fair and equal
access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access,
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes.  See Rights at 11.  Thus, political speech over the
network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with
a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status.  The
Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that
required its students in a certain political science course to participate
in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during
the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the
meaning of Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  See Revenue Ruling 75-512,
1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D. 
 
In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on
the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not
participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political
candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper.  This was
true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities
to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were
clearly those of the students and not of the university itself.  See
Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E. 
 
Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by
allowing University members to use its computer network for political
purposes.  We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for
official positions of the University.  At most, the only permissible
regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the
University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a
reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official
position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the
opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone.
 Compare Rights, "Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the
University and Political Activities," at Section 3. 
 
Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an
unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of
students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of
a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of
the New Jersey Constitution. 
 
Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey
Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been
sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to
honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression.  See State v.
Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against
the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994)
(holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive
use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet).  Princeton's
computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton "campus" as are the
lawns and buildings.  Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its
students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the
Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech
in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus. 
 
Political expression has always received the highest degree of
constitutional protection.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). 
The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship
those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for
political candidates.  Indeed, "where political speech is involved, our
tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion,
the narrowest range for restriction.'"  State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412
(1980).  As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in
American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and
defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to
the very limits of the law. 
 
The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free
speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive
information.  Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (right
to receive information precludes government from labeling certain
publications "propaganda") (Brennan, J., concurring); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) ("right of freedom of speech . . .
includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . .
receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of
thought, and freedom to teach . . . .  Without these peripheral rights the
specific rights would be less secure."); Kreimer v. Bur. of Police for Town
of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1350-55 (3d Cir. 1992) (listing cases).  This
is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the
Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community.  See
ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996).  They
provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access
information on virtually any topic, including politics. 
 
Finally, the computer use policy is in conflict with other University
policies and practices.  Princeton recognizes that 
 
     "the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the
discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching
and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and
learning to society at large.  Free inquiry and free expression within the
academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. 
The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate
conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in
classrooms and lecture halls." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 
With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it
has a fundamental responsibility to ensure 
 
    "the opportunity for all members of the University community to
exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . .  Encouragement of an
interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social
responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal
education.  The University continues to consider self-chosen participation
in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable
part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage.  Such activities
on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to,
imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or
point of view." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Guidelines Relating to Tax Exempt Status." 
 
For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal the existing
ban on use of the computer network for political purposes, and we look
forward to your early reply.

Bomb info OK in books but G-7 wants it off Net

By COLMAN JONES

While the fury over child porn on the net appears to be losing steam
after the defeat of the Communications Decency Act in June, there's a a
growing new cyber-backlash against terrorists.  

At a meeting in Paris last month, just before the downing of TWA flight
800 and the bombing in Atlanta, Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers
and security ministers struck an agreement to target terrorists using
the internet.  

The pact calls for international controls on the net to cut off access
to sites containing "dangerous" information, restrict electronic speech
by unpopular political organizations and allow governments to decode
privately encrypted communications.

The Paris meeting ended with a commitment to have reports ready by the
end of the year on ways of instituting such restrictions.

[...]

Bomb info

Many press accounts fume about bomb-making information available
online, without mentioning that the "offensive'' material being
targeted is no different from identical material easily obtained in
public libraries, college libraries and bookstores. A case in point is
the World's Biggest Bookstore, which stocks the Anarchist Cookbook, a
virtual how-to guide to subversive activity, also available online.  

Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who helped to draw
up the Paris agreement, cited the fact that his his 11-year-old son
showed him how to access extremist literature from the World Wide Web.
Axworthy's spokesperson, Catherine Lappe, says the pact is "not an
issue of trying to censor people" .  

"If you look at the communique, it says very clearly that all this
would have to be in compliance with national laws, so the issues of
privacy would be of utmost importance.''

The University of Nebraska is threatening web pages that have the word
"Husker" in their title, according to the message attached below. Guess
they'll have to go after these sites too:

       Husker Power web site
       Asger Schnack: Jeg Husker Alt

       Penstemon 'Husker Red' is 1996 Perennial Plant of the Year
       Husker midwestern home design
       Joel's Husker Page

I've set up a web page at http://www.well.com/~declan/huskers.html and
registered the URL with AltaVista and HotBot. It's called: "Husker web
pages, the University of Nebraska, and braindead policies."

I wonder what the university will do, if anything? This message is copied

Husker Web Pages Must Cease

Subject: Husker Web Pages Must Cease
From: mfricke@serv01.net-link.net (Mark E. Fricke)
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:59:55 -0400

I hate to be the bearer of real bad news, but if you have a personal
web site on the internet that features any logos, graphics, audio or
even the page name of Cornhusker or Husker (like the Husker Press Box)
be prepared to get a Cease and desist letter from the University of
Nebraska's attorney's. The problem is simple. A lot of money has been
paid to license the name and logo's of the Huskers and there are many
business interests to protect. Pinnacle Broadcasting is the exclusive
rights holder for internet usage of the name and logos (and you thought
the live broadcasts were all good).

Now..there are a couple of things we can do. #1 remove all references
to Huskers, Big Red, Cornhuskers etc. from THE PAGES TITLE. You can
still talk about, mention, berate or praise the team within the page,
just not in the page title. The reason here is that the University
wants all search engines (yahoo, excite, infoseek etc.) to send
searches for the Huskers to their site (huskerwebcast)

#2 remove all licensed logo's, pictures of Herbie audio of the band
etc. from your site.

#3 There is one more solution. Huskerwebcast will allow pages to exist
as they are if they are housed within THEIR page. Wether that mean they
will have hyperlinks to these hidden pages or if you will actually have
to set up an account and an FTP site to their server I'm not clear on.
I'm awaiting confirmation on this.

Okay, now my personal views. Yeah it's a bummer...a great big bummer. I
really don't see how private personal pages could possibly infringe on
the marketing dollars of the University (except for logos, you got me
there) But PAGE NAMES?!?!. They seem a little greedy fo rthe traffic.
I'm no lawyer (maybe some of you out there are and know something about
public domain)so I will do what I must with the Husker Press Box.  I
will still provide the page in some manner, either changing the name or
joining the University page. Luckily I have already been extended an
offer to do that. I will wait and see. My advise to other Husker wep
page masters. Be ready for a letter and be ready to reacte. this is a
big University with lots of money and lots of attorney's

Recently the London police sent a letter to U.K. Internet providers saying
that 133 Usenet newsgroups must be banned.

&gt;From observations at &lt;http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship&gt;, it's clear that:

       the Police regard ISPs as publishers
       the publication of obscene materials is an offence
       the Police expect ISPs to continuously monitor newsgroups and
           to remove those which contain illegal materials

More ominously, the letter says "Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive
and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups identifying and taking
necessary action against those others found to contain such material...
This list is only the starting point..." Also, the police have said they
have the power to arrest Internet providers and seize their equipment.

This move by the Brits is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising. I have
background about many more international net-censorship attempts at:

Our upstream provider, VBCNet, has informed us that today, they, and
other ISPs in the UK have received a notification from the Metropolitan
Police to remove 134 news groups from their news servers. Therefore, we
are no longer being fed these groups. As many of you will have seen,
recently, in a thread in the waverider.support newsgroup, Wave Rider
Internet Plc are
opposed to such censorship as a matter of principle - as I know many
of you are.

The letter from the Met makes it clear that this is only the
beginning - they plan to ban whatever newsgroups they see fit over the
coming months.

We urge you all to protest this action - use the media, contact your
MPs, generate whatever protest you see fit - or the UK Internet is going
to be operated by the whim of the Clubs & Vice unit of the Metropolitan
Police.

At present, Wave Rider Internet Plc have received no such notification from
the police, and will therefore not be removing any groups. However, as
we're not being fed them anymore, that's academic - there will shortly be
nothing in them.

I am enclosing the copy of the letter from the Met, that we have been
sent by VBCNet.

Like other UK ISPs, VBCnet today received a demand from the Metropolitan
Police that some 134 news groups be deleted from our news machines.
The letter makes it clear that this is only the beginning, that they
will be banning more groups and requiring ISPs to enforce their
dictats.  We have with great reluctance complied with their demand.

While we do not disagree that the articles in some of these groups are
often objectionable, we disagree in principle with this form of censorship.

We urge all of you to make it clear to your customers why these news
groups have been withdrawn and we urge you to contact your MPs and
the media about this arbitrary action by the police.  If there is no
protest, if a precedent is established, the UK Internet is going to
fall under the control of the Clubs and Vice Unit at Charing Cross
Police Station.

VBCnet is setting up a Web page to protest this action.  It should be
available at
        http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship
by the end of the day.  We will add pointers to other protesting Web
pages -- well, the ones that are calm and reasonable.  ;-)

Dear Sir / Madam

Pornographic Material on the Internet

Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.

We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.

This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.

We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.

Yours Faithfully


Stephen French
Chief Inspector

A longtime anti-porn crusader, Phyllis Schlafly generally is no friend of
free speech -- but I welcome her insightful and timely comments, attached
below. Privacy does cut through ideological lines. I seem to recall that
the Christian Coalition, a fiery supporter of the CDA, opposed the Clipper

                    Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother


     August 8, 1996                             by Phyllis Schlafly

     We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
     recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all
     Americans who care about civil liberties should vigorously resist
     President Clinton's attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an
     excuse to carry on his all-out war against the personal privacy of
     law-abiding Americans.

     This mind-set was first revealed in the Clinton health care bill,
     which would have given the government computer access to the
     medical records of all Americans. Fortunately, that totalitarian
     takeover of the health care industry was rejected.

     The Clinton Administration's education legislation now pending in
     Congress would put personal information about all schoolchildren
     -- academic, medical, attitudinal, behavioral, and family -- into
     an expanded Labor Market Information database available to the
     government, as well as to prospective employers.

     Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for
     individual Americans to have private conversations with one
     another. That's the real meaning of its effort to control
     encryption technology, and it's a direct assault on the First
     Amendment.

     It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First
     Amendment guarantees our right to speak in public but not in
     private. It would be just as ridiculous to say that we have
     freedom to speak in words that the government can understand, but
     not in words the government can't decipher.

     Americans have the right to speak to one another in private,
     behind closed doors, and we should likewise have the right to
     speak to one another in code and to put our coded messages on
     computer in a process called encryption. Americans would not
     tolerate the government opening and reading the letters we send
     through the mails, and we should not tolerate the government
     opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
     computer.

     Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and
     Vice President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our
     encrypted messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of
     California, Reno bluntly stated her demand for "ensuring law
     enforcement access to encrypted data.''

     Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government
     should create a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly
     "neutral third party''), to which all Americans should be forced
     to "entrust'' the keys to their encrypted messages, and to which
     the government would have access. On the contrary, there is no
     such consensus.

     Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do
     you trust the FBI to keep your files confidential?

     The Clinton Administration is already doing 30 to 40 percent more
     federal telephone wiretaps and other electronic surveillance than
     the last year of the Bush Administration. Those figures don't even
     include national security wiretaps or the hundreds of extensions
     granting more time for wiretap orders already issued.

     FBI Director Freeh wrote the New York Times last November that
     "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the
     extent of wiretapping." Four months later, FBI documents revealed
     that the FBI does, in fact, plan to increase electronic
     surveillance 54 percent by 1998 and 130 percent by 2004.

     On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will
     continue to push for the adoption of a massive public key
     infrastructure to give the government access to all encrypted
     communications. In a blatant bid for a police-state surveillance
     society, Gore warned about "the dangers of unregulated encryption
     technology."

     A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to
     make policy recommendations about encryption. The panel called on
     the government to abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.

     The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would
     enhance our national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of
     its 16 members had security clearances with access to secret
     information, and they saw no national security reason to justify
     the Clinton policy.

     The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private
     encryption on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping.
     However, the NSC panel concluded that the ability of the private
     sector to transfer confidential financial and other data over the
     information highway without interception is far more important.

     New technologies have given government awesome power to spy on
     individuals. The Filegate investigation accidentally uncovered the
     shocking news that, as soon as Bill Clinton entered the White
     House in 1993, he secretly spent $400,000 on software to create a
     highly sophisticated computer database to track detailed
     political, financial, attitudinal, and personal biographical
     information on 200,000 people, including members of Congress and
     the media. Known as WHODB for White House Office Data Base, the
     system was nicknamed Big Brother.

     Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the
     Clinton Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would
     be the biggest expansion of federal power since the passage of the
     Income Tax Amendment in 1913.

"G7, Russia Forge Anti-Terror Front"

Reuters reports foreign and security ministers of the G7 countries 
and Russia met in Paris Tuesday 30-July-96 to agree on building an
international front to fight terrorism.  The last two paragraphs 
of the summary:

"Among the measures the ministers planned to adopt was a drive to
prevent terrorists from communicating or sharing bomb-making
instructions over the Internet computer network.

Kinkel [German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel] said Canadian 
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy had told the meeting his 
11-year-old son had shown him how to find such content on the 
Internet."

Unfortunately, although this will probably turn out not to be

it will still be siezed on by Congress and the administration
as an excuse to loosen restrictions on wiretaps.

Seth's arguments are typical for anti-Libertarians -- that business is
inherantly suspect (and, likely, evil), and that anyone who defends business
is, of course One Of Them (and therefore suspect and likely evil).

Problem with these arguments is that they're more rhetoric than substance,
and when the principles of their side are questioned it's discovered that
there aren't any.

I said "principle." That means the word "Randian" is likely to appear soon.

Let's keep this list about government censorship, please.

&gt;Rich [Graves] is right in that I called Lemire a "Holocaust Revisionist."
He instead
&gt;identifies as a "White Nationalist." (Though Stanton reminds me that the
&gt;two labels aren't always mutually exclusive.)

"Revisionist" sounds so theoretical; academic.  Lemire seems to have his
hands in the mud a bit more than that.

Here's an excerpt from an affadvit, where he describes attacks on the
"Klanbuster" voicemail hotline:

(http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html)

"But I was monitoring the "Klanbuster" answering machine at the request of
Grant Bristow, who was the one who showed me how to break into the
hotline...He told me that you just simply call a "diverter" and through the
"diverter" to call the KlanBuster hotline...He instructed me to first call
up the diverter and then through the diverter call "Klan Busters" hotline
and type in a 2 digit passcode, which was 89 or 85 that would give me access
to the inside of the hotline. From there I was to collect names and numbers
of people who called in and pass them along to Mr. Bristow. 

"Mr. Bristow also told me that every time I listened to the telephone
numbers of these people, that I was to press "8" to erase them off the
machine so that the KlanBuster personnel did not know that I had gained
access to their answering machine. Mr. Bristow also instructed me to call
back these individuals whose phone numbers I had and to pretend that I was a
member of the Klanbusters Group and to try to get an address out of them to
supposedly send them Anti-Racist material. In the entire time I collected
names which lasted about 2 months, I collected around 10 to 15 and passed
all of the numbers I collected along to Mr. Bristow at various times that we
met each other (Generally Heritage Front events)."

Does a free speech advocate break into other people's voicemail and delete
their messages?

This is, of course, one of the huge, stinging ironies of this issue, IMHO:
While I will support the right of Lemire and his Nazi buddies to speak
freely, I have no doubt that if they actually held political power
"leftists" like myself would be among the first to lose our freedom of
speech.  Oh, well :)

Rich's point is well put, to me.  It's wrong to censor Lemire, and the
attempts tro censor him should be exposed.  But people should also be aware
of who he is and what he represents.  I'm guessing that the SWC Canada is
well aware of Lemire's extracurricular activities, and that those activities
are at least part of the reason they have tried to silence him.  Whether
that's right or not (I think not), it's important to understand, IMHO.

&gt;     On the other hand, the owners of this small firm may have
&gt; preferences and in our respect for diversity, we may indeed decide that
&gt; they have the right to their quirks in refusing business.  Further, I
&gt; think it is incumbent on us to be suspicious of the accusations of one
&gt; individual.  We need more evidence before taking such a post
&gt; seriously--some source of information that we know and trust.  Though we
&gt; should welcome Kate's post on this list as piece of information that we
&gt; may wish to keep in mind.
&gt;     This points to a need to distinguish big business from small
&gt; business for our political purposes and to demand liberal policies from
&gt; big business.   We do not have a liberal society, if we do not liberal

Why?

Right now, the situation is that if you want to show your opposition
to censorship, you don't get your film developed at Wal-Mart.  Is that
not the perfect solution?  Wal-Mart pleases its pro-censorship
customers, and you still get your film developed, since there are about
a million places to have it done.

The reason Libertarians focus on government is CHOICE.  You can deal
with Wal Mart or you can deal with Kmart or you can deal with the one
hour outfit around the corner.  Because of that, freedom can survive
any policy of theirs.

But we have only one government; if I want to opt out of the Social
InSecurity system because it's such a horrifyingly bad deal, the
government will say "You can't do that, we're forcing you
to give us this money or we'll lock you up in jail."

There /is/ a fuzzy boundary where there are private monopolies like
the phone company.  We have to deal with them if we want any kind of
phone service, so there has historically been a valid public interest
in regulating them.  But with competition popping up in the most
unlikely places nowadays - including local phone service - that's
becoming less and less true everywhere.

And, just in case you haven't noticed it, you surely can't depend
on government to fight censorship!

Since we're way off topic here anyway, I guess I'll add my say.

If in fact Jewel is the bomber, I would tend to see him as a rent-a-cop 
with a hero complex rather than a symbol of the Evil White Male Security 
State.  (BTW, I'm a white male, so that was sarcasm.)  The scenario looks 
to me like:
     12:30 or so  Sets the bomb in place
     12:45 "  "   Lets the other (rent-a-)cops know there's a package
     12:58        Someone (maybe not him) makes the 911 call
     1:25         detonation
We had a situation of a cop with a hero complex at the Hampton (VA) 
Coliseum a couple of years back, at some controversial concert.  He just 
wanted to find the bomb and get famous for supposedly saving lives.

That said, what could happen from this is that he could unwittingly get 
us to lower our expectations of freedom of movement, freedom of 
information, etc.  That's where the security state, J.-Edgar-Hoover-style 
pervasive wiretapping on the net, and censorship come in.  That's 
dangerous, as (I hope) everyone on this list believes.  If we give up our 
freedom, we've let one rent-a-cop gone bad achieve the aims of terrorists 
that are too tactically smart, and too technically sophisticated (with 
respect to explosives), to go after the Olympics with a pipe bomb.

Like people had been saying, you can't completely secure an open area.  It's 
just a fact of life.  I was down in Atlanta three weeks ago, and went to 
a Braves game Thursday night at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, the 
baseball venue for the Games.  They were searching backpacks of every one 
of the 72 youth and adults we had in our church choir tour group, all 
wearing our tour T-shirts.  If Olympic venue security is anything like that 
tight, and I'm sure it is, I seriously doubt anything will happen to the 
actual event sites.

The danger to the net comes, once again, from technophobic politicians -- 
and even the ones that do appreciate the Net, like Newt, but are facing 
challenges in their races this fall.  Such is life, and like it says in 
the Netizen article from the August Wired (4.08), the Net is a fledgling 
political entity.  We can hope, for now, that the bombing furor dies down 
and DC goes back to gridlock as usual, because if that happens, we may be 
safe for the moment.

And that's all I have to say about that...

&gt;The Libertarian effort to impugn all government action s evil coercion

As a Libertarian, I have to concur in some sense.  Censorship is often
wrong, even if done by private entities.  I refuse to put someone in
jail for refusing to let their computers or printing presses be used by
someone else, however I reserve the right to complain about it and
encourage boycotts.

I think that private electronic censorship is an appropriate topic for
fight-censorship...if we are to get along in a society based on
voluntary action, we need to communicate the deeds we feel are wrong,
even if they are legal.

I talked to Trueman today.

He told me Shea's victory was "not unexpected."

"The ACLU did some forum shopping. If I were going to file a suit like they
did, I'd go to Manhattan," he said, adding that NYC is much more permissive
than most parts of the country.

When I told him that Shea rather strongly dislikes the ACLU and refused to
join the ACLU lawsuit, Trueman was incredulous. Said that Shea must have
received some help from the ACLU in preparing briefs or whatnot.

Not quite.

&gt;Let's keep this list about government censorship, please.

I like the way Tom Edwards, an avowed Libertarian, described it:

Institutional restrictions on speech also are often wrong, but the response
to them is different. Such muzzling attempts are not illegal, just
misguided.

However, we should keep in mind the very fuzzy difference distinction
between editing and censorship. Should, for instance, Jim Thomas be forced
to include off-topic rants in CuD? Should the National Coalition Against
Censorship be forced to publish similar materials in their quarterly
newsletter? Editing != censorship. The ALA has a definition of censorship
that may be useful here.

But perhaps we can agree that the most vile form of censorship remains that
done by governments, which buttress their laws with the power of guns,
tanks, and gallows.

	For the record, we didn't forum-shop.  Also, I don't strongly
dislike the ACLU, and I certainly agree with them on the CDA.  Finally,
our case landed in NY because the correspondent firm that was going to
handle the case here backed out at the last moment -- on Feb. 7, the night
before we filed.  Our judges were relatively conservative.  We were not
assoisted by the ACLU, with whom we had a short-lived feud.

ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace;
New Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Wednesday, July 31, 1996

    NEW YORK, NY--Despite a second federal court decision affirming
that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today
warned of  persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and
internationally, to censor electronic communications and regulate
privacy technology.   

    At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known
as "G-7," government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate
the Internet and other electronic communications in an effort to
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing
incident at the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight
800, which is being investigated as a possible terrorist bombing.
Participants included France, Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany,
Canada, Russia and the United States. 

    Although not all details were made public, proposed measures
apparently include investigations of charities and political
organizations with radical political points of view -- threatening
their rights to free speech -- and using the Internet to "monitor"
terrorist communications.  There was also agreement to adopt a U.S.
plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed encryption, which would mean that
individuals and companies would be barred from using encryption
technology to electronically lock up their most private and
sensitive information unless they make the keys available to their
government.  

    In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and
electronic privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed
last month at a meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal.    The
group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition
with organizations from around the world to share information and
protect free speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the
global Internet.  GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the Internet
Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and human
rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding member of the group.

    "GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and
that decisions made by international bodies like the G-7 nations
affect all Internet users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate
director of the ACLU.  "The U.S. government may not accomplish
through an international end-run what the U.S. Congress and the
U.S. Courts have rejected."
    
    Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges
in New York declaring that censorship in cyberspace is
unconstitutional.  The decision marked another win in the ongoing
battle for free speech in cyberspace, which saw its first major
victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a Philadelphia court
granted a motion for preliminary injunction on "indecency"
provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed its
challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed
into law.

    "We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their
Philadelphia colleagues in protecting the Internet from
governmental intrusion," said Steinhardt, who testified in the
Philadelphia case.  "But we remain concerned about the government's
continuing efforts to censor electronic speech, not only in the
United States but internationally."

    In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal
that would make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-
making in print, radio, television or in cyberspace.   Violations
would be punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine,
or both. 

    "This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last
year, would criminalize everything from a high school chemistry
teacher explaining basic scientific principles, to a newspaper
carrying an illustration of a bomb's construction, to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture manual describing how to make fertilizer
bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's Steinhardt said. 

    In addition, President Clinton this week announced an
initiative to increase the powers of federal investigators,
including an expanded wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has
commended the Clinton Administration and law enforcement
authorities for their investigation into recent tragic incidents,
it urged President Clinton and Congress in a letter sent to the
White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit" by
safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss
continuing civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
generalized libertarian baiting. I for one would appreciate it if you'd
knock it off in this forum; distortions, insults, and amateur
psychoanalysis are not only not helpful, they're actively harmful in
sidetracking discussion and creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one
another.

If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please
do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list. Thank

If someone refuses to do business with another person based on disagreement
with his views or moral principles, that's certainly something to question,
but I can't see a single such incident as a problem. An inconvenience for
the artist who in this case has to find another, more reliable developer,
but no more than that. And I don't agree that it's wrong to refuse to do
business with someone, assuming you're not deceptive about it.

If we see a situation develop in which it's impossible to find developers
or printers to do certain work, or if there is an indication that this
developer refused this work because of intimidation or fear of legal
consequences, then it starts to become a censorship issue. But I didn't see
any such indications in the original message.

Yesterday in Paris government ministers from the G-7 countries met and
approved a 25-point plan calling for close cooperation in moving to
"intensify exchange of operational information," particularly "the use
of communications technologies by terrorist groups."

In a HotWired column, Kenneth Cukier writes: "In case there is any
question about the United States's position, Attorney General Janet
Reno said: 'We obtained the agreement of the eight (countries at the
conference) to develop means of lawful government access to and
decoding of scrambled or coded communication transmitted by
terrorists.'" German delegates also blasted the Internet.

The ACLU reports that: "Proposed measures apparently include
investigations of charities and political organizations with radical
political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech."

I've attached part of a cover story I have in the latest _Internet
Underground_ magazine (http://www.underground-online.com/) that talks
about the G-7 process and how countries around the globe are moving to
stifle the Net. Pick up a copy of the physical mag for the full text of
this article, plus some wonderously horrific graphics including a mouth

"PLAGUE OF FREEDOM"
The Internet's being disinfected for your protection
(pages 28-33)

By Declan McCullagh
declan@well.com


Call it an unlikely parable for today's Internet.

Daniel Defoe's "A Journal of the Plague Years" isn't about cyberspace.
Written in 1665, the book sketches a ghastly picture of a London under
seige.

Defoe tells how rats from foreign ships have invaded the city, carrying
with them the bubonic plague. Authorities resort to desperate measures,
barricading families inside their homes in a desperate attempt to halt
the onslaught.

It doesn't work. "Setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was,
first of all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by
force or by strategm, even almost as often as they pleased," Defoe
wrote.

So it is with the sprawling expanse of cyberspace in 1996. Governments
around the globe are rushing to barricade their borders, dam the flow
of foreign data, and create a new world information order. For good
reason: an uncensored 'net connection can be as deadly to a 20th
century government as the plague was three centuries ago.

And it may be just as infectious.

[...]

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The most influential international body involved in cyberrulemaking is
the G-7 group of industrialized nations. Truth be told, it's obscure
outside financial circles and is seen even inside them as becoming
irrelevant in a global financial system dominated by multinational
corporations, not by governments.

Yet the seven member nations have already started using the G-7
umbrella to engage in a sort of joint head-scratching about what to do
with cyberspace.

It started in February 1995 in Brussels, at a meeting called the "G-7
Ministerial Conference on the Information Society." There the telecom
honchos from G-7 nations and several smaller countries gathered to chat
about online copyright, cultural pollution, universal access, free
speech, and encryption policies.

At least the principles were lofty. "While the rhetoric of the
conference was progressive, there was no serious discussion of free
expression or other human rights concerns," wrote one American who
attended the conference.

Instead, the G-7 nations said they were considering how to deal with
inappropriate material on the 'net. Canada reminded the other countries
that it wasn't as permissive as the U.S. in dealing with
"hate-mongering materials," saying that when such publications appear
online "they are much easier to obtain but are more difficult to
monitor and take action against." The European Union decried copyright
pirates: "Some form of international cooperation is necessary to
supplement the existing legal systems governing intellectual property
rights." Saying the 'net is "not without risks," France stressed that
cyberspace "must not result in a standardization in content, or a
leveling of cultures."

Only Vice President Al Gore tossed a bone to cyber-rights advocates.
"[Cyberspace] is about protecting and enlarging freedom of expression
for all our citizens... Ideas should not be checked at the border,"
said Gore.

Gore didn't do this in a vacuum. "Our big victory at Brussels was that
we pressured them enough so that Al Gore in his keynote address made a
big point of stressing the importance of free speech on the Internet,"
says Ann Beeson of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Beeson should know -- she's been one of the few cybersavvy activists
who has been fighting globally for an unshackled Internet. Now a
principal attorney on the ACLU's legal team challenging the
Communications Decency Act, Beeson previously worked at Human Rights
Watch and crafted a letter the group sent to Gore before the Brussels
conference. Citing Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, it said: "Everyone has the right... to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Unfortunately, the only G-7 voices supporting this today are a silent
chorus.

The G-7 information ministers met again in South Africa in May 1996 and
plan to meet in Egypt later this year, but no international
'net-advocacy group has been tracking the proposals discussed at the
meetings. U.S. cyberliberty groups have been preoccupied with the CDA
battle, and they have no international counterparts.

That's finally about to change. Two global 'net-alliances are emerging
and have held their initial planning meetings at Internet conferences
this summer in Canada.

The ACLU co-founded one group, called the Global Internet Liberty
Campaign. "We have to face the fact that while ultimately it's
extraordinarily difficult for governments to control the 'net, they're
going to try," says Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.
"The best thing that governments can do is to stay out if it."

Not so, says Bruce Taylor, the chief architect of the CDA and a
professional cyber-scaremonger. The former Federal porn-prosecutor
believes that "not all censorship is bad."

"Foreign countries have an obligation to restrict obscenity and child
pornography on the Internet by the treaty of 1911," says Taylor. "It's
an agreement between the states to cooperate and to use international
laws to prosecute obscenity." And to Taylor, books and copies of
Penthouse magazine can be obscene.

FUTURE REGULATIONS

David Post is a likeable, bearded fellow who once studied yellow
babboons in Kenya and wears tennis shoes with his suits. Now the
co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute, Post is one of the
few lawyers who's made a serious study of the international
evolution of the 'net.

To Post, the 'net is at a fork in its development: the two paths are
self-regulation or an international government crackdown.

"It's the central problem the 'net faces today," says Post. "How does
it relieve itself of the conflicting claims of soverigns whose power is
based on geographical boundaries -- something the 'net doesn't
recognize?"

Eric Freedman, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra Law School, is
anything but optimistic. Freedman remembers how governments already
have crafted a complex constellation of little-known treaties and
agreements governing everything from satellite placement to the world
banking system and postal services.

"I'm worried that the governments are ahead of us," says Freedman.
"There's a humongous potential to get absolutely screwed here... If 100
countries agreed on this, they could get this done in a week. It's
easier for them to coordinate, agree, and implement than it is for us
to stop them from doing so."

That's why the ACLU/American Library Association lawsuit challenging
the CDA is vital. If the Supreme Court upholds the law, Congress and
the White House can craft international "decency" agreements for
cyberspace. But if the high court slams the law as unconstitutional,
Clinton would be barred from signing a CDA-type treaty. "It's a
principle of constitutional law that any treaty has to conform to the
Constitution," says Freedman.

A victory in the CDA case would, in a sense, turn the U.S. into a safe
haven for controversial content from all over the world.

Freedman urges 'netizens in every country to launch similar fights
against government 'net-censorship. "Win as many national victories as
possible to get ahead of the governments of the world," he says. "If
the German or Australian supreme courts were to rule that freedom of
speech principles apply to the 'net as they do to a newspaper, that
would be very helpful."

In the near future, that's the best way to forestall the world
information order. The first time a country proposes such a formal
treaty, it has to die from lack of support.

But pressure to regulate the 'net will always exist, and a new way of
looking at cyberspace may have to emerge. Some precedents exist.
Maritime law, for example, says that no single nation has jurisdiction
over the oceans. Medieval Europe recognized a separate law for
merchants that had its own judicial system. Antarctica is not governed
by any single country's laws. The Catholic Church is a multinational
institution that largely rules itself.

The Cyberspace Law Institute's Post argues for this model. "We should
treat cyberspace as a distinct location and allow our own distinct
legal and moral systems to evolve," he says.

He's right. As the 'net matures, no other solution will work.

Daniel Defoe described governments locking citizen inside their homes,
to no avail: "It was impossible for one man so to guard all the
passages as to prevent the escape of people made desperate... And that
which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the
infection farther."

The infection cyberspace spreads today is far more virulent than the
bubonic plague. Anathema to government, the 'net carries the virus of
freedom.

&gt; Does a free speech advocate break into other people's voicemail and delete

In fairness to Marc, I should explain that the Grant Bristow he was talking
about was a government informant. The point of his affidavit was to say he
was set up. You really need to read the whole SIRC report, and all of the
rebuttals on Zundel's web page, the counter-rebuttals on Nizkor, and all of
the press reports if you want to have the foggiest idea what is going on. It
wouldn't bother me one bit if you didn't care to do that, but it would bug
me if you presumed to pass judgement without doing that.

Since we're obviously not going to do that on this list, forget the larger
issues. They do not concern fight-censorship.

&gt; Rich's point is well put, to me.  It's wrong to censor Lemire, and the
&gt; attempts tro censor him should be exposed.  But people should also be aware
&gt; of who he is and what he represents.  I'm guessing that the SWC Canada is
&gt; well aware of Lemire's extracurricular activities, and that those activities
&gt; are at least part of the reason they have tried to silence him.  Whether
&gt; that's right or not (I think not), it's important to understand, IMHO.

Actually, I disagree. Unless you happen to live in Toronto, or to be Jewish,
I see no particular reason to be interested in the larger issues. You can't
expect us as free-speech activists to investigate the background of every
censorship victim.

My point was that absent a THOROUGH investigation, which one usually cannot
do, it is improper to comment on the merits of a particular site, or even to
characterize it in any but the most general terms. 

Wiesenthal Center-Canada (not sure of the position of the US org) wants to
shut down the web site of a political opponent. Wearing our free-speech
activist hat, we can say that that is wrong. But that's all we should say
without donning another hat. 

I apologize to Marc and Declan for bringing in other issues. Backlashes
breed more backlashes. If you're interested in my opinion of and experiences
with Marc, I'd be more than happy to talk to you off the list, but my point
is precisely that such extraneous discussions, for or against any viewpoint,
do not concern fight-censorship.

Some conflicts that hit the internet censorship scene verge on actual
warfare. The Zambia newspaper case, the Basque separatist web site, and this
case are viewed by their participants as real battles. The Wiesenthal Center
probably sees its battle with neo-Nazis as a covert war, and vice versa --
and rightfully so. I know people on both sides who have "gone underground," 
at considerable risk to life and limb. The role of a free-speech/peace
activist in such a situation is to enforce the "rules of war," and try to
foster real discussion. I don't think the Nazis should be excluded from the
political system; I see no reason to wage war on them. Obviously, the
Wiesenthal Center (and a few other groups, but not the ADL or Nizkor)
disagrees. 

[An extreme case to ponder: When the UN coalition bombed and jammed the
Iraqi communications infrastructure, was that censorship? That's how Lemire 
and certain people in the Wiesenthal Center view this "battle."]

&gt;From: jaed@best.com (Jeanne A. E. DeVoto)
&gt;Seth, this list is not really the appropriate place for trolls or
&gt;generalized libertarian baiting. 

	Is it the place for trolls and generalized Libertarian ranting?

&gt; I for one would appreciate it if you'd knock it off in this forum; 

	Similarly, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to hear the
"Libertarian" view of the proper use of the word censorship over and over
again. But given that it's inevitable that that happens, and I think
it's distracting and politically annoying, what do you suggest I do?
Keep silent about it?

&gt; distortions, insults, and amateur psychoanalysis are not only not
&gt; helpful, they're actively harmful in sidetracking discussion and
&gt; creating rifts and ugly feelings toward one another.

	I think the rifts and ugly feelings are created initially by the
harsh criticism of the person holding a non-Libertarian view. I think if
you'll examine the record of this thread, you'll see that's the history.

&gt;If you do believe in freedom of expression as a basic principle and
&gt;something that's worth having in itself - something I am beginning to doubt
&gt;after having read some of your writings over the last months - then please

	??? I cannot imagine how you can say this. Let's take it to e-mail.

&gt;do not undermine efforts to secure it by flamebaiting on this list.
&gt;Thank you.

	To be frank, I think very little of Libertarianism as a
political philosophy.  But more importantly, and somewhat relevant to
this list, I've come to believe that the habits of thought it engenders
are downright harmful, that they tend to keep people from thinking
effectively about the real world - which is a very complicated mix of
government, business, social customs, and so on, all interacting with
each other. In fact, I just wrote a long article where these very points
took up much of the space. Check out, at the Ethical Spectacle webzine,
(http://www.spectacle.org/)
   Linkname: Internet Blocking Programs and Privatized Censorship
        URL: http://www.spectacle.org/896/finkel.html

	Thus, I very much want to argue against such a worldview. I
don't view this as "flamebaiting", but as "political argument" (although
I am rough at times, but this is somewhat in anticipation of stock stuff
like being called a thief and a Stalinist). Given this background, what
are your suggestions as to what should be done?

 [None of the below is really on-topic for fight-censorship, but because
 Lemire posed specific questions here, I'll answer them here. 

 As far as the topic of fight-censorship goes, Marc Lemire strongly
 disagrees with Sol Littman's campaign to shut down his web site, and so do
 the Nizkor folks and I. Obviously, we disagree concerning the value and
 importance of the content of Mr. Lemire's web pages, but that's a matter of
 free speech -- in other, more appropriate forums.

 If anyone wishes to pursue these off-topic issues, please cross-post to

 forte, and I'm too busy with other things.]

     The rather extended arugument over this mailing list concerning
     the Liberarian view of free speech has been extremely informative
     for me. I never felt that there was flaming involved, just heated
     discussion, which is often the best way to learn for the
     observer of an argument, because the participants are throwing
     thier best shots.
     From being a nominal supporter of Libertarian views, I have grown
     increasingly aware of the dangers involved in that position. It
     is entirely possible that another subcscriber to this list has
     been pulled in exactly the opposite direction, but hey, that's
     what free speech is about, isn't it?

Perhaps I should add - a great, pithy response that, like all pithy
statements, needs a great number of auxiliary premises and background in
order to work.  The vast majority of newsgroups are not moderated - they
are a form of expression open to all.  The question is: are citizens
subject to prior restraint or chilling effect censorship when they try to
post to these newsgroups?  If so, they're not being "moderated" - they're
being censored!

But I acknowledge - the difference between content selection and
censorship *can* get a little hazy.  Fortunately, current government
censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Yes, things can get hazy even with selection of articles for academic
journals get a bit hazy.  Complaints that journals are favouring
certain kinds of approaches over others, or some people (or countries)
over others are not uncommon.  Of course whoever owns a journal is
entitled to print what they like (?), but the problem is that some
journals have a status due to external forces (ie they are included in
citation listings, or libraries subscribe to them).  Censorship is
definitely a possibility when this is the case.  (It's all very well
being able to publish on the Internet, but if your job prospects depend
on publication in certain journals it doesn't help much.)

&gt;Fortunately, current government
&gt;censorship efforts do not even approach the grey area.

Indeed.

Danny.

(1) CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS PROPOSE SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORISM
    INITIATIVES

In the wake of the recent bombing at the Olympics and the suspected
terrorist involvement in the TWA crash, the Clinton Administration and
members of Congress are proposing a set of sweeping counter-terrorism
initiatives. If enacted into law, these proposals will dramatically
increase law enforcement surveillance authority over the Internet and other
advanced communications technologies. An outline of the Administration's
proposal was circulated on Capitol Hill on Monday July 29.

President Clinton has urged Congress to pass new counter-terrorism
legislation before the Congressional recess at the end of this week.  While
several prominent Republican members of Congress, including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), have said publicly that Congress should not rush into
any new counter-terrorism legislation, most observers believe there is a
strong possibility that some or all of the Administration's proposal will
be enacted before the August recess.

The draft proposal contains several measures which were rejected by
Congress as part of the previous counter-terrorism initiative proposed
last year after the Oklahoma City bombing, as well as several new measures
including as-yet unspecified changes to U.S. encryption policy and funding
for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a.
Digital Telephony).

CDT is concerned that the latest counter-terrorism efforts on Capitol Hill
are occurring without appropriate deliberation.  Major policy decisions
expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement should not be made
without careful consideration of the necessity of such proposals and the
relative benefit to society. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work
with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to
ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet
are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
________________________________________________________________________

MAJOR POINTS OF THE COUNTER-TERRORISM PROPOSALS CIRCULATING ON THE HILL

The administration's new counter-terrorism initiative and other amendments
circulating this week in Congress contain numerous provisions, but four
are of particular concern to the net.community:

* New Threats to Encryption, Opposition to the Pro-CODE Bill
* Funding for Digital Telephony Without Public Accountability
* Amendment to Criminalize 'Bomb-Making' Information on the Internet
* Expanded Authority for Multi-Point, "Roving" Wiretaps

The full text of the Administration's proposal and background information
are available at CDT's counter-terrorism Web Page:

    http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/

       --------------------------------------------------------

I. NEW THREATS TO ENCRYPTION, OPPOSITION TO THE PRO-CODE BILL

The Administration's outline contains the following statement on encryption:

 "* Encryption -- We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement.  We oppose legislation that would eliminate
    current export barriers and encouraging the proliferation of encryption
    which blocks appropriate access to protect public safety and the
    national security."

While no specific legislative language has yet been proposed, this
represents the first statement by the Administration that they will seek
legislation to further restrict encryption.  Even more troubling, the
Administration is clearly attempting to use the recent suspected terrorist
incidents to push for a new and more restrictive encryption policy.

This new proposal comes as Congress is finally beginning to seriously
consider major changes in U.S. encryption policy. Bipartisan legislation
in both the House and Senate to relax encryption export controls is gaining
momentum.  The Senate Commerce Committee has held 3 hearings in the last 6
weeks, and is preparing to vote to send the Burns/Leahy "Pro-CODE" bill (S.
1726) to the floor of the Senate.  The Administration's attempt to leverage
the public's concern about terrorism to block passage of the Pro-CODE bill
is disturbing, and poses a significant threat to privacy and security on the
Internet.

CDT is working with members of Congress, privacy advocates, and the
communications and computer industries to oppose any attempt by the
Administration to impose new restrictions on encryption, and we continue to
work to move the bipartisan export relief legislation through Congress.

       --------------------------------------------------------

II. FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

The Administration is also seeking to override the public accountability
provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA
- a.k.a. 'Digital Telephony') by providing a funding for the law in a way
that prevents public oversight of the FBI's surveillance ability.

Enacted in October of 1994, granted law enforcement new authority to
influence the design of telecommunications networks (the Internet,
Commercial online services, and BBS's were exempted) in order to preserve
their ability to conduct court authorized electronic surveillance.

Congress balanced this new authority with a number of mechanisms to ensure
public accountability over law enforcement surveillance ability.
While complicated, the public accountability mechanisms are designed to
work as follows:

* Law enforcement provides telecommunications carriers, the Congress,
  and the public with notice of its surveillance capacity needs (i.e.,
  the number of simultaneous wiretaps in a given geographic location)
  with an opportunity for public comment.

* Based on an assessment of the reasonableness of the law enforcement
  surveillance capacity request, Congress appropriates money to cover
  the cost of modifications.  If Congress does not believe law
  enforcement has adequately justified its request, money will not be
  appropriated.

* Telecommunications carriers are not obligated to comply with the
  statute or make any capacity modifications without government
  reimbursement.

In October 1995, the FBI published its first notice of surveillance
capacity (see CDT Policy Post Vol. 1, No. 26).  The telecommunications
industry and privacy advocates used the public accountability provisions of
CALEA to respond to the FBI's request and argued that the FBI had not
adequately justified the extensive surveillance capability contained in the
request.  As a result, Congress has not yet appropriated funds and no
modifications have been made.

The FBI clearly believes that the public accountability provisions of CALEA
are working **too well**, and appears to be using the recent focus on
terrorism to push for a new funding mechanism which does not contain public
oversight.

CDT is fighting hard to ensure that the public accountability provisions of
CALEA, which have until now prevented the FBI from acquiring unnecessary
surveillance capacity, remain a part of the law, and will vigorously oppose
any effort by the FBI and the Clinton Administration to remove the last
opportunity for public oversight over law enforcement power.

       --------------------------------------------------------

III. THE AVAILABILITY OF 'BOMB-MAKING' INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has reintroduced an amendment to make it
illegal to disseminate information on how to construct explosives knowing
that the information will be used in furtherance of a federal crime.  The
amendment was adopted by the Senate earlier this month as part of a
Department of Defense Appropriations bill.  CDT believes that the vague
provisions of the Feinstein amendment could have a chilling effect on online
speech, needlessly duplicate existing criminal statutes, and should be
removed.

Feinstein first proposed the amendment as part of the 1995
counter-terrorism bill. The initial Feinstein amendment was extremely broad
and would have resulted in a flat ban on certain constitutionally protected
speech online.  After civil liberties advocates objected, Feinstein
narrowed her amendment substantially, although it was ultimately dropped
from the final terrorism bill signed in April 1996.

       --------------------------------------------------------

IV.  EXPANDED WIRETAP AUTHORITY

The Administration's proposal would also significantly expand current
wiretapping authority to allow multi-point (or "roving") wiretaps. This
would dramatically change surveillance authority to include wiretaps of
INDIVIDUALS instead of LOCATIONS.

This proposal would do away with the delicate balance between privacy and
law enforcement that Congress has struck over 30 years of wiretapping
legislation. Federal law has always required that wiretaps issue for a
specific location, to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. In 1986 Congress
introduced a narrow exception to this rule, only for cases where it could
be shown that the target was intentionally evading wiretaps by changing
facilities. The Administration proposal would completely remove this
standard, allowing so-called "roving taps" for any persons whose behavior
makes wiretapping difficult for law enforcement.

The administration proposed similar provisions in the spring of 1995 in the
wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. These provisions proved controversial in
Congress and were dropped from the final bill.

&gt;&gt; Seth, I'm no libertarian, but I do have a problem with any system that says
&gt;&gt; a private individual or business can't select, edit, censor, or whatever you
&gt;&gt; want to call it. I mean, what exactly are you suggesting?  Would we
&gt;&gt; *require* the operators of web servers to post any materials submitted ...
&gt;
&gt;	There's a whole range of actions that could take place that don't
&gt;*require* anything. The fact that this is an immediate, knee-jerk
&gt;reaction along the same lines, now yet another person, says something
&gt;very significant. As I said, it's a real mental tick. Anytime something
&gt;negative is said about private action, bang, are-you-proposing-to-compel...

But Seth, I think the line must be drawn clearly between public and private.
I don't know that it's 'kneejerk' to make that distinction.

&gt;	We could begin by not having this immediate flaming at the
&gt;critic whenever a business is criticized. Bad publicity can have a very
&gt;potent effect on private conduct, but actions are less likely to be
&gt;changed if any complainant seeking assistance has to pass through a gauntlet
&gt;of "business is holy, how dare you question it".

You certainly won't get that from me. However, when you're discussing an
issue of possible non-government censorship, I think the strategies for
handling differ (as you imply below). Again, the line between public and
private is important, because when you're in the public context of
government & court enforcement, you have force rather than volition, as you
would have in a private context. I'm not behind a libertarian critique of
government enforcement as an inherent evil, but I would certainly agree that
force should be used judiciously, minimally, and would not apply to a
process of selection in a private context that one might construe as censorship.

&gt;	The typical tactics of influencing business are publicity
&gt;campaigns and boycotts. Boycotts are sometimes criticized themselves,
&gt;but for the scope of this discussion, I'll just point out that they are
&gt;a type of private action that doesn't require any government
&gt;intervention, We've got to get past the idea that business conduct can't
&gt;be opposed, and the immediate leap into absurdity at the very thought is
&gt;a symptom of how deeply this blindness is rooted.

Agreed. If, for instance, you think that AOL is committing egregious acts of
censorship and exclusion, drop your AOL account, fuss at/about AOL, but
don't seek government involvement or court resolution.

thx
Jon

And it would be useful to get a good working definition of censorship that

For the sake of brevity, I will not quote Jon's reply to Seth's post.

Jon makes the valid point, which I'm sure Seth agrees with, that different
responses are appropriate for state and private censorship.  Most
importantly, when dealing with private censorship, one must not run to the
government for help.  If NBC suppresses a story critical of GE (its
owner), than the public has been denied access to important information.
But if we ask the government to dictate to NBC what they can and cannot
broadcast, then we trample upon the First Amendment.  The First Amendment
_protects_ private censorship (providing no other laws are broken).  Thus
when we respond to private censorship, we must respect the First Amendment
rights of the censors.  We can publicize the censorship incident, write
letters of protest, boycott, etc.  But  we must not involve the state in
regulating speech.

Cheers,
Bob

You're right, of course.  These are muddy waters, to say the least, and I
should have dome more research before passing any judgement.

I will look at the sources you have recommended.

Thanks :)

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

	         CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
	              NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

	SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

	Dear _________,

	Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
	I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
	considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

	Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use
the tragic events in Atlanta and New York to erode the basic rights of
citizens.

The Global Internet Liberty Coalition (GILC) said that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the
Internet.  GLIC urged users of the Internet to oppose legislative
measures that could restrict the free flow of information or limit the
ability of citizens to engage in private communication.

Members of GILC include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Human Rights Watch
(HRW), the Internet Society (ISOC), Privacy International (PI), and
other organizations.

The GILC was formed in June at the annual meeting of the Internet
Society in Montreal. A temporary web page for the Global Internet
Liberty Campaign has been established at:

   http://www.aclu.org/gilc/index1.html.

A permanent home for GILC will soon be established at

   http://www.gilc.org/

=======================================================================
[2] #005#New Domestic Surveillance Provisions Proposed
=======================================================================

In the wake of the recent tragedies in Atlanta and New York, the White
House and the FBI are again calling for new federal powers to expand
wiretapping authority, even in the absence of any evidence that
inability to wiretap led to the two tragedies.  The provisions were
originally introduced as part of the counterterrorism bill but were
struck out after objection from a coalition of liberal and
conservative groups.

The White House is trying to rush the proposal through Congress this
week before the August recess.

The new measure would allow prosecutors to use of "roving wiretaps."
The Administration proposal would allow prosecutors to tap multiple
telephones in an area if they suspect that the target in switching
phones. Other recommendations include allowing for 48 hour warrantless
"emergency" wiretaps, easier access to consumer records including
phone and travel records, and restrictions on the use of encryption.

Several members of Congress were critical of the proposal. Rep. Bob
Barr (R-GA) told CNN that the proposals created "vast powers" and that
there was "no case for emergency wiretaps and roving wiretaps." Rep.
Ike Skelton (D-MO) called for greater human intelligence noting that
law enforcement and intelligence agencies "seem to rely too much on
technology". Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and others met with
President Clinton on July 29, after which Gingrich expressed tentative
support for the proposals.

The American public also remains divided on the desirability of giving
federal law enforcement new wiretapping authority. In a USA
Today/CNN/Gallop poll taken July 29, 50 percent of those polled said
that "[i]ncreasing surveillance of U.S. citizens by the government"
was "going too far." According to the poll, 45 percent supported the
measures and five percent were undecided. The New York times
editorialized on June 30 that "the proposal to expand the Government's
wiretapping authority is excessive."

A House/Senate conference committee meeting on the Defense
Appropriations bill is also reviewing a provision introduced by
Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) that would ban the dissemination of
bomb-related information on the Internet. This provision had also been
rejected in the counterterrorism bill on First Amendment grounds.

More information on wiretapping is available from:

    http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/

=======================================================================
[3]  Digital Telephony Funding Approved by House
=======================================================================

The House of Representatives approved on July 25 funding for the
Justice Department that includes a provision to fund the "digital
telephony" bill.

The bill would establish a permanent "Telecommunications Carrier
Compliance Fund" with contributions from "any agency of the United
States with law enforcement or intelligence responsibilities". Thus
agencies such as the CIA and NSA, with their secret "black budgets"
will be able to fund the wiretap program without public oversight. A
previous draft of the bill had also allowed agencies with "national
security" roles to contribute.

Funding for the proposal was rejected in two earlier attempts: the FY
1996 appropriations bill and the 1996 counter-terrorism bill. It now
goes to the Senate where advocates will attempt to remove the funding
provision.

A copy of the House bill and more information on wiretapping is
available from:

   http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/


=======================================================================
[4] Another Court Enjoins CDA
=======================================================================

Another federal court has ruled that the Communications Decency Act is
unconstitutional and has prohibited its enforcement.  This follows the
decision earlier this month by a federal court in Pennsylvania
striking down two provisions in a case brought by the ACLU, EPIC, ALA
and others.

In this case, Joe Shea, editor of the American Reporter an online
newspaper, challenged the CDA in US District in New York city. Shea
published an "indecent" article by Judge Steve Matthews, a Texas state
judge and law professor, and then challenged the CDA.

The court ruled that the section prohibiting the dissemination of
"indecent" speech was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and
affected protected speech between adults. The court also found that
presently there was no practical way to block the material using
currently available blocking software and thus the affirmative defense
were not adequate to save the law: "there is no persuasive evidence
that a substantial proportion of Internet content providers can make
available material potentially within the scope of the CDA without
fear of prosecution and criminal liability."

Unlike the ACLU case, however, the court rejected the challenge to the
CDA as being overly vague. It ruled that there was substantial case
law available on what was "indecent" that has been upheld by the
courts. It also rejected the assertion that because of the global
nature of the Internet, online providers could not be expected to know
what was indecent everywhere:

   "We have no basis for concluding that Internet content providers are
   any less capable than those subject to obscenity laws or other
   indecency restrictions to acquire a general familiarity with the
   relevant standards; indeed, one might conclude that a content
   provider's contact with others around the country and around the world
   through interactive computer services would cultivate a heightened
   awareness of regional and cultural differences."

The US Justice Department has twenty days to appeal this decision to the
US Supreme Court. DOJ has already filed a petition for appealing the
Pennsylvania case to the Court, which will hear it in its fall session.

In a case raising similar issues brought before a French court, the French
Conseil Constitutionnel on July 24 struck down a recently enacted French
law Internet censorship law known as the "Fillon amendment". The court
ruled that placing Internet regulations under the control of the Conseil
Superieur de l'Audiovisuel and requiring Internet service providers to
take the advice of the CSA was a violation of free speech rights.

[5] Congressional Hearing Critical of US Crypto Policy
=======================================================================

Senators at the July 25 hearing of the Commerce Committee on S. 1726, the
PRO-Code legislation were openly critical of current US policy on
cryptography.  Senators Burns, Pressler, Ashcroft openly questioned the
viability of key escrow and the effects of export controls on American
business.

The first panel of the hearing included FBI Director Louis Freeh, William
Reinch, Undersectrary of the Bureau of Export Administration for the US
Department of Commerce, and William Crowell, Deputy Director of the
National Security Agency. The panelists opposed S. 1726 and supported the
implementation of an international key escrow system. Freeh claimed that
five percent of all cases show evidence of cryptography.

Many of the Senators were openly critical of the current export controls
and the viability of creating a comprehensive international key escrow
system. Senator Pressler held up a copy of Applied Cryptography and a disk
and described the restrictions on the disk as "somewhat absurd." Sen. Ron
Wyden noted "The terrorists and drug merchants of the 21st century are not
going to be encryption simpletons."  Senator Burns described the
international key escrow system as a "pipe dream." When Undersecretary
Reinsch claimed that "there's a very clear commercial interest in having
hardware and/or software with a back door" to prevent a "electronic tower
of Babel", Senator Ashcroft forced him to admit that the only real use
would be for government access and then questioned the Constitutionality of
the proposal and invoked the Filegate incident as an example of the
potential abuses.

Under questioning by Senator Burns, FBI Director Louis Freeh acknowledged
that if the current "voluntary" policy failed, he would seek mandatory
domestic controls on cryptography. Freeh told the Committee:

  I don't think I'm at that point yet.  I believe that the policy
  that is enunciated here is a doable policy, but there could come a
  point where that policy, the voluntary policy, is not a viable
  one.  And then I would certainly look at more mandatory controls.
  Not that that might work, but backing up my position that's where
  ultimately I would be.

A second panel was made up of industry representatives who supported S.
1726. James Barkesdale of Netscape Communications testified that his
company has lost 30 percent of its business to foreign competitors who have
stronger security systems. He described the Clipper III proposal as "most
massive computer infrastructure on the planet . . . beyond belief." Ron
Pieper of Tandem Computers described the key escrow system as "an absolute
show stopper" for electronic commerce.

The bill may now be considered by the Commerce Committee this week and then
sent to the full Senate for a vote in September after the Congressional
recess. More information, including Freeh's written testimony, is available
at:

        On August 1, 1996 Canuck Soup ONLINE will mirror a controversial
white supremacist Internet web site that is dedicated to hosting
controversial groups.
        I am the webmaster for CSO and a 15 year old British Columbian. I

        I do not agree with the Freedom Site's content, but I do agree that
they have a fundamental right to express their political opinions, both on and
off the Internet. The B.C. government has no experience or understanding of
cyberspace, or a right to censor or suppress legal expression, even if it's
on a web site.
        I'm also requesting that other people who are interested in
mirroring the Freedom Site contact freedom@netcom.ca (the webmaster at

ELECTRONIC FRONTIER CANADA (EFC) --- PRESS RELEASE
(For immediate release --- Thursday, August 1, 1996
---------------------------------------------------


   BC teenager takes on BC government in bold free speech battle


A 15-year-old boy in Smithers, BC, says he will be "mirroring" the
controversial web pages that had prompted the BC Attorney General
to call for controls on the flow of "hate" through the Internet.

Frank Sayre, who acts as webmaster for the `Canuck Soup' web pages says,
"I decided to mirror the `Freedom Site' because of B.C.'s misguided
attempt to censor the Internet".

"I do not agree with the Freedom Site's content," he continues,
"but I do agree that they have a fundamental right to express
their political opinions, both on and off the Internet."

"The B.C. government has no experience or understanding of cyberspace,
... nor does it have any right to censor or suppress legal expression,
even if it's on a web site," says the young cyber-activist.

Sayre says he's encouraging other like-minded individuals to help him
make his point by setting up their own "mirror sites" -- something he's
facilitated by packaging up the information into a downloadable
"ZIP file" that his web pages boasts will enable anyone to
"Set up your own Freedom-Site in 5 minutes or less!"

"It's a controversial approach," admits David Jones, president of
Electronic Frontier Canada, who recalls that a similar tactic was
successful earlier this year in getting Germany's Deutsche Telekom
to back down when it started blocking access to Ernst Zundel's web
pages based in southern California.

Although Electronic Frontier Canada is a staunch defender of free speech
in cyberspace, the organization won't be setting up a mirror site of
its own.  "I want to be clear that we don't endorse the views expressed
in any of these so-called `hate' web pages," says Jeffrey Shallit,
EFC vice-president, acknowledging that many Canadians find them
offensive and distasteful.

"We do agree, however, that attempts to censor web pages are pointless
and misguided.  First, attempts at censorship just give more media
attention to these people, who desperately crave attention, and second,
the end result tends to be that the information gets copied around
the Internet to these mirror sites -- which can hardly be considered
an improvement."

Both Shallit and Sayre make reference to the approach advocated by
US Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas: "The way to combat noxious
ideas is with other ideas.  The way to combat falsehood is with truth."
(from 1958 interview with Mike Wallace)

The Nizkor Project, run by B.C.'s own Ken McVay, is a notable example
of this approach.

        Background
        Participating organizations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

                 CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
                      NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to "go slow" and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

[1] G-7 Urges Crypto Restrictions -- GILC Launches Campaign
=======================================================================

Leaders of the G-7 nations agreed to policies on Tuesday that could
limit speech on the Internet and restrict the use of encryption.
Meeting in Paris in the aftermath of the crash of TWA flight 800 and
the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Olympics in Atlanta, delegates
from the G-7 countries agreed to work together to combat international
terrorism.

The G-7 group issued a declaration that included 25 principles ranging
from the protection of mass transportation and furthering research and
development on bomb detection to measures that might limit
international travel, restrict the activities of political and
charitable organizations, and lead to the development of new
identification technologies.

Two provisions are of particular concern to the users of the worldwide
Internet. One principle said that the G-7 would "Accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
government access to data and communications in order to prevent or
investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of
legitimate communications." A second provision would limit the
availability of certain information on the Internet.

Stronger measures sought by the US to restrict information on the
Internet and limit the availability of encryption were apparently not
adopted by the G-7 countries

The G-7 acknowledged that it is necessary to respect "fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law," but civil liberties experts were quick
to note that many provisions could lead to a dramatic expansion of law
enforcement authority. The G-7 countries include the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also
participates in the meetings.

Earlier attempts by officials in Washington to pass similar measures
uin the United States Congress that would restrict the availability of
information on the Internet or prohibit the use of encryption have
failed.

However, a recently established coalition of civil liberties, human
rights, and free speech groups said that governments should not use

Free speech isn't only for those with dangerous ideas; privacy isn't just
for suspected criminals.

As Internet users, we all have a stake in standing up for free speech *and*
privacy.

With your indulgence, I'm passing along an important alert regarding
several telecommunications surveillance proposals that Congress may
adopt... perhaps as soon as FRIDAY.

If you can, please call Congress on Friday to insist that our legislators
carefully consider the privacy implivations of any proposal to expland the
FBI's wiretap authority.  Your call can make a very big difference.

Full details follow below.

Work the network!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allow law enforcement to wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to
   48 hours WITHOUT obtaining a court order.

2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Impose new restrictions on encryption technologies

4. Criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

                 CALL YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY
                      NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to "go slow" and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

 If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to know there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap "suspected terrorists" for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point "Roving" Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called "roving" wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    "We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement."

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

&gt; Jon makes the valid point, which I'm sure Seth agrees with, that different

&gt; importantly, when dealing with private censorship, one must not run to the
&gt; government for help.

You mean like taking Princeton to New Jersey State court for its efforts
to censor?  I see this demand for state intervention as a perfectly
appropriate way to deal with private censorship, but I do urge Bob to
attempt to dissuade those who may wish to take this action.

Thank you for calling attention to the need for clarification.  By running to
the government to help I meant asking the government to intervene in a way
contrary to the First Amendment--e.g. by forcing a newspaper to print something
it does not want to print.  Using the courts is a  perfectly valid way of asking the 
government for help in cases where private institutions are trampling on the First 
Amendment rights of others.  If I didn't believe in the appropriateness of using
the courts, I never would have involved the National Writers Union as a plaintiff
in the suit to invalidate the CDA.  (Granted, this is a case of state censorship.)

Anyway, my original message certainly left me open to misinterpretation.  Forgive
my sloppiness and thank you for calling this to my attention.

Cheers,
Bob

*  CYBER-LIBERTIES ALERT: Anti-Terrorism Measure Threatens Net Liberty 
 
The latest understanding from ACLU's legislative representatives is that
the "Anti Terrorism" bill that is expected to be acted on today and
tomorrow will include government controls on encryption -- a scheme for key
escrow of private keys for encryption. It is also likely to include
expanded use of wiretapping without a Court order. 
 
There is absolutely no evidence at this time to show that either the TWA
tragedy or the Olympic Park bombing could have been prevented or any crimes
solved by increased government power to control the use of encryption or to
wiretap.  
 
Please call your Congress member and Senators immediately and ask them to
oppose these measures.

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
* Congress Attacks Our Medical Privacy 
 
The House-Senate Conference Committee has reported out H.R. 3103, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill. The U.S. House conferees pushed
for and achieved the inclusion of their deceptively-labeled "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments (which were not in the Senate's
version). The bill is scheduled to go to the House floor for a vote today,
and to the Senate floor for a vote tomorrow.  It then would still require
the President's signature. 
 
With "Administrative Simplification" and its related amendments included,
this bill is profoundly destructive to the Medical Privacy Rights of each
and every person in the United States. 
 
Specifically: 
 
1.)  Medical Records will be computerized in vast databases run by the
government and/or large corporations, including consumer credit reporting
companies whose problems with both privacy and accuracy are
well-documented. 
 
This will create, without any consent or control by patients (all of us), a
COMPUTERIZED "LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OF OUR MEDICAL RECORDS. Just as the
Social Security Administration and the U.S. military can't protect their
computers from unauthorized access, so too the new Medical Records "Lending
Library" will not be secure. 
 
2.)  Each of us will have a "UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFIER" NUMBER assigned to
us by the government, and the government will force this number to be used
in connection with any and all health care. 
 
3.) Although the bill does not formally preempt state laws protecting our
medical privacy, it establishes a structure and creates conditions that
will make it unlikely for such state laws to survive. 
 
IF YOU VALUE YOUR MEDICAL PRIVACY, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. 
 
Call your own U.S. Senators (202-224-3121) and U.S. Representative
(202-225-3121) and tell them to "KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY MEDICAL RECORDS". 
 
Urge your Representative and Senators to oppose passing any Health Care
bill that violates our medical privacy by having "Administrative
Simplification" and related amendments.  Tell them to SEND IT BACK TO THE
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, and to JUST SAY NO TO "ADMINISTRATIVE
SIMPLIFICATION." 
 
You can also reach the Capital Switchboard at 1-800-962-3524. 
 
----- 
 
For your convenience, we supply the following talking points: 
 
H.R. 3103 (the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill) should be opposed
because it includes the deceptively labeled "administrative simplification"
section and its related provisions. 
 
For example: 
 
1. The bill would give government and corporations access to confidential
medical information about individuals without their consent.  Violating the
privacy of medical patients is very unpopular.  The Time/CNN Poll found
that 87% of Americans "believe patients should be asked for permission
every time any information about them is used." (Time, May 6, 1996, p. 61) 
 
2. The bill creates the framework for a national medical data collection
and data transfer system, beginning with claims and billing data and
proceeding to the entire medical record.  The system will include data
processing clearinghouses, which may also serve as repositories for data. 
This would create, without any consent or control by the patient, a
"COMPUTERIZED LENDING LIBRARY" OF ALL OUR MEDICAL RECORDS, vulnerable to
being accessed by unauthorized unsuitable parties. 
 
3. The bill has THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING A UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFICATION
NUMBER UPON EVERY PATIENT, health provider, health plan, and employer,
thereby establishing a vast, bureaucracy-dictated, national ID regime, with
the new government numbers being the key to everyone's private Medical
Records. 
 
4. The bill gives new powers and duties to the National Committee on Vital
and Health Statistics, authorizing extensive new statistical studies,
including "health status" studies.  These studies no doubt will make use of
the large stores of individually identified medical information which will
now be easily obtainable (especially by this committee; see what follows). 
 
5. The bill has the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
advising the Secretary of HHS on privacy regulations, a responsibility in
conflict with its duties of data collection and analysis.  The committee,
which will be composed largely of statisticians, epidemiologists, health
services researchers and experts on computerized medical information
systems, is ill suited for protecting the patient's right to privacy and
medical record confidentiality. 
 
6. The bill will undercut state laws that protect medical privacy. 
 
HR 3103 should be rejected so long as it includes any "administrative
simplification" or related provisions. Such provisions cannot be fixed;
they must be deleted from the bill.

* ACLU Warns of Latest Government Efforts to Regulate Cyberspace; New
Global Campaign Will Monitor National, International Threats 
 
NEW YORK:  Despite a second federal court decision affirming that
censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional, the ACLU today warned of
persistent government attempts, in the U.S. and internationally, to censor
electronic communications and regulate privacy technology. 
 
At a meeting in Paris yesterday of the major U.S. allies known as "G-7,"
government leaders announced plans to strictly regulate the Internet and
other electronic communications in an effort to 
combat terrorism.  The meeting came in the wake of the bombing incident at
the Atlanta Olympics and the explosion of TWA Flight 800, which is being
investigated as a possible terrorist bombing. Participants included France,
Italy, Japan, Britain, Germany, Canada, Russia and the United States.  
 
Although not all details were made public, proposed measures apparently
include investigations of charities and political organizations with
radical political points of view -- threatening their rights to free speech
-- and using the Internet to "monitor" terrorist communications.  There was
also agreement to adopt a U.S. plan to prohibit non-key-escrowed
encryption, which would mean that individuals and companies would be barred
from using encryption technology to electronically lock up their most
private and sensitive information unless they make the keys available to
their government.   
 
In response to these and other threats to limit Internet and electronic
privacy, the Global Internet Liberty Campaign was formed last month at a
meeting of the Internet Society in Montreal. [See the GILC release below.] 
The group, which announced its formation today, will work in coalition with
organizations from around the world to share information and protect free
speech, privacy, equality of access and liberty on the global Internet. 
GILC members include the ACLU, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
Human Rights Watch, the Internet Society, Privacy International, and other
civil liberties and human rights organizations.  The ACLU is a founding
member of the group. 
 
"GILC recognizes that there are no borders in cyberspace and that decisions
made by international bodies like the G-7 nations affect all Internet
users," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.  "The U.S.
government may not accomplish through an international end-run what the
U.S. Congress and the U.S. Courts have rejected." 
 
Steinhardt cited a recent ruling by a panel of federal judges in New York
declaring that censorship in cyberspace is unconstitutional.  The decision
marked another win in the ongoing battle for free speech in cyberspace,
which saw its first major victory last month in ACLU v. Reno, when a
Philadelphia court granted a motion for preliminary injunction on
"indecency" provisions of the Communications Decency Act.   The ACLU filed
its challenge on February 8 of this year, the day the CDA was signed into
law. 
 
"We are delighted that the New York judges have joined their Philadelphia
colleagues in protecting the Internet from governmental intrusion," said
Steinhardt, who testified in the Philadelphia case.  "But we remain
concerned about the government's continuing efforts to censor electronic
speech, not only in the United States but internationally." 
 
In the U.S., Congress is now attempting to revive a proposal that would
make it a felony to disseminate information on bomb-making in print, radio,
television or in cyberspace.   Violations would be punishable by up to 20
years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. 
 
"This unconstitutional bill, rightly rejected by Congress last year, would
criminalize everything from a high school chemistry teacher explaining
basic scientific principles, to a newspaper carrying an illustration of a
bomb's construction, to a U.S. Department of Agriculture manual describing
how to make fertilizer bombs for removing tree stumps," the ACLU's
Steinhardt said. 
 
In addition, President Clinton this week announced an initiative to
increase the powers of federal investigators, including an expanded
wiretapping authority.  While the ACLU has commended the Clinton
Administration and law enforcement authorities for their investigation into
recent tragic incidents, it urged President Clinton and Congress in a
letter sent to the White House on Monday to "preserve the American spirit"
by safeguarding constitutional principles.  The ACLU has asked for a
meeting with the President and Congressional leaders to discuss continuing
civil liberties concerns in light of recent events.

*  GILC Opposes Efforts to Regulate Internet; Group Calls G-7 Efforts
Anti-Democratic 
 
The Global Internet Liberty Coalition said today that it would oppose
efforts to regulate privacy technology and free speech on the Internet. 
The announcement follows a meeting of G-7 leaders in Paris where plans were
announced to regulate the Internet in ways that threaten the Free Speech
and Privacy rights of it users. 
 
The G-7 countries include the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada and Japan. Russia also participates in the meetings of the
G-7. 
 
The G-7 proposal, while couched in careful diplomatic terms, appears to
endorse a U.S. Government initiated plan to require key escrowed encryption
on the Internet -- a scheme where the keys for decryption would be
accessible to governments.  There is also language which suggests plans to
restrict the electronic publication of information by unpopular political
organizations. 
 
Earlier attempts by officials in the US Administration to pass similar
measures through Congress have failed. 
 
Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director of the ACLU, said "The US government
may not accomplish through an international end-run what the US Congress
and the US Courts have rejected." 
 
The ACLU was lead plaintiff in the successful challenge to the
Communications Decency Act.  In that case, a US federal court held that the
government may not regulate speech on the Internet. 
 
Simon Davies, director general of Privacy International, said that the
human rights community must not permit national governments to seize
control of privacy enhancing technologies.  "National governments will use
the horrendous incidents in the States to build a international web of
surveillance to the detriment of their citizens." 
 
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, said that the proposals would meet with fierce opposition from
the Internet community.  "Net users will simply not allow governments to
trample on the rights of citizens.  Our rights to privacy and free speech
are clearly protected by international law." 
 
EPIC organized the Internet petition against the Clipper encryption scheme.

 
Cynthia Brown, program director of Human Rights Watch, said, "Free speech
on the Internet is already under attack from states like Saudi Arabia,
China and Singapore, and with this agreement, the G7 countries are only
reinforcing that negative trend." 
 
Human Rights Watch has produced a report on threats to Liberty on the
Internet. 
 
The GILC was formed at the annual meeting of the Internet Society in
Montreal.  Members of the coalition include the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, the
Internet Society, Privacy International, and other civil liberties and
human rights organizations.

It's not over yet....

The House has scheduled a vote on "suspension" for a 'counter-terrorism'
bill TODAY (Friday).

Despite media reports that the negotiations had stalled out, house
Republicans have apparently worked out their differences and are set to
vote on the bill today.  The Senate may or may not vote on the measure on
Saturday.

No one I've talked to knows for sure what's in the bill, though I have
heard that there are no encryption provisions and that some of the wiretap
proposals have been scaled back.

I will post details as I get them. In the mean time, keep those calls
coming into Congress.

The outline below is from a document produced by the House Republican
Conference.  It is ONLY A SUMMARY of the proposed bill and is NOT actual
legislation.  No one I have spoken with has seen any specific legislative
language yet.

The outline is confusing on several points, particularly the "FBI DIGITAL
TELEPHONY" Section, which says:

 "The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to
  investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding for equipment purchase was
  provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier this
  year."

The first sentence above is not at all clear, and probably won't be until
we can get our hands on the actual text of the bill. It could be additional
wiretap authority (ie, roving wiretaps), or it could be nothing.  As far as
the funding goes, the "1996 omnibus appropriations measure" DID NOT contain
funding for implementation of the law - but it did appropriate $37 million
to cover new equipment for the FBI.

The rest looks like it is a scaled back version of a measure the
Administration and members of Congress were pushing earlier this week, but
the scope of the new bill depends a lot on what the actual text says.

I will post additional information as soon as I get it.

                Bipartisan Antiterrorism Initiative
                                HR__

                     Committee on the Judiciary
                          No Report Filed
                         To Be Introduced

Floor Situation:

The House is scheduled to consider HR__ on Friday August 2, 1996. On
Thursday August 1, the Rules Committee granted a rule to allow the bill to
be considered under suspension of the rules. It is debatable for 40
minutes, may not be amended, and requires a two-thirds vote for passage.

Summary:

HR__ includes several bipartisan initiatives intended to bolster federal
efforts to combat domestic terrorism in addition to those already enacted
earlier this year as part of the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132).  The bill contains the following
counter-terrorism provisions:

Aviation SECURITY MEASURES: The bill enables domestic airports to
aggressively search for and prevent explosives from causing destruction and
harm to individuals or property through enhanced explosive detection
procedures, baggage and passenger screening, and FBI authority to improve
airport security training and standards to ensure that provisions of the
1990 Aviation Security Act (P.L 101-604) are implemented expeditiously.
Specifically, the bill (1) requires the FAA to implement increased
explosives section methods immediately, (2) strengthen the level of
training and expertise possessed by security personnel who are assigned to
domestic airports, (3) allows airports to use available funding to
reinforce such training for security personnel, and (4) extends criminal
background requirements to include a greater number of airport employees.

IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS: The bill urges
implementation of provisions enacted in the 1996 Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132), such as designating and
freezing the assets of foreign terrorist organizations and implementing
expedited removal procedures for aliens convicted of a crime.

BIPARTISAN "BLUE RIBBON" COMMISSION: The bill establishes a special
commission to review all aspects of U.S. anti-terrorism policy and make
legislative recommendations about methods to most effectively establish a
long-term defense against terrorist threats, including enhancing the
nation's human intelligence capabilities.

PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENTS: The bill includes provisions which grant a cause of
action against the U.S. if in the course of a wiretap investigation
damaging information is willfully disclosed to the detriment of an innocent
party by the federal government.  The cause of action includes monetary
damages to the plaintiff if a favorable decision is rendered in federal
court.

EXPLOSIVES STUDY: The bill authorizes a study on black and smokeless powder
by an independent agency selected by the National Institute of Justice.

FEDERAL RACKETEERING STATUTE CRIMES: The bill permits federal prosecutors
to deem those acts determined to be terrorist in nature as substantial
enough to invoke criminal prosecution under existing criminal racketeering
(RICO) statutes.

FBI DIGITAL TELEPHONY: The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced
telephone technology to investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding
for equipment purchase was provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations
measure enacted earlier this year.

Check out this quote by Rep. Charles Schumer I found in an article by CNN:

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

The article also reports:

"Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

"They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties."

U.S. anti-terrorism talks collapse
But proposals could resurface

August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 9:30 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) --
Congressional efforts to draft new anti-terrorism legislation before the
August recess a the end of the week collapsed Thursday night in a partisan
stalemate. But lawmakers said
there is hope for agreement after the monthlong break.

Key members of the Senate blamed House conservatives for the failure,
saying they had insisted on linking proposed new wiretapping authority
for the FBI to an expansion of privacy laws.

"There's no possibility of anything to be signed before the recess," Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Delaware, said after the last series of meetings on the
issue broke up.

"It's over," said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York as the sixth meeting
between White House and congressional negotiators ended. The House
Republican leaders "have come up with this smokescreen called
privacy," said Schumer, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime.

Although Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
and Biden, the panel's top Democrat, said there no longer seemed to be a
possibility of passing a bill before the recess, they thought it could be
done before Congress adjourns for the year.

Hatch said negotiators had agreed on a dozen issues, but key requests by
the administration for new wiretap authority and for a broader study of
using chemicals in gunpowder to help trace it were not among them.

Worries about privacy

Conservative House members had demanded that people under investigation by
law authorities be able to sue individual officers for wrongful collection
of private information.

They linked their request to the much-publicized improper acquisition
by the White House of hundreds of confidential FBI files. Biden said the
Justice Department said it could not agree on such penalties.

"The White House is not free of blame here. They want it immediately;
we can give it to them in early September," said Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, who heads the bipartisan task force that has been negotiating
with administration officials.

Craig, who had hoped for House and Senate votes on a new
anti-terrorism package before the recess, declined to declare defeat
Thursday evening. Asked whether passage was still possible, he said, "I
hope so."

President Clinton has urged Congress to take quick action, because of the
Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta and the crash of TWA
=46light 800, suspected to have been caused by a bomb.

The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

The House passed a revised counter-terrorism bill this afternoon by a
substantial majority.  The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate
on Saturday 8/3, and is likely to pass.

The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening
provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from
the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI
objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap
authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed
bill.

In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. Earlier
in the week, the Administration had circulated an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. It's nice to finally have a number of powerful
allies joining the usual defenders of net.freedom on Capitol Hill.

The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a controvertial provisions expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.

The bill also contains a small but not insigificant privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.

This is not over yet -- many of these issues, particularly encryption and
Digital Telephony funding, are likely to be back before the Congress in
September, so stay tunned...

Thanks to everyone who called Congress today to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
mave had really made a difference in this debate.

More as it comes...

Stop the presses -- the other shoe didn't drop. Despite a flurry of
last-minute hyperbole, the House passed an anti-terrorism bill this
afternoon without the ominous encryption or wiretap provisions. Now
the bill lies in the lap of the Senate, which probably will approve it
later today or tomorrow before they leave town for the August recess.

In the wake of the dual bombings, Congress wanted to be seen as taking
*some* action before they adjourned, and last weekend Clinton and the
Dems started lobbying hard for the heinous measures they wanted in an
anti-terrorism bill. Vastly expanded state-snooping capabilities:
multipoint wiretaps, warrantless short-term wiretaps, dialed-phone
number recorders, and black and smokeless powder taggants. Even
possible of anti-crypto language that Jamie Gorelick, deputy attorney
general, has been shopping around for months.

The Net owes its thanks to the House Republicans for stopping these
fool Dems in a fine backroom political maneuver late last night.

They did it through the House Rules Committee, which in the wee hours
of the morning reported a rule allowing the GOP leadership to introduce
the terrorism bill on the floor today -- without letting Democrats see
it, amend it, or even send it back to committee. It was a good plan --
coordinated by Rep. Chris Cox -- keeping the legislation away from the
hands of the Big Brother Dems.

The Democrats waxed pissy. Rep. David Bonior, the party's whip, called
the majority's maneuvering "extrordinary." John Conyers, the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, blasted Gingrich and the
Republican leadership for "bringing a meaningless bill to the House
floor."

Conyers said to reporters at 1 pm: "It's a hoax on the American
people. It is all bark and no bite... This bill is missing the
important wiretapping provisions that would allow law enforcement to
find and stop terrorists before they kill. The House Republicans and
the NRA say we should not have emergency authority for surveillance
even if we know terrorists are about to blow a plane out of the sky.
They also say that we should not have wiretap authority for terrorists who
use more than one telephone to make their deadly plans."

Of course, this is political grandstanding at its finest -- or worst.
Conyers conveniently neglected to add that law enforcement officers
already have the right to use roving wiretaps with court approval.

Also, there was a mixup over Digital Telephony funding, compounded by
the text of the legislation's being kept secret until the last minute.
Summaries distributed to reporters early this afternoon said: "The bill
authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to investigate
suspected terrorist activity. Funding for equipment purchase was
provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier
this year." But the DT provisions weren't in the final draft of the bill.

Silly Congressperns. The House had *already* approved the DT slushfund
on July 24 as part of the 1997 Commerce, Justice, State departments
appropriations bill.

Now the 1997 CJS appropriations bill goes to the Senate, which will
decide how much cash to give Digital Telephony when they return in early
September.

What's going to happen? Well, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), a former
prosecutor and longtime proponent of Digital Telephony, said yesterday
at the Intelligence Committee hearing on terrorism: "I was proud to
have worked with the FBI director to ensure passage of the
Communications Assisatance for Law Enforcement Act, sometimes called
the digital telephony law."

With Republicans like the ones in the House, who needs so-called "civil
libertarian" Democrats?

Joe, I was a staffer on Jerry Brown's 1992 presidental campaign in Santa 
Monica and NYC. I'm hardly an uncritical supporter of the Republicans.

However, I believe in giving credit where it is due, and they deserve our 
thanks this week. Next week the opposite may be true when the Republicans 
conspire to trample on our free expression rights.

But the undercurrent of political posturing worked in our favor for a
change and we should welcome the reprive. Why are the Dems being
anti-civil-lib suddenly? My first thought is because one of their own is
in the White House, overseeing the DoJ, running for re-election, so Dems
are closing ranks. They also seem truly to enjoy being the "law-and-order"
party for a change.

This was picked up by the local Fox affiliate, Channel 5, and headlined 
on the 10 pm news yesterday.

I was sitting in my living room with a friend -- we had just finished
watching a rather poor episode of X-Files -- and we looked at each other
and sighed as Fox detailed how the investigation had shifted to a small
Georgia college where Jewell was a security guard. "Investigators are
trying to determine whether he downloaded bomb-making information from the
Internet while working at the college." 

This is a very virulent meme.

The Senate left without voting on the anti-terrorism bill. This is not

  County Accuses Four of Using the Internet to Access Child Porn
  --------------------------------------------------------------

By Ronald K. Fitten
Seattle Times Staff Reporter

Four men, including two former Microsoft employees, have been charged
with allegedly using computers to access child pornography on the
Internet, said King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.

"Traditional law-enforcement efforts against child pornography have
focused on magazines, movies, and tangible materials," Maleng said
yesterday.  "But law enforcement faces new challenges with the
emergence of new technology.  The Internet, with its millions of
international web sites, has become the new underground highway for
illegal child pornography."

The two former Microsoft engineers, Michael Seaman, 37, of Kirkland,
and Ronald Rosul Jr., 31, of Seattle, allegedly used Microsoft
computers to access and copy child pornography from the Internet,
according to prosecutors.

[...]

Both Seaman and Rosul will be arraigned next week in King County
Superior Court.  If convicted, both could receive up to one year in
jail.

Maleng, who said police and prosecutors worked cooperatively with
Microsoft throughout the investigation, said law-enforcement officers
had confiscated computer hard drives, CD-ROMs, and printed materials
as evidence.

Found this buried deep in the long version of an AP story about the
Atlanta pipe bomb suspect:

      Bomb-making instructions available through the global computer
      network have contributed to an increase in bombings in the United
      States, authorities say. 

Did I miss the news story where that contribution was identified?  Or is 
the AP mis-stating what their FBI "expert" said on Monday.

Incidentally, the source for the oft-repeated statement that the FBI was 
"trying to determine whether Jewell may have had access to the campus
Internet" [sic] is not in the FBI; it's someone on the campus who believes
that that's what the FBI is doing.

	Police wanted to secure the building. Reporters wanted to file

House approves anti-terrorism bill
By Rose Aguilar

August 2, 1996, 6:15 p.m. PST

          The United States House of Representatives tonight approved the
          Anti-Terrorism act of 1996 by a sweeping 389 to 22 vote, but to
          the relief of Net activists passed a version free of amendments
          that would have regulated Net content, restricted encryption
          technology, and expanded the use of wiretapping.

          The Democrats fought hard for the encryption, Internet, and
          wiretapping provisions, but lost to arguments from
          conservatives and libertarians that the provisions would be an
          infringement of citizens' First Amendments rights. The law that
          was approved by the house also did not include the amendment
          re-introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would have made
          it a felony to publish information about bombs and bomb-making
          on the Internet.

[...]

          The anti-terrorism section of the bill adds several
          terrorism-related crimes to the list of offenses included in
          the federal antiracketeering law. Under this section, the
          penalty for unlawful disclosure of information obtained from a
          wiretap doubles from 5 to 10 years.

          The bill went to the Senate today. Supporters would like the
          bill to be approved without changes and then sent to the
          President. The Senate may vote as early as Saturday or may
          decide to make changes and wait to approve its own version
          until next month.

          "I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said online
          activist Declan McCullagh. "The Senate may or may not act
          tomorrow, but I think the Net has a reprieve from the Net
          crackdown in terms of bomb information until September," he
          said.

Louis Freeh beats his fear-mongering drum while singing his wiretap tune....


From: http://www.cnn.com

FBI chief: U.S. 'under attack' by terrorists
August 1, 1996
Web posted at: 6:05 p.m. EDT

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States may face "a very difficult time"
coping with terrorists, and new counter-terrorism weapons are needed,
FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.

On expanded wiretap powers being sought by the FBI as part of that
defense, he said: "We're simply trying to catch up with technology. And
that is critical."

[ ... ]

He referred to the two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 24
servicemen; the bombing that killed one woman at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta; and the still-unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800.

Although the combined incidents have "completely consumed" law
enforcement personnel, Freeh said the wiretap proposals would not give
the government "expansive powers" and would not lead to "an avalanche of
new electronic surveillance."

"The United States and its interests both here and around the world are
clearly under attack. And we may be in for a very difficult time with
respect to continuation of these types of things," Freeh said.

Anti-terrorism negotiations

Freeh spoke a day after the White House, after wrangling with key
Republican lawmakers, won tentative agreement on a package of
anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority.

[ ... ]

The negotiators, led by Craig and White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, hoped to have a package ready for a vote by the end of the
week.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders summoned
Attorney General Janet Reno, Panetta and Freeh to a private meeting
Thursday to explain why some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't
been spent.

"We have been somewhat behind in the hiring of people" for
anti-terrorism programs, because of the time needed to screen applicants
for such sensitive work, Freeh explained during his Senate testimony
Thursday.

NETCOM SETTLES SUIT WITH CHURCH

Out-of-court deal with Scientologists

BY MARK LEIBOVICH
Mercury News Staff Writer

A lawsuit that many in the online community feared would set a
precedent restricting freedom of expression on the internet was
resolved quitely Saturday in an out-of-court settlement in San
Jose.

Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc. announced it has
settled the intellectual property dispute initiated by
Religious Technology Center, the publishing wing of the Church
of Scientology.

RTC had brought a claim against Netcom, seeking to prohibited
what is viewed as illegal postings of sacred church writings,
some of which it claimed were protected under US copyright
laws.  Both parties agreed not to disclose specific details
of the settlement.

According to a statement, Netcom as set up a protocol on its
company home page for handling future intellectual property
disputes.

[...]

The full text of the protocol can be found on Netcom's home
page, at
http://www.netcom.com/about/protectcopy.html

[...]

"I would hate to see Netcom be put in the position of having
to police the material posted on its service," says Howard
Rheingold, a well-known digital community guru, and author of
the 1993 book Virtual Community, who is not familiar with the
details of the case.

AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into
the computers of the European parliament and
European commission as part of an international
espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and
political secrets, according to investigators, write
Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. 

The European parliament has called in British
communications experts to improve its security and
to block further attempts by American govern ment
agents to spy on its workings. 

Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg
offices say they have discovered several recent
instances in which its communications system was
compromised by American hacking. They have also
found evidence that the Americans used information
obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations
last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt). 

Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the
European parliament, said he was shocked by the
disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the
American ambassador [to the European Union]," he
said. 

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese
and French governments of hacking into their
communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets. 

The European parliament's computer network links
more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and
other staff to each other, and to the European
commission headquarters in Brussels and the council
of ministers. 

Traffic across the network by telephone and
computers includes details of the private medical
and financial records of many MEPs and officials,
and discussion documents on confidential issues,
including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The
records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE
and fraud are also stored on the system. 

European parliament sources say the Americans
accessed the network by compromising the
information exchanges that link the parliament's
internal networks with the Internet and external
users. 

The devices, called "routers", filter entry to the
European parliament's network. It is understood the
Americans were able to obtain access to what is
called the simple network management protocol
(SNMP), the language that enables the networks to
talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact
that parts of the system were manufactured by two
American firms. 

The breach came to light when officials believed
that American negotiators had been given advance
warning of confidential European Union positions
in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established
that the system had been penetrated just days before
the talks," an EU source said. "Our principal
concern is not to establish what has already been
copied but to ensure that it does not happen again.
This is an on-going problem." 

A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of
data processing at the commission, confirmed that
allegations of hacking had been investigated.
However, she said she was unable to provide any
details.

as part of a defense authorization appropriations bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of 
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.
                  
   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

This is the truly astonishing thing to me about terrorism in America. If,
at least for the sake of argument, the goal of terrorism in America is to
weaken the country through such attacks, it's phenomenally stupid to hand
terrorists a victory on a silver platter by gutting our Constitution as our
response.

Why bother to bring down the American government when the American
government can do a pretty good job of peeling way the nation's alleged
principles all on it own in the name of political brownie points?

           O'REILLY ANNOUNCES "NETACTIVISM" GUIDE TO
           USING THE INTERNET IN GRASSROOTS POLITICS
  Veteran Grassroots Activist Shares the Secrets of Online Success

SEBASTOPOL, CA--It's no secret that the American citizen is fed up with
politics as usual. Fewer people are voting in every election, and those
who do vote aren't sure it matters. During this presidential primary
season, noted Internet publisher O'Reilly & Associates is releasing in
"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet," a book that will show
ordinary people who want to reclaim politics--from the neighborhood to
the national level--how to use the power of the Internet to make a
difference.

Written by veteran political activist and former Philadelphia city
councilman Ed Schwartz, "NetActivism" is a no-hype guide that shows
readers how to use the Internet to find out what the government really
does, as well as how to organize around a cause or a community with
online tools like electronic mailing lists, online debates, and Web
sites.

A leader in citizen movements for more than 30 years, author Schwartz
embraced the Internet not because it's cool, but because it gets the
job done. He has an extensive online presence: a Web site
(http://libertynet.org/community/phila/natl.html) that serves community
activists across the country, a mailing list that discusses civic
values, and ties to a community network that organizes citizens across
the city of Philadelphia. "NetActivism" features real-world examples
from Schwartz's Institute for Civic Values and a host of other citizen
groups, including the Downtown Minneapolis Residents Association and
Project VoteSmart.

Community activists, politicians--and any concerned citizens who care
about their community--will find "NetActivism" packed with advice on
conducting online research, getting the right equipment and software,
using online networks in local communities, and crafting political
campaigns on the Net.

"NetActivism: How Citizens Use the Internet" will be released on
September 24. Produced by O'Reilly affiliate Songlione Studios for
O'Reilly's Songline Guide imprint, "NetActivism" includes a CD-ROM with
Internet software and limited free online time.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Ed Schwartz, founder and president of the Institute for the Study of
Civic Values, has been a national leader in movements to revitalize
neighborhoods and expand citizen participation in government for more
than 25 years.  In the 1970s, he built a city-wide coalition of
community organizations that led to his upset election to the
Philadelphia City Council as a councilman-at-large in 1984. Between
1987 and 1992, he served as director of Philadelphia's Office of
Housing and Community Development, overseeing the rehabilitation of
more than 4,000 houses and apartments for low-income residents of the
City. In 1992, he returned to the Institute for the Study of Civic
Values full-time to develop new models for community planning and
citizen empowerment for the 1990's.

Dr. Schwartz, who received his Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers
University, has written widely on problems related to civic
participation, neighborhood development, and America's democratic
heritage. His first book, "Will the Revolution Succeed?" has been
followed by articles and reviews in The New York Times Book Review, The
Nation, The American Prospect, Shelterforce, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
and The Philadelphia Daily News. The work of the Institute for the
Study of Civic Values itself is profiled extensively in Robert Bellah's
award-winning book, "Habits of the Heart."

Bryan,

I've taken the liberty of forwarding your note, along with my prepended
comments, to the fight-censorship mailing list.

I confess I'm not sure what recourse you have now that GeoCities has killed
your web site's graphics. Their current policy says that "nudity or
pornographic material of any kind" is verboten. Do you have the URLs to
other nude sites that remain on GeoCities?

At http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homeguide.html, I found:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a summary of things that are not permitted as part of
the GeoCities free Personal Home Page Program:

1.Material that is grossly offensive to the Web community including
blatant expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity

2.Pages that promote or provide instructional information about illegal
activities

3.Pages that promote physical harm or injury against any group or
individual

4.The use of free Personal Home Pages for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the following:

Soliciting for advertisers or sponsors

Displaying a sponsorship banner of any kind, including those that are
generated by "banner exchange" services

Displaying banners for services that provide cash or cash-equivalent
prizes to users in exchange for hyperlinks to their web site.

Conducting raffles or contests that require any type of entry fee

5.Pages that contain nudity or pornographic material of any kind

6.Pages that exploit images of children under 18 years of age

7.Restricted or Password-only access pages

8.Hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible
page)

9.Use of the page (or directory) as storage for remote loading

10.Use of the page as a door or signpost to another server

11.Use of copyrighted material without the prior permission from the
author
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.

Does anyone else have any insights?

Subject: censorship at www.geocities.com

Over a month ago I responded to a soliciation for a free personal home page
from www.geocities.com (which is advertised on their home page). They are
promoting theme-based neighborhoods for the home pages. The only content
guidelines were that nothing injurious to any person or group is permitted.
Based on those guidlelines, I felt the server a safe place to display my art
work and I placed my drawings of male nudes on an available address in
GeoCities' WestHollywood neighborhood. I have noticed other sites on
GeoCities with an equal amount of nudity. The only difference was my site
displayed the blue ribbon online freedom icon with a link to the EFF site.

Well, 30 days  and 10,000 hits to my site later (I heavily promoted my site
with listings in many art related directories), I awakened one morning to a
barage of e-mail from people informing me my site had been stripped of all
its graphics--everything from the blue ribbon icon to my nude art work, only
part of which contained male frontal nudity, to the photo of myself
fully-clothed. Later I was to receive an impersonal e-mail notification from
 GeoCities informing me that I was violating their content guidelines which
they now claim prohibit nudity (which I did not find in their posted
guidelines all the while other nude sites remain on GeoCities).

I am very distressed that after all my work and sincere efforts to produce a
tasteful site (which I received many e-mail compliments on wordwide),  I
would have it stripped bare in Nazi style of all the graphics, the essence of
my artistic energy.

Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
of expression in art and lifestyles.

Usually, tracking international net-censorship efforts is depressing.
However, this UPI report on the pissing match between N. Korea and S. Korea
made me laugh aloud. The North Koreans are posturing brilliantly -- truly
trying to force Seoul's hand, and using the Net to do it.

        TOKYO, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea's official news agency blasted
South Korea Tuesday for allegedly blocking its citizens' access to a new
Internet page sponsored by Pyongyang, a report monitored in Tokyo said.
        ``What they (Seoul) should block is not the North Korean Page but the
U.S. channel dealing with methods of murder and robbery and pornographic
scenes too shameful to watch,'' the Korean Central News Agency dispatch
said.
        The KCNA report quoted researcher Kim Hyong-sok of the Information
and Culture Center of North Korea as saying the history of the Internet
has seen no example of people being punished for monitoring certain
sites.
        ``Such punishment would cause bitter condemnation from the
international community,'' said Kim.
        Bristling with slogans about the ``great leader comrade Kim Il-sung,''
the Internet page has upset South Korean leaders, said KCNA, to the
point of having access to the site banned.
        ``The puppet Agency for National Security Planning and Prosecution
officially asked the Internet service organ in South Korea to block the
channel,'' said the KCNA report.
        The North Korean mouthpiece said the officials in Seoul should not
``trouble themselves'' because they do not have the equipment to block
the Internet page anyway.

[So Malaysia will censor only material that some government bureaucrat
finds "offensive?" What a commitment to free speech! Cynically, Declan]


         KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Reuter) - Malaysia on Thursday
unveils plans for a ``multimedia super corridor'' (MSC), which it
hopes will attract a new breed of foreign investors and propel
the country into the 21st century.

[...]

         [Proj director] Azzman said Malaysia would guarantee the
free flow of information. Sceptics have questioned that commitment in
a country where newspapers are licensed and the Printing and
Publications Act has been used to muzzle dissent.
         ``We have not censored the Internet, so the free flow of
information is very much the order of the day,'' said Azzman who
is director general of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronic Systems, a government agency that provides sole
access to the Internet in the country.
         ``We won't police what they do as long as it is within the
confines of the company,'' he said, adding companies in the MSC
can receive information from abroad, process it and then
transmit it out of the country without interference.
         The government would act only if illegal or offensive
materials like pornography were distributed within Malaysia.
         Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had agreed to set up a
regional office after meeting Mahathir last month. A ``couple of
dozen'' others have expressed ``keen interest'', Azzman said.
         The corridor would link the new airport and the futuristic
Putrajaya federal capital with the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, a
mammoth office highrise project featuring the Petronas Towers,
the world's tallest buildings.

   BEIJING -- When it comes to controlling the Internet, China is
trying to learn from a little neighbor.
   In June, Beijing sent Zeng Jianhui, a top official, to Singapore to
pick up tips on expanding the use of the Internet within strict
limits. Singapore, a critic of unfettered dissent and Western culture,
is trying to become the network's model censor.
   ``China has a lot to learn from Singapore's experience,'' says a
Chinese government official studying Internet restrictions.

[...]

   Worried that the new electronic communications medium is spinning
out of its control and could undermine Communist propaganda, the
Chinese leadership decided in February to put teeth into Internet
regulations and prevent computer-disseminated pornography and
antigovernment material.
   The government is uneasy about cyberspace connections between
overseas democracy activists and Chinese dissidents, which blossomed
during political protests on the streets of Beijing and other major
cities during the spring of 1989. The few Chinese activists who are
not imprisoned or under detention are closely watched amid a
government crackdown on crime and political unrest.

[...]

   ``This is not having any negative effect on the Internet's
development in China,'' says Wang Jun, an official in the
telecommunications ministry's data communication bureau. ``It's just a
precautionary procedure.''

[...]

   In May, China launched a nationwide computer network that allows
only limited access to the Internet. The venture aims to avoid
breaking China's censorship laws by creating its own content and
making available only information useful for businesses.
   The new edited network, which is 60 percent owned by the official
New China News Agency and was launched in conjunction with the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, does not face a censorship
problem because ``there is nothing illegal on the network,'' says
Joyce Wong, an executive with the Hong Kong-based China Internet Corp.

CSIS Calls Itself Canadas Political Police & States ARA Torched
Zundels House

Since the outrageously biased Heritage Front Affair Report published by
the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), a group of appointed
political has-beens and bagmen, we have had serious concerns that
Canadas security apparatus is utterly out of control and is spying
wholesale and contrary to the CSIS Act on legitimatre, non-violent
dissent. Some very disturbing confirmation of our fears has recently
come our way.

In February of this year, Kitchener, Ontario electronics businessman
Michael Rothe  was interviewed by two CSIS agents, who identified
themselves to him as such and showed ID. They were identified as Peter
and Angela. Rothe had organized several meetings in Kitchener for
British historian David Irving, who has since, under pressure from the
censorship lobby been banned from Canada, while planeloads of Tamil
terrorists and Jamican drug pushers and gunsels seem to have open access
to this country. The interview was taped. The revelations on thios tape
are staggering.

ANGELA: Have you heard of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service?
PETER: You can bet its real!.... Ill explain what we are. First, the
Canadian Security Intelligence service is like the BFK in Germany.
These are the dreaded so-called Federal  Constitution Protection  Police
(Bundesverfassungsschutz), which spy on the German right and are
blatantly a political police force. Just in case the frightened German
immigrant didnt get the point, Peter added: Were the political
police. Angela and I are from the counter-terrorism branch. ... We are
interested in the Heritage Front. He was then asked a number of
questions as to how he got involved in politics, how hed been contacted
by the Hereitage Front andf what he thought of this group, which CSIS,
through its agent Grant Bristow had helped fund and lead!
PETER: Did you ever meet Paul Fromm. Hes C-FAR and CAFE. The school
teacher from Mississauga. He would have been at the this David Irving
[meeting]. False!!!. Fromm was actually in Vancouver that day.
PETER: In Toronto, Wolfgang [Droege of the Heritage Front] has beren
much troubled by a group that calls itself Anti-Racist Action, ARA. This
is a collection of anarchists, Trotskyists, Stalinists.
ANGELA: The ARA that Peter described firebombed Ernst Zundel. Im sure
youve heard about the problem various leaders of the so-called right
wing have received firebombs. Shes apparently referring to the May 7,
1995 arson attack on Ernst Zundels Toronto residence/office, and
firebombings of Don Andrews and Nicola Polinuk.
PETER: So, were interested to know, ... were there ever  threats made
to you? That ought to put the fear of the Lord into him,

So, here we have CSISs descriptin of themselves as a political
police. Frightening! Then. theres the clear assertion that the
perpetratrors of the fire at Zundels and the firebombings in spring,
1995, were the ARA. If so, why havent they been arrested? Are they
being protected by the Canadian security establishment? Readers should
contact Solicitor-General Herb Gray and ask these questions. Ontario
readers should contact Solicitor-General Bob Runciman and ask why, in
light of this information, no charges have been laid by the Metropolitan
Toronto Police in these clearly political acts of terrorism. Had such an
attack been perpetrated on the offices of one the currently privileged
minoiorities, is there any doubt that every rightwinger to the starboard
of Joe Clark would have been hauled in for questioning?

            G7 THREAT TO ONLINE FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY

      IN THE NAME OF COMBATING TERRORISM THE G7 IS PLANNING TO

SUMMARY

On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.

This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.

* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.

* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.

* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.

______________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND

This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.

Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.

In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.

Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.

Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export.
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography.
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.

What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.

2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this
   release for contact information for several such organisations.

3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:

&gt; What you might want to do is publicize this well, and then move your site
&gt; to a less sensitive ISP such as Netcom.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else have any insights?

I have a friend whose site containing nudity was treated in a very
similar way:  Wendy.

	http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4750

She had some beautifully tasteful partial nudes of herself on her
page; I would consider them erotic, not pornographic.  Unlike 
thie site in question here, I'd say that the main intent was to
show viewers a good time; there was essentially no content other
than the pictures.

When the hit counter went through the roof, they found her site and
apparently warned her a couple of times about its content not being
acceptable.  But she also played a mean trick on another Internet
user, which probably also contributed to her deletion.  It was apparently
some sort of revenge thing; I'm not sure who's right and who's wrong.
In my communications with her, I considered her a rather sweet lady
but not too frightfully verbal.  She certainly talked quite clearly
with her pictures, which revealed a stunningly perfect body.

I helped organize a brief protest campaign to Geocities which apparently
resulted in the reinstatement of her page, sans a few of the "best"
pictures.  And there, as far as I know, it remains.

The lesson from this would seem to be that you can probably get
Geocities to bend if you have enough friends.  (I probably don't
need to tell any of you here that being a gorgeous 25 year old girl
who loves to show off her body is one great way of acquiring
instant friends &lt;grin&gt;).

I hope this helps!

Best
D

&gt;Perhaps I have little legal recourse since GeoCities was sponsoring the disk
&gt;space (which I credited with their logo and a link back to them). But I do
&gt;sense great deception on their part with a theme-based neighborhood like
&gt;"West Hollywood", which in the real world is a locale known for its freedom
&gt;of expression in art and lifestyles.

As a free service, Geocities has the right to determine which pages it
decides to sponsor.  This is not a good incident to espouse free speech
principles.

Two prime examples of site with PHOTOS  containng male frontal nudity on
GeoCities are:

Rob's Bound & Gagged
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3100

contains graphic photos of sadomaochism showing male genetalia

Nude Celebrities
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3102

My site only contained abstract pencil drawings with no sexual activity
portrayed.

There are dozens of sites containing nudity on GeoCities and obviously
something else is going on here.

Certainly, GeoCities has the right to determine which pages it decides to
sponsor. It may even have the right to offer the pages on on basis and then
pull them off under a new set of rules, after the page creator has invested
time in making them and publicizing their location. (I have the impression
from the initial message that this is what happened - can someone who knows
clarify this point?)

However, that does not mean they're not slimy for causing this kind of
unnecessary inconvenience, and it doesn't mean they shouldn't be called on
their acts and others who might be considering dealing with them alerted to
the possibility of a problem.

I personally would like to hear from GeoCities on why they chose to pull
the pages off. Did their policy change at any point, and if so, why did
they change it?

Um... and what would that be? Please go on. Obviously there is some

Yes, but it's not necessarily something sinister.  From the evidence
I've seen GeoCities is just responding to the "squeaky wheels."  When
a page gets a pile of hits they check it out.  I'm not especially
impressed with the actions they're taking, but I doubt there's any
plot to stifle free thinking on the net.

Get this one.  I just heard it on the afternoon news.  Two young boys were
seriously burned after a failed attempt at making napalm on their kitchen
stove.  Sounds like the normal fun activities of bored youth on summer break
right?  But hey - where did they get the recipe?  From the Anarchists
Cookbook in the library?  No - they got it from -- GASP -- the Anarchists
Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
-- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
sort of convention) are deciding whether or not to press charges.  See -
just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

We have a four-week reprieve until the Senate returns. As I say in the
full article at the URL below, they've been worse than the House when it
comes to wiretapping/crypto/censorship. For instance, senators already
passed the Feinstein Amendment banning bomb-making info (on- and off-line)
as part of a defense appropriations authorization bill.

Waiting Game
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
Washington, DC, 5 August

   In a last-minute legislative crunch before the summer recess, House
   Republicans on Friday outmaneuvered their Democratic counterparts and
   coughed up a surprisingly reasonable anti-terrorism bill, which the
   Senate will act on when Congress returns next month.

[...]

   But the Senate has begun its own four-week vacation without voting on
   the measure, and they'll have plenty of time to reintroduce the
   missing [wiretapping] language when they return.

   The outlook, frankly, is dismal, says Don Haines of the American Civil
   Liberties Union. "The Senate has been much more interested in giving
   the FBI a blank check. They've been much more sympathetic to
   increasing wiretapping. They've been much less interested in
   protecting privacy," Haines said.

[...]

   Meanwhile, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) - a staunch opponent of
   the Communications Decency Act - continues to tout his Digital
   Telephony legislation, which he shepherded through Congress in 1994...

   Perhaps Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president,
   had it right when he said last week: "If we're not careful, half of
   the Bill of Rights will fall victim to the frantic desire of
   Republican and Democratic politicians to appear tough on terrorists."

   The last few years have seen several murderous acts of terror on
   American soil - and now, with the explosion of TWA Flight 800, in
   American airspace. Americans should brace themselves for even more...
   Whether the terror is foreign or domestic in origin, one thing's for
   certain: cries for a government crackdown will mount.

   But by granting their government police-state powers, Americans will
   have awarded terrorists their first substantial victory in the United
   States.

Law Professor Sues Federal Government
Over Computer Privacy Issues

Federal Civil Rights Action Seeks Injunction Against 
State Department And National Security Agency

Cleveland Scholar Attacks Prohibition On Discussing 
Cryptographic Software With Foreign Students And Colleagues

     A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
     federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict
     his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a
     twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a
     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

     The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military
     technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which
     encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet,
     is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control.
     The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by
     defining "export" to include discussing technical information about
     non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students
     registered for Professor Junger's course.

     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

     Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on
     the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans
     to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this
     fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach,
     and to whom.

     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Folks, I apologize for the mail problems. I still haven't quite figured 
out exactly what happened -- I'm not at home, but in NYC on business, so 
I wasn't able to log on this evening until now.

Seems as though the problem happened when I forwarded a fight-censorship
message to cypherpunks, which has among its subscribers a nonexistent
address at axcess.net.in. For some reason, a poorly-configured machine at
axcess.net.in started repeatedly resending the forwarded message back to
fight-censorship. Odd. I think I've blocked it from doing it again. 

I blame the problem on AOL, of course.

On a topic more germane to the list, I was in Times Square with Glenn and
some NYC webperns this evening, having dinner in a delightful greasy
burger joint. For no apparent reason, a woman sitting next to me started
to describe, in painstaking detail, how to kill someone with a hatpin. (A
jab to the nerve center in the solar plexus, if you must know.)

I started to think to myself, especially after Dara's note earlier, that 
this kind of material should be banned! Censor biology texts on the Net!

Yours in protecting children from dangerous knowledge,

Declan

        Sure, I'll get flamed....


        But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?), and
therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
weapon every year...

        ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
extrapolation) dangerous?

Subject: Washington Post letter by Sen. Burns

     Sen. Burns' letter to The Washington Post today contained something of 
     an error, in case you couldn't tell.
     
     A line from the original letter was deleted.
     
     The line that read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights" 
     should instead read, "Second, the administration's proposal to seek a 
     copy of decoder 'keys' for our electronic information is not simply an 
     extension of current wiretapping authority, it is a drastic expansion. 
     it lays the groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights."
     
     Fortunately, the overall meaning of the letter is left largely intact.

                      `SPEAKING IN CODE ON THE INTERNET'
   
   Friday, August 9 1996; Page A16
   The Washington Post
   
   
   The Post's editorial July 27 on my Pro-CODE bill to ease restrictions
   on encoded, or "encrypted," computer messages ["Speaking in Code on
   the Internet"] was generally balanced but deleted a couple of key
   points.
   
   First, my bill would not "lift" restrictions on the export of strong
   encryption technology, which is designed to allow people to protect
   their computer files and messages. Instead, it would allow the
   Commerce Department merely to ease export restrictions to a level of
   computer security that it deems is "generally available" in the
   nations we trade with.
   
   This bill does not open the floodgates. Instead, it is an
   acknowledgment of the real world and that high-tech U.S. companies
   must be allowed to compete in an increasingly vital sector of the
   world economy. One trade group stated the United States stands to lose
   $60 billion in market share and 216,000 jobs under the current
   restrictions.
   
   Second, the administration's proposal to seek a copy of decoder "keys"
   for our electronic information is not simply an extension of the
   groundwork for drastic breaches of privacy rights. Imagine a Craig
   Livingstone or an Aldrich Ames being designated the "trusted third
   party" who holds the keys.
   
   Supporters of my bill have never maintained that some criminals will
   not attempt to use encryption to evade law enforcement. But the bill
   is an attempt to address the encryption status quo, not some long-ago
   world to which the FBI would like to return. (FBI Director Louis Freeh
   stated in the hearing July 25 that he would even like to restrict
   encryption imports.)
   
   While the White House indicates it might be willing to give people
   stronger encryption, it insists that the trade-off must be a copy of
   our decoder keys. It's a deal Americans will never accept and a plan
   that has yet to be proven feasible.
   
   Denying millions of law-abiding people the use of a legitimate and
   increasingly necessary security product for "law enforcement" reasons
   is like banning deadbolt locks because they make it a little harder to
   kick down the doors of a few drug dealers.

&gt; &gt; Cookbook on the Internet.  Authorities (and a myriad of censor happy wackos
&gt; &gt; -- most of which heard about the story on their way to California for some
&gt; &gt; sort of convention)
Excuse me?  Last I heard, Feinstein (who wouldn't be caught dead in SD this
week&gt;, was sponsoring the worst censorship bill currently in Congress.  
And, lest we forget, Sen. Exon was (and is) a Democrat.  Sure, there are 
censors in the Republican Party (can you say Christian Coalition?), but 
that's a rather wide brush you're painting the Republicans with.  On the 
net, party lines don't quite fit.  As I think we've discussed here and 
elsewhere, it's net.experience that is the divider.

&gt; &gt; just one more example of how the Internet rots your mind, corrupts the
&gt; &gt; morals of young souls and causes madness and mayhem.
No truer words were ever spoken &lt;g&gt;, speaking as one of the corrupted 
myself... :)

&gt;         But, I'm wondering: how is it possible that, in a country where
&gt; you can buy an AK47 as easily as a PC and modem (more easily?)
Uhhhh... no.  The last time I went to Computer City, I didn't have to 
have a criminal background check or wait five days.  Actually, in VA, we 
don't have to wait 5 days, but that doesn't matter.  Back-of-the-truck 
sales, like you must be referring to, are illegal anyway, and if the 
police would enforce current laws, we might not have to worry about that.

&gt; therefore where there must be a few dozen thousand accidental death by
&gt; weapon every year...
More like &lt;maximum&gt; a few thousand over several years.  Remember, there 
are a hell of a lot more accidental car deaths than accidental gun 
deaths, though.  There's your few dozen thousand.

&gt;         ... so many people think it'd be REALLY kewl to censor the
&gt; Internet, but so few ever realize that guns are ACTUALLY (without any
&gt; extrapolation) dangerous?
Good point.  Guns, though, in a way like computers, require a 
mis-intentioned person to become dangerous.  Computers aren't designed to 
put holes in people or things (as Kurt Vonnegut would say).  In both 
cases, though, an unreasonable person has to make an irrational decision 
in order to cause harm.

&lt;/rant&gt;
&gt;         Just wondering....

Purchasing an AK47 is illegal in several states, and in those which do
allow machine gun ownership by citizens, you must receive an OK from
local law enforcement and obtain a BATF special permit.  

Modems do not require local law enforcement sign offs...yet.

             CLINTON: GOP LISTENING TO 'GUN LOBBY OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'
                                          
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) -- President Clinton on Saturday
   accused the Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts to fight terrorism
   by kowtowing to the gun lobby.
   
   In his weekly radio address from Jackson, where the president and his family
   are vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had stripped his anti-terrorism
   bill of valuable tools "that law enforcement needs to help them find out,
   track down and shut down terrorists."
   
   The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
   anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and marking
   explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to the dealer who
   sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill and the assault weapons
   ban.

[...]
   
   Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti- terrorism
   legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and explosive taggant
   issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism bill of its own that
   excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not vote on the measure before
   adjourning for its August recess.
   
   The Republicans, the president said, were listening to "the gun lobby over
   law enforcement."
   
   "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
   country and the safety of our people," he said.

August 9, 1996
  
After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?

   By VIVIENNE WALT 
   THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
   
   At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
   Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.
   
   Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship from
   his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a white
   supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service provider, the
   teenager posted the site's entire contents in a compressed "mirror" file...
   
   Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a task
   force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech -- something the
   Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe, has laws against.

[...]
   
   One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
   virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) pushed his
   proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony,
   punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
   
   "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
   of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
   the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
   how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
   can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

[...]
   
   In a last-minute maneuver on Aug. 2, House members dropped the Internet
   controls and wiretapping provisions from their Anti-Terrorism Act, approved
   it by 389-22, and went home for the rest of the summer, leaving the Senate
   in a quandary about what to do after Labor Day. "We just couldn't come up
   with a bipartisan bill," says Sen. Feinstein's press secretary Susan
   Kennedy.
   
   Like Washington, Paris empties out in August for la vacance. But on Sept.
   26, the fight picks up in the French capital at a top-level meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   
   Justice Department officials, and 'Net activists, are set to travel to Paris
   to argue about key escrow...

   "This is an example of the Justice Department trying to dictate foreign
   policy," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center in Washington, who sits on the OECD's advisory panel on encryption.

[...]
   
   "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
   subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
   Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
   of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
   the Web.
   
   Rabbi Cooper and others have lobbied Internet providers to expel the
   extremist sites. "Will they eventually find somewhere else? Probably. But
   that still makes it a worthwhile thing to do," he says.

The face of net-activism is changing. I'm writing this from a science
fiction writers' and editors' party in upstate New York, where we've been
talking about net-politics and online communities.

The fronts we face now are three: national, state, and international. 
We've fought the national fight in the CDA, Clipper, and recent crypto and
terrorist debates. It's been where most of our efforts have focused. 

State politics lags behind that of Capitol Hill. State legislators are
starting to try to ram through bills similar to the CDA -- and, worse yet,
ones that are substantially different. We've discussed some on
fight-censorship.

The ACLU is the only cyber-liberties group tracking them. Yesterday I
stopped by Ann Beeson's office in Manhattan to talk about the Georgia bill
and other laws the group is planning to challenge. 

(Congratulations are in order. No longer a temporary ACLU fellow, Ann is
now a full-time staff attorney in the national office. It's a
well-deserved promotion!)

Then I walked across Bryant Park to the headquarters of Human Rights
Watch, an international civil rights group. They don't have a substantial
online presence now, but they did publish a fabulous global
net-restrictions report ("Silencing the Net") this spring -- and they have
what the Net needs right now: expertise in dealing with international
groups like G-7 and an extensive network of affiliates around the world. 
They seemed interested in doing more online work, which is wonderful. 

Afterwards Charles Platt and Ann, Glenn and their SOs and I went to dinner
at Sam's Noodle Shop on 29th and chatted about our CDA lawsuit and the
human genome project. 

The two aren't necessarily related, unless you count discerning what
congenital defects DoJ attorney Jason "The Weasel" Baron has. Yes, I'm
hardly unbiased. Anyone who threatens to have me arrested for interviewing
government witnesses is a splendid example of a censorhappy Fed
bureaucrat. As a side note, the weasel has been showing up to more and
more DC cyber-regulation events, like the Freedom Forum's panel on crypto
and censorship, and the FTC's panel on net-regulation and privacy. (Wonder
what he's up to?)

So the growing net-involvement of ACLU and HRW is just in time. They have
the well-established state and international affiliates, respectively,
that other groups lack. Hopefully, the affiliates can forward reports
uphill to the parent groups and help in fighting laws and policies locally. 

We need all the help and international expertise we can get -- as we've
seen recently at the Paris summit, governments have this annoying,
persistent habit of working backroom deals. The G-7 resolution (also
endorsed by Russia) said: 

  We call on all States to:

  6. note the risk of terrorist using electronic or wire communications
       systems and networks to carry out criminal acts and the need to
       find means, consistent with national law, to prevent such
       criminality.

  11. accelerate consultation, in appropriate bilateral or multilateral fora,
       on the use of encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful
       government access to data and communications in order, inter alia,
       to prevent or investigate acts of terrorism, while protecting the
       privacy of legitimate communications.

I've been putting whatever international information I come across at
&lt;http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/&gt;. Check it out for more background.

Congress may be in recess, but Bill Clinton is still dreaming of expanded
FBI wiretap authority.  In this week's radio address, Clinton sought to
paint the GOP into a corner by depicting the opponents of his
"anti-terrorism" plan as "gun nuts."

Expect the White House to continue beating this drum throughout September.

      Clinton: GOP Listening To 'Gun
      Lobby Over Law Enforcement'

      JACKSON, Wyo. (AllPolitics, Aug. 10) --
      President Clinton on Saturday accused the
      Republican-led Congress of hampering efforts
      to fight terrorism by kowtowing to the gun
      lobby.

      In his weekly radio address from Jackson,
      where the president and his family are
      vacationing, Clinton said that Congress had
      stripped his anti-terrorism bill of valuable tools "that law
      enforcement needs to help them find out, track down and shut down
      terrorists."

      The president said that those who oppose two key provisions in his
      anti-terrorism legislation -- broader wiretapping authority and
      marking explosive powder with a "taggant" that can be traced back to
      the dealer who sold it -- were the same who opposed the Brady bill
      and the assault weapons ban.

      [ ... ]

      Negotiations between the White House and Congress for anti-
      terrorism legislation stalled last week over the wiretapping and
      explosive taggant issues. The House later passed an anti- terrorism
      bill of its own that excluded those provisions, but the Senate did not
      vote on the measure before adjourning for its August recess.

      [ ... ]

      "We cannot cast aside any tools in this fight for the security of our
      country and the safety of our people," he said.

      The United States, he said, is not immune to terrorism, citing the
      Oklahoma City bombing and last month's bombing in Centennial
      Olympic Park in Atlanta as "brutal evidence."

Um, well, except that
- there are serious safety questions concerning adding taggants to black
and smokeless powder
- a taggant provision is of dubious utility in catching terrorist bombers,
since black powder is not difficult to make (and presumably anyone serious
about planting pipe bombs and not getting caught would take this small
additional step for self-protection)
- it's hard to see how taggants would help LE track powder anyway, since
powder from a given manufacturing lot can be and commonly is shipped to
dealers all over the country.

I do think the issues are separable, and the wiretapping provisions are
obviously of considerably greater relevance to this list (and to
free-speech activism) than the taggant nonsense is. But I wanted to correct
the misapprehension; as we know from bitter experience with the CDA,
getting non-facts accepted as conventional wisdom is one of the first steps
in promulgating bad laws and in demonizing those who oppose them.

&gt; After Dhahran, TWA, and Atlanta: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 'Net?
&gt; 
&gt;    By VIVIENNE WALT 
&gt;    THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
&gt;    
&gt;    At 15, Frank Sayre isn't old enough to vote in Canada. Yet, his knack for
&gt;    Internet coding has already earned him some powerful enemies.

I believe this is false. As far as I know, no one has objected, other than
by calling him naive. Frank is on vacation and off the net until early
September, so I imagine the WSJ was unable to reach him for this story. 
People reacted to his action the same way they did to our Zundelsite mirrors
- -- despite the fact that Zundel is just a harmless neo-Nazi propagandist,
while Lemire is a bit more... activist. For *his* side of the story, see
http://www.webcom.com/ezundel/english/sirc/affidavit_of_marc_lemire.html

&gt;    Last month, Mr. Sayre launched a private protest against Web censorship
&gt;    from his home in Smithers, British Columbia. After hearing that a
&gt;    white supremacist site had been ejected from an Internet service
&gt;    provider,

This is false. He heard that they were being protested. Lemire has not been
kicked off. His site remains at http://www.ftcnet.com/~freedom, and the site
that the SWC-Canada was far more concerned about, www.ftcnet.com/~skinhds,
is still online, too. Oddly, none of the stores in the US press even mention
the skinheads site. The initial reports in the Canadian press didn't even
mention Lemire, because it really wasn't about him.

Funny... the Skinheads site admits that they won and will not be censored. 
Take a look at http://alpha.ftcnet.com/~skinhds/ -- "Well my site has
weathered the storm of controversy and is still afloat.  Despite the best
efforts of some of the enemies of free speech my service provider did not
capitulate."

I wonder how long Lemire plans to milk the publicity. Maybe trolling the
Wall Street Journal was enough.

&gt;    the teenager posted the site's entire contents in a
&gt;    compressed "mirror" file... 

This is false. Lemire created and posted the archive, soliciting mirror
sites. The first one online was www.alpha.org, but they've been having
technical problems, so Frank's was announced first. Frank's web page simply
links to Lemire's archive on ftcnet.com. Frank did not compile and is not
distributing the site's entire contents. 

&gt;    Incensed, the province's Attorney General, Ujjal Dosanjh, dispatched a
&gt;    task force to investigate the Web's proliferation of hate speech --
&gt;    something the Canadian government, like its allies in Western Europe,
&gt;    has laws against. 

This is highly misleading; I assume it was taken from either Declan's
article or Lemire's press release, as it shows a lack of understanding of
the political and legal situation in Canada.

I don't suppose the WSJ will admit that they were trolled? Frank has, but I
know that Declan won't. In fact, if it weren't for this sentence and the
fact that I'm Bcc'ing it to Vivian, I doubt Declan would allow this message
to hit fight-censorship at all.

&gt;    One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and
&gt;    virtually flattened a military base, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.)
&gt;    pushed his proposal to make posting bomb-making information on the
&gt;    Internet a felony, punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
&gt;    
&gt;    "I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind
&gt;    of bone-chilling information is making its way over the Internet," he told
&gt;    the Senate on June 26. "You can access detailed, explicit instructions on
&gt;    how to make and detonate pipe bombs, light-bulb bombs, and even -- if you
&gt;    can believe it -- baby-food bombs."

...and thanks to Biden, that recipe is now available through thomas.loc.gov.
What a moron.

&gt;    "They might be the lunatic fringe, but they've embraced this technology. A
&gt;    subculture is emerging," says Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Weisenthal
&gt;    Center in Los Angeles, who recently presented President Clinton with a disk
&gt;    of extremist Web sites, and whose Cyberwatch project monitors extremism on
&gt;    the Web.

No, Cyberwatch does no such thing. It just moans about it, giving no
specific examples. They don't even acknowledge the existence of other
organizations with policies that are both more effective and more respective
of freedom of speech, such as the Anti-Defamation League (which is larger
and older than the Wiesenthal Center, but strangely absent from press
reports of "jewish reaction to hate on the net") and Nizkor (which has far
more experience than either, but isn't jewish).

Subject: Column, Aug. 7


    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED Aug. 7, 1996
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Reading our mail

    Only in a nation already enormously out of touch with its founding
principle - that individual citizens and businesses have the right to do
just about any peaceful thing, while it's the powers of (start
ital)government(end ital) that are sharply restricted - could Congress find
itself debating whether to "allow" American computer firms to maintain
their lead in the multi-million-dollar overseas market for software
encryption.

  In plainer language, outfits like Netscape Communications and Tandem
Computers want "permission" to sell overseas programs like Pretty Good
Privacy - to which savvy American netsters now have free access - programs
which allow private e-mail messages and files to be encoded so government
snoops can't read them.

  The Clinton administration proposes that such exports be allowed only if
a decoding "key" is entrusted to a third party - such as a bank or
insurance company - which would then be subject to a court order or
subpoena should law enforcement personnel wish to break the code and
secretly read this electronic "mail."

  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in favor of such restrictions July 25,
arguing that "Uncontrolled export of U.S. computer codes may help
international criminals and terrorists hide their activities from law
enforcement."

  Well, yes, they probably do. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in New York on
charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S. airliners, used a laptop computer
containing files the FBI still hasn't been able to decode.
  But note the past tense. Terrorists have already got this stuff. Anything
in the possession of an American teenager can be (likely has been) uploaded
onto the Internet, and then downloaded without anyone being the wiser in
Baghdad, Tripoli, or Tangiers.

  The real goal here is to control the ability of American citizens to
communicate with one another without government snoops reading over their
shoulders. When Director Freeh warns that "Encryption products used
unchecked by criminals and terrorists for their illegal activities pose an
extremely serious threat," it's worth remembering that federal agencies
have, in recent years, used the terms "criminal" and "terrorist" to
describe peaceful worshippers and their children at the Branch Davidian
Church in Waco, MOVE activists in Philadelphia, an unarmed Idaho mother
with a nursing baby in her arms, and any number of perhaps misguided but
far-from-violent tax protesters, home schoolers, barter exchange operators,
and practitioners of alternative medicine, to name just a few.

  Once the possessor of such stuff can be arrested and jailed for years on
charges of "exporting a munition" for the mere act of posting the
mathematical formula on the Internet, does it make sense to pretend
Americans will still be free to use such encryption domestically?
  Those who favor an authoritarian, hierarchical society have grown
accustomed to the fact that the political opinions available to most
American government-school graduates have long been "filtered" through the
news desks of a few television networks and major wire services. The
unregulated, spontaneous nature of Internet communications frightens such
souls with dark nightmares of anarchy, the same way King George hated the
colonial "Committees of Correspondence."

  As Stephen Chapman of the Chicago Tribune pointed out in his nationally
syndicated column June 19, "We can be grateful that ink and paper didn't
make their first appearance the day before yesterday . Otherwise, Congress
and the president would be scrambling frantically to make sure that these
communication tools would not be used for purposes unapproved by the
government."

  If the idea of a government service delivering letters between private
citizens were being introduced today, wouldn't Director Freeh similarly
argue against the "extremely serious threat" that criminals and terrorists
might use this new "mail" system to keep their secrets, should the
government allow the use of glue-flapped "envelopes"?
  But wait, you say: The secret "keys" would only be available upon
issuance of a "court order."

  And this guarantee would be enforced, I presume, by the same courts that
today regularly excuse the short-circuiting of any and all such existing
safeguards so long as the federals assert a "compelling government
interest" in hunting drug dealers, nabbing  "money-launderers," or whatever
dastardly new crime of the week they care to allege?

  It's understandable that repressive regimes like China are pulling out
every stop to register and track private users of the Internet. When
legislators show similar instincts in what was once the "Land of the Free,"
it's their own premises which they ... and we ... should re-examine.

U.K. INTERNET PROVIDERS PLAN TO RESTRICT CYBERPORN
Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers
Association, representing 60 of an estimated 140 providers in the United
Kingdom, will be asking its members to voluntarily block access to sites
and services featuring hard-core pornography.  An executive of Demon
Internet, which has the largest subscriber base in the U.K., dismisses the
proposed action as ineffective:  "This is not a solution, it is just hiding
the problem."  (Financial Times 10 Aug 96)

        It was hard to wake up, that morning. The pillow to the right
of her was bewildered at its own unaccustomed chill. She had gathered
all the blankets around herself and no one had been there to pull them
back; this more than anything reminded her of her aloneness and she
very nearly turned back onto her side to weep herself to sleep.

I'm not sure this is the most effective or noticeable action, but what

useful, just do it on the 31st, and let local media know with a short fax 
soon that Aug. 31 is Internet Censorship Protest Day.  If you've been of 
a mind to organize a rally, make it snappy. No better time.  I don't

Got a note this morning from a U.K. journalist who spoke with PSInet:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversation this am with a leading light at a large ISP here (subsidiary
of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and
essentially said, either you do something about it, or we'll do something
about it.  The guy said they'd pulled the groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups were "pedophile" areas. But the
FT report talks about Scotland Yard pressuring Internet providers to block
"hard-core pornography."

&gt; of US ISP).  Says last week there was a meeting of ISPs with the police,
&gt; who complained about the pedophilic newsgroups (estimated 20 ngs), and

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;
&gt; Note the ISPs are stressing the newsgroups are "pedophile" areas. But the
&gt; FT report paints the situation much more broadly -- Internet providers are
&gt; blocking "pornography."

Almost certainly true. It's highly unlikely that there are 20 child
pornographic newsgroups. I have side accounts at 3 major ISPs that all
have as close to a full newsfeed as is physically possible, I think.
They all have almost an identical roster of available newsgroups (other
than local ones of course, very few of which anywhere are pornographic in
nature.)  Out of those, only the following newsgroups would appear to
qualify at first blush:

alt.sex.pedophilia
alt.sex.pedophilia.boys
alt.sex.pedophilia.girls
alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.sex.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.d
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.sex.pre-teens
alt.sex.teens
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

[I admit the possibility of missing a keyword. I did a search for
"child", "kid", "teen", "lolita", "young", "youth" and "pedo". There
might be, say, a "nambla" match, now that I think about it, but obscure
keywords like that are unlikely to find enough newsgroups to strongly
affect the outcome of this quick examination.]

Of these, many can be immediately eliminated, as they are discussion
groups, not binaries group, or are typos ("binaires") and ergo not carried
by 99% or so of usenet (though available on a few sites like the WELL where
the admins allow the automatic availability of every newsgroup known to
the system, even ones created just to create a stupid-named newsgroup
with no intention that it will ever be used.)

This leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
de.alt.pictures.sex.children
alt.binaires.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.fuck
alt.sex.masturbation.pictures.female.teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.female.masturbation
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.misc
alt.sex.young

Now, of these all the "young" and "teen" groups have to be eliminated,
since "young" is to vague to mean anything more specific that "younger
than middle aged", and teen can refer to 18 or 19 (or even younger legal
ages, if the UK is like Australia and sets age of consent at 16 instead
of US & Canada's 18).  If you actually look in these groups there appears
to be nothing but flames, blather, and BBS ads, almost none, if any, of
which will be childporn, since that would be a major cop magnet.
Lolita.misc and pedophilia.swaps also have be dropped, as too vague to
clearly indicate child pornographic visual content.  The de. newsgroup is
also probably not carried by many sites outside of Germany. (WELL had it,
but my other ISPs didn't. Probably WELL is trading news with a site in
Germany for some reason - maybe the .de site can't get a decent news
feed? I dunno).

That leaves:

alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.child.erotica.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.female
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.child.male
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.lolita
alt.binaries.pictures.lolita.fucking


Six likely suspect newsgroups for genuine illegal content in the form of
child pornography.  It's highly questionable whether real child porn
shows up on any such newsgroup with any regularity, if at all. Again, the
content seems to consist of flames and blatant BBS ads (though I'm not
dumb enough to actually download the material, since that could count as
"possession" if some of it is really child porn.)  I even recall the
creation of a few of these - they were newgrouped simply to piss people
off with no intention of actually using the newsgroups. They were
instantly rmgrouped, and are unavailable on all sites that honor
"official" alt.config rmgroups, which is probably the vast majority of
news servers.

Much ado about nothing.

Also, none of this even touches the question of whether liability adheres
to providing access to something that happens to contain child porn
simply becuase is *sounds* child pornographic. By this logic, even if is
eventually established that an ISP could not be held liable for child
porn content in general, absent guilty knowledge, an ISP could be held
liable for it if someone posted a message with "child porn" in the
subject line, and it actually did contain child porn, regardless of the
fact that any message by that name is more likely to be a discussion
thread about child porn and the problems it causes, that to be actual
child porn.

The UK cops are making the mistake of assuming that every label is.
first, always accurate, and second, non-ambigious.  That's a very stupid
set of assumptions.

Either way you look at it, this is ridiculous.

Either:

a) the UK police bureucrats have taken all newsgroup names at face
value and have targetted most of the initial long list near the top of this
message, even though most are obviously intended to be discussion areas
and don't carry child porn itself, or

b) they are going after 5 or so newsgroups that are, at least in name,
definitely child pornographic, PLUS a buch of others (the rest of the 20)
like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.male, or whatever, that have nothing at
all, even in name, to do with child porn, as the article Declan quotes
seems to suggest (I think this quite possible, since it's unlikely that
many if any UK hosts have this many pedophillic-sounding newsgroups. Only
the biggest and most bandwidth rich US ISPs carry them all, so the UK
cops probably don't even know about the majority of the newsgroups in the
top, large, list.)

A and B are *both* stupid and indefensible.

The British police would be doing a far better job if they monitored the
contents of the newgroups in question and worked to locate those posting
any genuine child porn, and prosecute them (with an eye to the fact that
its very easy to create fake child porn with modern graphics editors.
That may be illegal in Canada, but it's probably not in the UK, or
anywhere else, since such a law is truly inane.)

August 13, 1996

BY FAX: +65-375-7765

Mr. George Yeo
Minister for Information and the Arts
460 Alexandra Road, 37th Story
PSA Building
Singapore 119963

Dear Mr. Yeo,

     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the recent
decision by the Singapore government to establish strict controls on Internet
use. The implementation of the Class License Scheme, which, according to a
July 11 government news release, "will focus on content which may undermine
public morals, political stability and religious harmony,"ensures a leading
role for Singapore among international promoters of online censorship. This is
a particularly unfortunate role for Singapore, which has been a leader in the
development and promotion of Internet use in Asia. It places Singapore in the
same category as countries like China, where Internet users must endure
onerous restrictions.

     One of the most unique and valuable characteristics of the Internet is
its ability to establish easy, inexpensive and practically instantaneous
communication between the farthest points of the earth. By prohibiting
connections between its citizens and various Web sites outside its borders,
Singapore is in essence removing itself from the global Internet. If, as will
surely happen, its example is followed in other countries, the Internet, which
held such promise as the world's first truly global medium, will be nothing
more than a set of country-specific networks where local prejudices and fears
are reinforced by technology.

     Our specific objections concern Singapore's decision to regulate the
Internet as if it were a broadcast medium. Unlike broadcast media, the
Internet is the first truly mass medium. Through e-mail, it allows individuals
with nothing more than a computer and a modem to express their views to an
international audience. Even the World Wide Web differs significantly from a
broadcast medium in that individuals are not confronted with a particular site
upon connecting to the Web--they may choose whichever sites they choose to
visit. As with other forms of Internet communication, anyone may put up his or
her own site on the Web. The Singapore government's own use of Web pages
demonstrates how the Internet can be used to propound a particular point of
view. Its citizens, so long as they are not using their site to incite to
violence, should have the same opportunity to express views as their
government. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights:

     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
     to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
     media and regardless of frontiers.

     We are particularly concerned that restrictions have been placed on
Singaporeans who wish to discuss religious and political ideas online. It is
only through unrestricted discussions of such serious topics by all members of
society, no matter how unpopular their views, that these subjects become less
explosive. Forbidding discussion--in effect, treating its citizens like
children--will, on the other hand, ensure that dangerous topics remain just
that.

     We are also concerned that the extraordinarily broad categories of
forbidden content, as outlined by the SBA, will encourage arbitrary
restrictions on communication. According to the Internet Content Guidelines,
the following topics are banned.

     Public Security and National Defense

          a.   Contents which jeopardize public security or national
               defense.
          b.   Contents which undermine the public confidence in the
               administration of justice.
          c.   Contents which present information or events in such a
               way that alarms or misleads all or any of the public.
          d.   Contents which tend to bring the Government into
               hatred or contempt, or which excite disaffection
               against the Government.

     Racial and Religious Harmony

          a.   Contents which denigrate or satirize any racial or
               religious group.
          b.   Contents which bring any race or religion into hatred
               or resentment.
          c.   Contents which promote religious deviations or occult
               practices such as Satanism.

          Public Morals

          a.        Contents which are pornographic or otherwise obscene.
          b.        Contents which propagate permissiveness or
                    promiscuity.
          c.        Contents which depict or propagate gross exploitation
                    of violence, nudity, sex or horror.
          d.   Contents which depict or propagate sexual perversions
               such as homosexuality, lesbianism, and pedophilia.

By banning such subjects a chill will be sent through the online community in
Singapore, and will render the Internet essentially useless in allowing any
kind of serious discussion.

     In addition to forbidding particular content, the government has also
announced that some sites will be banned. Internet service providers were
given the deadline of September 14, 1996,  to begin using proxy
servers--devices that can prohibit connections to specified sites--to
connect all their
subscribers.

     Although the government has promised to use a light hand in regulating
the Internet, its activities even at this early stage indicate otherwise. A
July 12 posting in the Usenet newsgroup "soc.culture.singapore" was reportedly
removed at the request of the SBA, who asked local Internet service providers
for its removal because it alleged that lawyers at a local law firm were
incompetent. The request came, according to the Straits Times, after the law
firm complained to the government. Despite the removal from the newsgroup, the
message is still widely available to Singaporeans through other Internet
sources, indicating that content control will be difficult unless Internet
access is restricted even further.

     We hope that the Singapore government will retract these repressive new
regulations, and support the development of an unfettered Internet. Instead of
using its power to restrict Internet use, the government could play a truly
useful role by devising ways to expand its use to even the most disaffected
members of its population.

                                   Sincerely,
                                   Sidney Jones
                                   Executive Director

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

You're forgetting the tortuous British obscenity laws.  For example, it's
illegal to show an erect penis in Britain.  The police are just trying
enforce the censorious powers the government has always given them.

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION 
NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS 
News Release   August 15, 1996 
---------------------------------------------------- 
 
Free Speech 101: ACLU Gives Princeton University an "F"  
for Barring Political Speech on its Network 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             
Wednesday, August 15, 1996 
 
Contact: Ann Beeson, ACLU National (212) 944-9800, x788 
David Rocah, ACLU of New Jersey (201) 642-2084 
 
NEW YORK--In a letter sent today to Princeton University officials,  the
American Civil Liberties Union urged them to reconsider a policy barring
students and staff from using the computer network for "political
purposes."  
   
The letter was sparked by complaints the ACLU national office received over
a recent memo from Princeton officials advising faculty, staff and
students, "especially in this year of a presidential election," that the
school's not-for-profit status barred it from allowing use of the computer
network "for political purposes." 
 
The ACLU called this conclusion mistaken, pointing out in its letter that
the Internal Revenue Code specifies that only the University itself is
barred from political activity -- not faculty, staff, or students acting
independently.  In fact, the ACLU said, the IRS has previously held that
statements in support of political candidates appearing on the editorial
page of a student newspaper would not be considered violations of a
university's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. 
 
"Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network," the ACLU letter
stated, "it is an unjustified content-based restriction on the free
expression rights of students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is
not only unworthy of a great university like Princeton, it is in violation
of the New Jersey State Constitution."  The letter was signed by ACLU
national staff attorney Ann Beeson and David Rocah, staff attorney of the
ACLU of New Jersey. 
   
"We understand the university's concerns regarding it's tax-exempt status,"
Rocah said.  "But this is free speech 101.  Sadly, Princeton is not making
the grade."    
 
Rocah said the ACLU would consider legal action if the university refuses
to drop its censorship policy. 
 
"Traditionally, college campuses are the center of political discussion and
debate," said Beeson.  "The fact that the debate is taking place on the
Internet does not mean that the speech is any less deserving of
protection."  
 
Beeson added that the policy could bar students and staff from a wide range
of protected expression, including downloading position papers from the
Dole or Clinton website; sending e-mail to their parents urging them to
vote for Ralph Nader; and organizing online discussion groups for  student
chapters of politically active groups such as Greenpeace.   In short, Rocah
said, "Everything that would be acceptable, even welcome, off-line, becomes
off-limits on the Internet."  
   
In its letter, the ACLU called on the school to take a leadership role in
the academic community:  "As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a
leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to
promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its
community, to the very limits of the law," the letter said. 
 
Beeson added that the ACLU  is working to develop model guidelines for 
colleges and universities to help sort out the confusion in academia
regarding free expression on the Internet.  Many schools have already put
in place "Appropriate Use Policies" to police student and faculty computer 
use, some of which violate rights of free expression, Beeson said.

Mr. Harold Shapiro 
President                 BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, & REGULAR MAIL 
1 Nassau Hall 
Princeton University 
Princeton NJ 85044 
 
RE: Computer Use Policy 
 
Dear President Shapiro: 
 
In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton
University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ)
to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University
from using the Princeton's computer network for "political purposes."  We
believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding
the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic
freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.

 
Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students
widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet
greatly expanded the resources available for academic research.  It also
provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas.  In
contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for
"political purposes" unjustifiably interferes with the right of the
University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.

 
Princeton's current computer use policy holds that "the Computing and
network resources of the University may not be used by members of the
University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial
gain . . . ."  Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter "Rights," attached
as Appendix A).  On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent
an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use
of the Internet or computer network for "any participation in, or
intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
public office" would result in disciplinary action.  See Office of the
General Counsel, "Internet use and Politics," E-mail of July 19, 1996,
attached as Appendix B. 
 
We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a
concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to
use the computer network for political purposes.  We believe that this
concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal
Revenue Service. 
 
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization
will be tax-exempt as long as it "does not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office."  The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to
constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the
political activity must be that of the University itself and not the
individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students.  See Internal
Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for
1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C.  Thus, any personal
communication by University members over the computer network cannot
threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the
communication takes place does not change this conclusion.  The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether
the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political
activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the
university under Internal Revenue Code  501(c)(3), is whether the
facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for
non-political reasons.  Id. at 427.  Princeton provides fair and equal
access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access,
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes.  See Rights at 11.  Thus, political speech over the
network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
 
Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with
a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status.  The
Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that
required its students in a certain political science course to participate
in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during
the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the
meaning of Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3).  See Revenue Ruling 75-512,
1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D. 
 
In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on
the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. 
The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not
participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political
candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper.  This was
true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities
to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were
clearly those of the students and not of the university itself.  See
Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E. 
 
Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by
allowing University members to use its computer network for political
purposes.  We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for
official positions of the University.  At most, the only permissible
regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the
University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a
reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official
position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the
opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone.
 Compare Rights, "Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the
University and Political Activities," at Section 3. 
 
Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket
prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an
unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of
students, faculty and staff.  Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of
a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of
the New Jersey Constitution. 
 
Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey
Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been
sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to
honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression.  See State v.
Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against
the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994)
(holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive
use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet).  Princeton's
computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton "campus" as are the
lawns and buildings.  Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its
students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the
Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech
in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus. 
 
Political expression has always received the highest degree of
constitutional protection.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). 
The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship
those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for
political candidates.  Indeed, "where political speech is involved, our
tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion,
the narrowest range for restriction.'"  State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412
(1980).  As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in
American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and
defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to
the very limits of the law. 
 
The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free
speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive
information.  Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (right
to receive information precludes government from labeling certain
publications "propaganda") (Brennan, J., concurring); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) ("right of freedom of speech . . .
includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . .
receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of
thought, and freedom to teach . . . .  Without these peripheral rights the
specific rights would be less secure."); Kreimer v. Bur. of Police for Town
of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1350-55 (3d Cir. 1992) (listing cases).  This
is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the
Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community.  See
ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996).  They
provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access
information on virtually any topic, including politics. 
 
Finally, the computer use policy is in conflict with other University
policies and practices.  Princeton recognizes that 
 
     "the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the
discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching
and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and
learning to society at large.  Free inquiry and free expression within the
academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. 
The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate
conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in
classrooms and lecture halls." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 
With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it
has a fundamental responsibility to ensure 
 
    "the opportunity for all members of the University community to
exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . .  Encouragement of an
interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social
responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal
education.  The University continues to consider self-chosen participation
in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable
part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage.  Such activities
on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to,
imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or
point of view." 
 
Rights, Introduction to "Guidelines Relating to Tax Exempt Status." 
 
For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal the existing
ban on use of the computer network for political purposes, and we look
forward to your early reply.

Bomb info OK in books but G-7 wants it off Net

By COLMAN JONES

While the fury over child porn on the net appears to be losing steam
after the defeat of the Communications Decency Act in June, there's a a
growing new cyber-backlash against terrorists.  

At a meeting in Paris last month, just before the downing of TWA flight
800 and the bombing in Atlanta, Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers
and security ministers struck an agreement to target terrorists using
the internet.  

The pact calls for international controls on the net to cut off access
to sites containing "dangerous" information, restrict electronic speech
by unpopular political organizations and allow governments to decode
privately encrypted communications.

The Paris meeting ended with a commitment to have reports ready by the
end of the year on ways of instituting such restrictions.

[...]

Bomb info

Many press accounts fume about bomb-making information available
online, without mentioning that the "offensive'' material being
targeted is no different from identical material easily obtained in
public libraries, college libraries and bookstores. A case in point is
the World's Biggest Bookstore, which stocks the Anarchist Cookbook, a
virtual how-to guide to subversive activity, also available online.  

Canada's foreign affairs minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who helped to draw
up the Paris agreement, cited the fact that his his 11-year-old son
showed him how to access extremist literature from the World Wide Web.
Axworthy's spokesperson, Catherine Lappe, says the pact is "not an
issue of trying to censor people" .  

"If you look at the communique, it says very clearly that all this
would have to be in compliance with national laws, so the issues of
privacy would be of utmost importance.''

they'll have to go after these sites too:

I've set up a web page at http://www.well.com/~declan/huskers.html and
registered the URL with AltaVista and HotBot. It's called: "Husker web

I wonder what the university will do, if anything? This message is copied

Husker Web Pages Must Cease

Subject: Husker Web Pages Must Cease
From: mfricke@serv01.net-link.net (Mark E. Fricke)
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:59:55 -0400

I hate to be the bearer of real bad news, but if you have a personal
web site on the internet that features any logos, graphics, audio or
even the page name of Cornhusker or Husker (like the Husker Press Box)
be prepared to get a Cease and desist letter from the University of
Nebraska's attorney's. The problem is simple. A lot of money has been
paid to license the name and logo's of the Huskers and there are many
business interests to protect. Pinnacle Broadcasting is the exclusive
rights holder for internet usage of the name and logos (and you thought
the live broadcasts were all good).

Now..there are a couple of things we can do. #1 remove all references
to Huskers, Big Red, Cornhuskers etc. from THE PAGES TITLE. You can
still talk about, mention, berate or praise the team within the page,
just not in the page title. The reason here is that the University
wants all search engines (yahoo, excite, infoseek etc.) to send
searches for the Huskers to their site (huskerwebcast)

#2 remove all licensed logo's, pictures of Herbie audio of the band
etc. from your site.

#3 There is one more solution. Huskerwebcast will allow pages to exist
as they are if they are housed within THEIR page. Wether that mean they
will have hyperlinks to these hidden pages or if you will actually have
to set up an account and an FTP site to their server I'm not clear on.
I'm awaiting confirmation on this.

Okay, now my personal views. Yeah it's a bummer...a great big bummer. I
really don't see how private personal pages could possibly infringe on
the marketing dollars of the University (except for logos, you got me
there) But PAGE NAMES?!?!. They seem a little greedy fo rthe traffic.
I'm no lawyer (maybe some of you out there are and know something about
public domain)so I will do what I must with the Husker Press Box.  I
will still provide the page in some manner, either changing the name or
joining the University page. Luckily I have already been extended an
offer to do that. I will wait and see. My advise to other Husker wep
page masters. Be ready for a letter and be ready to reacte. this is a
big University with lots of money and lots of attorney's

Recently the London police sent a letter to U.K. Internet providers saying
that 133 Usenet newsgroups must be banned.

&gt;From observations at &lt;http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship&gt;, it's clear that:

       the Police regard ISPs as publishers
       the publication of obscene materials is an offence
       the Police expect ISPs to continuously monitor newsgroups and
           to remove those which contain illegal materials

More ominously, the letter says "Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive
and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups identifying and taking
necessary action against those others found to contain such material...
This list is only the starting point..." Also, the police have said they
have the power to arrest Internet providers and seize their equipment.

This move by the Brits is disappointing, but perhaps not surprising. I have
background about many more international net-censorship attempts at:

We urge you all to protest this action - use the media, contact your

At present, Wave Rider Internet Plc have received no such notification from
the police, and will therefore not be removing any groups. However, as

nothing in them.

Like other UK ISPs, VBCnet today received a demand from the Metropolitan
Police that some 134 news groups be deleted from our news machines.
The letter makes it clear that this is only the beginning, that they
will be banning more groups and requiring ISPs to enforce their
dictats.  We have with great reluctance complied with their demand.

While we do not disagree that the articles in some of these groups are
often objectionable, we disagree in principle with this form of censorship.

We urge all of you to make it clear to your customers why these news
groups have been withdrawn and we urge you to contact your MPs and
the media about this arbitrary action by the police.  If there is no
protest, if a precedent is established, the UK Internet is going to
fall under the control of the Clubs and Vice Unit at Charing Cross
Police Station.

VBCnet is setting up a Web page to protest this action.  It should be
available at
        http://www.uk.vbc.net/censorship
by the end of the day.  We will add pointers to other protesting Web

Dear Sir / Madam

Pornographic Material on the Internet

Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.

We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.

This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.

We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.

Yours Faithfully

A longtime anti-porn crusader, Phyllis Schlafly generally is no friend of
free speech -- but I welcome her insightful and timely comments, attached
below. Privacy does cut through ideological lines. I seem to recall that
the Christian Coalition, a fiery supporter of the CDA, opposed the Clipper
Chip.

                    Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother


     August 8, 1996                             by Phyllis Schlafly

     We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
     recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all
     Americans who care about civil liberties should vigorously resist
     President Clinton's attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an
     excuse to carry on his all-out war against the personal privacy of
     law-abiding Americans.

     This mind-set was first revealed in the Clinton health care bill,
     which would have given the government computer access to the
     medical records of all Americans. Fortunately, that totalitarian
     takeover of the health care industry was rejected.

     The Clinton Administration's education legislation now pending in
     Congress would put personal information about all schoolchildren
     -- academic, medical, attitudinal, behavioral, and family -- into
     an expanded Labor Market Information database available to the
     government, as well as to prospective employers.

     Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for
     individual Americans to have private conversations with one
     another. That's the real meaning of its effort to control
     encryption technology, and it's a direct assault on the First
     Amendment.

     It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First
     Amendment guarantees our right to speak in public but not in
     private. It would be just as ridiculous to say that we have
     freedom to speak in words that the government can understand, but
     not in words the government can't decipher.

     Americans have the right to speak to one another in private,
     behind closed doors, and we should likewise have the right to
     speak to one another in code and to put our coded messages on
     computer in a process called encryption. Americans would not
     tolerate the government opening and reading the letters we send
     through the mails, and we should not tolerate the government
     opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
     computer.

     Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and
     Vice President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our
     encrypted messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of
     California, Reno bluntly stated her demand for "ensuring law
     enforcement access to encrypted data.''

     Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government
     should create a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly
     "neutral third party''), to which all Americans should be forced
     to "entrust'' the keys to their encrypted messages, and to which
     the government would have access. On the contrary, there is no
     such consensus.

     Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do
     you trust the FBI to keep your files confidential?

     The Clinton Administration is already doing 30 to 40 percent more
     federal telephone wiretaps and other electronic surveillance than
     the last year of the Bush Administration. Those figures don't even
     include national security wiretaps or the hundreds of extensions
     granting more time for wiretap orders already issued.

     FBI Director Freeh wrote the New York Times last November that
     "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the
     extent of wiretapping." Four months later, FBI documents revealed
     that the FBI does, in fact, plan to increase electronic
     surveillance 54 percent by 1998 and 130 percent by 2004.

     On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will
     continue to push for the adoption of a massive public key
     infrastructure to give the government access to all encrypted
     communications. In a blatant bid for a police-state surveillance
     society, Gore warned about "the dangers of unregulated encryption
     technology."

     A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to
     make policy recommendations about encryption. The panel called on
     the government to abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.

     The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would
     enhance our national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of
     its 16 members had security clearances with access to secret
     information, and they saw no national security reason to justify
     the Clinton policy.

     The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private
     encryption on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping.
     However, the NSC panel concluded that the ability of the private
     sector to transfer confidential financial and other data over the
     information highway without interception is far more important.

     New technologies have given government awesome power to spy on
     individuals. The Filegate investigation accidentally uncovered the
     shocking news that, as soon as Bill Clinton entered the White
     House in 1993, he secretly spent $400,000 on software to create a
     highly sophisticated computer database to track detailed
     political, financial, attitudinal, and personal biographical
     information on 200,000 people, including members of Congress and
     the media. Known as WHODB for White House Office Data Base, the
     system was nicknamed Big Brother.

     Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the
     Clinton Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would
     be the biggest expansion of federal power since the passage of the
     Income Tax Amendment in 1913.

<p><font size=4>The illustrated Canadian version of &quot;<b>The Galileo of the

of Harvard University (B.A.Biology) and the American 
University of Washington, D.C. (M.A. Soviet and East 
European Studies). </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Author and co-author of several best-sellers, Mr. Bird has 
written this book on the life and trials of Gaston Naessens 
... &quot;So that people everywhere may know about an up-hill 
struggle&quot; ... the struggle of a pioneer who discovered a 
revolutionary product, 714X, I his private laboratory. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The discoveries of Gaston Naessens shake the very foundations of medical 
science. But, as evidenced by the people who spoke on his behalf durig his trial, 
no law can put a stop to progressive science and its efforts to alleviate human 
suffering. This book leads you on an odyssey of dedicated research and study to 
improve human life conditions on this planet.</font></p>

<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>When one views cancer as a cellular disease, isolated from general biological disorders and 
developing along proper norms which are local and independent of any possible carcinogenic 
agent whose persistence is no longer indispensable to the autonomous progression of the 
tumoral process, the therapy is centered on the &quot;the tumoral mass&quot; whose destruction and 
radical removal becomes the only imperative means of recovery. </p>
<p>Until now, among the means at our disposal for combatting the disease, the surgical solution has 
figured most prominently. This solution, which best addresses the notion of &quot;Tumor as a local 
disorder&quot;, consists of the radical removal of the autonomous and parasitic mass from the 
cellular agglomeration, which appears as an immediately palliative solution. </p>
<p>Next came the radiation solution. This therapy applied to tumors, which proposes the 
destruction of the tumoral mass by deep disintegration of the cancerous cells and for which the 
question of dosage and irradiated surface is an important consideration, would not be efficient 
other than to the extent in which the radiation would reach the neoplastic cells, not with the 
intent of immediate and blind disintegration but rather to force a reversal of the pathological 
synthesis which is the source of their malignancy. </p>
<p>Finally came the chemotherapeutic solution. The therapeutic solution based on the use of 
chemicals toxic to such cells, which is to say by karyoclasic poisons which stop the mitoses by 
plasmatic division and chromatic alteration, leads to duplications of the number of 
chromosomes and abnormal mitoses. The karyoclasic action of this therapy appears, with 
regard to neoplastic mitoses as an essentially negative mode of stopping, blockage, and 
chromial disintegration and furthermore presents a danger (without speaking of general toxicity) 
to the mitoses of normal cells and among others, to that of the germinal series.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Immunity">Natural Immunity</a></h1>
<p>For some time already, a new orientation had been taken in the work of researchers studying 
cancer. As a matter of fact, the possibilities of natural immunity, as much zoological as 
physiological or individual in the cancer grafts, whose essentially antitissular nature remains 
obscure, have shown that cancer should no longer be considered a cellular disease isolated 
from the general biological disorders. To the contrary, the evolution of this disease is linked to 
conditions of the organism, and the aptitude to cancerization points back to the organism 
&quot;alone&quot;. </p>
<p>To grow, the tumor needs the organism and without the latter cancerization cannot take place. 
Given the interaction which exists between the organ and the tumor, in particuliar its 
vascularization and the composition of the blood which irrigates it as well as the state of 
nervous inlfux pertaining to it, all modification of these different factors can thus have an action 
on the very life of the cancer. The process which at certain times permits the host carrier of the 
tumor to stabilize it, should be analogous to that which permits an individual to harbor in his 
throat &quot;diphtheria bacillis&quot; without being stricken by this disease. It is possible that similar 
phenomena occur with regard to malignant cells. This is reasoning by analogy. If one considers 
the numerous possible causes of cancer which surrounds us, is it possible that there exists in 
certain individuals, a resistance to the development of cancer?</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Grafts">Grafts Studies</a></h1>
<p>A number of studies have been undertaken with the purpose of clarifying this problem. The first 
attempts were undertaken with patients striken with advanced cancer, who had volunteered to 
undergo these experiments. Some tumor fragments, removed from other persons and cultivated 
for a long time in an artificial medium, were implanted under the skin of their fore-arms. The 
grafts were accepted and progressively grew in volume. This result was in contradiction with 
the usual biological rule which requires that a tissue removed from an animal does not develop 
itself if it is grafted on another animal, unless the latter is a true twin of the first. </p>
<p>The explanation of this statement, which appears to be paradoxical, requires that, with patients 
striken with advanced cancer, the natural defense which opposes the acceptance of grafts had 
disappeared. One could inquire further if all the usual defenses of these fatigued patients had 
thus given up. The experiment showed that the normal defense mechanism that yielded to the 
cancer, remained intact in all other respects. It is thus, that a graft of normal tissue was rapidly 
eliminated. The two possible explanations were that, either the cancerous tissue had a 
particular ability of growth contrary to the usual laws which rule grafts, or the patient had lost, 
especially with regard to cancerous cells, the possibilities of normal defense. The question then 
was: <i>Would cancer cells transplanted to a normal individual be capable of growing?</i> </p>
<p>A systematic study of this question had been undertaken by the cancer research center in New 
York, which called on volunteers from an american prison. From more than one hundred 
volunteers, fifty men were chosen. These men received an implant of a human cancer culture, 
the same type as that which had been utilized within the patients striken with cancer. With the 
fifty volunteers, there had been one important defensive local inflammatory reaction and the 
graft disappeared completely in four weeks. </p>
<p>This experiment demonstrated that the human body possesses some type of resistance to the 
growth of cancers transplanted from another man. This resistance does not exist with patients 
striken by advanced cancer. These experiments lead one to attempt to stimulate the natural 
defense of an organism against cancer. This is why several research were undertaken in the 
area of immunology. </p>
<p>It is a question of knowing if the elements which constitute the malignant tumor, essentially the 
chemical elements which forms the cell or the nucleus, are capable of playing the role of 
antigen. That is to say, to provoke in the organism which contains them, the formation of 
antagonistic subtances called antibodies, whose role it is to oppose the development of the 
former, or antigen. If such a property can be disclosed in malignant tumors, it would indicate 
the possibility of promoting the formation of such antibodies for fighting against the 
development of cancer. </p>
<p>The problem is not so simple though, because the normal tissues from which cancer results, are 
grafted on another subject. It is necessary to suppress the antibodies thereby formed in order to 
verify if other antibodies exist whose formation would be due to the presence of malignant 
tissue. It would be necessary to admit that, not the tumor but perhaps one or several elements of 
the cell play the role of foreign body in its development in the organism. It is possible to 
consider that in certain circumstances, there exist a certain degree of antigenic properties, and 
that it may then be possible to promote the development and encourage the formation of 
corresponding antibodies. </p>
<p>This phenomenon would then be able to explain why certain carrier subjects of cancer, although 
having diffused the cells from the primary tumor in the organism, do not lead to the development 
of other metastases. The cells stopped at other points could have provoked there the formation 
of antibodies which were opposed to their development or which could have destroyed them. 
One can equally envision a lowering of immunity which had stabilized the swarming cells, thus 
allowing for the development of metastases years after the destruction of the initial tumor.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Tumor">Tumor Cells</a></h1>
<p>The problem of cancer viewed from this angle makes it necessary to study the life of the 
malignant cell in order to discover which antigenic agents would be capable of producing such 
antibodies as are capable of destroying cancerous cells. Despite very particular aspects of the 
malignant cell, it is surprising to note that one may again ask how it can differ from a normal 
cell. </p>
<p>Research seeking to put into evidence a new element not found in normal cells found no 
conclusive results. On the contrary, it would seem that there are qualitative differences in the 
choice made by the cell between the primary materials which supply it in particular in the 
chemical phenomena and the fermentations leading to the formation of nucleic acids (the role of 
which is essential in the life of the cell). </p>
<p>Tumor cells utilize more glucose than normal cells, but no quantitative differences have been 
found between normal tissue and tumoral tissue. This strongly indicates an increase in the 
formation of lactic acid. Tumor cells utilize the energy produced by the destruction of 
carbohydrates for the synthesis of cellular proteins at greater level than normal cells. The cells 
returns to a simpler form. The phenomena associated with fermentation (linked to ferments 
called enzymes), basic to proper life, simpify the cell, which then loses more or less those 
functions which individualize it and make it pertain to a specialized organ. Before the cell has 
utilized all its capacity for synthesis, it divides, thus prematurely interrupting the cycle of its 
activities and aggravating the disorder at each division. In response, it recovers former 
properties remembered from its origin, most important of which is the aptitude to multiply more 
rapidly, with consequences which are one of the manifestation of its malignancy. </p>
<p>This abnormal growth in mumber is due to a liberation of the control system which normally 
maintains tissue harmony. The cells then become dangerous parasites or anarchists in the midst 
of the cellular community. The malignant cells appear &quot;priviliged and antisocial&quot;. They first 
monopolize materials, and in particular, amino acids indispensable to the life of all cells, 
wheter normal or malignant. </p>
<p>What is especially striking is the intensity of these physical or chemical phenomena in 
comparison to ordinary chemical phenomena in normal conditions. The surrounding conditions 
(temperature, PH, and molecular pressure) have a capital importance on the phenomena of 
cellular life.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="State">Physical State of Humors</a></h1>
<p>Of all the problems the most important is, without doubt, the disorders of the humoral system 
engendered by these phenomena and the consequences which come from the behaviour of 
individuals in a normal or pathological state. Hippocrates, and well before his time, the 
Hebrews and the Egyptians, already attributed the major part of morbid incidents to troubled 
humors. </p>
<p>By &quot;humors&quot; we mean the extra-cellular liquids of the organism. They form the fluid part of the 
circulating blood: the plasma, in which the sanguine elements appear, such as the suspended 
white and red cells, and also all the interstial liquids either lacunal or others, which bathe, 
impregnate or encircle the tissue and organs. Not having a precise means of investigation, the 
ancients completely ignored how and why humors can be innovative. </p>
<p>Later, when the constitution of these humors became known, medecine sought to discover which 
of the subtances which composes these humors, were responsible for the incidence of 
pathology. Having identfied that all experimentally provoked variations, in terms of diverse 
humorous constitutional elements, had been powerless to reproduce the symptoms of acute 
chronic diseases, they came to this conclusion, diametrically opposed to that of Hyppocrates: 
that the humoral state plays no role in the genesis of illness. </p>
<p>Medecine then became &quot;solidist&quot;: only lesions were considered important; the state of humors 
was left aside. </p>
<p>On a modern basis, we will endeavour to recognize the triumph of humoral medecine in 
discovering the real reason for the innovative behaviour of humors, which resides, not in their 
chemical constitution, but in the physical state of certain elements, when the latter ones change 
to the state of a solid. </p>
<p>We are drawn to examine the behaviour of observable elements in all biological liquids, in 
particular our attention has been retained by extremely tenuous particles, whose presence has 
already been signalled by numerous authors in the end of the previous century. </p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Cycle">The Somatidian Cycle</a></h1>
<p>For quite some time already, the microscope has been an indispensable instrument for precise 
measurement in research laboratories and the industry. The classical microscope normally 
permits enlargement on the order of 1800X with a resolution of 0.1 microns. </p>
<p>The electron microscope permits enlargement on the order of 400,000X with a resolution of 30 
to 50 angstroms. But use of the latter necessitates manipulations which alter the physical aspect 
of objects being observed. </p>
<p>We have thus perfected an instrument for microscopic observations which we have called 
<b>SOMATOSCOPE</b>. The primary quality of this apparatus is that it permits the observation of 
live elements and can follow the polymorphism to enlargements attaining 30,000X with a 
resolution on the order of 150 angstroms. </p>
<p>Using this instrument, we have observed in all biological liquids and particularly in the blood, 
an elementary particle endowed with a movement of electronegative repulsion, possessing a 
polymorphic nature. We have called it &quot;SOMATIDE&quot;. <a href="ti05imga.gif"><img src="ti05lnk0.gif" align=right hspace=0 width=346 height=309></a>This extremely tenuous particule whose 
dimension varies from a few angstroms to 0.1 
microns, can be isolated and put in a culture. We 
could then observe the polymorphic cycle shown in 
the figure. We were surprised to discover in this 
cycle such elements which we had regurlarly seen 
in the blood of healthy persons but equally in the 
blood of carriers of diverse diseases. We made 
certain correlations. </p>
<p>In the blood of healthy persons we observe 
SOMATIDES, SPORES and DOUBLE SPORES. 
In the course of this micro-cycle we can detect the 
production of a &quot;trephone&quot;. This is a proliferative 
hormone indispensable to cellular division. 
Without it, life does not exist. In healthy 
individuals, the evolution of this cycle is stopped at the level of the double spore because of the 
presence of trephone inhibitors in the blood. These are either mineral substances like cooper, 
mercurey and lead, or organic substances such as cyanhydric acid, etc... In the course of this 
micro-cycle, the quantity of trephones necessary for cellular multiplication is thus elaborated. 
If, because of stress or some biological disturbances, the inhibitors in the blood diminish in 
concentration, the somatide cycle continues its natural evolution and one sees the appearance of 
diverse forms of bacteria. These have also been termed by German scientists during the 1930&#146;s: 
Syphonospora Polymorpha. </p>
<p>Next come the myco-bacterial forms, and then the yeast-like forms. These forms with a 
dimension of 4 to 5 microns evolve rapidly into ascospores, then by maturation become asci. At 
this stage of evolution, the ascus, after staining on a blood smear, appears as a small 
lymphocyte and cannot be differentiated by conventional means. </p>
<p>Next come the filamentous forms. One can observe from an ascus, the formation of a thallus in 
which evolves a cytoplasm of increasing importance. The cytoplasm is formed from the ascus 
and a conjuncture is observable between them. It is by this conjuncture and by peristalsis that 
the cytoplasm forms in the thallus. This apparent mycelial form responds to none of the criteria 
of fungal elements. In fact, it is in no way affected by massive doses of Amphotericin B, 
Fungizone or other antifungal agents. When this pseudo-mycelial element has attained its full 
maturity with an extremely active cytoplasm, we then witness the bursting of this thallus and the 
liberation into the surroundings of an enormous quantity of new particles capable of reinitiating 
a complete cycle. </p>
<p>The empty thallus has a fibrous aspect. Furthermore, it is often seen on blood smears but it is 
considered as an artifact of the staining procedure. </p>
<p>From the preceding observations, we have been able to draw the following conclusions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Cellular division requires the presence of the SOMATIDES (Which is either in the animal 
or plant domain.) </li>
<li>TREPHONES are elaborated by the SOMATIDES. </li>
<li>The SOMATIDE is capable of polymorphism. This polymorphism is controlled by 
inhibitors found in the blood. </li>
<li>A deficiency of sanguine inhibitors permits the elaboration of large quantity of trephones, 
which in turn lead to disorders in cellular metabolism. </li>
<li>All degenerative diseases are a consequence of these disorders.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Evolution">Evolution of Cancer</a></h1>
<p>In light of the above observations, the notion of &quot;cancer, a general disease which is localized&quot; 
takes on its meaning when one examines the evolutive process of this affection. This process 
can be divided in two parts: </p>
<p><u>1st part: Cancerization or initiation.</u></p>
<p>When, for whatever reason, the sanguine inhibitors diminish and the polymorphism of the 
somatide is no longer stopped at the double spore state, an exagerated formation of trephones in 
the organism leads the cell to return to a more simpler form. The phenomena of fermentation 
(linked to ferments called enzymes), basic to proper life, simplifies the cell. It then loses more 
or less those functions which give it its individuality and make it pertain to a specialized organ. </p>
<p>The cell is divided even before it has utilized all its capacity for synthesis, thus prematurely 
interrupting the cycle of its activities and aggravating its disorder at each division. In response, 
it recovers old properties remembered from its origin, the most important of which is the 
aptitude to multiply rapidly, with consequences which are one of the manifestation of its 
malignancy. This abnormal growth in number is due to a liberation of the control system which 
normally maintains cellular harmony. </p>
<p>At this stage, the cancerization is effective. It can be called initiation or precancerous. We now 
have an accelerated and anarchic multiplication of one or several cells which provokes, by an 
agglomeration of their descendants, the occurance of a new &quot;entity&quot; opposing the organism 
which had given birth to it. The immune system then enters into action and fights actively to 
eliminate this entity. In this fashion, we develop a small cancer daily, but our immune system 
rids us of it. </p>
<p><u>2nd part: Cocancerization or promotion:</u> </p>
<p>If the immune system is somewhat deficient and the new entity has been able to reach a certain 
proportion, it then attains a &quot;critical mass&quot; of cells in anarchic proliferation. This entity which 
has been able to escape from the immune system, needs an enormous quantity of nitrogen for 
subsistance ( the cells of this entity are moreover named Nitrogen Traps.). It then emits a 
substance which allows it to withdraw nitrogen derivatives from the organism and which at the 
same time, paralyses the immune system. We have called this substance COCANCEROGENIC 
K FACTOR or CKF. </p>
<p>The paralysing action of CKF against the immune system appears only when the critical mass of 
cells in anarchic proliferation is reached. From this moment, the organism finds itself without 
defense against this new entity which can develop at will and progressively invade its host. </p>
<p>We can conclude from this analysis that: </p>
<ol>
<li>The cancerization or initiation phase is linked to the reduction of sanguine inhibitors and a 
weakness of the immune system. </li>
<li>The cocancerization or promotion phase is the direct consequence of a paralysed immune 
system provoked by a substance called CKF. This substance is elaborated by anarchic 
cells in order to withdraw, from the organism, nitrogen derivatives necessary for 
proliferation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The understanding of this process makes it possible to propose a therapy leading to the 
suppression of CKF. As a matter of fact, if the latter is neutralized, the immune system can 
regain its initial activity and consider each anarchic cell composing the tumors as a foreign 
body to be rejected. </p>
<p>After having carried out numerous experiments on camphor and its derivative, we have 
discovered that this product is endowed with remarkable pharmaceutical properties since it 
impedes the formation of the CKF substance, which puts leucocytes and other phagocytic 
elements of the organism in a state of &quot;negative chemotaxis&quot;, that is to say in a state of paralysis 
during diverse degenerative diseases. </p>
<p>Camphor is neither an antimitotic nor an antimetabolite. Its property of inhibiting the CKF 
resides in the fact that it carries to the tumor cells all the nitrogen which it needs, suppressing 
by the same action the secretion which would paralyse the immune system. We have therefore 
proposed for the experimentation a camphor derivative by the name of 714X.</p>

<h1><a name="step2">Preparing the Seringe </a></h1>
<p><i>(At this point, washing and brushing hands is essential.)</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Get the seringe out of its sterile packaging. Make sure that the needle is fixed solidly and 
that the protective cover can easily be removed. </li>
<li>Take the multi-dose vial of 714X. Pull out the center of the metallic capsule (if the vial is 
new). Return to tray. </li>
<li>Take a sterile cotton tampon and soak it in alcohol at 94%. Disinfect the rubber lid 
(NEVER USE ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL). </li>
<li>Hold the vial in your left hand and put the needle through the center of the rubber lid. </li>
<li>Turn the vial and seringe upside down. <a href="ti24img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> Pull down the piston while making sure that 
the seringe receives 0.1cc more than the needed quantity <a href="ti08imga.htm">(depending upon the day of the 
cycle).</a> </li>
<li>Pull the seringe out of the multi-dose vial. </li>
<li>While holding the seringe with the needle toward the ceiling, pull the piston down to 
0.7cc. </li>
<li>Tap the seringe to dislodge and get the air bubbles out. </li>
<li>Push the piston to the required level. A small drop <a href="ti25img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> must appear at the end of the 
needle. </li>
<li>Put the protective cover back on the seringe and return it to the tray. </li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="step3">Getting the patient ready</a></h1>
<p><i>The injection must be performed in a room which allows for a certain degree of intimacy. 
The temperature must be comfortable.</i> </p>
<ol>
<li>The patient must lie down, his head held at a comfortable level. <a href="ti26img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> He or she must relax 
and abstain from wearing clothes that are too tight. </li>
<li>The lower part of the body must be nude except for underwear. </li>
<li>Put the ice pack on the right inguinal zone <a href="ti27img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> for a period of 10 minutes. The skin must 
take on a pink color. If the patient feels that the cold is too much of a shock on the skin, a 
paper towel can be placed between the skin and the Ice Pak. </li>
<li>Disinfect the injection zone with a sterile tampon soaked in 94% alcohol. </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#table">Return to Table of contents</a></p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="step4">Perinodular injection</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>In the fold of the right leg, localize the pulse of the femoral artery. <a href="ti28img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> Place the 
middle-finger and the ring-finger on this artery and apply a progressive pressure to rise the 
deep lymphatic glands. The pulse of the artery is an important benchmark to localize the 
exact injection site. </li>
<li>With the side of your left hand, pull the skin of the lower belly toward the navel. </li>
<li>Rotate the wrist so that left hand's thumb is in front of the right hand fingers, pressing down 
on femoral artery. <a href="ti29img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> Replace the middle and ring fingers with thumb of left hand in 
order to maintain the pressure on the femoral artery and to assure that the lymph nodes do 
not slide back to their initial position. This pressure must be maintained througout the 
entire procedure; it assures that lymph nodes remain lightly elevated. </li>
<li>Now that it is free, the right hand can perform the injection. The exact site of the injection 
is 5 cm higher than the thumb on an imaginary line between the femoral artery and the 
navel. <a href="ti36img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> When the injection site is localized, the needle is inserted in a quick 
movement, and at needle-length depth. <a href="ti30img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> The left hand's thumb is then replaced by the 
right-hand's ring finger, to keep a good pressure on the artery, once again to avoid the 
receding of the lymph nodes. </li>
<li>The injection must be done very slowly. It should take between 10 and 20 minutes to inject 
0.5cc of 714X. During the injection, the seringe must be at a 45&#176; angle with the body. <a href="ti31img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> 
It is normal to feel pressure during the injection. If the pressure becomes too strong, it can 
be alleviated by simultaneously lifting the needle and the skin. If a burning sensation 
occurs, bring the Ice Pak close to the injection zone. </li>
<li>To limit the quantity of liquid injected with each depression of the plunger, one must avoid 
beaming down on the end part of the piston, but rather work a down movement with the 
left-hand on the side of the piston. The piston must go down about 1 milimeter each time. 
Repeat about every 10 seconds. </li>
<li>When the injection is over, wait 30 to 60 seconds before pulling out the needle. This will 
avoid a back flow of the 714X through the canal created by the needle, which would cause 
a burning sensation. </li>
<li>After having pulled out the needle, put a sterile cotton tampon on the injection site and put 
the Ice Pak back for fifteen minutes, directly on the injection zone. This will insure a better 
spreading of the product through the lymphatic system and diminish the risk of 
uncomfortable sensations caused by the rapid vaporization of 714X. The patient can take 
advantage of this time to relax before continuing his/her regular activities. </li>
<li>If a burning sensation reoccurs in the following hours, the skin can be cooled again with 
the Ice Pak or simply with ice. </li>
<li>If bleeding occurs after pulling out the needle, a bruise might appear. Such a situation is of 
no danger. </li>

<h1><a name="step6">Particular cases</a></h1>
<p>Some patients might prefer to inject the 714X themselves. For self-injection, the position might 
vary. One might choose to lie down <a href="ti33img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> with pillows under his/her head or back, or one might

with his/her hands. <a href="ti35img0.gif"><img src="ut16img0.gif" align=absbottom border=0 width=40 height=25></a> In that manner, he uncovers the inguinal zone, site of the injection. </p>

<p><font size=4>Auteur et coauteur de plusieurs best-sellers, monsieur Bird

<p>Le 714X (Trimethylbicyclonitraminoheptane Cl.) est un d&eacute;riv&eacute; de nitrogen et de 
camphre, m&eacute;lang&eacute; &agrave; des sels min&eacute;raux. Son action consiste &agrave; fluidifier la lymphe, 
tout en nourrissant les cellules canc&eacute;reuses de nitrogen. Ces derni&egrave;res arr&ecirc;tent d&egrave;s 
lors leurs s&eacute;cr&eacute;tions toxiques qui paralisent le syst&egrave;me de d&eacute;fense.</p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=4>Il y a plus de 40 ans, M. Gaston Naessens inventait le 
somatoscope. Un microscope capable d'atteindre un 
grossissement de plus de 30,000X avec une r&eacute;solution de 
15nm. L'observation d'&eacute;chantillons de sang frais lui permit 
d'&eacute;mettre l'hypoth&egrave;se que l'on retrouve, dans tout &ecirc;tre animal 
ou v&eacute;g&eacute;tal, des particules microscopiques tr&egrave;s dense qu'il appelle &quot;somatides&quot; et 
qui constitue la base m&ecirc;me de la vie. L'&eacute;tude morphologique de la sant&eacute; &agrave; partir 
d'&eacute;chantillons sanguins permet de d&eacute;pister un &eacute;tat de sant&eacute; favorisant un cancer, 
la scl&eacute;rose en plaques, l'arthrite rhumato&iuml;de progressive...</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=4>Par la suite, Gaston Naessens mit au point un condensateur, adaptable &agrave; la 
plupart des microscopes sur le march&eacute; et accessible &agrave; tous les professionnels de 
la sant&eacute;. L'ultramicroscope permet ainsi d'observer le </font></font><a href="ti05imgf.htm#Cycle"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=4>cycle de la somatide</font></font></a><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=4> &agrave; partir 
d'une goutte de sang fraichement extraite. Comme la m&eacute;decine orthodoxe n'offre 
aucun examen de sang frais pour le cancer, des &eacute;tudes sont pr&eacute;sentement en 
cours afin de standardiser le test de sang Naessens. Les r&eacute;sultats de ces &eacute;tudes 
permettront &eacute;ventuellement d'&eacute;laborer un examen sanguin pouvant diagnostiquer 
toute forme de cancer, tout en respectant les normes des autorit&eacute;s m&eacute;dicales 
canadiennes. </font></font></p>

<p><a name="Introduction"><font size=6><strong>Introduction</strong></font></a></p>
<p>Lorsqu&#146;on envisage le cancer comme une maladie cellulaire, isol&eacute;e de perturbations 
biologiques g&eacute;n&eacute;rales et &eacute;voluant suivant des normes propres et locales, la conduite 
th&eacute;rapeutique est centr&eacute;e sur &quot;l&#146;agglom&eacute;ration tumorale&quot;; la destruction et l&#146;extirpation 
deviennent alors les seuls moyens imp&eacute;ratifs de gu&eacute;rison. </p>
<p>Jusqu&#146;&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, parmi les moyens mis &agrave; notre disposition pour combattre cette maladie figure 
en premier lieu la solution chirurgicale. Cette solution, qui consiste en l&#146;extirpation de la masse 
parasite et autonome de l&#146;agglom&eacute;ration cellulaire, r&eacute;pond le mieux &agrave; la notion voulant que la 
tumeur soit une &quot;maladie locale&quot;. Cette voie nous appara&icirc;t comme une solution paliative 
d&#146;urgence. </p>
<p>Vient ensuite la solution radiante. La radioth&eacute;rapie propose la destruction des tumeurs par une 
action lysante profondes des cellules canc&eacute;reuses. Ici, la question de dose et de surface 
irradi&eacute;e a une importance consid&eacute;rable. Cette th&eacute;rapie physique des tumeurs pourrait &ecirc;tre 
efficiente si les radiations &eacute;taient port&eacute;es au niveau des cellules n&eacute;oplasiques, non pas &agrave; la fin 
d&#146;une lyse imm&eacute;diate et aveugle, mais afin de renforcer la r&eacute;versibilit&eacute; des synth&egrave;ses 
pathologiques, source de leur malignit&eacute;. </p>
<p>Enfin, il y a la solution chimioth&eacute;rapique bas&eacute;e sur des moyens chimiques toxiques pour les 
cellules. Cette th&eacute;rapie fait usage de poisons caryoclasiques afin d&#146;arr&ecirc;ter les mitoses par des 
divisions plasmatiques et chromatiques d&eacute;cal&eacute;es, mais elle aboutit &eacute;galement &agrave; des 
duplications du nombre de chromosomes et &agrave; des mitoses anormales. L&#146;action caryoclasique 
proprement dite de cette th&eacute;rapeutique appara&icirc;t vis-a-vis des mitoses n&eacute;oplasiques comme une 
modalit&eacute; essentiellement n&eacute;gative d&#146;arr&ecirc;t, de blocage et de lyse chromiale. Cette action 
repr&eacute;sente aussi un danger (sans parler de la toxicit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale) pour les mitoses des cellules 
normales et entre autres, celles de la s&eacute;rie germinale.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Immune">Immunit&eacute; naturelle</a></h1>
<p>Depuis quelques temps d&eacute;j&agrave;, une orientation nouvelle a &eacute;t&eacute; donn&eacute;e aux travaux des chercheurs 
oeuvrant en canc&eacute;rologie. En effet, les possibilit&eacute;e d&#146;immunit&eacute; naturelle tant zoologique que 
physiologique ou individuelle dans les cancers greff&eacute;s (dont la nature essentiellement 
antitissulaire reste obscure) ont montr&eacute; que le cancer ne doit pas &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme une 
maladie cellulaire, isol&eacute;e de perturbations biologiques g&eacute;n&eacute;rales. Au contraire, il semble que 
l&#146;&eacute;volution de cette maladie est li&eacute;e aux conditions de l&#146;organisme et que l&#146;aptitude de 
canc&eacute;risation revient &agrave; l&#146;organisme &quot;seul&quot;. La tumeur a besoin de l&#146;organisme pour &eacute;clore et en 
dehors de celui-ci, la canc&eacute;risation ne s&#146;op&egrave;re pas. </p>
<p>Etant donn&eacute; l&#146;interaction qui existe entre l&#146;organe et la tumeur, en particulier sa vascularisation, 
la composition du sang qui l&#146;irrigue et l&#146;&eacute;tat de l&#146;influx nerveux y aff&eacute;rant, toute modification 
de ces diff&eacute;rents facteurs peut donc avoir une action sur la vie m&ecirc;me du cancer. Le processus 
qui permet &agrave; certains moments &agrave; l&#146;h&ocirc;te porteur d&#146;une tumeur de la stabiliser doit &ecirc;tre analogue &agrave; 
celui permettant &agrave; un individu bien portant d&#146;h&eacute;berger dans sa gorge des bacilles de la dipht&eacute;rie 
sans &ecirc;tre atteint de cette maladie. </p>
<p>Il est possible, en raisonnant par analogie, que des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes semblables se produisent &agrave; 
l&#146;&eacute;gard des cellules malignes. Si l&#146;on tient compte des nombreuses causes possibles de cancer 
qui nous environnent, n&#146;existe-t-il pas chez certains individus des possibilit&eacute;s de r&eacute;sistance au 
d&eacute;veloppement d&#146;un cancer?</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Greffes"><font size=6><strong>Greffes et cancer</strong></font></a></h1>
<p>Un certain nombre d&#146;&eacute;tudes ont &eacute;t&eacute; entreprises en vue d&#146;&eacute;claicir ce probl&egrave;me. Les premiers 
essais ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s chez des malades porteurs de cancers avanc&eacute;s et qui avaient accept&eacute; de 
se pr&ecirc;ter aux exp&eacute;riences. Des fragments de tumeur pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s sur d&#146;autres personnes et 
longtemps cultiv&eacute;s en milieu artificiel furent implant&eacute;s chez ces malades, sous la peau de leur 
avant-bras. Cette greffe prit et augmenta de volume progressivement. Ce r&eacute;sultat &eacute;tait en 
contradiction avec la loi biologique habituelle qui veut qu&#146;un tissu pr&eacute;lev&eacute; sur un animal ne se 
d&eacute;veloppe pas s&#146;il est greff&eacute; sur un autre animal, &agrave; moins que ce dernier ne soit un vrai jumeau 
du premier. </p>
<p>L&#146;explication de cette constatation, en apparence paradoxale, veut que, chez les malades 
atteints de cancer avanc&eacute;, la d&eacute;fense naturelle habituelle qui s&#146;oppose &agrave; la prise des greffes ait 
disparu par suite du mauvais &eacute;tat du malade. Il est alors normal de se demander si toutes les 
d&eacute;fenses habituelles des ces malades fatigu&eacute;s avaient ainsi c&eacute;d&eacute;. L&#146;exp&eacute;rience montra qu&#146;elles 
n&#146;avaient c&eacute;d&eacute; que pour le cancer et non pour les autres atteintes puisque les greffes de tissus 
normaux ont rapidement &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;limin&eacute;es. Les deux explications possibles &eacute;taient que, ou bien le 
tissu canc&eacute;reux avait un pouvoir particulier de croissance contraire aux r&egrave;gles habituelles qui 
r&eacute;gissent les greffes, ou bien que le malade avait perdu ses possibilit&eacute;s de d&eacute;fense normale, 
sp&eacute;cialement &agrave; l&#146;&eacute;gard de la cellule canc&eacute;reuse. La question se posait alors de savoir si des 
cellules de cancer transplant&eacute;es chez un individu normal seraient capables de cro&icirc;tre. </p>
<p>Une &eacute;tude syst&eacute;matique de cette question a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;e par le centre de recherches sur le cancer 
de New York qui fit appel &agrave; des volontaires internes dans une prison am&eacute;ricaine. Parmi plus de 
cent volontaires, cinquante hommes furent choisis. On implanta chez eux une culture de cancer 
humain de m&ecirc;me nature que celle qui avait &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e chez les malades atteints de cancer. Chez 
les cinquantes volontaires, il y eut une importante r&eacute;action locale inflammatoire de d&eacute;fense et la 
greffe disparut compl&egrave;tement en quatre semaines. Cette exp&eacute;rience apporta la preuve que le 
corps humain poss&egrave;de une sorte de r&eacute;sistance &agrave; la croissance des cancers transplant&eacute;s &agrave; partir 
d&#146;un autre homme. Cette r&eacute;sistance n&#146;existe pas chez les malades atteints de cancers avanc&eacute;s. </p>
<p>Ces exp&eacute;riences permettent de penser qu&#146;il serait possible de provoquer une augmentation de la 
d&eacute;fense naturelle de l&#146;organisme contre le cancer. C&#146;est pourquoi les recherches se sont 
d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es dans le domaine de l&#146;immunologie. Il s&#146;agit concr&egrave;tement de savoir si des 
&eacute;l&eacute;ments qui constituent la tumeur maligne, essentiellement les &eacute;l&eacute;ments chimiques qui forment 
la cellule ou le noyau, sont capables de jouer le r&ocirc;le d&#146;antig&egrave;nes, c&#146;est-&agrave;-dire de provoquer 
dans l&#146;organisme qui les contiennent, l&#146;apparition d&#146;une substance antagoniste appel&eacute;e 
anticorps dont le r&ocirc;le est de s&#146;opposer au d&eacute;veloppement de l&#146;antig&egrave;ne. Si une telle propri&eacute;t&eacute; 
pouvait &ecirc;tre d&eacute;cel&eacute;e dans les tumeurs malignes, elle indiquerait la possibilit&eacute; de favoriser la 
formation de ces anticorps pour lutter contre le d&eacute;veloppement du cancer. </p>
<p>Le probl&egrave;me n&#146;est toutefois pas si simple, car les tissus normaux dont sont issus les cancers 
sont capables eux-m&ecirc;mes, lorsque greff&eacute;s sur un autre sujet, de provoquer l&#146;apparition 
d&#146;anticorps. Il faut donc supprimer les anticorps &quot;normaux&quot; ainsi form&eacute;s afin de rechercher s&#146;il 
n&#146;existe pas d&#146;autres anticorps dont la formation ne serait due qu&#146;&agrave; la pr&eacute;sence du tissu malin. 
Il faudrait admettre que, non pas la tumeur mais peut-&ecirc;tre un ou plusieurs compos&eacute;s de la 
cellule jouent le r&ocirc;le de corps &eacute;tranger en se d&eacute;veloppant dans l&#146;organisme. </p>
<p>Il n&#146;est pas impossible de consid&eacute;rer qu&#146;il existe, dans certaines circonstances, un certain degr&eacute; 
de propri&eacute;t&eacute;s antig&eacute;niques et qu&#146;il soit alors possible d&#146;en favoriser le developpement et 
d&#146;encourager la formation des anticorps correspondants. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;me pourrait alors 
expliquer pourquoi certains sujets porteurs de cancer ne voient se d&eacute;velopper ult&eacute;rieurement 
des m&eacute;tastases, bien que des cellules se soient diffus&eacute;es &agrave; partir de la tumeur primitive dans 
l&#146;organisme. Les cellules arr&ecirc;t&eacute;es en d&#146;autres points ont pu y provoquer la formation 
d&#146;anticorps qui se sont oppos&eacute;s au d&eacute;veloppement des m&eacute;tastases ou qui peuvent les avoir 
d&eacute;truites. On peut &eacute;galement envisager qu&#146;une baisse de l&#146;immunit&eacute; qui avait stabilis&eacute; les 
cellules essaim&eacute;es permet le d&eacute;veloppement des m&eacute;tastases &agrave; distance, parfois des ann&eacute;es 
apr&egrave;s la destruction de la tumeur initiale.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Tumeur">Cellules tumorales</a></h1>
<p>Le probl&egrave;me du cancer &eacute;tant envisag&eacute; sous cet angle, il est n&eacute;cessaire de s&#146;attarder &agrave; l&#146;&eacute;tude de 
la vie de la cellule maligne afin de d&eacute;couvrir quel pourrait &ecirc;tre l&#146;agent antig&eacute;nique capable 
d&#146;engendrer de tels anticorps pouvant d&eacute;truire les cellules canc&eacute;reuses. Malgr&eacute; les aspects tr&egrave;s 
particuliers de la cellule maligne, il est surprenant de constater que l&#146;on en soit encore &agrave; se 
demander en quoi elle peut diff&eacute;rer de la cellule normale. </p>
<p>Les recherches tendant &agrave; mettre en &eacute;vidence un &eacute;l&eacute;ment nouveau que l&#146;on n&#146;aurait pas trouv&eacute; 
dans les cellules normales n&#146;ont aboutit &agrave; aucun r&eacute;sultat concluant. Par contre, il semblerait 
qu&#146;il existe des diff&eacute;rences qualitatives dans le choix que fait la cellule parmi les mati&egrave;res 
premi&egrave;res qui lui sont fournies, en particulier les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes chimiques et les fermentations 
conduisant &agrave; la formation d&#146;acides nucl&eacute;iques dont le r&ocirc;le est essentiel dans la vie de la 
cellule. </p>
<p>Les cellules tumorales consomment plus de glucose que les cellules normales. Cependant 
aucune diff&eacute;rence qualitative qui puisse indiquer une augmentation dans l&#146;acide lactique n&#146;a &eacute;t&eacute; 
trouv&eacute;e entre le tissu normal et le tissu tumoral. Les cellules tumorales utilisent l&#146;&eacute;nergie 
provoqu&eacute;e par la destruction des hydrates de carbones pour la synth&egrave;se des prot&eacute;ines 
cellulaires sur une plus grande &eacute;chelle que ne le fait un tissu normal. La cellule retourne vers 
une forme plus simple. Les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de fermentations (li&eacute;s aux ferments appel&eacute;s enzymes), 
base de la vie propre de la cellule, se simplifient et celle-ci perd alors plus ou moins les 
fonctions qui lui donnent son individualit&eacute; et font qu&#146;elle appartient &agrave; un organe sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;. </p>
<p>La cellule se divise avant d&#146;avoir utilis&eacute; toute sa capacit&eacute; de synth&egrave;se, interrompant ainsi 
pr&eacute;cocement le cycle de ses activit&eacute;s et aggravant &agrave; chaque division son d&eacute;r&egrave;glement. En 
revanche, elle retrouve des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s anciennes, souvenir de son origine, dont la plus 
importante est l&#146;aptitude &agrave; se multiplier plus rapidement avec les cons&eacute;quences qui sont une des 
manifestations de la malignit&eacute;. Cet accroissement anormal en nombre est d&ucirc; &agrave; une lib&eacute;ration du 
syst&egrave;me de contr&ocirc;le qui maintient habituellement l&#146;harmonie tissulaire. Les cellules deviennent 
alors de dangereux parasites ou anarchistes au sein de la communaut&eacute; cellulaire. Les cellules 
malignes semblent &quot;privil&eacute;gi&eacute;es&quot; et &quot;antisociales&quot;. Elles accaparent en priorit&eacute; les mat&eacute;riaux et 
en particulier, les acides amin&eacute;s indispensables &agrave; la vie de toute cellule, qu&#146;elle soit normale 
ou maligne. </p>
<p>Ce qui frappe surtout dans l&#146;ensemble des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes physiques ou chimiques de la vie 
cellulaire, c&#146;est leur intensit&eacute; par rapport aux ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de la chimie ordinaire dans des 
conditions analogues. Les conditions de milieu (temp&eacute;rature, pression des ions H et des 
mol&eacute;cules) ont une importance capitale sur les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de la vie cellulaire. </p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Etat">&Eacute;tat physique des humeurs</a></h1>
<p>De tous les probl&egrave;mes, le plus important est celui de la perturbation du syst&egrave;me humoral 
engendr&eacute; par ces ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes et des cons&eacute;quences qui en d&eacute;coulent dans le comportement des 
individus &agrave; l&#146;&eacute;tat normal ou pathologique. Hippocrate et, bien avant lui, les H&eacute;breux et les 
&Eacute;gyptiens attribuaient d&eacute;j&agrave; la majeure partie des accidents morbides &agrave; des troubles humoraux. </p>
<p>On entend par &quot;humeurs&quot; les liquides extra-cellulaires de l&#146;organisme. Les humeurs forment la 
partie fluide du sang circulant: le plasma, dans lequel les &eacute;l&eacute;ments figures sanguins comme les 
globules blancs et rouges sont en suspension, et aussi tous les liquides intersticiels, lacunaires 
ou autres qui baignent, impr&egrave;gnent ou entourent les tissus et les organes. Ne disposant d&#146;aucun 
moyen pr&eacute;cis d&#146;investigation, les Anciens ignoraient fatalement comment et pourquoi les 
humeurs pouvaient &ecirc;tre novices. </p>
<p>Lorsque, beaucoup plus tard, la constitution de ces humeurs put &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;cis&eacute;e, les m&eacute;decins ont 
recherch&eacute; quelles pouvaient &ecirc;tre parmi les substances qui les composent, celles dont la 
pr&eacute;sence paraissait responsable des accidents pathologiques. Ayant reconnu que toutes les 
variations exp&eacute;rimentalement provoqu&eacute;es dans la teneur des divers &eacute;l&eacute;ments constitutionnels 
humoraux &eacute;taient impuissantes &agrave; reproduire les sympt&ocirc;mes des maladies aig&uuml;es ou chroniques, 
ils arriv&egrave;rent &agrave; cette conclusion diam&eacute;tralement oppos&eacute;e &agrave; celle d&#146;Hippocrate, que l&#146;&eacute;tat 
humoral ne joue aucun r&ocirc;le dans la g&eacute;n&egrave;se des maladies. La m&eacute;decine devint alors &quot;solidiste&quot;: 
les l&eacute;sions seules entrent en ligne de compte; l&#146;&eacute;tat des humeurs est sans importance. </p>
<p>Sur des bases modernes, nous allons tenter d&#146;assurer la reconnaissance de la m&eacute;decine 
humorale en d&eacute;couvrant la raison r&eacute;elle de la nocivit&eacute; des humeurs, laquelle r&eacute;side non dans 
leur constitution chimique, mais dans l&#146;&eacute;tat physique de certains &eacute;l&eacute;ments lorsque ceux-ci 
viennent &agrave; affecter l&#146;&eacute;tat solide. </p>
<p>Nous nous sommes donc interess&eacute;s &agrave; observer le comportement des &eacute;l&eacute;ments figures 
observables dans tous les liquides biologiques. Notre attention a &eacute;t&eacute; retenue par des particules 
extr&ecirc;mement tenues dont la pr&eacute;sence avait d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute;e par de nombreux auteurs &agrave; la fin du 
si&egrave;cle dernier.</p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Cycle">Cycle de la somatide</a></h1>
<p>Depuis longtemps d&eacute;j&agrave;, le microscope est un instrument indispensable aux mesures de pr&eacute;cision 
dans les laboratoires de recherche et l&#146;industrie. Le microscope classique permet normalement 
des grossissements de l&#146;ordre de 1,800X avec une r&eacute;solution de 0.1 microns (&#181;). Le 
microscope &eacute;lectronique est beaucoup plus puissant avec des grossissements de l&#146;ordre de 
400,000X avec une r&eacute;solution de 30-50 angstroms ou &Aring;. Mais l&#146;usage de 
ce dernier n&eacute;cessite toutefois des manipulations qui alt&egrave;rent l&#146;aspect physique des objets &agrave; 
observer. </p>
<p>Nous avons donc mis au point un instrument d&#146;observation microscopique que nous avons 
appel&eacute; Somatoscope. La qualit&eacute; premi&egrave;re de cet appareil est de permettre l&#146;observation 
d&#146;&eacute;l&eacute;ments vivants et d&#146;en suivre le polymorphisme &agrave; des grossissements pouvant atteindre 
30,000X avec une r&eacute;solution de l&#146;ordre de 150 &Aring;. </p>
<p>Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; cet instrument, nous avons mis en &eacute;vidence dans tous les liquides biologiques et en 
particulier dans le sang, une particule &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire dou&eacute;e d&#146;un mouvement de r&eacute;pulsion 
&eacute;lectron&eacute;gative et poss&eacute;dant un polymorphisme. Nous l&#146;avons appel&eacute;e SOMATIDE. <a href="ti05imgf.gif"><img src="ti05lnk0.gif" align=right hspace=0 width=346 height=309></a> Cette 
particule extr&ecirc;mement m&eacute;nue, dont la dimension 
varie de quelques angstrom &agrave; 0.1&#181;, a pu &ecirc;tre isol&eacute;e 
et mise en culture. Nous avons pu ainsi en observer 
le polymorphisme pr&eacute;sent&eacute; &agrave; dans la figure. </p>
<p>La surprise pour nous fut de retrouver dans ce 
cycle des &eacute;l&eacute;ments figur&eacute;s que nous &eacute;tions habitu&eacute;s 
&agrave; observer dans le sang de personnes saines mais 
&eacute;galement dans le sang de personnes porteuses de 
diverses maladies. Nous avons pu en d&eacute;terminer 
les corr&eacute;lations. </p>
<p>Dans le sang des personnes saines, nous observons 
les somatides, les spores et les doubles spores 
(num&eacute;ros 1 &agrave; 3 sur le diagramme). Au cours de ce 
micro-cycle, il y a formation dans le milieu d&#146;une tr&eacute;phone. Cette hormone de prolif&eacute;ration est 
indispensable &agrave; la division cellulaire. Sans elle, la vie n&#146;existe pas. Dans les organismes sains, 
l&#146;&eacute;volution de ce cycle &agrave; partir de la somatide est arr&ecirc;t&eacute;e au stade de double spore par les 
inhibiteurs sanguins. Il s&#146;agit de substances min&eacute;rales (cuivre, mercure, plomb...) ou de 
substances organiques (acide cyanidrique, poisons des diastases, etc.) Au cours de ce 
micro-cycle, la quantit&eacute; de tr&eacute;phone n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; la multiplication cellulaire est ainsi &eacute;labor&eacute;e. </p>
<p>Si sous l&#146;effet du stress ou par quellesques perturbations biologiques que ce soit les inhibiteurs 
sanguins diminuent d&#146;une fa&ccedil;on consid&eacute;rable, le cycle de la somatide continue son &eacute;volution 
naturelle et on voit apparaitre dans les milieux biologiques et en particulier dans le sang, les 
diverses formes bact&eacute;riennes (4-6). Ces formes ont d&#146;ailleurs &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tudi&eacute;es auparavant par les 
auteurs allemands dans les ann&eacute;es &#145;30 sous le nom de syphonospora polymorpha. </p>
<p>Viennent ensuite les formes mycobact&eacute;riennes (7-10), puis les formes levures (12). Ces formes, 
d&#146;une dimension de 4 &agrave; 5 &#181;, &eacute;voluent rapidement en ascospore (13), puis par maturation 
deviennent des asques. </p>
<p>&Agrave; ce stade de l&#146;&eacute;volution et apr&egrave;s coloration sur les frottis sanguins, l&#146;asque appara&icirc;t comme un 
petit lymphocite et ne peut &ecirc;tre diff&eacute;renci&eacute; par les moyens habituels. </p>
<p>Suivent les formes filament&eacute;es (14-15). On peut observer &agrave; partir d&#146;une asque, la formation 
d&#146;un thale dans lequel &eacute;volue un cytoplasme de plus en plus important (14). Ce cytoplasme se 
forme &agrave; partir de l&#146;asque, il est possible de remarquer un conjoncteur entre l&#146;asque et le thale. 
C&#146;est par ce conjoncteur et par p&eacute;ristaltisme que se forme le cytoplasme dans le thale (15). </p>
<p>Cette forme d&#146;apparence myc&eacute;lienne ne r&eacute;pond &agrave; aucun des crit&egrave;res des &eacute;l&eacute;ments fongiques. En 
effet, elle n&#146;est nullement affect&eacute;e par des doses massives d&#146;Amphot&eacute;ricine B, Fongyzone ou 
autres anti-fongiques. Lorsque cet &eacute;l&eacute;ment pseudo-myc&eacute;lien a atteint sa pleine maturit&eacute; avec un 
cytoplasme extr&ecirc;mement actif, on assiste alors &agrave; l&#146;&eacute;clatement de ce thale qui lib&egrave;re dans le 
milieu une &eacute;norme quantit&eacute; de nouvelles particules capables de reformer le cycle complet (16). </p>
<p>Vid&eacute; de son cytoplasme, ce thale a un aspect fibreux. Il est d&#146;ailleurs souvent observ&eacute; sur les 
frottis color&eacute;s mais il est catalogu&eacute; comme art&eacute;fact de coloration. </p>
<p>Des observations qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;dent, nous avons pu tirer les conclusions suivantes: </p>
<ol>
<li>La division cellulaire exige la pr&eacute;sence de la SOMATIDE (que ce soit dans le r&egrave;gne 
animal ou v&eacute;g&eacute;tal). </li>
<li>Les tr&eacute;phones sont &eacute;labor&eacute;s par la SOMATIDE. </li>
<li>La SOMATIDE est dou&eacute;e de polymorphisme. Ce polymorphisme est r&eacute;gi par les 
inhibiteurs sanguins. </li>
<li>La d&eacute;ficience en inhibiteurs sanguins permet l'&eacute;laboration d'une trop grande quantit&eacute; de 
tr&eacute;phones, ce qui am&egrave;ne des d&eacute;sordres dans le m&eacute;tabolisme cellulaire. </li>
<li>Toutes les maladies d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ratives sont une cons&eacute;quence de ces d&eacute;sordres. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1><a name="Evolution">&Eacute;volution du cancer</a></h1>
<p>&Agrave; la lumi&egrave;re des observations pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes, la notion de &quot;cancer, maladie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale qui se 
localise&quot; prend toute sa signification lorsqu&#146;on examine le processus &eacute;volutif de cette affection. </p>
<p><u>1er temps: Canc&eacute;risation ou initiation</u></p>
<p>Lorsque les inhibiteurs sanguins diminuent pour une raison quelconque et que le polymorphisme 
de la somatide n&#146;est plus arr&ecirc;t&eacute; au stade de la double spore, une formation exag&eacute;r&eacute;e de 
tr&eacute;phones dans l&#146;organisme am&egrave;ne la cellule &agrave; retourner vers une forme plus simple. Comme 
nous l&#146;avons vu pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment, les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de fermentation (li&eacute;s aux ferments appel&eacute;s 
enzymes), base de sa vie, se simplifient et de ce fait, elle perd plus ou moins des fonctions qui 
lui donnent son individualit&eacute; et font qu&#146;elle appartient &agrave; un organe sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;. </p>
<p>La cellule se divise avant d&#146;avoir utilis&eacute; toute sa capacit&eacute; de synth&egrave;se, interrompant ainsi 
pr&eacute;cocement le cycle de ses activit&eacute;s et aggravant &agrave; chaque division son d&eacute;r&egrave;glement. En 
revanche, elle retrouve des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s anciennes, souvenir de son origine, dont la plus 
importante est l&#146;aptitude &agrave; se multiplier plus rapidement avec les cons&eacute;quences qui sont une des 
manifestations de sa malignit&eacute;. Cet accroissement anormal en nombre est d&ucirc; &agrave; une lib&eacute;ration du 
syst&egrave;me de contr&ocirc;le qui maintient habituellement l&#146;harmonie cellulaire. </p>
<p>&Agrave; ce stade, la canc&eacute;risation est effective et peut &ecirc;tre appel&eacute;e initiation ou pr&eacute;canc&eacute;rose. La 
multiplication acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute;e et anarchique d&#146;une ou de plusieurs cellules provoqu&eacute;e par une 
agglom&eacute;ration de leurs descendants, l&#146;apparition d&#146;une &quot;entit&eacute;&quot; nouvelle s&#146;opposant &agrave; 
l&#146;organisme qui lui a donn&eacute; naissance. Le syst&egrave;me immunitaire entre alors en action et lutte 
activement pour &eacute;liminer cette entit&eacute; nouvelle. Nous faisons chaque jour un petit cancer, mais 
notre syst&egrave;me immunitaire nous en d&eacute;barrasse. </p>
<p><u>2e temps: Cocanc&eacute;risation ou promotion</u> </p>
<p>Si le syst&egrave;me immunitaire est tant soit peu d&eacute;ficient et que l&#146;entit&eacute; nouvelle a pu prendre une 
certaine proportion, elle atteint alors une &quot;masse critique&quot; de cellules en prolif&eacute;ration 
anarchique. Cette entit&eacute; qui a pu &eacute;chapper au syst&egrave;me immunitaire, a besoin pour subsister 
d&#146;une quantit&eacute; &eacute;norme d&#146;azote (les cellules de cette entit&eacute; sont d&#146;ailleurs nomm&eacute;es Nitrogen 
Traps). Elle &eacute;met alors une substance qui lui permet de retirer des d&eacute;riv&eacute;s azot&eacute;s de 
l&#146;organisme et qui paralyse en m&ecirc;me temps le syst&egrave;me immunitaire. Nous avons appel&eacute; cette 
substance Facteur Cocancerig&egrave;ne K (FCK). </p>
<p>Ce n&#146;est que lorsque la masse critique des cellules en prolif&eacute;ration anarchique est d&eacute;pass&eacute;e 
qu&#146;appara&icirc;t l&#146;action paralysante du FCK envers le syst&egrave;me immunitaire. D&egrave;s ce moment, 
l&#146;organisme se trouve sans d&eacute;fense envers cette nouvelle entit&eacute; qui peut se d&eacute;velopper &agrave; son gr&eacute; 
et envahir progressivement son h&ocirc;te. </p>
<p>De cette analyse rapide, il ressort que: </p>
<ol>
<li>La phase de canc&eacute;risation ou initiation est li&eacute;e &agrave; la diminution des inhibiteurs sanguins et &agrave; 
une faiblesse du syst&egrave;me immunitaire. </li>
<li>La phase de cocanc&eacute;risation ou promotion est la cons&eacute;quence directe de la paralysie du 
syst&egrave;me immunitaire provoqu&eacute;e par une substance appel&eacute;e FCK. Cette substance est 
&eacute;labor&eacute;e par les cellules anarchiques afin de retirer de l&#146;organisme les d&eacute;riv&eacute;s azot&eacute;s 
n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; la prolif&eacute;ration.</li>
</ol>
<p>La compr&eacute;hension du processus que nous venons de d&eacute;crire nous a permis de proposer une 
th&eacute;rapie tendant &agrave; supprimer le FCK. En effet, si celui-ci est neutralis&eacute;, le syst&egrave;me immunitaire 
peut retrouver son activit&eacute; initiale et consid&eacute;rer chaque cellule anarchique composant les 
tumeurs comme des corps &eacute;trangers &agrave; rejeter. </p>
<p>&Agrave; la suite de nombreux travaux de recherche effectu&eacute;s sur la camphorimine et ses d&eacute;riv&eacute;s, nous 
avons d&eacute;couvert que ce produit est dou&eacute; d&#146;une remarquable propri&eacute;t&eacute; pharmacologique 
puisqu&#146;il emp&ecirc;che la formation de la substance d&eacute;sign&eacute;e sous le nom de FCK. C&#146;est une 
substance qui met les leucocytes et autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments phagocytaires de l&#146;organisme en &eacute;tat de 
paralysie au cours de diverses affections d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ratives. </p>
<p>La camphorimine n&#146;est ni un antimitotique ni un antim&eacute;tabolite. Sa propri&eacute;t&eacute; d&#146;inhiber le FCK 
r&eacute;side dans le fait qu&#146;elle apporte &agrave; la cellule qui &eacute;labore le FCK, tout l&#146;azote dont elle a 
besoin, supprimant par le fait m&ecirc;me la s&eacute;cr&eacute;tion qui paralysait le syst&egrave;me immunitaire. Nous 
avons donc propos&eacute; &agrave; l&#146;exp&eacute;rimentation un d&eacute;riv&eacute; de la camphorimine sous le nom de 714X. </p>

<H4><I>Christopher's Bistro</I>, ideal for more relaxed dining, featuring
the spontaneity of a French bistro with the very best of American International
cuisine. The <I>Bistro</I> has been lauded as <I>&quot;4 Stars... Exceptional&quot;</I>
by Food &amp; Wine and as <I>&quot;two of the countries best dining rooms&quot;</I>
by the New York Times. The finest and freshest ingredients, the deceptively
simple yet elegant presentations of Chef Christopher, the highly trained
professional staff and the award winning wine list combine to create a
uniquely, memorable dining experience.</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Guy Gabriel Coscas and Chef <A HREF="chrisbio.html">Christopher
Gross</A> are pleased to announce the opening of Arizona Caf&eacute; &amp;
Grill. This talented duo will work their collective restaurant magic at
the 32nd and Lincoln location, formerly known as Mother Tucker's. The spacious
main dining room is bordered with Indian blanketed booths and immense Arizona
state flag suspended from the ceiling. The centerpiece of this room is
the <I>Corral</I>, trimmed with lodgepole where diners will enjoy a bird's
eye view of the chef preparing trademark dishes exhibition style in the
pizza oven and rotisserie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A one of a kind view awaits guests who choose to dine
on ACG's covered patio. Arizona misters in the summer and a lovely outdoor
fireplace on crisp Valley evenings allow diners to enjoy great Arizona
cuisine and the fabulous Phoenix skyline. The lounge at ACG has already
become one of Phoenix's most high energy watering holes. ACG features a
marvelous wine list which is sure to include some of your favorites and
a unique collection of beers, imported and domestic, which are paired with
menu selections by Beverage Director, <A HREF="paola.html">Paola Gross</A>.
The lists feature a great variety of reasonably priced wine and beers guaranteed
to quench anyone's thirst.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>ACG will offer guests a true taste of Arizona. The menu
selections are moderately priced and the flavors are as vast as the Arizona
desert. Mouth watering starters and crisp salads are the perfect opening
for the menu headliners, sensational grilled steaks each accompanied by
three signature sauces, oven roasted pizzas and fabulous fresh fish. The
desserts are sweet, Arizona inspired interpretations of American favorites.
ACG's menu selections will tempt diners of all ages and is designed with
a casual family experience in mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If ACG's food whets your appetite for all things Arizona,

<H2>Cafe Second Helpings: Some Like it Haute</H2>
<H3>June 27, 1996<BR>
Phoenix New Times<BR>
by Howard Seftel</H3>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Some like it haute: Whats the Valleys best Mexican restaurant? Italian
restaurant? Chinese restaurant? </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can make a case for at least ten restaurants in each category. <B>But
when it comes to high-end, gourmet dining, theres only one contender in
town: Christophers</B>. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I recently revisited chef Christopher Gross flagship restaurant (not
to be confused with his next-door place, Christophers Bistro), and <B>left
almost woozy with admiration</B>. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The small room is plush and elegant; the sharply trained staff is
smooth and knowledgeable; the wine list is the best in town. And the food
is out of this world.</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can order a la carte. But the wisest plan of action is to go with
the seven-course fixed-price dinner. Come with good company and armed with
plenty of conversation-youll be here for about three hours.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dinner gets under way with a disk of silky-smooth house-smoked Irish
salmon bathed in a basil oil, and topped with creme fraiche and a dollop
of osetra caviar.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Next up is one of the worlds greatest treats: foie gras, prepared both
as a mousse and saut&eacute;ed whole. Accompanied by a glass of Sauternes,
its a heart-stopping thrill.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The foie gras is a hard act to follow, but the chef managed to find
one of my weaknesses: sweetbreads. Theyre rolled in chanterelles, and
the flavor is sublime.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At this point, you may want to loosen your belt a notch for the fish
course, a combination of lobster meat and sea scallops in a creamy chive
sauce. Then comes the meat dish, a couple of thin, velvety sirloin slices,
lightly smoked, served with fareki (a Middle Eastern grain) and elephant
garlic.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dinner begins to wind down with a cheese course. The kitchen offers
three samples, ranging from mild to sharp: tete de moine from Switzerland,
reblochon from France, and a somewhat overrated American cheese, Maytag
Blue. (Id prefer Stilton or Roquefort.)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finally, dessert. We were lucky to hit a night which featured the stunning
hot and cold chocolate-a combination of ice cream, cake and souffl&eacute;.
Wow.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The $75 tag? Only those who know the price of everything and the value
of nothing could complain. In addition, the chef will pair each course
with wine for an additional $40. Or you could do your own wine mixing and
matching. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When I got my bill, I noticed we hadnt been charged for a glass of
wine. After I alerted the manager, he thanked me for my honesty and said
it was on the house.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Is this any way to run a restaurant? You bet it is.</B></P>

<CENTER><H2>Arizona Cigar Lovers Magazine</H2></CENTER>

<P><BR>
</P>

<UL><MULTICOL COLS=2 GUTTER=40>

<P>Close to 30 years ago, a desire to race motorcycles in the vast deserts
of Arizona just outside of Phoenix sparked a brilliant career for a young man. His
profession, though, had nothing in common with dirt, speed and the sun.</P>

<P>At the age of 12, Christopher Gross and his family moved from his
birthplace of Trenton, Missouri, to the Valley of the Sun. His first discovery was,
it seemed, that everyone was out in the desert racing motorcycles. His next door
neighbors had six dirt bikes and Christopher was determined to have one of his own.
Chris went to work at a local restaurant with the single goal of buying a bike of his
own so that he, too, could race in the desert. He soon achieved his objective and
continued to work in local Phoenix restaurants and ride bikes until he
turned 18.</P>

<P>In 1973, at the Adams Hotel in Phoenix, Christophers life would
be forever changed. For it was here that he discovered the restaurant industry was
no longer a means to an end - it had captured his heart and soul and soon became a
passion that would lead him to great things.</P>

<P>Leaving Phoenix to pursue his newfound career, Christopher returned
13 years ago. At that time, the Valley was hardly culinary paradise.  One was hard
pressed to find a restaurant other than the classic American "steak and potatoes"
chain or the American version of a French restaurant, of which Christopher says,
"You never needed a menu one would have Chateaubriand, which was not really French,
and maybe some snails. Basically, every French menu looked the same." However, since
then, the bustling Phoenix economy has brought to life a more discerning palate in its
citizens. The passion that began all those years ago has turned into a remarkable,
award-winning career. Over the last 20 years, his accomplishments have created a
worldwide reputation and earned him the respect of his peers, both nationally and
internationally.  Today, Christopher and his wife, Paola, can be found at the
restaurants, making sure that a unique dining experience continues to await each
guest and taking care of the myriad of problems that occur daily. We caught up
with them one morning.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What led you to leave Phoenix for Los Angeles?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The hotel went into Chapter 11, and the whole team went to
Los Angeles. One of the chefs said to me, "If you want to continue in this field, you
should go to Los Angeles." So I went to LA and worked for a few big hotels and small
restaurant, and I ended up at the Century Plaza Hotel. After a year and half, the chef
advised that to further my knowledge I should go to London. He had a connection over
there, and I worked in a small French restaurant for about a year. I then basically
took the Michelin Guide to restaurants in France, and sent out 100 letters to all of
the one-, two-, and three- star restaurants in Paris and waited for responses.
I received a few responses and accepted an opportunity to work at Chez Albert,
a two-star restaurant. I made friends with one of the cooks who went to Lucas Carton.
I was basically an observer there. His father owned a pastry shop in Normandy, and
I went to work there for six months. Then I returned to Los Angeles to work at
LOrangerie, and stayed there about a year and a half. I then worked for three
months for a friend who is a very talented pastry chef, learning things I felt
I needed to know, returning to Phoenix shortly thereafter.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> When and where did you meet your wife?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> I met Paola almost four years ago here at the restaurant.
She was working for a consulting company that was based out of Belgium. Paola would
spend half of her time in the U.S. and half in Europe traveling.  Whenever she was
in town for a month at a time, she would go out to eat every night and continued to
frequent this restaurant more and more.  Over a period of time, we got to know each
other well and were married three years ago.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> When did you smoke your first cigar?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> This is a tough one. My first serious cigar was probably
12 years ago at Le Relais in north Scottsdale. We used to have a few customers who
were cigar smokers come in and they would always have a Monte Cristo or Cohiba and
would leave one for me. I discovered that I enjoyed them more and more, especially
at the end of the night with nice glass of port!</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What are your favorite cigars?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> A Churchill or that size cigar.  I like Avos or Ashtons,
but is anyone leaves a Cohiba or a Monte Cristo for me, I will very happily smoke
it.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> You now have your cigar bar upstairs from the restaurant.
How did that come about?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> My partner Guy Coscas and I were always looking for extra
space in the building to do private parties. We wanted to have room to hold special
or private parties that would not cause disruption to our regular restaurant guests.
The building was very generous in offering to build this private space, with the
ideal of including a lounge where people could conduct business in private. Of course,
we were all interested in cigars and didnt have a specific place for cigar smokers,
so it basically all came together.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do you see the trend in cigars growing?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> I think it will continue to get more and more popular.
People seem to equate cigars to wine. It takes almost as much time to create a great
cigar as it does to create a fine bottle of wine.,  The curing of the tobacco and
craftsmanship all have their own characteristics and different flavors. The wine
trend shows people getting introduced to the many different varieties of wines,
not just the typical Chardonnay or Cabernet. They are enjoying other wonderful
types like Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and many others.
The same is true with cigars.  You dont want to smoke just one kind of cigar.
Different occasions call for different varieties.  I would smoke one type of cigar
in the afternoon, then I would enjoy another at the end of the night with a nice
glass of Port.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What does a membership in Christophers cigar club
entitle you to?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> It entitles you to come up anytime for lunch and to enjoy the
lounge.  There is also a small media center with a television and VCR if you need to
conduct business.  Members are permitted to purchase wine at reasonable prices
(probably less expensive then anywhere else in town) and store it in their lockers.
If you reserve the room for a dinner for perhaps 20 to 30 people, the savings alone
in the cost of wine come close to paying for the membership.  Each member leases a
humidor that holds 25 cigars and they can come up at anytime and enjoy a good smoke.
Membership also provides the waiving of room charges for parties held in the private
dining room.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> You stated that you tried your first cigar 12 years ago - how
did that come about?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> We were doing a promotion with Davidoff and Baron de Rothschild.
Davidoff was introducing their cigar line, and Zinos and Rothschild were introducing their
wine Mouton Cadet.  One of the general managers for Davidoff was giving a presentation
on how to light a smoke a cigar.  One of the things I most remember was him saying,
"You know Christopher," with a very intense look, "a cigar is like a woman, if you dont
give her attention, shell go out!"</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> I see you smoke Cubans. How do you compare them to other
brands of cigars?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> I think they are little heartier and more robust in flavor.
If you get a really good one, the aroma and flavor are wonderful.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> I understand that your wife, Paola, smokes cigars?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> My wife is obsessed with everything she gets involved in.
She will not get involved unless she knows a lot about it,  Paola has a natural
talent, a  great palate and nose, which has tremendous impact on her ability to
analyze and taste wines.  She felt that she could not buy or sell cigars unless
she knew everything about them.  She studied the subject thoroughly, but did not
leave it at that.  She talked to her friends that smoked cigars, and then ultimately
bought a variety of cigars and literally sat down and smoked them.  Paola analyzed
the aromas and flavors, and then documented all the information so that our staff could
sell them properly.  She has created a document that we put in every cigar box that we
sell that not only gives prices, but describes each cigar as well, allowing our servers
to provide our guests with the information to choose the cigar most suited to them.
</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Paola, we understand that you smoke cigars. Do you recall having
your first cigar?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> I think it was when we first decided to open the cigar room
upstairs.  It was a bit intimidating.  Never having smoked a cigar, I thought it was
the same as smoking a cigarette.  People often smoke cigarettes when theyre stressed.
And then I discovered that smoking a cigar is pensive, something you think about and
take your time.  You devote 20 minutes to it and it is very relaxing.  I began smoking
cigars a lot and it was fun.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Is this how you started with wines?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No, wines I had a passion for right away.  What I could not
understand was the wide variation in pricing.  What helped me the most was
experimenting and tasting the wine.  I just loved it.  And it wasnt simply
drinking the wine, but understanding how it could compliment food, how they
ultimately go hand in hand.  Now I see that the meal is not over when you finish eating.
A great Cigar and a fabulous after dinner drink are the perfect end to a perfect meal.
</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do you like Cognacs?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> More Ports and Madeiras.  I enjoy my cigar best with a Madeira.
Madeiras have a little higher acidity and are a little more refreshing. I believe that
cigars tend to dry your palate and that you need to have drinks made from grapes that
refresh you palate.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> How about you Chris?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> I love the smell of Cognac, but I cant drink it.
I get a tremendous headache from it.  Port is far more refreshing; it has more character.
It also has a better finish.  I does not have the intense alcohol in the palette that
Cognac does.  Madeira has many characteristics similar to a cigars in flavor.
</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> You opened A.C.G. (Arizona Caf and Grill) with your partner
Guy Coscas about a year ago wasnt it?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Yes and on any given night you might see Guy Coscas smoking
a cigar on the patio there, but not inside.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> How does A.C.G. differ from Christophers?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> It is more American-style, almost a cowboy western steak house.
The restaurant is more family-oriented and offers great steaks, pizzas and a great view
of the city lights.</P>

<P><B>A. (Paola)</B>  We focus on beer there.  Of course we have wine, but
we are trying to concentrate on offering as many different beers as possible.
</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is on the horizon for you two in the next couple of
years? How do you see your business and your lives evolving?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> I would think we will continue to grow and expand the business
and persevere in providing our guests with the classic, innovative artistry and cuisine
that has always epitomized Christophers.  Weve been thinking about expanding the cigar
smoking and doing something on the patio when the weather is nicer. We have more of an
outside meeting-type atmosphere on our patio now that it is covered.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Christopher and Paola Gross</H3>

<P><B>Christopher Gross began his culinary career at the early age of 14
in Phoenix, Arizona and has since perfected his skills throughout Europe
and the United States. Christopher has been associated with such fine restaurants
as <I>Chez Albert</I>, Paris; <I>L'Orangerie</I> and <I>Century Plaza Hotel</I>,
Los Angeles; and <I>La Champagne</I> and <I>Le Relais</I>, Scottsdale,
Arizona.</B></P>

<P><B>In 1988, Christopher was one of 12 chefs in America, and the only
chef from Arizona, to compete in the <I>1988 Bocuse d'Or</I> Competition
in Chicago. Christopher's accomplishments have created a worldwide reputation
and have garnered for him the respect of his peers nationally and internationally.
In July, 1989, Christopher was named one of America's 10 Best New Chefs
by Food and Wine Magazine. These annual awards are designed to recognize
the very best talent of America's new generation of chefs. The search for
the 1989 winners began one year prior with a roster of over 400 nominees
proposed by the Food and Wine editors, as well as 149 restaurant critics,
food writers and chefs nationwide who were polled by the magazine. Christopher
was featured in the August 1989 issue of Food and Wine which was dedicated
to the awards.</B></P>

<P><B>In January 1990, Christopher opened his most noteworthy venture to
date. &quot;<I>Christopher's</I> and <I>Christopher's Bistro</I>&quot;
located in the prestigious Biltmore area of Phoenix opened to rave reviews.
A unique dining experience awaits each and every guest. Guests at <I>Christopher's</I>

which epitomizes Christopher's style. Christopher's art is evident in the
<I>Bistro</I> as well. The finest and freshest ingredients, deceptively
simple preparations and exquisite presentations are Christopher's trademarks.
</B></P>

<P><B>Christopher founded the Arizona Chapter of the American Institute
of Wine and Food, and served as chairman of the Julia Child and Mondavi
organization.</B></P>

<P><B>The prestigious James Beard Foundation has honored Christopher repeatedly.
As the guest chef for numerous Beard functions beginning in 1989, Christopher's
culinary productions have been heralded as &quot;<I>planned, perfectly
executed and wildly imaginative</I>&quot;. Twice nominated as Best Chef
of the Southwest for the James Beard Awards, Christopher hosted a spectacular
dinner at the restaurant to benefit the Beard Foundation at which all previous
records for proceeds raised were shattered. Additionally, he is a member
of the Beard Foundation's National Advisory Board. </B></P>

<P><B>During the early summer of 1994, Christopher filmed a show for the
award winning series, <I>In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs</I>, featuring
world - renowned cooking authority Julia Child. Julia and Christopher prepared
several of Chef Christopher's favorite recipes, which will also be featured
in the new bestseller In <I>Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs</I>. Christopher
is currently featured weekly on the number - one rated morning show of
the Phoenix area's leading independent station Good Morning Arizona and
Christopher's wife, Paola, writes for Andre Gayot's TASTES.</B> </P>

<P><B>The culinary arts, charitable organizations of all designations have
been the recipients of Christopher's dedication. Appearing as a guest chef
at multitudes of functions locally and throughout the country, Christopher's
gastronomic efforts have benefited the March of Dimes, Red Cross Flood
Relief, Share our Strength, the Arizona Liver Alliance, the Phoenix Art
Museum, the Hospice of Cincinnati, Hurricane Relief Fund, Heartland Flood
Relief. </B></P>

<P><B>In December 1994, Christopher with partner Guy Coscas opened a fabulous
new restaurant. Christopher designed a relaxed family-oriented menu featuring
Western comfort foods at moderate prices. <I>Arizona Cafe &amp; Grill</I>,
locally known as ACG, was an immediate hit with Phoenix natives and Valley
visitors alike and is currently Phoenix's favorite watering hole.</B></P>

<P><B>In 1995, Christopher was honored for his consistent culinary excellence
as he was named the 1995 <I>Perrier Jou&euml;t Best Chef of the Southwest</I>
at the James Beard Awards. This coveted honor places Christopher among
the culinary elite in America. Also in 1995 Christopher's was inducted
into the Nation's Restaurant News Fine Dining Hall of Fame. With this induction
Christopher's joins a group of industry counterparts selected for this
unique distinction. </B></P>

<P><B>In June of 1993, Christopher married <A HREF="http://www.christophers.com/paola.html">Paola
Embry</A>. Paola's talent, commitment to excellence &amp; education have

<H1>CHOCOLATE CIGAR WITH<BR>
VANILLA ARMAGNAC ICE CREAM</H1>

<H2><IMG SRC="circ.gif" HEIGHT=34 WIDTH=40 ALIGN=TEXTTOP>INGREDIENTS</H2>

<UL>
<LI><B>5 <FONT SIZE=-1>1/2</FONT> ounces dark chocolate</B></LI>

<LI><B>3 tbsp butter, unsalted</B></LI>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE=-1>1/4 </FONT>cup whipping cream</B></LI>

<LI><B>10 egg whites, whipped stiff</B></LI>

<LI><B>4 tbsp superfine sugar</B></LI>

<LI><B>1 large sheet parchment paper</B></LI>

<LI><B>2 ounces dark chocolate, melted</B></LI>

<LI><B>5 ounces white chocolate, melted</B></LI>
</UL>

<H2><IMG SRC="circ.gif" HEIGHT=34 WIDTH=40 ALIGN=TEXTTOP>PREPARATION</H2>

<P><B>Place 5 <FONT SIZE=-1>1/2</FONT> ounces of the dark chocolate and
3 tablespoons butter in a medium bowl and place on top of the stove in
a water bath. The water should just simmer. While the chocolate and butter
are melting, stir with a wooden spoon occasionally to mix. This should
take about 5 minutes. At the same time with a hand held mixer or whip,
in a medium bowl beat the heavy cream until stiff. Set aside. To finish
the mousse, fold the chocolate and egg whites together, then fold the cream
with a spatula.</B></P>

<P><B>You will need one large sheet of parchment paper, tape and a pastry
bag. Cut parchment paper in strips approximently 8&quot; x 6&quot;. (This
size will enable you to &quot;double wrap&quot; the sides for strength.)
Roll out strips into a tube approximently on inch in diameter and tape.
Stand them up and fill with the chocolate mousse using the pastry bag.
(They stand nicely in a coffee tin.) They are to be placed in the freezer
until frozen.</B></P>

<P><B>Melt dark and milk chocolate and mix together (but not too much,
just enough to get a wood grain effect or in this case tints or shades
of color in the tobacco leaf.) Spread thinly on a sheet of plastic approximently
4&quot; x 6&quot; as the length and diameter of the chocolate mousse. Then
unwrap frozen mousse and wrap plastic around the mousse and place in the
refrigerator for approximently 2 minutes until the chocolate hardens. Then
you may unwrap and let defrost in the refrigerator so that the mousse softens.
</B></P>

<P><B>To make the cigar band, cut a stencil in the shape of a cigar band
to match the circumference of the cigar. Give yourself a little extra length
so when you cook the cigarette paste and wrap around a wooden or plastic
dowel. </B></P>

<LI><B>&frac12;Tbsp Vanilla Extract</B></LI>

<LI><B>3 ounces Illycaffe Espresso Beans </B></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>For the espresso sauce, with a hand held mixer, cream the yolks and
sugar in a medium bowl. At the same time bring the half &amp; half with
the vanilla bean to a simmer in a medium sauce pot. When the half &amp;
half is hot, temper the egg yolk and sugar mixture by adding &frac14; cup
hot half &amp; half. Stir well. Pour the egg and sugar mixture into the
rest of the half &amp; half with the espresso beans and cook gently over
a low heat stirring constantly. When the sauce is thick enough to coat
the back of the spoon, strain and let cool. </B></P>

<P>It's hard to believe, but the Chilean wine craze that has hit North America
and England in the recent years hasn't hit Chile.</P>

<P>Traditionally, Chilean wines have been at their best when young and
hearty and the fruit is fresh and delicious. That applies, it seems, for
just about everyone but Chilean restaurateurs. On each and every visit,
I am surprised to look at various restaurant's wine lists that inevitably
feature the same old vintages of tired, fruitless reds and oxidized whites.
I always inquire of the server which are the most recent vintages; it is
those wines I enjoy most because of their vigorous fruit.</P>

<P>On my most recent visit to Chile, I had occasion to conduce a series
of wine service classes for one of the most modern and luxurious hotels
in the country. I was amazed to find improper storage and handling of the
wines. So, even in the best of circumstances, these wines are not given
the full and proper attention in their native land. The good news is that
things are changing fast, with quality players such as Concha y Toro, Santa
Rita and Cousino-Macul, producing small lots of premium wine. These new
wines are emerging from the so-called &quot;$10 good value&quot; range
and entering competition with contemporaries form California and France.
One of the most exciting developments with regard to Chilean winemaking
in recent years has been the influx of capital investment from such French
winemaking superstars as Lafite, Bruno Prats from Cos d'Estournel and Chateau
Margaux.</P>

<P>Here are some contenders stepping into the ring that should have the
longevity and age-ability to maintain their place and not easily fall out
the market for some time to come. (Tasting notes derived from my recent
visit to Chile.)</P>

<P><B>1992 Cousino-Macul, Finis Terrae, Maipo Valley</B><BR>
This is a blend of 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot. Deep intense purple
hue, medium to full body. On the nose complex: layers of black fruit, aggressive
tannins but round, good acidity and length. Delicious ! $24.</P>

<P><B>1992 Concha y Toro, Cabernet Sauvignon, Maipo, Don Melchor Private Reserve</B><BR>
This wine offers great depth, complexity and elegance. Round firm
tannins with great concentration of ripe fruit. This wine is mouth watering.
$15. </P>

<P><B>1992 Santa Rita Cabernet Sauvignon, Medalla Real, Maipo Valley</B><BR>
Brilliant intense currant fruit on the palate. Medium body with some
herbal nuances, this is a luscious wine. $14.</P>

<P><B>1994 Domaine Paul Bruno Cabernet Sauvignon</B><BR>
The owner of Cos d'Estournel, Bruno Prats and Paul Pontalier, winemaker
of Chateau Margaux, have produced a wine that is supple and elegant with
great vibrant fruit of cassis and plums with a long, smooth finish. $15.</P>

<P>Chile's winemaking is improving every vintage and investments in the
vineyards are paying off. Only time will tell, but the phenomenal growth
of the country in every aspect show nothing but great promise.</P>

<h1> Long Range Science Rover Task</h1>
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/threeviews.jpg"></A>
<p>

<h4> Beyond the 1997 
<a href = "http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/rover/sojourner.html">
Microrover
Flight Experiment</a> on the <a href = "http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/">
Pathfinder Mission to Mars </a>, NASA/JPL intend to continue to use
small robotic rovers for planetary surface exploration.  This task is
designed to expand the current science enabling capabilities of these
microrovers, while increasing their range of operation.
This work includes exploration of 
<a href="factsheet/homepage.html">new or improved methods</a> of mobility,
manipulation, sensing, computation, and control.  The research is
divided into three categories:

<ul>
<li> <a href="technology/homepage.html">Rover Technology</a>:
     new <i>Rocky 7</i> rover design, construction and testing; sensing,
     perception, and control for navigation and manipulation.
<li> <a href="science/homepage.html">Science Data Acquisition</a>:
     integration and operation of real science instruments;
     autonomous sequencing for nominal and contingency operations;
     data reduction.
<li> <a href="operator/homepage.html">Operator Interfacing</a>:
     graphical programming of rover operations;
     fused display of collected science data; WWW access.
</ul>

For experimentation, we have created the 
<a href="marsyard/homepage.html">Mars Yard</a>
outdoor test area for this task and several components of the Pathfinder mission.
In addition, we will be conducting 
<a href="http://wundow.wustl.edu/rocky7/">field trials</a> in the Mojave desert at
<a href="laviclake/homepage.html">Lavic Lake</a>, 
in collaboration with scientists from Washington University and elsewhere.

The Rover Science Data Acquistion effort is integrating three science
instrument on the Rocky 7 rover for experimentation with rover-based
in-situ analysis.  These instruments are:<br>

<ul> 

<li><B>
<a href="../technology/spectrometer/homepage.html">Point Spectrometer</a></B> 
- Commerically available visible/very
near-IR (450-850nm) point reflectance spectrometer.  This instrument
is incorported into the the manipulator arm on the Rocky 7 rover as
shown above enabling it to be pointed at rock/soil targets and
includes an integrated calibration target for reference data.  In this
wavelength region different weathering materials can be clearly
identify by their spectra as shown in the figure above.<P>

<li><B>Mast Stereo Imager</B> - A mast and mast mounted imaging system
are being developed to enable the rover to gather panoramic stereo
images from a vantage point of more than 1 meter above the ground.
The imaging system will include two monochrome microvideo cameras and
and filter wheel for broad band red/green/blue imaging enaling
generation of false color images.<P>

<li><B>Close-up Imager</B> - A monochrome microvideo camera will be
used in the development of a close-up imaging instrument for placement
agianst targets to gather close-up imagery with ~50um/pixel
resolution.  The instrument will include an active illumination source
as well as contact sensors to confirm successful emplacement against
target.  This instrument will be mounted on mast and reply on mast
degrees of freedom for placement against targets.

<H1>JPL MarsYard</H1>

<H4> Simulated Mars landscape developed by JPL Robotics and Mars
Exploration Technology Program for testing and evaluation of rovers
and robotics technology for future Mars surface exploration.  </H4>

<HR>
<H2> Overview </H2>

An important part of rover and robotic development is testing of
prototype systems in relevant environments.  Outdoor evaluation is
particularly important as it provides natural lighting conditions and
large test areas.  In the past, rover testing has been done in the
Arryo Seco East of JPL but this was less than ideal as the terrian was
not representative of Mars and excessive time was spent in setting up
and breaking down the equipment each day.  Development of a large
outdoor test area within the bounds of JPL therefore made perfect
sense.  <P> 

<HR> 
<H2> 
Construction </H2> <IMG SRC="images/marsyard-3.gif">
<p>

The MarsYard is located at the corners of Explorer and Surveyor roads
near the center of JPL grounds.  This approximatly 5000 sqft area
(~80' * ~60') was formally power substation C but has been empty for a
number of years.  An exsiting fence around the area enables the area
to be secured and its central location provides good visiblity of our
work to other JPLers.  <P>

Decomposed granite (dg) fines (sand) was selected as ground cover as
its spectral qualities are similar to those expected on Mars.  (This
is the same material used by scientists at the University of Arizona
Mars Garden.)  200 tons of dg were used to provide approximatly 8" of
cover over the entire area.  A hill or sand dune was developed in the
middle of the area to add variety (as well as to cover an existing
concrete pier).  20 tons of volcanic rocks of different types (color,
texture, density) were brought in th populate the area.  The rocks
were placed by hand by robotic researchers during lunch hours,
evenings, and weekends.  <P>

A concrete retaining wall along the West, North, and East sides
provided the perfect opportunity for a mural depiciting Mars.  Long
Beach California artist Joseph Giri was commissioned to do the
painting. The view is based on Viking Lander 1 (VL1) and Viking Lander
2 (VL2) imagery showing a rocky plain extending off to the horizon.
<P>

<HR>
<H2> Rock Distribution </H2>
<IMG SRC="images/rockdist.gif">

<p>
One of the most important features of the MarsYard is the distribution
of rocks based on actual Viking lander data.  The Moorse's model, a
probablistic rock density for a given rock size based on VL1 and VL2
imagery, was used to generate the rock distribution map above.  This
map was then used to lay out nearly 20 tons of volcanic rock in the
MarsYard to recreate areas like the very rocky VL2 (shown in red), VL1
(shown in yellow), and Mars nominal (theortical average Mars rock
density shown in green).  Having good models of the rock distribustion
is critical for testing rovers of all sizes to ensure they are able to
effectivly meneauver and carry out scientific exploration.  <P> 

<HR>

<H2> MarsYard Events </H2>

<UL> 
<LI>
<a href="images/MYlocalnews.jpg"> Life on Mars TV Broadcasts</a> (8/7/96) - 
Seven local television stations performed live
broadcasts to talk about the NASA announcement of fossilized life

<LI>JPL Open House '95 and '96- The first major event for the MarsYard
was its grand opening during the JPL Open House on July 22nd and 23rd,
1995.  A repitition of this event occurred in summer 1996 as well.
Approximatety 30,000 people came to visit JPL and see many displays
including the MarsYard with several prototype rovers.<P>

Two feild trips have been made to the northern portion of Lavic lake
in November and December of 1996.  While the first served largely
as a logistics exercise, the second contained several days of experiments
conducted 
<a href="http://wundow.wustl.edu/rocky7/">
in conjunction with a team of planetary scientists</a>.
Among the results were: 
<ul>
<li> Multiple 100-200 meter traverses using sun sensing for heading maintenance.

For tests in May 1997, we are considering a test site on the southern side
of Lavic lake, near the junction of the lakebed, a lava flow, and an alluvial fan.
These tests will extend the performance demonstrated in December in 
several ways:
<ul>
<li> Placement of a
  <a href="http://www.scimedia.com/chem-ed/spec/material/mossbaue.htm">
  Mossbauer Spectrometer</a>
  by the mast. (This science
  instrument will be provided by G. Kligelhofer, Institut fur Kernphysik, Germany.)
<li> One kilometer traversal by the rover.
<li> Use of integrated GPS for rover position measurement
     (not used for navigation purposes).
</ul>
These tests will be open to the press.

<h2>GEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION</h2>

From <b>Geolology Underfoot in Southern California</b>, R. Sharp and A. Glazner,
Mountain Press Publishing Company, Missoula Montana, 1993:

<blockquote>
Relatively young volcanoes dot the triangular region of the Mojave 
Desert between Barstow, Baker, and Twentynine Palms. Amboy and Pisgah
craters are among the youngest of those youthful volcanoes.  Both
have small craters in their summits, but mainly they are excellent
examples of cinder cones.  Cinder cones are small basaltic volcanoes
that spit songy fragments of basalt lava up to an inch or two in diameter....
Geologists call such material tephra, a term Aristotle used that is
based on the Greek word for ashes.  Tephra refers to any fragmented material
(ash, cinder, or even automobile-sized blocks) that a volcano blows
into the air.<p>

Cinder cones typically appear, erupt tephra for a few weeks or years,
produce lava flows, then stop.   Few ever erupt again.  In most cases,
the next eruption will build a new cinder cone.  The larger tephra blown 
from a cinder cone piles up around the vent to build the volcano; the small
material drifts downwind as a cloud of ash.  Although a strong wind may
shape them, most cinder codes are symmetrical.  After the column of 
magma has blown off most of its gases the tephra eruption ceases, and 
the volcano ends its career by producing a lava flow, perhaps two or three.
Th flows typically burst out of the base of the cone because the pile of loose 
tephra is too weak to support an internal column of magma.  In many cases,
a segment of the cone floats away on a lava flow.<br>

...<p>

Amboy an Pisgah craters stand amid large fields of basalt lava.  Although
the tephra eruptions undoubtedly made good fireworks displays, they were
neither dangerous nor violent -- by volcanic standards.  Basalt flows 
tupically erupt very quietly and predictably.  Contrast that to rhyolite 
eruptions, such as the Bishop tuff from the Long Valley caldera...,
which may devastate a region the size of an average state, and possibly
change the climate worldwide for years.<p>

Most of the basalt flows erupted from Amboy and Pisgay craters have a 
``pahoehoe'' surface.  Pahoehoe, a Hawaiian term, refers to surfaces
that are relatively smooth and locally covered with distinctive ropy
coils.  The ropy texture forms when molten lava beneath rumples a
thin outer skin of hardening rock, much like the surface texture of 
fudge that cools as it is poured into a pan.  Some of the flows have 
``aa'' surfaces, another Hawaiian term.  Aa surfaces are rough, clinkery,
and jagged; they tear your boots.<br>

...<p>

How old are Amboy and Pisgah craters?  No one knows for sure, except
that they are among the youngest volcanoes in Southern California.
They are too young to date by the potassium-argon technique, which can
be used on basalt erupted as recently as about 100,000 years ago.
They may be young enough to date by the carbon-14 technique, which
can be used for samples as old as about 50,000 years.  But geologists
normally use volcanically charred wood for radiocarbon (carbon-14)
dating, and so far no one has found any around either cone.  
Neither volcano shows much evidence of erosion, but that is typical
of cinder cones; the loose tephra absorbs water so well that surface
runoff rarely gullies the surface. Lavas from Amboy Crater are interbedded
at a depth of about 30 feet with lake sediment in Bristol playa ...
that are about 100,000 years old.  So these volcanoes could be 
as much as 100,000 years old, perhaps much younger.<p>

<BODY>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Long-Range Science Rover (LRSR) Task<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Introduction/Rationale:</B>
<P>
This task develops technologies that enable 15 Kg class microrovers
to autonomously traverse many kilometers on a planetary surface
and perform scientist directed experiments and return relevant
data back to Earth. Present microrover technology has several
limitations that preclude more ambitious science rich missions.
Current microrovers have very limited range (10s of meters), are
not capable of sample acquisition and manipulation (i.e., soil
and rock acquisition, subsurface access, pointing and burial of
instruments), have limited science packages onboard, are designed
for short term missions (10 days), require careful and repetitive
ground monitoring and control (limited autonomy). <BR>

<P>
There is great interest in the science community to explore Mars
by landing near interesting geographic areas and moving to pre-selected
targets helping to offset landing errors. It is desirable to place
instruments against outcrops or loose rocks, search an area for
a sample of interest, and possibly collect rocks and soil samples
for return to Earth. Long traverse will provide an opportunity
to make observations and measurements along the way providing
access to a wide variety of rocks from different areas.<BR>

<P>
This task will develop a small prototype rover that will carry
several science instruments. It is envisioned that the mass of
the flight rover will be 7-8 Kg and that of the science payload
5-6 Kg. The challenge will be to increase the science payload
to rover mass ratio and at the same time achieve long-range and
autonomous science experiment goals. This rover will have the
capability to perform macro and micro imaging, visual and near-infrared
spectroscopy, instrument pointing, sample acquisition, and manipulation.
The rover will also carry several yet to be defined science instruments.
This task will emphasize scientist involved field testing and
long traverses so that relevant onboard and ground based automation
tools for realistic surface exploration of Mars are developed.
Ames Research Center is collaborating in this task by providing
virtual reality displays and ground-based science data analysis
and visualization.<BR>

<P>
This task will increase the traverse range of microrovers by 100
times in FY 97, 500 times by FY 98, and 1000 times by FY 99. The
science instrumentation will be increased by a factor of 3 and
4 in FY 96 and 97, respectively. A major contribution of this
task is the development of autonomous science experiments with
and without a lander. Such autonomous operations will increase
the science return per uplink command by a factor of 2-3 in FY
97 and 4-5 in FY 98.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Focus and Direction:<BR>
</B>
<P>
This technology development program combines both research and
actual system demonstrations to advance the existing autonomous
vehicle technologies for future Mars missions. While the primary
focus is research, the planned system demonstrations and scientist
directed field tests provide a means of testing the robustness
of the technology components within a viable mission scenario/environment.
The task will have three distinct components: Rover System; Science
System; and Ground System. In addition to the integrated level-I
milestones described in the following each subsystem will have
its separate level 2 milestones. <BR>

<P>
<B>Major milestones:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>FY 1996 (Lander-Based)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Demonstration of a science rover capable of sampling and science
instrument pointing. This demonstration will include:
<UL>
<LI>Integration of at least three science instruments to the rover
(work with planetary scientists to integrate representative science
instruments to the rover). Tight integration of these instruments
to the rover computing/power infrastructure is desirable and will
be pursued)
<LI>On-board science-based autonomy (develop a command language
which enables science experiment related commands to be sent to
the rover instead of a sequence of low-level commands)
<LI>On-board monitoring and confirmation for each science activity
(develop vision and other sensor-based confirmation of test results,
such as confirmation of successful soil sampling, laser-based
verification of spectrometer pointing)
<LI>Navigation capability for long-range traverse via the integration
of a Sun sensor
<LI>Command sequencing and Web-based science target designation
(utilize state-of-the-art software such as Java)
<LI>Terrain map building and use of virtual reality technology
to visualize terrain and science data
<LI>Autonomous position localization from the lander via image
differencing (this plus a Sun sensor will provide rover position
and orientation without the need for previously used color cylinder.
Reduces mass and provides flight compatibility with a solar panel)
<LI>Rover localization via landmarks (extend goal confirmation
so that the rover can determine its position relative to a number
of designated rocks by the operator. This capability is an enabling
technology for long-range rovers for performing site surveys without
a need to use a lander for localization) 
</UL>

<P>
<B>FY 1997 (Rover-Based)<BR>
</B>
<P>

controlled remotely from JPL. <BR>

<UL>
<LI>Scenario will consist of traversing in the indicated direction
and periodically (e.g., every 100 to 200 m) transmitting panoramic
images to the ground station. The ground station will provide
new commands to either continue in the same direction or to change
direction. If the site is of interest to scientists, site survey
commands will be issues.
<LI>Develop panoramic maps (with feature segmentation) and utilize
virtual reality to show a continues motion picture of the traversed
terrain.
<LI>Verify commands automatically for consistency with flight
rules
<LI>Stop at interesting locations (as determined by scientists)
and perform site surveys based on scientist designated targets.
Perform at least two science operations without a need for a separate
lander in these sites (via rover position estimation using landmarks)

avoidance and science instrument pointing/emplacement. Perform
experiments to compare the performance of these techniques.

(prior to long-traverse) and confirm that the operation has been
successful. 
<LI>Investigate use of beacons to update rover position relative
to the lander (possibly use GPS to emulate a beacon system). Perform
experiments to show performance of the rover returning to the
lander from 100-300 m traverses. <BR>

<H2>Ranger Dexterous Arm Control </H2>

The goal of this task is to augment the operational capabilities of the
dexterous arms in the Ranger Flight Experiment.  These new capabilities will
be developed within the framework of Configuration Control, which has been
developed at JPL and selected for implementation on the Ranger arms.
The FY'95 focus was to develop and implement collision detection and
avoidance capabilities for the Ranger arms, and to transfer the software
to the Ranger project.  The FY'96 focus is to develop, simulate and transfer
the automated base placement capability for the Ranger, and to conduct 
experiments to validate the collision detection/avoidance and base
placement capabilities.

<H2> Ranger Automated Visual Inspection </H2>

Automated robotic inspection of space platforms such as Space Station is
expected to be an important element to offload time consuming inspection
activities from astronauts.  Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently developed
such a remote surface inspection (RSI) system demonstrated successfully
on the ground in a constrained lab environment. The system, however, needs 
further evaluations/enhancements to be robust for practical use in space 
applications. The objectives of this task are to 1) evaluate and enhance 
the existing JPL automated surface inspection technology to be robust 
under varying ambient sunlighting and also under varying image 
mis-registrations and 2) apply this technology to the Ranger TFX mission 
Phase 3 Visual Inspection Task to assess/validate the telerobotic 
automated inspection capability in real space operation lighting 
conditions. The inspection taskboards will be three-dimensional with 
different surface textures, and will be used for both ground-based 
pre-flight and actual Ranger flight tests. The level 1 milestone for FY'96 
is to deliver an inspection taskboard, inspection scenario, and inspection
task software to University of Maryland Ranger Program for Neutral 
Buoyance tests.
<P>

<IMG SRC="ri.gif">

<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Completed task plan and workforce staffing.

<LI> Coordinated with the University of Maryland Ranger Program Team to 
define on-board camera/lighting requirements.  At present, we will assume 
that only on/off controllable continuous lighting will be available for 
the actual Ranger flight, which will achieve reduced evaluation/validation 
goals relative to the flight inspection test equipped with electronic 
shuttering/strobe lighting.  University of Maryland may later opt to 
add electronic shuttering/strobe lighting, which is more desirable for
the automated inspection demonstration.

<LI> Coordinated with the Ranger Team to investigate a possibility of using 
on-board image processing hardware/software. We decided not to pursue 
on-board image processing options due to the cost/risk involved.

<LI> Coordinated with the Ranger Team to clarify the currently planned 
ground operation option. The current plan we both agreed upon is 
near real-time remote-site ground operation at JPL.  The "near real-time" 
operation is different from "off-line" operation. Namely, we are not just 
collecting data in the actual Ranger flight for later analysis, but we will 
actually demonstrate a near real-time on-line image inspection (flaw 
detection) capability during the actual Ranger flight (at some lighting 
conditions only). Of course, further careful analysis for the flight data 
collected for all different lighting conditions will be performed in 
post-flight operations. We may later consider a possibility of 
near-real-time on-site ground operation at University of Maryland.

</UL>


<H3> B. Plans for the Next Reporting Period </H3>

<UL> 

<LI> Continue defining on-board and ground-site requirements.

<H2> Calibrated Synthetic Viewing </H2>

The camera viewing problem is a major concern in ISS (International Space
Station) payload alignment/mating operations, since the end-effector camera 
is occluded by the ORU during the ORU insertion, while the overhead and ISS 
cameras provide limited views. The Calibrated Synthetic Viewing (CSV) is 
needed to enable successful ORU insertion despite the inadequate video 
coverage. By contrast, the current baseline use of the onboard AVF 
(Artificial Vision System) has limitations in terms of viewing constraints 
and availability of AVF vision targets for small payloads. 
<P>

New technical contributions include 1) enhance existing edge-based 
semi-automatic VR (virtual reality) calibration, 2) develop a new 
local fine alignment algorithm to compensate for model inaccuracy, and 
3) demonstrate a reliable, high-precision alignment for the ISS RPCM-like 
ORU insertion (1/4 inch clearance) under limited/occluded camera viewing 
conditions, with quantitative analysis/experiments of alignment accuracy 
in comparison with vision-target based technique. The level 1 milestone 
for FY'96 is to deliver the calibrated synthetic viewing (CSV) software 
developed at JPL to the JSC ARMSS (Automated Robotic Maintenance for 
Space Station) testbed for technology assessment and demonstration 
to the Space Station Program.

<H2>Lightweight and Survivable Rover </H2>

<P>
This task develops rover architectures and technologies that
significantly extend planetary surface science options of the Mars
Exploration Program. Specifically, we address the challenge of
developing a 5-to-7 kilogram class rover capable of  diverse terrain
traverses (VL1/2), self-navigable sorties of  multiple kilometers, and
extended operation for months in both equatorial and polar latitudes.
We introduce approaches to volume-and-mass efficient mobility, based
on innovative concepts in wheel design, miniature actuation, chassis
structure, thermal control, sampling mechanization, and
computation-efficient 3-D terrain sensing. These ongoing developments
address Mars Surveyor '01 mission constraints as currently known, and
offer scaleable technology/component solutions for the MSP missions at
large. We conduct this R&D in cooperation with the Mars Exploration
Technology Program, leveraging their developments of new high-capacity
thermal materials, low-temperature batteries, and miniature science
instrumentation. FY96 Level 1 task activities will demonstrate a new
wheeled mobility concept consistent with VL1/VL2 traverse and stowage
of the wheels proper to 1/3 their operational volume. 
<P>



<IMG SRC="lsr.gif"> 

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Developed a new mobility concept and chassis implementation
approaches for novel rover architectures based in collapsible
lenticular strut wheels. The wheels will potentially stow to 30%
deployed volume and are consistent in design with both conventional
four wheel (box) and six-wheel (rocker-bogie) chassis geometry. By way
of scaling reference to prior JPL rover designs:  based on rough cut
mass budget estimates (MFEX reference computing/sensor hardware), this
new mobility design would in rocker-bogie configuration equate to a
vehicle having  8x MFEX rover volume, 2.5x ground clearance, 4x hazard
avoidance threshold  -- from the same stowed rover volume at 70% MFEX
mass. <BR>

<LI>Defined and began hardware development of a new hybrid
point-laser/stereo pushbroom sensor. By comparison to current MFEX
flight design, this new approach potentially affords 100-200x
signal/noise improvement for terrain mapping, thereby finessing the
problem of time-and-power consuming redundant difference imaging to
assure reasonable receiver operating curve characteristics.
Concomitant with reduced power and computational requirements of  a
point versus stripe mapping of terrain, the new sensor will enable the
rover to map its near field and egress continuously at rates up to 6
cm/sec (x15 MFEX stop-and-wait performance) <BR>

<LI>Began design of a novel lightweight, volumetrically compact hybrid
Phase Change Material (PCM) /aerogel warm electronics box (WEB)
structure which will be implemented without jeff-bar pass-through<BR>

<LI>Developed a set of progressive FY96-99 science scenarios and
underlying concepts for quantification of evolving
navigation/terrainability  performance as a parametric function of
rover geometry and sensors. Work this year addresses the problem of
continuous motion traverse (~10m at up to 3cm/sec) to a dead-reckoned
and autonomously localized (by on-board sensing) science target in
VL1/VL2 simulated terrain - using the new mobility design in 4-wheel
configuration. FY97, which graduates to longer range traverse (1-2 km)
with a 6-wheel rover, characterizes sun-sensor based corrective
guidance in geo-transects of a dead-reckoned course, and will provide
a reference model configuration appropriate to known Mars Surveyor '01
science objectives<BR>

<H2> Long-Range Science Rover </H2>
<p>

This task develops technologies that enable 20 Kg class microrovers
to autonomously traverse many kilometers on the surface of Mars
and perform scientist directed experiments and return relevant
data back to Earth. Present microrover technology has several
limitations that preclude more ambitious science rich missions.
Current microrovers have very limited traverse (10s of meters),
are not capable of sample acquisition and manipulation (i.e.,
soil and rock acquisition, subsurface access, burial of instruments),
have limited science packages onboard, are designed for short
term missions (10 days), and require careful and repetitive ground
monitoring and control (limited autonomy) 
<P>
There is great interest in the science community to explore Mars
by landing near interesting geographic areas and moving to pre-selected
targets to offset landing errors. It is desirable to place instruments
against outcrops or loose rocks, possibly collect rocks for return
to Earth, and search an area for sample of interest. Also, long
traverse will provide an opportunity to make observations and
measurements along traverses and to access a wide variety of rocks
from different regions of Mars.

<H3>A. Significant Activities and Events During This Period</H3>
<P>
Level 1 milestone completed:
<P>
Rocky 7 rover integration was completed which consisted of an
advanced VME based computing environment (VxWorks operating system
and ControlShell C++ programming tool), an on-board stereo vision
system, a light weight sampling arm with a two-DOF pointing capability
and a two-DOF scoop mechanism, a near IR spectrometer (integrated
to the manipulator arm). 
<P>
The demonstration consisted of an operator developing a science
experiment scenario using lander images and specifying goal points
and experiments to be performed at those goal points. The experiments
consisted of a spectrometer pointing (in at least two goal points),
performing goal confirmation (at least in one goal location),
scooping soil in a designated area, and dumping of the sample
in another specified location. A single uplink command from the
operator control station was sent to the rover. The rover then
used its local collision avoidance capability (using on-board
stereo vision) to traverse to the specified goals. Goal points
are assumed reached when the rover estimates that it is within
20 cm from the goal point. The tests were conducted outdoors at
the JPL Mars Yard. During these tests the rover traversed more
than 200 meters. Rover communicated to the lander via a wireless
modem.
<P>
Goal Confirmation consisted of the on-board vision system searching
a location for a rock with certain dimensions. Positive confirmation
would indicate that the rover had reached its specified goal point.
Soil sampling was accomplished by deploying the manipulator arm,
opening its scoops, and then pressing on the surface to determine
ground height. After scooping some soil and stowing the arm Rocky
7 traveled to the specified location for dumping the sample. The
point spectrometer operation consisted of deploying the arm, then
deploying a special calibration target to obtain images in the
ambient light. Imaging was done after the calibration target was
retracted. A software tool then analyzed the spectrometer data
and positive identification of rock material was demonstrated.

<H2>Nanorover Technology Development</H2>

The objective of this task is to develop a very small but
scientifically capable rover system which can easily fit within the
projected mass reserves of future landed missions on Mars and other
planetary surfaces.  These reserves are currently (e.g. Mars Surveyor)
about 1kg and new smaller missions (e.g. New Millenium) may have mass
reserves as small as 100g.  By fitting within the mass reserves, and
by having a very simple interface to the lander, the nanorover can fly
as a secondary payload or as a late addition to the mission.
<p>

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>

<LI> Developed breadboard 25 gram 2-wheeled (tail dragger) mobility
chassis and tested different wheel diameters to assess mobility of
very small rovers in sand.  Concluded that wheel diameters much less
than 5 cm cause dramatic reduction in mobility for this mass regime.
Concluded that small tracked vehicles (as originally proposed) will
entrain material and have low mobility and power efficiency compared
to wheeled vehicles.  As expected, ground pressures should be much
less than 1psi for good performance.  Selected 4 wheel, all-wheel
drive, skid-steered 1-dof-articulated mobility chassis as the best
trade-off of complexity, mass, and performance.
<p>

<LI> After literature review and discussions with Planetary
Scientists, we selected for the science complement an Active Pixel
Sensor (APS) 256x256 silicon microscopic imaging detector with filter
wheel and a near-IR point spectrometer.  These are selected as
low-mass, high science return instruments which can give tremendous
mineralogical data sets and which can be incorporated at moderate cost
and without radioisotopes.  The APS, developed in the JPL Microdevices
Laboratory, offers approximately 100-fold reduction in power
requirement over CCD based imaging, which is crucial for a vehicle
with a 1/2 watt power budget.  It will be equipped with a variable
focus lens which allows imaging from about 2 cm to infinity, with
about 7 microns per pixel microscopic imaging at closest approach.  A
crucial Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) component of the
system will be nanoactuated optical elements in the spectrometer which
will maintain proper focus despite the expected 100K temperature
gradients and excursions.  The science requirements of the IR
spectrometer (better than 20 nm of resolution over a range which
includes important bands at 1.4 and 2.3 microns) sets the vehicle scale
at about 10 cm and the surface area of the top (solar panel), thereby
determining the power budget to be about 1/2 watt for more than 4 hours
per day for Mars equatorial missions.
<p>

<LI> Reviewed alternative electronics architectures and
low-temperature packaging technology, and selected the rad-hard 80C51
microcontroller on a kevlar printed circuit board for the electronics.
The kevlar circuit board has adequate structural and thermal
properties to be the frame of the rover and to form the optical bench
of the spectrometer (given the nanoactuation described above).
Additional support chips will include A/D converter and Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA).  The initial focus of this activity is to use
commercial parts and package them in a way consistent with operation
under Mars ambient surface conditions.

<H2> Exploration of Small Bodies </H2>
<p>

Future exploration of interplanetary small bodies, such as comets
and asteroids, requires technology development in a variety of
areas.  Landing and operation in the microgravity environment
of small bodies is an extremely challenging problem.  The Exploration
of Small Bodies task will focus on developing the enabling technologies
to accomplish <I>in-situ </I>scientific studies of these interplanetary
objects.  The primary objectives of this task are to develop the
mechanisms to perform landing, anchoring, surface/subsurface sampling
and sample manipulation for a complement of science instruments.
 Five key new technologies will be developed:
<DL>
<DT> Compact Drill Mechanism
<DD>To develop a drill capable of
depths up to a meter, with a total mass of 2 kg and minimal power
usage.  A Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism (SATM) must
be integrated to the Drill within this mass limit.

<DT> SATM
<DD>To develop sampling mechanisms that will not contaminate,
mix nor heat a subsurface sample obtained from a known depth.

<DT> Drill and SATM control algorithms
<DD>These mechanisms must
be operated autonomously, compensating for the unknown material
and incorporating fault tolerant controls.  A key goal is also
to obtain scientific information regarding the substrate sampled,
such as hardness and density, by the use of the embedded control
sensors within the Drill.

<DT> Landing and Anchoring
<DD> The act of landing and staying at
a test site in a microgravity environment is grouped as a &quot;single&quot;
new technology since the methods to absorb impact, accommodate
terrain, compensate for horizontal velocity and anchor are all
interrelated.

<DT> Simulant Test Bed
<DD> The surface substrate must be simulated
to assure the above technologies are relevant.  The task of simulating
a cometary material is very challenging, and near term focus is
on that goal.  Adequate cryogenic simulants as well as ambient
analogs will be developed.<BR>
</DL>

<P>
The Exploration of Small Bodies effort is reported by dividing
it into three task areas:  Drilling and Sampling, Landing and
Anchoring, and Facility Modifications.<BR>
<BR>

<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period </H3>

<U>Summary:<BR>
</U>
<UL>
<LI>Task fully staffed.  Lag in personnel availability during
first quarter planned.

<LI>Test lab moved to new facility.  Workstation acquired and
facility modifications in process.  (Move unplanned; net costs
OK since planned workstation at no cost.)

<LI>Coordination with Champollion organized.  Task corroborates
with pre-project &quot;Tiger Team&quot; for landing configurations,
then fabs and tests concepts.  Members from each team attend each
other's weekly staff meetings for efficient focus of tasks.

<LI>Bounding limit requirements for landing baselined (max
velocities, g-forces, etc).

<LI>New Technology Report for Compact Drill Mechanism submitted
to JPL patents organization.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
<U>Landing and Anchoring<BR>
</U>
<P>
A significant activity performed during this reporting period
was the coordination of this task with the Champollion pre-project
organization.  To maintain relevance to this flight program, intimate
coordination is ongoing with the recently formed Champollion &quot;Tiger
Team&quot;.  Landing and anchoring concepts in a cometary environment
are being developed in corroboration with this Tiger Team.  Champollion
resources that will enhance this task in accomplishing its goals
include weekly meetings with staff scientists, experts in navigation,
guidance and control, and the Lander System designers.  This task
will continue on to fabricate and test the one (or possibly two)
most promising landing concepts.  Current models of the topography
of comets results in an extremely challenging problem for landing,
in that the surface may have little &quot;holding strength&quot;
for anchoring up to depths of 3 meters.  The terrain may exhibit
high reliefs and scarps, or may consist of a thin crust over very
large voids.  The latest anchoring concepts that may be developed
consist of mechanisms to provide deep anchorings up to a meter
or more in depth.  An &quot;extendible piling&quot; versus &quot;harpoon
and winch&quot; configurations are currently in design trades.
<P>
The requirements for a representative comet Lander have been determined.
 Efforts in the navigation, guidance and control disciplines have
determined that the Lander must at a minimum have two axis attitude
control.  Targeting will be performed from the mother spacecraft,
and then the Lander will be navigated by &quot;point-and-shoot&quot;.
 Bounding limits of the landing phase will be  6 m/s vertical
and 2 m/s horizontal velocity vectors to a mean surface normal.
 Vertical and horizontal deceleration loads shall be limited to
14 Gs in each vector, to be compatible with a 30 G RMS limit load
negotiated by Champollion with the science payload.  For the purposes
of limiting the design space, the Lander attitude (along the velocity
vector) at the point of contact with the surface is assumed to
be bounded by plus or minus 45 degrees to surface normal.  This
value combines the velocity vector-to-surface components with
the surface topography component.<BR>

<P>
<U>Facility Modifications/Simulant Test Bed<BR>
</U>
<P>
The laboratory move was unplanned in the original Proposal.  This
move was  required because of the change of cognizance for the
task in the JPL organization.  (The original development of the
Compact Drill Mechanism was performed under the Robotic Scientist
Task.)  The lab facilities used for the initial Drill Mechanism
development remains for the Telerobotics Program, while the Exploration
of Small Bodies development testing is being conducted in a new
dedicated facility.  This facility combines the lab space requirements
of the Drill/ Sample Acquisition Mechanisms, Simulation Test Bed
and the Landing and Anchoring development.  The building contains
a high bay for landing simulation testing.  Laboratory upgrades
for this task was previously costed, but the move was unforecasted.
 The cost for the initial move was more than compensated for in
the budget by the unspent planned funds for a Sun workstation,
which was acquired at no cost to the task.
<P>
Development of the comet Simulant Test Bed will be enabled by
the relationship with the Champollion pre-project, with the weekly
access to project scientists and the assurance that the final
product will be relevant.  Simulation of a comet site is considered
a greater challenge than an asteroid site, so in the near term
all focus will be on cometary materials development.  Adequate
simulation and selection of  analogs suitable for room temperature
testing is on-going.  A materials engineering expert is currently
staffed full time to perform this sub-task.<BR>

<P>
<U>Drill and Sampling Mechanisms</U>
<P>
A New Technology Report was submitted to JPL patents organization
for the Compact Drill Mechanism.  Determination of the minimum
thrust forces that will adequately penetrate the upper bound of
the cometary model are being determined analytically, and testing
next quarter will confirm.  This upper bound is modeled as a density
of 2 g/cm3 and a compression strength of 100 MPa.  Selection of
the motors and gearheads for the &quot;next generation&quot; Drill
is currently being researched.  Reducing the power requirements
towards the 10 watt value desired by Champollion will be investigated,
but some testing and analysis suggests the minimum achievable
may be 30 watts.<BR>

<H2>Micro Lander Dexterous Manipulators </H2>

<P>
This task develops new robotic architectures and technologies for planetary
surface science, consistent with mission objectives and constraints of the NASA
Mars Exploration Program. Resulting robots - as integrated with Mars lander or
rover science platforms - will be used to dexterously view, probe, acquire, and
containerize samples for in situ analysis and potential return to earth. Task
technology thrusts include design of scalable, ultra-light arms and actively
powered effectors, the development of new composite robot components and
material forming processes, and the innovation of miniature, high-torque
density solid state motors applicable to wide ranging Mars climates. The scope
of  task R&D is ground laboratory concept demonstrations and the evaluation of
selected new components in realistic Mars environmental conditions. FY96 Level
1 task activities develop and demonstrate a new, all-composite manipulator
under dexterous task space control for representative sampling operations. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="mldm.gif"> 

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Developed a concept design for an all-composite (links and joints) two
meter manipulator having potential to reduce mass 30-40% from the FY95 baseline
3-d.o.f. arm hybrid composite-link/metal-joint architecture. The new arm design
is scalable, and will also be used in related development of  a small
rover-mounted dexterous micro-arm.
<BR>

<LI>Supporting the above, defined a new approach for fabrication and structural
forming of novel high strength composite robotic components based in 3-D air
lay-up carbon fiber and polycyanate post-impregnation. By comparison to
composite components formed in more conventional 2-D materials and resins,
resulting designs are expected to have several-fold greater tensile and
torsional strength/mass, as will be critical to highly loaded composite joint
structures. 
<BR>

<LI>Working with QMI, Inc. (TCA partner), produced the first of a new JPL
segmented-and-reversed stack rotary ultrasonic motor design that potentially
allows higher torque density, lower drive voltages and reduced cost of
fabrication. In related developments, the MIT collaboration (N. Hagood et al.)
produced a new motor eliminating much of the vibration and efficiency loss
observed in their first FY95-end prototype due to poor control of normal axis
tolerancing (which degrades critical rotor-stator interface contact
properties).
<BR>

<LI>With Dr. Eric Baumgartner (Michigan Tech NASA-ASEE visiting faculty
fellow), demonstrated a novel means of arm positioning to a designated sampling
point -- accurate to ~ 5 mm at two meter arm extent. In this machine
vision-based iterative visual guidance technique, all computations are referred
to the camera planes of two wide field stereo CCD imagers -- no prior explicit
calibration of the cameras is required nor is a detailed kinematic model of the
arm needed (thus making the approach of considerable interest in environments
where such modeling is either prohibitive or subject to unpredictable change
due to environmental influences.). This work is summarized by E. Baumgartner
and P. Schenker in a forthcoming IEEE ICRA'96 paper. 
<BR>

<LI>Per report to the September TRIWG meeting, we proposed a derived flight
design of the FY95 Code X concept arm (3-d.o.f. hybrid composite/metal serial
manipulator with DC motors) within an externally-led UCLA Mars Surveyor '98 AO
science response -- the Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor (PI, David A.
Paige). We were informed at end-October that the proposal was selected, and
work on flight arm development is now underway by a separate project team with
whom we maintain close working contact.  

</UL>

<H3>B. Plans for the Next Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Develop a detailed mechanical design for the new all composite lander arm
<BR>

<LI>Begin experiments in 3-D composite/polycycanate component fabrication, and
define a testing approach for comparative analysis with respect to 2-D
composite/epoxy structures (environmental concerns potentially include both
thermal shock and UV exposure tolerance) 
<BR>

<LI>Begin environmental testing of available solid state motor (SSM) samples
for characterization of failure modes in temperature and vacuum atmospheric
conditions
<BR>

<LI>Continue related modeling and computer-aided design of SSM material and
structural  parameter optimization, emphasizing the stator-rotor interface
<BR>

<H2> Vision and Touch Guided Grasping (MIT) </H2>
<p>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
This project conducts fundamental research and demonstrations in
the mutually complementary areas of real-time vision and touch
sensing, robust grasping mechanisms, and computer-based grasp
control. It enables autonomous and semi-autonomous grasping tasks
in space of human-fabricated objects (e.g. tools) and natural
objects (e.g. loose rocks) covering a wide range of object size
and geometry. The project will conduct experimental demonstration
of how to acquire and grasp stationary spherical objects and
cylindrical objects using coordinated robotic vision and control
algorithms. It will conduct experimental evaluation of how to use
touch and force feedback to improve the grasping operations. It
will analyze sensitivity of robotic grasp system performance to
object size and geometric features. Investigation of end-effector
design to support these activities will be conducted. The
research will be targeted to planned and on-going missions
utilizing earth-orbiting and planetary surface robotics such as
the remote scientist project. The task is being performed at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and supports the research
of Dr. J. Kenneth Salisbury, Prof. Jean-Jacques E. Slotine,
graduate students, and research staff.  <P>

<H3>What was done this period</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Started developing methods for stabilizing motion of
compliant objects including adaptation to unknown parameters.<P>

<LI>Started developing methods to permit stable control of
yanking of grasped  objects and simple digging actions including
adaptation to unknown parameters.

<UL> The digging issue brought to light the limitations of the
current color-keyed vision system which we are using.  We receive
only center of area and orientation information from the vision
boards.  There is little way of knowing, without some prior
knowledge of the object, where to dig.  The solution of using
touch sensing to build up a topographical map of the object and
surrounding area was explored, but it was found that the sensing
capabilities of the talon were unsufficient for this task in its
current incarnation.  We are currently exploring a new sensor
design which should eliminate this problem. 
</UL><P>

<LI>Set up laboratory mock-up of a planetary surface site
including multiple,  randomly placed rock samples.  
<UL>

Built a "mars-scape" using heavy gravel in a frame with caster wheels to roll
into the workspace.  Considering cleaner injection molding
pellets like the type used in the mock up at JPL.
</UL><P>

<LI>Developed new search algorithms which allowed for cataloging
of multiple objects in the workspace. 

<UL>
Two approaches were taken.  The one currently in use was to
program a simple search at the finite state machine level which
scans the workspace until it sees an object, servos to that
object, records all relevant data, and then continues the search
from where it left off.  Multiple occurrences of the same object
are trivially eliminated using location information.  If two
objects are reported as being within a few centimeters of
each other they are assumed to be the same object.  The second
approach which is currently being developed for future use is
explained <A HREF =
"http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/wam/doc/newsearch_page/feg_newsearch.html">here</A>.
</UL><P>

<LI>Initiated experimental evaluation and demonstration of rock
selection,  quick/slow/shake grasp, and retrieval strategies. 

<UL>
Through experimentation it has been found that various retrieval
strategies are necessary.  Among these strategies are the
following:<p>

1. Simple quick "touch sensitive" grasping.  This involves moving
the end effector to the coordinates given by the vision system
with the hand completely open, and then doing a series of steps
involving closing each finger individually until it hits
something, and then moving up a little.  This method is most
useful for objects sitting on the surface, and is the fastest and
most straight forward of the grasps.<p>

2. Slower "touch sensitive" grasping.  It was found that for
objects with non-optimal geometries for grasping, (i.e. not
having a circular cross-section), it was necessary to slow down
and incorporate a higher number of smaller increments in the
grasp.  <p>

3. For objects partially buried in gravel, adding a simple
shaking motion to the grasp increased the success rate by at
least 75%.  This involved adding a simple linear shaking motion
to the talon in the plane of the object.  The shaking allowed the
fingers to work themselves into the gravel around the object, and
was found to  be preferable to digging given the current lack of
sensory information, and the ease of implementation.<p>

4. Experimentation in digging has brought to light several
issues.  First of all, a more robust end effector was needed than
what we currently had.  Some new talon parts were designed and
fabricated to satisfy this need.  The actual finger design will
have to be modified as well to provide a wide enough surface with
which to dig.  The current fingers are thin aluminum, which has
made the digging action produce rake-type results.  We are
considering a simple "snap-on" attachment which would make the
talon more scoop-like.  Another issue is the need for extended
inverse kinematics, while this is currently more of a detail than
an issue, it would be nice to create a second kinematic mode in
which the endpoint of the last link was set to the finger tips
rather that the middle of the talon so that we could more easily
control the digging motion.  Another issue is the need for real
force control on the talon.  It has been found that without
accurate contact force information, it is very difficult to
determine the nature of the interaction with the ground, and
therefore almost impossible to create a robust system capable of
handling various environments, and most specifically variations
in soil height and density.  The last issue is the need for
better visual information.  Due to the fact that the current
vision system only outputs location, orientation, and approximate
area, determining where to dig is a matter of guess work at this
point, i.e. we try digging 10cm to the left and to the right of
the object.<p>
</UL><P>

<LI>Further analyzed and improved the consistency of the grasping
algorithm. 
<UL>
We have found that while we are able to achieve 100% success for
grasping objects within the workspace, it often takes several
attempts at a grasp before success.  In considering energy
consideration, it would be desirable to minimize the number of
attempts.  To do this we have established various measures on
which to base the graspability of the object.  These include: <p>

1. Location: the center of the workspace being preferable to the
edges, etc.<p>

2. Size: There is a certain optimal size for grasping based on
our hardware, this being objects with a 4cm radius.  Twice that
is too large, and half that is too little.  This information is
not directly available with the current vision system, only rough
estimates based on pixel count are possible at this point.<p>

3. Orientation:  The orientation of the object with respect to
the forearm of the wam when grasping is important due to the fact
that the talon only has three degrees of freedom rather than the
four it would need to grasp at any arbitrary orientation.  Having
the object perpendicular to the forearm is optimal, and parallel
is least optimal.<p> Using these three measures, and associated
uncertainty values, it is possible to create a graspablility
index which is a composite of all three values, and will
approximate the chances of a successful grasp.  We are currently
investigating different models which will be used to provide this
estimate of the possibility of a successful grasp for each
object.  Again, the main limitation here is the vision system.

</UL><P>

<LI>Explored fish-eye vision option. 
<UL>

Experimented with different fish-eye cameras. After some work by the
vision board developer, the system showed reasonable results, but as
of yet has not been implemented as we are exploring the possibilities
of other vision systems.
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>Concerns</H3>
<OL>

<LI>A more flexible vision system may have to be incorporated for
digging and first-try grasping.

<LI>Better contact/touch sensors need to be incorporated into the system.

</OL>
Both of these concerns are being budgeted for in the FY96 contract.

1.  We are working with two versions of the arm.  The first bench 
mounted prototype has continued as our workhorse for developing 
control algorithms, and for testing new wiring schemes.  The second 
version is fully completed mechanically, but awaits new wiring and 
electronics. <P>
     
We have built a high level control system to control the first arm, 
concentrating on reaching. Some biologically inspired "movement 
primitives" have been used to allow the control of all 6 dof with 
simple algorithms. A hierarchical controller is being developed that 
will move the arm around, while at the same time protecting the joints 
from excess torque, responding naturally to collisions, and reacting 
appropriately to touch sensor information at the end effector. The 
early work has also involved some learning of the arm characteristics. 
It is envisaged that this system will provide a robust and stable base 
on which more complicated digging/hammering tasks can be built. <P>
     
In order to fully integrate the second version of the arm onboard the 
tracked vision-based rover we have been developing new, smaller, and 
more robust motor controller boards.  We have completed the new 
schematic design for these boards while completely maintaining 
software compatibility, halving their size, and increasing their 
electrical robustness. <P>
     
     
2.  We have significantly extended the programs running on the second 
generation vision system on our tracked robot. We now have three 
parallel vision operators running, and a very robust navigation 
system based on that visual input.  We have tested the system 
extensively, mainly in our indoor planetary surface testbed,
but also some outdoor testing.  We have completed an
initial analysis of the performance of the vision system. <P>

<LI> We will lay out the new control boards, fabricate them and will 
start the installation of the second arm in the rover.  We will 
continue to develop control algorithms on the first arm and 
demonstrate some visually guided manipulation.
     
<LI> We will carry out more outdoor testing of the vision and 
navigation system.  We will run first test on our new third 
generation low power vision system.
     
<LI> We will begin a new task; the design and fabrication of a 10 gram 
micro-rover.  During these three months we will investigate
sources of parts for a demonstration system, investigate thermal 
and electrical constraints, and produce an initial design, with 
performance estimates.

<H2> MicroTelerobotics & Medical Applications </H2>

This task is a cooperative NASA-Industry effort to develop a telerobot for
breakthrough micro-and-minimally invasive surgeries. The resulting Robot
Assisted
Microsurgery (RAMS) workstation, via computer enhanced controls, will enable
new procedures beyond human manual dexterity, and allow a broader group of
practitioners to successfully deliver needed healthcare services at reduced cost.
Surgical applications include the eye, ear, nose, throat, face, hand, spine, and
brain. NASA-JPL's role is to design, fabricate, test, and document an
engineering R&D prototype -- a six degrees-of-freedom, position and force
scaling master-slave telemanipulator -- capable of relative positioning of 20
microns over a 10-to-20 cm*3 continuous volume (e.g., the eye).  The industry
partner, MicroDexterity Systems, Inc., working through independent funding,
defines medical requirements, collaborates in system engineering design,
develops and tests a pre-commercial clinical prototype, and with end market
support certifies and commercializes a final design. <P>

JPL successfully demonstrated a robot slave engineering
prototype in FY 1994, and in FY 1995, a master arm capable of simulating a
force feedback environment and manually controlling task space position of the
slave. In FY 1996, JPL will add the capability of force-reflection to the
master arm from a sensor on the slave arm, enable the handling of surgical
instruments and demonstrate a realistic microsurgical procedure using the
telerobotic system. Further growth master-slave system capabilities include
textural
feedback at the master, and <i>in situ</i> imaging at the robot slave.
Beyond its medical significance, this new MicroTelerobotic system has potential
dual-use in ground-to-orbit and thermal-vacuum applications that include
EVA/IVA telescience and telemedicine, safe bio-and-materials processing,
micro-mechanical assembly, small-instrument servicing, and terrestrial
environmental testing. <P>

<H2>Ranger Dexterous Arm Control </H2>

The goal of this task is to augment the operational capabilities of the
dexterous arms in the Ranger Flight Experiment.  These new capabilities will
be developed within the framework of Configuration Control, which has been
developed at JPL and selected for implementation on the Ranger arms.
The FY'95 focus was to develop and implement collision detection and
avoidance capabilities for the Ranger arms, and to transfer the software
to the Ranger project.  The FY'96 focus is to develop, simulate and transfer
the automated base placement capability for the Ranger, and to conduct 
experiments to validate the collision detection/avoidance and base
placement capabilities.

<H2> Ranger Automated Visual Inspection </H2>

Automated robotic inspection of space platforms such as Space Station is
expected to be an important element to offload time consuming inspection
activities from astronauts.  Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently developed
such a remote surface inspection (RSI) system demonstrated successfully
on the ground in a constrained lab environment. The objective of this task 
is to apply this technology to the Ranger TFX mission Phase 3 Visual 
Inspection Task to assess/validate the telerobotic automated inspection 
capability in real space operation lighting conditions. To achieve this
evaluation objective, we will perform pre-flight, on-orbit actual flight, 
and post-flight experiments. The degree of success of the task depends 
upon how well the pre-flight baseline experiment and its predictions agree 
with real flight experiments, using performance metrics such as flaw size and 
flaw contrast under various sunlight and mis-registration conditions. 
Post-flight will provide lessons learned. The level 1 milestone for FY'96 
is to deliver an inspection taskboard, inspection scenario, and inspection task
software to University of Maryland Ranger Program for Neutral Buoyancy tests. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="ri.gif">

<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Defined onboard and ground requirements for Ranger flight inspection
in coordination with the University of Maryland Ranger Program Team.
For now, we assume that only on/off controllable continuous lighting is 
available, which will achieve reduced evaluation goals (camera electronic 
shuttering with strobe lighting may be available later). For the Ranger 
flight experiment/demonstration, we will support near-real-time remote-site 
(JPL) ground image inspection (flaw detection), without onboard
image processing hardware due to the cost/risk involved.

<LI> Defined inspection task scenario. It consists of initial calibration
and actual inspection (flaw detection) phases. The initial calibration 
procedure is essential in the Ranger flight inspection task, because 
"unflawed" and "flawed" images need different camera arm locations, requiring 
accurate camera arm positioning to align the "unflawed" and "flawed" images.
The two quadrants of the taskboard will be used for "unflawed" images and 
the other two for "flawed" images, eliminating procedures for attaching and 
detaching flaws during the Ranger flight experiment. One set of the 
unflawed/flawed quadrants will be used for 2-D surface marking tests and 
the other set for 3-D surface structure tests, during the actual inspection 
phases after the initial arm calibration.

<LI> Completed task re-planning to meet with a reduced budget guideline.
The on-going "evaluation of the automated inspection software" work is now 
moved to the newly created RSI Technology Transfer Task. The planned
"enhancements of the automated inspection software" work is now deleted.

<LI> Presented the task overview/status in the Ranger Integrated Design 
Review (IDR) at University of Maryland.

<LI> Design/fabricate taskboard. Two copies of the inspection taskboard will 
be made: one for pre-flight ground test and the other for Ranger Neutral
Buoyancy test. See the description above in "Defined inspection task scenario".

<LI> Develop inspection task software. NDDS will be used for data communication
between University of Maryland and JPL. Satellite up/down link will be used
for transmission of video images. JPL will control video compression
parameters to obtain higher quality image during inspection.

<H2> Calibrated Synthetic Viewing </H2>

The camera viewing problem is a major concern in ISS (International Space
Station) payload alignment/mating operations, since the end-effector camera 
is occluded by the ORU during the ORU insertion, while the overhead and ISS 
cameras provide limited views. The Calibrated Synthetic Viewing (CSV) is 
needed to enable successful ORU insertion despite the inadequate video 
coverage. By contrast, the current baseline use of the onboard AVF 
(Artificial Vision System) has limitations in terms of viewing constraints 
and availability of AVF vision targets for small payloads. 
<P>

New technical contributions include 1) enhance existing edge-based 
semi-automatic VR (virtual reality) calibration, 2) develop a new 
local fine alignment algorithm to compensate for model inaccuracy, and 
3) demonstrate a reliable, high-precision alignment for the ISS RPCM-like 
ORU insertion (1/4 inch clearance) under limited/occluded camera viewing 
conditions, with quantitative analysis/experiments of alignment accuracy 
in comparison with vision-target based technique. The level 1 milestone 
for FY'96 is to deliver the calibrated synthetic viewing (CSV) software 
developed at JPL to the JSC ARMSS (Automated Robotic Maintenance for 
Space Station) testbed for technology assessment and demonstration 
to the Space Station Program.
<P>

<IMG SRC="sv.gif"> 


<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period </H3>

<UL>

<LI> Presented a TRIWG continuing-task proposal for the task. In FY'97, we plan
to demonstrate a complete ORU replacement task (as compared to this year's ORU 
alignment only) using CSV with new technical developments in robust automated 
edge tracking and interactive "task-level" model building for undefined models.

<LI> Presented a two-and-half-hour JPL-internal Task Review for the task.
Reported task status/plan with detailed technical overview.

<LI> Completed intrinsic camera calibration (field of view angle, lens center 
position, etc.) of a computer-controlled zoom camera and a fixed-zoom camera. 

<LI> Implemented an edge-based camera calibration algorithm, and extended 
to utilize known accurate intrinsic camera parameters when available.

<LI> Started implementing a vision target based model matching algorithm.
The vision target based model matching procedure will be essentially the same 
as the edge based one except that it uses black dots, instead of edges,
as features for matching.

</UL>


<H3> B. Plans for the Next Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>

<LI> Complete/test the vision target based model matching technique.

<LI> Enhance existing edge-based semi-automatic VR (virtual reality) 
calibration by implementing a least-squares method that updates camera 
calibration and object localization simultaneously.  This will allow very 
rough, approximate initial camera calibration, increasing operational 
efficiency.

<LI> Develop/implement fine local alignment to achieve high precision
by compensating for model inaccuracy.

<LI> Develop/enhance operator interface for calibrated synthetic viewing

<LI> Plan experiments for comparative performance evaluation of CSV, AVF,
and manual teleoperation.

<H2>Lightweight and Survivable Rover </H2>

<P>
This task develops rover architectures and technologies that significantly
extend planetary surface science options of the Mars Exploration
Program. Specifically, we address the challenge of developing
a 5-to-7 kilogram class rover capable of diverse terrain traverses
(VL1/2), self-navigable sorties of multiple kilometers, and extended
operation for months in both equatorial and polar latitudes. We
introduce approaches to volume-and-mass efficient mobility, based
on innovative concepts in wheel design, miniature actuation, chassis
structure, thermal control, sampling mechanization, and computation-efficient
3-D terrain sensing. These ongoing developments address Mars Surveyor
'01 mission constraints as currently known, and offer scaleable
technology/component solutions for the MSP missions at large.
We conduct this R&amp;D in cooperation with the Mars Exploration
Technology Program, leveraging their developments of new high-capacity
thermal materials, low-temperature batteries, and miniature science
instrumentation. FY96 Level 1 task activities will demonstrate
a new wheeled mobility concept consistent with VL1/VL2 traverse
and stowage of the wheels proper to 1/3 their operational volume.
<P>
<IMG SRC="lsr96.jpg"> <BR>

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Developed a detailed design for the first rover to be built
in this task, &quot;LSR-1&quot; as shown in the CAD graphic above.
This 100 cm long vehicle has 20 cm diameter wheels of 8 cm width,
70 cm track, and 30 cm belly-pan clearance. It will carry both
front and rear science trays; the front tray will eventually host
a light micro-sampling arm from the Micro Lander Dexterous Manipulators
task, and the rear tray will be deployable to ground level thereby
enabling release, emplacement and/or recovery functions. Each
tray is approximately 33 cm wide, 15 cm long, and 12 cm high.
As further discussed below, the LSR-1 primary chassis is an integrated
structure/thermal design affording considerable weight savings.
The overall vehicle design is scaleable, being primarily limited
at the lower end by Warm Electronics Enclosure (WEE) volume, and
at the upper end by launch vehicle mass/volume stowage constraints.
We have capped the FY96 implementation at 7 kg (with science),
per JPL Program Office request (C. Weisbin). The mobility vehicle
proper will weigh 6+ kg, and carry as its first science instrument
for the Level 1 Sept '96 demo an integrated APS imager/near-IR
spectrometer package. LSR with fully collapsible running gear will 
flexibly stow at dimensions comparable to the Mars Pathfinder Rover 
(MFEX) while deploying to approximately 1.8x linear dimensions of 
same. Hence LSR-1 will have a much improved terrainability that 
enables not only VL1, but also VL2 class missions. [We note in passing 
that a number of JPL personnel attended a recent NASA Ames hosted 
Mars Sample Return Science Workshop (cf. MarsSWG/S. Squyres) of 
March 25-27, 1996. The preliminary consensus of the three science 
communities present (climate-life-resources) suggests that areas of 
interest for rover-based sample acquisition and traverse could be 
highly variable and challenging -- ranging from lakebeds, to volcanic 
terrain and highland features]. LSR-1 is estimated, in flight configuration, 
to carry up to 2 kg of science in each of its front and rear trays. Compare
this projected LSR capability to MPF/MFEX planned operations at
11+kg gross vehicle weight, with a 1 kg science APXS payload.
<BR>

<LI>Made significant progress on all aspects of vehicle design:
1) MOBILITY: The new collapsible wheel design was finalized, with
some revisions for torque, as well as tension-compression loading
factors, and started to fabrication. We selected motors and gearheads
(with a credible path to MSP '01 flight from these lab models)
and started procurements of same. We also began preliminary concept
development for the collapsible rocker-bogie assembly (an early
FY97 integration, with the FY96 vehicle to use rigid lightweight
Al spars) and initiated contact with several proprietary vendor
sources for component materials; 2) CHASSIS/THERMAL: A novel approach
to chassis implementation has been developed wherein the WEE thermal
structure interior walls integrate a distributed load bearing
sheet-and-spar mechanical structure capable of carrying all suspended
mass (the WEE proper, overhead solar array, attached science trays
&amp; payloads, etc.). This hybrid aerogel/Phase Change Material
(PCM) WEE thermal design (glass epoxy walls) has been reduced to a 
33x33x14 cm*3 exterior dimensions layout incorporating computing,
batteries, telecommunication components, and interface to the
rocker-bogie running gear pivot. An innovative feature of this
thermal/structural chassis is complete elimination of the conventional
Jeff-bar WEE pass-through and its concomitant 30-40% heat losses;
rather, the rocker will pivot in an external 3-D composite mount;
; 3) COMPUTING: We established a WEE configuration for the MFEX
80c85 board set (&quot;EM brain&quot; as provided by MEP) that
will serve as our FY96 computing baseline. We also began a straightforward
port of existing code to a 80486 development environment, with
the intent of implementing an evolved 32-bit architecture by early
FY97 (utilizing MFEX I/O, modified logic, and processor retrofit
to a smaller form factor - cf. TRIWG LSR FY97 proposal and our
interaction with MPF/MFEX developers to establish this potentially
inexpensive, and early flight-targeted option for '01 MSP higher
performance sensing/navigation/control); 4) NAVIGATION: The primary
bottleneck to navigational speed in MPF/MFEX sensor-based obstacle
detection is the power cycling requirements of the sequentially-scanned
five laser stripers and subsequently repeated stereo CCD sensor
readout (to obtain an ambient light image for background differencing,
given the laser stripes are insufficiently bright for direct detection).
As such, MFEX travels stop-and-wait at an average .3-.4 cm/sec;
if the rover lasers could be fired/sensed in parallel, much higher
rates of egress would potentially be possible. To this end, we
are developing a spot-pushbroom sensing approach (viz. spots are
read-out over only a few, versus hundreds of CCD scan-lines as
projected lateral spot pattern &quot;pushes&quot; forward), initially
based in a five-laser/CCD direct projection configuration (FY96),
with planned growth to a lower power and more highly resolved
multi-spot/APS based implementation (FY97). Potential speed-ups
-- with high optical conversion efficiency and supporting computational
capability -- could approach 20X MFEX average speed, and enable
continuous egresses. Even with the baseline 80c85 computing implementation,
we project improvements to the 1-3 cm/sec range (though not necessarily
continuous traverses). During this period we have developed a
first cut implementation of the direct spot projection system,
algorithms, real-time 80c85 implementation, and begun testing
and optical system characterization. We have also initiated design
of a multi-spot system utilizing high-efficiency diffraction grating
projectors. This optical characterization work has advanced our
understanding relative to earlier MPF/MFEX-related R&amp;D, and
includes our generalization of the mathematical imaging model
for laser beam detectability to include bi-directional reflectance
distribution functions (BDRF) for representative particulate surfaces
(wherein we have drawn on serendipitous photometry literature
from planetary geology that arrive at better substantiated results
than the conventional Lambertian assumption of MPF). Interestingly,
the BDRF-based models predict relatively more light will be reflected
back at the camera than by assumed Lambertian means; this suggests
further reduced power requirements. However, our experimental
studies to date of focus and power transmission through the train
of laser collimating optics show far from optimal performance;
thus, we are investigating further, including use of new optical
components for improved collimation and reduced laser housing
backscatter.<BR>

<LI>Presented the LSR task concepts/plans to a JPL-internal 1/30/96
Peer Review Board drawn from the line, programmatic (TAP/Code
X), and science exploration (SESP/MEP Code S) organizations --
and -- responded to a request from SESP/MEP to assess the achievable
relative science payload as a function of LSR scale (See FY97
TRIWG LSR proposal discussions and tables therein). We also presented
related information to a February 9, 1996, meeting of the MarsSWG
subgroup on Robotic Science at JPL(M. Carr/USGS-ad hoc Chair).
Based on general outcomes of these discussions, the LSR team arrived
at the above described LSR-1 vehicle target design for a FY96
Level 1 demonstration, with the following milestone [NOTE: We
have chosen to implement a six-wheel rocker-bogie configuration
as the first LSR-1 prototype at given 6+ mobility mass target,
believing it offers better terrainability as a function of fixed
stowage (collapsed) volume versus other configurations. We also
examined some four wheel design options, which may be particularly
attractive if the direction of later developments are toward scale/mass
reduction -- which could be quite significant if more of the vehicle
electronics is run at ambient, thus minimizing or altogether eliminating
WEE sizing constraints]:

Current microrovers have very limited traverse (10s of meters),
are not capable of sample acquisition and manipulation (i.e.,
soil and rock acquisition, subsurface access, burial of instruments),
have limited science packages onboard, are designed for short
term missions (10 days), and require careful and repetitive ground
monitoring and control (limited autonomy) 
<P>
There is great interest in the science community to explore Mars
by landing near interesting geographic areas and moving to pre-selected
targets to offset landing errors. It is desirable to place instruments
against outcrops or loose rocks, possibly collect rocks for return
to Earth, and search an area for sample of interest. Also, long
traverse will provide an opportunity to make observations and
measurements along traverses and to access a wide variety of rocks
from different regions of Mars.

<LI>Detailed plans for this task were developed and reported in
an internal JPL task review meeting.  This meeting was Chaired
by Chuck Weisbin and had several senior JPL managers as review
panel members.  Subsequent to the meeting, the panel issued its

any individual with a browser that supports JAVA to design and
upload science target and waypoint information for the rover.
Currently, two images are provided to a user. One image gives
the elevation map generated from a panoramic image.  The center
of this image is the last location of the rover. Wedges represent
an area where stereo correlation information is available. Actual
images for each wedge is displayed in a second window. Waypoint
designation and target selection can be done by using the tool
bar.  Editing of the entered information is possible using standard
cut and paste and dragging operations. If you have JAVA click

<H2> Planetary Aerobot Testbed </H2>
<p>

The primary purpose of the Planetary Aerobot Testbed (PAT) is to develop
the telerobotic technologies necessary to fly autonomous, robotic 
aerovehicles (aerobots) in the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, Titan and the 
Outer Planets. 

An aerobot is capable of one or more of the following activities:
<UL>
<LI>Autonomous State Determination.
<LI>Periodic altitude variations where altitude, amplitude and period 
are design variables.
<LI>Control of altitude and following a designated flight path within
a planetary atmosphere using prevailing planetary winds.
<LI>Landing at a designated surface location.
</UL>

This activity focuses on the development of balloon 
aerovehicle robots for Venus and Mars. In addition to the telerobotic
technologies, PAT will demonstrate new science techniques such 
as imaging from a balloon in FY96. 
<p>

FY96. First reversible fluid balloon altitude control manual operation
demo; first Venus autonomous balloon navigation sensors prototype
flight demos; high resolution balloon imaging demonstration.
<p>

FY97. First reversible fluid balloon autonomous flight demo; first
Mars autonomous balloon navigation sensor prototype flight demos.
<p>

FY98: First reversible fluid balloon autonomous landing demos; complete
first earth balloon global planning model development.
<p>

FY99: First global balloon flight navigation demos; Complete
first Mars/Venus Global Planning Models. 
<p>

<H4> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period. </H4>


There has been considerable progress in the Planetary Aerobot Testbed (PAT) development this last quarter.  Two of the tasks currently supported by the Telerobotics Program are the Venus Sensor and Perception (VESPER) and the Buoyancy Control Subsystem (BCS).

<H4> Buoyancy Control Subsystem (BCS) </H4>

The PAT BCS is a unique mobility system being developed to further the 
exploration of planetary atmospheres and surfaces.  An aerobot BCS will 
allow science packages to be placed in the atmosphere of places such as 
Venus or Titan, and then to be flown at different altitudes, landed at 
specific sites, or guided to different regions in the atmosphere under 
autonomous control.
<p>

The system currently being developed under the Telerobotics Program for 
operation within the Earth's atmosphere consists of a primary balloon 
with Helium lifting gas, a secondary balloon for the reversible fluid, 
and a pressure vessel/heat exchanger system designed to allow control of the 
fluid phase.  The operation subsystem will enable the verification of 
complex dynamic, thermodynamic and aerodynamic models which will eventually 
adapted to Venus and Titan.  Experience gained in the manual operation of 
the BCS in FY96 will enable the autonomous operation and control of PAT in 
FY 97.
<p>

This quarter various subsystem-level configurations have been studied and 
down-selected to two potential configurations, differing in the number of 
valves required.  The components have been initially sized.  The heat 
exchanger material is either a mylar/polyethylene or nylon/polyethylene 
composite film, heat-sealed together to form the heat exchanger 
passage-ways.   Cut-down system components, including a parachute and 
laser-initiated reefing line cutters have been identified.  Various 
light-weight latching valves have been identified and tested.
<p>

The PAT BCS will begin integration and testing mid summer 1996 for a 
September 1996 first launch.  The PAT BCS team at JPL includes Eric 
Slimko, Matt Heun and Jack Jones from Mechanical Engineering, and Andre 
Yavrouian from Thermal and Propulsion Engineering.  
<p>

<H4> Venus Sensor and Perception (VESPER) </H4>

The VESPER subsystem achieved a significant technical
milestone last quarter - the end-to-end integration and demonstration
of an inertial attitude estimator for use in the testbed gondola. This 
is obviously of some significance to the PAT project, but may also be of 
interest to the larger community as is discussed below.
<p>
First, the technical details: 
<p>
  Signals from the inertial sensors (rate gyros) were amplified, conditioned
  and provided as differential inputs by the Venus Sensor & Perception 
  (VESPER) subsystem to the Robotic Controller subsystem's Analog-To-Digital 
  (A2D) converter via an 8x1 multiplexor (MUX).  The Controller, a PC104 bus 
  based 33 MHz 486/387 Intel microprocessor system, controlled the A2D device 
  as well as the MUX selector digital i/o interface using the real-time 
  operating system VxWorks (Version 5.3), and the advanced real-time software 
  framework ControlShell (Version 5.1). The attitude quaternion was 
  graphed in real-time using the Stethoscope tool-kit while the rate-gyro
  fixture was put through various test rotations. 

<center><p><A HREF="pat_inertial_estimator.jpg"><IMG SRC="pat_inertial_estimator.jpg" 
ALT="Aerobot Attitude Estimation"></A></center>



From a project perspective, this milestone provides early validation
of PAT's choice of computing platform, hardware bus, i/o architecture, 
operating system, and software tools. Any technical uncertainty in 
the remaining integration efforts involving the Real-Time Controller 
has been greatly reduced, giving us more confidence in meeting the
objectives of this years program.
<p>

From an institutional perspective, this milestones marks the first 
validation of the PC104/Intel/VxWorks architecture for a robotics 
application at JPL. Hitherto, our experience has been with 
VME/Motorola/VxWorks (e.g. Rocky7, Hazbot, RAMS) configurations which have 
limited, expensive hardware selections for embedded applications where 
small size is important. The PC104 standard and the Intel microprocessor 
represent a small, rugged, and inexpensive computing platform with a wide 
variety of cheap peripheral components. Our other experiences have been 
with custom architectures (e.g. Rocky3, MFEX, STAR) with low-end 
microprocessors and/or simple or no operating systems. The ability to use 
the VxWorks operating system outside of the VME/Motorola architecture 
increases our confidence in providing the benefits of a high-end operating 
system to a number of new demanding applications. At the same time, this 
enables a development approach that preserves our significant investments in 
existing VxWorks software and systems expertise. For those applications 
choosing to leverage the strong re-use features built into ControlShell, 
porting of code modules between applications becomes especially easy, even 
trivial, for all non-device-driver code. 
<p>

This successful effort represents a team effort by J. (Bob) Balaram, Mark 
Long, and Robert Scheid from the Automation and Control, and 
Phil Salomon and David Zhu from the Avionics Equipment.

<H2>Nanorover Technology Development</H2>

The objective of this task is to develop a very small but
scientifically capable rover system which can easily fit within the
projected mass reserves of future landed missions on Mars and other
planetary surfaces.  These reserves are currently (e.g. Mars Surveyor)
about 1kg and new smaller missions (e.g. New Millenium) may have mass
reserves as small as 100g.  By fitting within the mass reserves, and
by having a very simple interface to the lander, the nanorover can fly
as a secondary payload or as a late addition to the mission.

traverses to targets selected in lander imagery (with traverses
accurate to ~10 cm at 3 m).  The off-board electronics will control
the mobility mechanism based on lander commands and also be able to
perform microscopic imagery (<~100 microns/pixel)".  This experiment/
demonstration was performed on 1/24/96 using the breadboard 25 g

<H2>Micro Lander Dexterous Manipulators </H2>

<P>
This task develops new robotic architectures and technologies for planetary surface science, consistent with mission objectives and constraints of the NASA Mars Exploration Program. Resulting robots - as integrated with Mars lander or rover science platforms - will be used to dexterously view, probe, acquire, and containerize samples for in situ analysis and potential return to earth. Task technology thrusts include design of scaleable, ultra-light arms and actively powered effectors, the development of new composite robot components and material forming processes, and the innovation of miniature, high-torque density solid state motors applicable to wide ranging Mars climates. The scope of  task R&D is ground laboratory concept demonstrations and the evaluation of selected new components in realistic Mars environmental conditions. FY96 Level 1 task activities develop and demonstrate a new, all-composite manipulator under dexterous task space control for representative sampling operations.
<P>

<IMG SRC="mldm_arm.gif"> 

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Completed preliminary mechanical design of "MarsArmII," an
all-composite three degrees of  freedom manipulator that is the FY96
Level 1 deliverable from this task. This two-meter long arm will have
2-D composite rigid tubular links, three (roll-pitch-pitch) joints
based in a novel 3-D composite implementation, and be actuated by a
set of  rotary ultrasonic motors. The MarsArmII concept further serves
as reference for a scaled-down "Micro-arm" design, an approximate 60
cm long small manipulator targeted for use as a light, dexterous
rover-borne sampling device (cf. Lightweight and Survivable Rover task
report) <BR>

<LI>Enabling the above designs, we have made significant progress on a
new resin transfer mold 3-D composite, work we are carrying out in
cooperation with B. F. Goodrich, Inc. During this period we fabricated
samples of the first such materials, which are based on an air lay-up
3-D carbon fiber pre-form and epoxy post-impregnation. Results of
initial mechanical tests are very encouraging: The material has
approximately one half the density of aluminum, equivalent breaking
strength, and one-third the modulus. We have found the 3D composite --
unlike 2-D counterparts -- amenable to conventional machining
(milling, cutting, tapping, etc.). In test cases, we successfully
tapped 1/4-20 and #2-56 machine screws. We therefore believe the new
3-D composite process will be a means of making very light, strong
parts for critical load-bearing interfaces such as robot joint
structures, rover wheel assemblies & running gear, etc. <BR>

<LI> There has been good progress on a number of fronts in our
ultrasonic solid state motor (SSM) work: 1) QMI, Inc. (TCA partner)
developed a miniature driver circuit that has prospects for
generalized application to many SSM designs, facilitating use and
reducing expense;  2) modifications were completed to our SATEC
cryo-vac test chamber enabling full range characterization of motor
torque-speed  behavior under realistic conditions (down to 120K and
10mTorr); 3) the MIT/JPL SSM modeling tools were improved by
finite-element-model extensions, versus prior Rayleigh-Ritz averaging,
that now enable accurate prediction of fundamental motor operating
parameters such as stator drive frequency (and a new 3" motor has been
designed, to be used in corroborating model predictions; 4) MIT (N.
Hagood) delivered a revised dual side stator motor design for
evaluation (showing, as noted in last report, significantly improved
rotor-stator interface control, and reduced vibration/noise); 5) four
related JPL New Technology Reports have now been approved for patent
disclosure, and two submitted to the Washington D. C. office. <BR>
  
<LI>We have developed strawman science scenarios for FY96-end
experimentation/ demonstration: 1) autonomous soil science where a
robot arm trenches soil to examine and deposit soil samples to lander
based science instrumentation; 2) small rock science where a robot arm
scans and picks up small, loose surface samples of interest, and 3)
large rock science where a robot arm and attached science tooling
interacts with larger weathered rocks/outcroppings to expose, scan and
extract fresh rock samples. From these operating scenarios we will
select key elements to test the new MarsArmII and associated dexterous
controls procedures. We have iterated with the MSP Mars '98/Mars
Volatiles and Climate Surveyor (PI, David A. Paige) task on some of
these concepts, in part motivated by their recent testing of robotic
arm digging in frozen Mars soils simulants. Based on these discussions
with the flight project, we have factored some design changes into
MarsArmII (e.g., a 33% increase in tip down-force capabilities with
negligible mass impact to overall design).

It has two driven wheels, and two caster wheels.  This gives us the extra dof
needed for grasping since our arm is only 1dof.  
  </UL>
<LI>Arm
  <UL>
  <LI>Currently fabricating a 1dof arm which is kinematically similar to the
JPL Version except that it lacks the first axis of rotation.  This joint was
seen to add unfavorable complexity to the arm, without adding significant
additional capability.  
  </UL>
<LI>Hand
  <UL>
  <LI>Currently fabricating a  2dof hand  which is kinematically similar to the
JPL Version except that it does not have infinite rotation.  This capability is
difficult to achieve on the reduced budget, and again it was seen as
unnecessary for the proposed research.  The hand has been made so that the
fingers can easily be changed in order to be able to do both grasping and
digging experiments.
  <LI>Two sets of fingers have been machined for the hand.  One set consists of
flat plates with force sensors mounted on them.  These are being used to carry
out simple grasping experiments, and to validate predictions of the object
graspability model.  The second set of fingers is a scoop design for digging.
</UL>
<LI>Vision System
<UL>
<LI>Two Supercircuits pcb-mount cameras have been purchased, not yet mounted.
<LI>Due to the budget it was necessary to buy a PCI-based frame grabber.
Currently planning to do the vision processing on the PC.
<LI>The vision software is being developed in an incremental approach.  As a
first step, we have implemented a simple blob detector similar to the system
used with the WAM.  This will provide the object COA so that grasping
experiments can begin.
</UL>


</UL>
<LI>Implement and evaluate sample acquisition techniques with this manipulator
including grasping and digging.
<UL>
<LI>NA
</UL>
<LI>Demonstrate in simulated planetary scenario acquisition of indicated
object, presentation to camera for viewing and delivery to sample container.

<H2> MicroTelerobotics: Robot Assisted MicroSurgery (RAMS) </H2>

This task is a cooperative NASA-Industry effort to develop a
telerobot for breakthrough micro-and-minimally invasive
surgeries. The resulting Robot Assisted Microsurgery (RAMS)
workstation, via computer enhanced controls, will enable new
procedures beyond human manual dexterity, and allow a broader
group of practitioners to successfully deliver needed healthcare
services at reduced cost. Surgical applications include the eye,
ear, nose, throat, face, hand, spine, and brain. NASA-JPL's role
is to design, fabricate, test, and document an engineering R&D
prototype -- a six degrees-of-freedom, position and force scaling
master-slave telemanipulator -- capable of relative positioning
of 20 microns over a 10-to-20 cm*3 continuous volume (e.g., the
eye).  The industry partner, MicroDexterity Systems, Inc.,
working through independent funding, defines medical
requirements, collaborates in system engineering design, develops
and tests a pre-commercial clinical prototype, and with end
market support certifies and commercializes a final design. <P>

JPL successfully demonstrated a robot slave engineering prototype
in FY 1994, and in FY 1995, a master arm capable of simulating a
force feedback environment and manually controlling task space
position of the slave. In FY 1996, JPL will enable the handling
of surgical instruments, demonstrate a realistic microsurgical
procedure using the telerobotic system and build a second
prototype to allow external medical laboratory testing of the
RAMS technology. Further growth master-slave system capabilities
include textural feedback at the master, and <i>in situ</i>
imaging at the robot slave. Beyond its medical significance, this
new MicroTelerobotic system has potential dual-use in
ground-to-orbit and thermal-vacuum applications that include
EVA/IVA telescience and telemedicine, safe bio-and-materials
processing, micro-mechanical assembly, small-instrument
servicing, and terrestrial environmental testing. <P>

<H2>Ranger Dexterous Arm Control </H2>

The goal of this task is to augment the operational capabilities of the
dexterous arms in the Ranger Flight Experiment.  These new capabilities will
be developed within the framework of Configuration Control, which has been
developed at JPL and selected for implementation on the Ranger arms.
The FY'95 focus was to develop and implement collision detection and
avoidance capabilities for the Ranger arms, and to transfer the software
to the Ranger project.  The FY'96 focus is to develop, simulate and transfer
the automated base placement capability for the Ranger, and to conduct 
experiments to validate the collision detection/avoidance and base
placement capabilities.

<H2> Ranger Automated Visual Inspection </H2>

Automated robotic inspection of space platforms such as Space Station is
expected to be an important element to offload time consuming inspection
activities from astronauts.  Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently developed
such a remote surface inspection (RSI) system demonstrated successfully
on the ground in a constrained lab environment. The objective of this task 
is to apply this technology to the Ranger TFX mission Phase 3 Visual 
Inspection Task to assess/validate the telerobotic automated inspection 
capability in real space operation lighting conditions. To achieve this
evaluation objective, we will perform pre-flight, on-orbit actual flight, 
and post-flight experiments. The degree of success of the task depends 
upon how well the pre-flight baseline experiment and its predictions agree 
with real flight experiments, using performance metrics such as flaw size and 
flaw contrast under various sunlight and mis-registration conditions. 
Post-flight will provide lessons learned. The level 1 milestone for FY'96 
is to deliver an inspection taskboard, inspection scenario, and inspection task
software to University of Maryland Ranger Program for Neutral Buoyancy tests. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="ri.gif">

<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Designed/fabricated the inspection taskboard with underwater resistant
     painting for Neutral Buoyancy tests, and delivered to University of 
     Maryland on 7/3.

<UL>
<LI> The left and right sides of the inspection taskboard are mechanically 
     identical with sub-millimeter accuracy --- left side for "unflawed" 
     and right side for "flawed" images.

<LI> The inspection taskboard has three pairs of panels: flat 2-D, concave 
     holes/convex heads, and 3-D structure sections. 

<LI> The right side of the 2-D section (bottom right panel) is silk-screened, 
     which will be used to examine the inspection quality with different sizes 
     and contrasts. 

<LI> The left and right sides of the top and middle panels (holes/heads and 
     3-D structure sections) are currently identical. Flaws, for example, 
     black, grey, or colored tape patches, will be added on the right side 
     prior to inspection tests.
</UL>

<LI> Delivered an initial version of the inspection task software to 
     University of Maryland and conducted an initial integrated test

<UL>
<LI> Integrated the NDDS communication link into the JPL RSI system, and
     JPL (Gene Chalfant) and University of Maryland (Corde Lane) successfully 
     performed an initial integrated test. 

<LI> In the test, the Ranger simulator at UMd was sending the joint angles 
     telemetry data periodically, and the Ranger arm graphics simulation 
     at JPL was being updated accordingly. At the same time, the operator
     at JPL RSI system sent inspection/robot control commands, and we verified
     that the Ranger simulator at UMd received the commands correctly.
</UL>

</UL>


<H3> B. Plans for the Next Reporting Period </H3>

<UL> 

<LI> Plans to have two more integrated tests: one for command sequence GUI and 
     the other for the calibration procedure. The inspection task scenario and 
     corresponding command sequence will be refined through these tests.

<LI> Perform inspection experiments at JPL using the inspection taskboard,
     a duplicate of the one delivered to University of Maryland

<H2> Calibrated Synthetic Viewing </H2>


The camera viewing problem is a major concern in ISS (International Space
Station) payload alignment/mating operations, since the end-effector camera 
is occluded by the ORU during the ORU insertion, while the overhead and ISS 
cameras provide limited views. The Calibrated Synthetic Viewing (CSV) is 
needed to enable successful ORU insertion despite the inadequate video 
coverage. By contrast, the current baseline use of the onboard AVF 
(Artificial Vision System) has limitations in terms of viewing constraints 
and availability of AVF vision targets for small payloads. 
<P>

New technical contributions include 1) enhance existing edge-based 
semi-automatic VR (virtual reality) calibration, 2) develop a new 
local fine alignment algorithm to compensate for model inaccuracy, and 
3) demonstrate a reliable, high-precision alignment for the ISS RPCM-like 
ORU insertion (1/4 inch clearance) under limited/occluded camera viewing 
conditions, with quantitative analysis/experiments of alignment accuracy 
in comparison with vision-target based technique. The level 1 milestone 
for FY'96 is to deliver the calibrated synthetic viewing (CSV) software 
developed at JPL to the JSC ARMSS (Automated Robotic Maintenance for 
Space Station) testbed for technology assessment and demonstration 
to the Space Station Program.
<P>

<IMG SRC="sv.gif"> 


<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events During this Period </H3>

<UL>

<LI> Completed an initial version of CSV, and delivered to JSC on 6/27.
     Key integration elements include:

<UL>
<LI> edge-based camera calibration and object localization using "weighted 
     average" local edge detector, weighted least squares object localization, 
     and robust matching to remove outliers

<LI> simultaneous update of camera calibration and object localization to
     reduce relative camera positioning errors

<LI> camera/model update after camera zoom change

<LI> local fine alignment --- needs further enhancements

<LI> GUI for interactive camera/model initial adjustment and model/image edge 
     selection/deselection

<LI> GUI enhancement using TELEGRIP 3.0 upgrade allowing video image and 
     2D/3D graphics rendering in a window
</UL>

<LI> JSC interface

<UL>
<LI> visited JSC on 5/21 to define the CSV interface at JSC

<LI> Lucien Junkin of JSC/Lockheed-Martin visited JPL on 5/31 to familiarize
     with CSV

<LI> JSC (Ivan Spain) provided an example TelRIP program that can communicate 
     with the JSC ARMSS robot controller, video switch, camera control, and 
     video frame grabber at JSC. Based on this program, JPL/JSC developed 
     a TelRIP gateway program that interfaces between CSV and JSC systems 

<LI> visited JSC on 6/26 and 6/27 for CSV delivery and integrated tests.
     The basic integration tests were successful --- needs further work
     for complete integration.
</UL>

<LI> Implemented a vision target based model matching technique ---  not
     integrated into CSV yet.

</UL>


<H3> B. Plans for the Next Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>

<LI> Support JSC to complete the JSC interface with further enhancements.
     JSC plans to conduct evaluation experiments in mid August. JSC will 
     use similar camera views that were used by an Oceaneering team to test 
     the RPCM-ORU coarse alignment requirement with manual teleoperation.

<LI> JPL plans experiments for comparative performance evaluation of CSV, AVF,
     and manual teleoperation.

<H3> B. Accomplishments </H3>

<DL>

<DT> ELECTRODING TECHNIQUES
<DD> Methods of electroding polymer films were 
considered and it was determined that sputtering techniques should not 
be used due to film damage associated with heat.  The method that we 
found most effective is vapor deposition.  However, in order to assure 
a good adhesion of the electrode to the polymer surface it is 
necessary to apply a series of solvent and ion beam cleaning 
processes.  For low cost and easy to use applications, brushing 
conductive paste was found useful.  Further, in future mass production 
of electrodes ink-printing method will be considered and AMP Corp. 
offered their assistance.  In addition to parallel surface 
electroding, we also using interdigital electrodes as a form of 
lateral displacement actuation.
<P>

<DT> s-PMMA BASELINE
<DD> Difficulties were encountered with the effort to 
reproduce the data reported in the paper by K. Ohara et. al., entitled 
"Electrostriction of Polymethylmethacrylates" that was published in 
Colloid &amp; Polymer Science, Vol. 260, (1982) pp. 164-168.  This data 
indicated that s-PMMA responds to electroactivation with more than 12% 
strain.  The baseline was substitute with PVF2 for which significant 
amount data is available.  
<P>

<DT> ALTERNATIVE EAP ACTUATORS
<DD> A series of commercially available 
materials were selected for a parametric study of the properties that 
are responsible to electrostriction in polymer.  This includes the 
tacticity, dipole moment, and the dielectric constant of the pendant 
group.
<P>
[The basic mechanism of electrostriction in organic polymers is 
presumed to be related to the polymer structure, i.e., a backbone (a 
polymer chain) with pendant groups (elements with a strong dipole 
moment) attached to the backbone.]  
<P>
Film processing techniques were developed for these materials and the 
films were electroded to form actuators.  The actuators were driven by 
an electric field and the displacement was observed.  Currently, the 
relation between the response and the material characteristics are 
being analyzed to develop criteria for obtaining a strong striction 
from polymers.  
<P>

<DT> MUSCLE CONFIGURATION
<DD> A series of configurations were considered 
and a Neo-Hokian model was investigated.
<P>

<DT> PREPARATION FOR DEMONSTRATION OF 1 DoF MECHANISM
<DD> A actuator based 
on ionic Perflurinated Solfonic Acid films that delivers a 10% linear 
actuator was developed.  A mechanism is being investigated to design a 
1 DoF device that will be used to demonstrate this electroactive 
polymer performance.

<H2>Lightweight and Survivable Rover (LSR)</H2>

<P>This task develops new rover architectures and enabling technologies
for planetary surface science, with themes of extending rover capability
and survivability while reducing rover mass and launch volume. Our initial
efforts focus on a 5-to-7 kilogram class rover capable of diverse terrain
traverses (VL1/2), self-navigable sorties of multiple kilometers, and extended
operation for months in both equatorial and polar latitudes. We demonstrate
new approaches to volume-and-mass efficient mobility, based on innovative
concepts in wheel design, miniature actuation, chassis structure, thermal
control, sampling mechanization, and computation-efficient 3-D terrain
sensing. These ongoing developments address currently known Mars Surveyor
Program (MSP) mission constraints and objectives, and produce technology
solutions important for later Sample Return missions. We conduct this R&amp;D
in cooperation with the Mars Exploration Technology (MET) Program, leveraging
new high-capacity thermal materials, low-temperature batteries, and miniature
science instrumentation. FY96 Level 1 LSR&nbsp;task activities produce
a first working proof of concept rover (<B><U>LSR-1</U></B>) having collapsible
wheels that stow to 1/3 their operational volume, an integrated low-loss
thermal/structural chassis, and a low-power-and-computation, all-terrain
obstacle detection sensor. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="lsr96.jpg" HEIGHT=367 WIDTH=561><BR>
</P>

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>We made significant progress on detailed mechanical design and fabrication
of our first LSR prototype during this reporting period. &quot;LSR-1,&quot;
per the CAD depiction above, is a 7kg vehicle (incl. a science instrument
for visible imaging and near-IR spectrophotometry), 100 cm in length, having
20 cm dia. wheels, 70 cm track, and 30 cm belly-pan clearance. A key innovation
in LSR is the development of space-worthy collapsible wheels enabling major
reduction in launch stowage volume (and in subsequent FY97 developments,
related collapsible running gear) for which we have implemented a first
mechanical proof-of-concept, shown below: </LI>

<P><IMG SRC="colwheel.jpg" HEIGHT=231 WIDTH=600></P>

<P>[<I>working bench model of LSR wheel: 25 cm dia, wheel, aluminum construction,
collapses to approx. 30% deployed volume, simulated growsers, approx. 400g</I>]
</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P>The operational LSR-1 wheels will be of hybrid composite/metal construction,
weighing about 250g each at 20 cm dia. We have docketed a NTR for this
development under the title &quot;Volume Efficient Deployable Rigid Wheel
(VEDRW).&quot; In general, our recent development of a new high-strength
machinable 3D composite (cf. accompanying 3Q96 JPL/Micro Lander Dexterous
Manipulator task report - &quot;<I>Black Aluminum</I>&quot;) is playing
an important part in LSR design, enabling 40-50% mass reduction of various
struts, integral thermal-structural elements, load-bearing joints, etc.
At this time, we estimate the mobility subsystem mass at 3.0 kg (six wheels,
rigid Al strut rocker-bogie with composite linkage elements, actuators,
etc.). All rotating surfaces incorporate Vespel SP-3 bushings, rather than
ball bearings, thus providing a further mass savings and extending low
temperature operability. Related developments in this period include design
of the LSR-1 power train, which utilizes flight heritage Maxon DC motors
and five-stage planetary gear-heads (modified fifth stage planet carrier
and output shaft). </P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>We continued the development of a novel integrated thermal/structural
vehicle chassis for LSR-1, wherein the warm electronics enclosure (WEE)
walls integrate a distributed load bearing sheet-and-spar mechanical composite
structure. Thermal control &amp; isolation is advanced over MFEX/Sojourner
through a combination of new Phase-Change Materials (PCM) being developed
in a companion MET task (R. Manvi), and LSR task introduction of a new
thermally isolating aerogel. We reported on some recent facets of this
work in two papers (G. Hickey et al.) given at the <I>Intl. Conf. on Environmental
Systems</I>, Monterey, CA, July 10, 1996. A <B><I><U>significant event</U></I></B>
within our latest work is our first experimental findings on a new low-loss,
low-mass rover thermal isolation approach. Utilizing a sheet-and-spar WEE
model structure from LSR-1, we performed thermal conductivity tests on
opacified resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogel, and demonstrated 10-to-30% lower
losses relative to silica aerogels used in MFEX -- these results as observed
in a Mars- relevant 10 torr CO2 ambient over a -80 to 20C range. </LI>

<LI>As described in prior LSR task reports, this year's work develops a
new laser spot-pushbroom sensor enabling reliable obstacle detection/avoidance
at relatively high rates of traverse, low computation, and low power. We
made good progress this period on design and proof-of-concept of the sensor
system, which was conceived for FY96/LSR-1 baseline operations as a five-laser/five-spot
projector, whose projected beams are selectively scanned and triangulated
within CCD cameras. Our evolution from conventional light-striping, as
used in MFEX/Sojourner, to highly focused, low-loss spot-projection has
required careful modeling and optimization of the laser collimating optics.
This work and experimentation was also useful to MFEX sensor development
(cf. Email of 5/29/96 J. Matijevic to D. Lavery). Further, we have been
able to extend the single-spot-per-laser projection concept to a new sensor
design in which up to 15 bright spots per laser are projected into the
50-100 cm rover near field through use of laser-mounted diffraction grating
optics. Using such a preliminary implementation, we have demonstrated obstacle
detection to 1 cm accuracy at 50 cm in full sunlight by <I>direct imaging
and spot/background discrimination</I>. Thus, we avoid time-consuming overhead
and power utilization of an additional difference imaging step (cf. MFEX
design). </LI>

<H2> Long-Range Science Rover  (LRSR)</H2>


<P>
This task develops technologies that enable 20 Kg class microrovers
to autonomously traverse many kilometers on the surface of Mars
and perform scientist directed experiments and return relevant
data back to Earth. Present microrover technology has several
limitations that preclude more ambitious science rich missions.
Current microrovers have very limited traverse (10s of meters),
are not capable of sample acquisition and manipulation (i.e.,
soil and rock acquisition, subsurface access, burial of instruments),
have limited science packages onboard, are designed for short
term missions (10 days), and require careful and repetitive ground
monitoring and control (limited autonomy) 
<P>
There is great interest in the science community to explore Mars
by landing near interesting geographic areas and moving to pre-selected
targets to offset landing errors. It is desirable to place instruments
against outcrops or loose rocks, possibly collect rocks for return
to Earth, and search an area for sample of interest. Also, long
traverse will provide an opportunity to make observations and
measurements along traverses and to access a wide variety of rocks
from different regions of Mars.
<P>
The development program is a multi-organizational research activity
involving several JPL technical divisions, industry, and universities.
The technical approach to achieving the above objectives is composed
of a focused research effort covering:

<LI>Autonomous sensing/navigation, 
<LI>Sampling/sensing using a rover attached miniature manipulator

<LI>Integration of relevant science instruments and demonstration

 This mast will be used both for navigation and science instrument
pointing and placement. Currently, the mast carries a pair of
CCD cameras for stereo imaging. The cameras also have color filters
that provide for synthesized color imaging and spectrometry. The
stereo imaging system weighs 150 gm.  In addition, a close-up
imaging instrument has been developed using a CCD camera which
can be placed against rocks for 50 um/pixel resolution imaging.
This imager uses a number of LED's to take images under different
lights, and therefore can be used for spectral analysis. The camera
is mounted in a self-aligning housing that will automatically
place the camera head on a rock when the surface normal is not
known, precisely. Three micro switches provide onboard confirmation
that the camera head has contacted a surface. This close-up imager
weighs 200 grams.  The mast has been designed to carry a 500 gm
science instrument.

<LI>A number of improvements in the dig-dump and spectrometer
pointing operations have been implemented to improve the overall
robustness of the system. Before deploying the arm, Rocky 7 searches
the area in front of the rover for possible collision of its manipulator
with rocks. It searches and finds spots that are safe for manipulation.
It then autonomously moves the rover such that the arm deployment
occurs in a collision free region. For
dig and dump operations, the vision system checks the before and
after images of the manipulator scoops to determine whether or
not the dig or dump operations were successful. For digging operations,
the vision system confirms that the area is &quot;soil&quot; like

<a name="aerobot">
<H2> Planetary Aerobot Testbed </H2>

There has been considerable progress in the Planetary Aerobot Testbed
(PAT) development this last quarter.  Two of the tasks currently
supported by the Telerobotics Program are the Venus Sensor and
Perception (VESPER) and the Buoyancy Control Subsytsem
(BCS).

<h3>Buoyancy Control Subsytsem (BCS)</h3>

The PAT BCS is a unique mobility system being developed to further the
exploration of planetary atmospheres and surfaces.  An aerobot BCS
will allow science packages to be placed in the atmosphere of places
such as Venus or Titan, and them to be flown at different altitudes,
landed at specific sites, or guided to different regions in the
atmosphere under autonomous control.<P>

The system currently being developed under the Telerobotics Program
for operation within the Earths atmosphere, shown in figure 1,
consists of a primary balloon with Helium lifting gas, a secondary
balloon for the reversible fluid, and a pressure vessel/heat exchanger
system designed to allow control of the fluid phase.  The operation
subsystem will enable the verification of complex dynamic,
thermodynamic and aerodynamic models which will eventually adapted to
Venus and Titan.  Experience gained in the manual operation of the BCS
in FY96 will enable the autonomous operation and control of PAT in FY
97.<P>
 
<center><img width=600 height=660 src="pat_sch.gif"><P><i>
Fig. 1.  Preliminary configuration of PAT '96.</i></center><P>

The third quarter of 1996 has provided some very interesting
developments for the Buoyancy Control System (BCS) of the Planetary
Aerobot Testbed (PAT).  First, the system-level design was
reconsidered and a method for operating these types of balloons with a
one valve instead of three was discovered.  This allows us to make
smaller, lighter reversible fluid balloon systems applicable to the
target missions of Earth, Venus, and Titan.<P>

Second, progress has been made on the hardware front.  The heat
exchanger, arguably the largest and most complicated component of the
system, was built using mass production electronic parts packaging
equipment, providing inexpensive, accurate techniques for
construction.  This technique allows us to scale the PAT heat
exchanger to virtually any desired size with very few engineering
changes, opening up the possibility for flying future PATs of
different sizes without increasing costs.  Additionally, other
components such as the balloon, gas bag, and cutdown system components
(parachutes and line cutters) have been located and in some cases
received.  The last significant piece of hardware, the fluid reservoir
with valve train, is currently in fabrication for system test.<P>

A difficulty arose in the characterization and modeling of the
reversible fluid originally intended to fly aboard PAT.  This fluid,
dubbed Mix II (65% R142b and 35% R124), has recently been found to
have a higher solar absorbtivity than originally expected.  Too much
solar absorption will keep the fluid from condensing and will cause
PAT not to reverse direction.  In addition, because this fluid boils
at a lower temperature than fluids flown in the past, PAT would
operate closer to the tropopause, where the radiant black body
temperature characteristics of the atmosphere are less well understood
and cause difficulties in the proper modeling of the delicate
thermodynamics of the vehicle.  In light of these two issues, we are
searching for better reversible fluids to fly the mission.  Our
leading candidate, a combination of R114 and R143, promises to give us
a similar Buoyancy Control Margin to PAT without the above problems. 
Fortunately, this change has little impact on the hardware described
above.<P>

The next quarter should bring together the culmination of the
activities.  A full-scale BCS system will be erected in the newly
established Aerobot Laboratory for initial characterization. 
Additionally, plans are in the works to fly the system within the
Earth's atmosphere on PAT.<P>

<h3>Venus Sensor and Perception (VESPER)</h3>

The first objective of the VESPER system is to develop autonomous
perception concepts for balloon aerobot system (with focus on Venus
operations) to enable: on-board localization of balloon with respect
to a planet, estimation of balloon motion (horizontal/vertical) and
determination of balloon gondola attitude.   This capability supports
science instrument line-of-sight determination and sequence
triggering, global navigation and path-planning, and descent/landing
operations.  In other words, Where are we ? Where are we going ? What
are we looking at? <P>

Other objectives are to develop a ``ground-truth'' system for
performance evaluation as well as emulation of other sensors, develop
an open and extensible hardware, software and test infrastructure i.e.
a testbed to support the demonstration of sensors, algorithms and
mission concepts for aerobot studies applicable to Mars, Venus, Earth,
etc., and to serve as a point design to provide the foundation of a
design database for potential mission opportunities - Mars 2001, Venus
2005. <P>

Specific FY96 objectives of VESPER include establishment of a set of
general aerobot perception/navigation concepts using inertial,
imaging, celestial, and radiometric sensors, the design and
implementation of a sensor/perception system for demonstration of a
core subset of perception concepts on PAT including:<P>

<ul>

<li>Inertial propagation of balloon state - attitude and attitude rate.
<li>Science camera triggering and line-of-sight referencing.
<li>Frame-to-frame image based ground velocity track estimation.
<li>Pressure-based balloon altitude estimation. 

</ul>

Additional objectives include implementation (but not necessarily fly)
additional perception/navigation concepts such as 6-dof inertial
propagation of balloon state - attitude, attitude rate, translational
position/velocity and simple imaging-based sun/horizon sensor.  Other
specific objectives are selection and implementation of long-lead
sensor hardware elements e.g. radar/lidar altimeter, sun-sensor for
Venus, radiometric sensor, implementation of a ground-truth system for
attitude and use GPS data (implemented by communication/RF task) for
position and implementation of ambient atmospheric sensors -
pressure/temperature for support of FAA transponder and flight
performance/modeling. <P>

In the last quarter the VESPER subsystem saw continued progress
towards the demonstrationflight in the fall. All hardware and
electronics development is completewith the integration of the
inertial sensors into a compact lightweight package.  Algorithm and
software development activities focus on improvements and tuning of
the image processing algorithms for frame-to-frame motion estimation
and the Kalman filter algorithms for the inertial attitude and motion
estimation. Calibrations of the various sensors is in progress.
Preparations are also underway to process and interpret aerial image
data returned from an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) camera to be flown in
the fourth quarter on a small test balloon (ALICE). A study is also
underway to select a suitable altimeter technology and sensor (either
Q-switched laser or pulsed radar) for use on the balloon.

planetary surfaces.  These reserves are currently (e.g. Mars Surveyor)
about 1kg and new smaller missions (e.g. New Millenium) may have mass
reserves as small as 100g.  By fitting within the mass reserves, and
by having a very simple interface to the lander, the nanorover can fly
as a secondary payload or as a late addition to the mission.

<H2>Micro Lander Dexterous Manipulators </H2>

<P>This task develops new robotic architectures and technologies for planetary
surface science, consistent with mission objectives and constraints of
the NASA Mars Exploration Program. Resulting robots - as integrated with
Mars lander or rover science platforms - will be used to dexterously view,
probe, acquire, and containerize samples for in situ analysis and potential
return to earth. Task technology thrusts include design of scaleable, ultra-light
arms and actively powered effectors, the development of new composite robot
components and material forming processes, and the innovation of miniature,
high-torque density solid state motors applicable to wide ranging Mars
climates. The scope of task R&amp;D is ground laboratory concept demonstrations
and the evaluation of selected new components in realistic Mars environmental
conditions. FY96 Level 1 task activities develop and demonstrate a new,
all-composite manipulator under dexterous task space control for representative
sampling operations. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="mldmarm.gif" HEIGHT=234 WIDTH=493></P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<H3>A. Activities in This Reporting Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI>We completed the detailed mechanical design of &quot;MarsArmII,&quot;
an <I>all-composite</I> three degrees of freedom (T/S/E) manipulator that
is our FY96 Level 1 deliverable from this task (Sep'96). MarsArmII is constructed
of high-strength 2-D composite tubular links, three (roll-pitch-pitch)
modular joints based in novel 3-D composite implementation (see below),
and is driven by a set of rotary solid state ultrasonic motors (USM) acting
through harmonic drives. The arm proper, integrated with all instrumentation
and actuation, is approximately two meters at full extent, 4 kg in mass,
and will support a full extent load of approx. 15 lb. while achieving 5
in/sec tip velocities. MarsArmII will carry a new all-composite Multi-Function
Science End Effector (MFSEE ) incorporating a trenching tool, worm-driven
opposed jaws (for sample acquisition/handling), micro-viewing science camera
and a simple active abrasion device for exposure of fresh rock surfaces.
We have processed the enabling composite billets/tubes, and most parts
are now in fabrication. We note that MarsArmII further serves as reference
for a scaled-down &quot;Micro-arm&quot; design, an approx. 60 cm long small
manipulator targeted for use as a light, dexterous rover-borne sampling
and deployment device (cf. Lightweight and Survivable Rover task).</LI>

<LI>Our work on the new 3D composite process continued successfully, measured
in one respect by recent resin transfer mold production of numerous billets
as large as 10x10x2.5 cu-in, from which we are able to <I>directly, repeatably
machine</I> arm joint, joint-tube interface, end-effector parts and other
critical load-bearing assemblies by conventional metal shop practice. Preliminary
mechanical tests yielded average 80 ksi thread shear strengths at 4-40
screw size, and dependable results for 2-56 machine screws. We have filed
for technology disclosure under the name &quot;Black Aluminum.&quot; </LI>

<LI>We made progress in several areas of ultrasonic motor design and analysis:
1) one important advance was experimental development (within a SATEC chamber
instrumented for local motor cooling/torque-gauging) and completion of
first environmental tests under space-relevant conditions. Using commercially
available Shinsei (Litton-Westrex/Japan) 1 in-lb devices, we obtained stable
motor torque-speed characteristics from room temperature down to -50C onset
of thermally induced mechanical seizure in 2.2x10^2 Torr vacuum. We observed
no evidence of vacuum corona or welding, these being primary low-temperature
concerns for this type of motor. Given the motor is maximally rated for
&gt;-10C operations in 1 ATM ambient, these initial results are encouraging;
2) Significant progress was made in developing finite element models (FEM)
of USM's to incorporate complete configuration of the stator (teeth size,
diameter and thickness, etc., these interface parameters being empirically
observed as critical variables in motor torque output/efficiency). This
work is joint with MIT (N. Hagood), who provides further support in design-synthesis,
novel techniques of experimental analysis (interferometric tools for dynamic
characterization of the motor actuation phenomenology - e.g. visualization
of wave transduction at the critical stator-rotor interface and related
pathologies due to mechanical design tolerancing, areally/temporally uniform
control of interface pressure/friction, etc.), and prototyping of new large
diameter (3&quot; dia.) /high-torque devices for JPL evaluation at lower
temperatures; 3) Using the new finite element algorithm, we designed a
series of USM's (1.75&quot; dia.) utilizing parametrically different materials,
teeth size and thickness, so as to validate our new design tools. Resulting
USM's demonstrated significantly higher torque than any of our prior comparable
heuristic designs (or those based on more approximating MIT Rayleigh-Ritz
vs. JPL&nbsp;FEM models). In parallel with our JPL efforts, TCA partner
QMI is now making a 3&quot; diameter motor based on the JPL reverse-stack-and-segment
design to produce a high torque USM. QMI, with JPL requirements input,
also made progress in design of generic USM drivers/amplifiers that were
successfully used to operate both commercial Shinsei and MIT prototype
R&amp;D&nbsp;lab devices. </LI>

<H3>B. Plans for the Next Reporting Period </H3>

<LI>Complete MarsArmII fabrication, assembly, electromechanical integratation,
and instrumentation. Test MarsArmII under USM servo controls and once they
prove operational, demonstrate/evaluate the arm in application to representative
dexterous sampling tasks under sensor-referenced Cartesian controls (e.g.,
see &quot;autonomous soil science&quot; and &quot;autonomous rock science&quot;
scenarios discussed in 2q96 report). </LI>

<H2> Vision and Touch Guided Grasping (MIT, Theobald) </H2>

This project conducts basic research in the area of vision and touch
guided grasping of objects.  This project encompasses the areas of
touch sensing, material property sensing, stable autonomous grasping
of objects (including buried, constrained, or moving objects), and
enhanced remote user interaction.  Our platform for testing and
development is the
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/wam/">WAM system</A>
with two active vision cameras.  In addition, in order to facilitate
technology transfer, we have also recently constructed the
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/theo/rocky/">Rocky7 Test
System</A> which consists of a kinematically similar yet simpler
"mock-up" of the Rocky7 rover.

<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events for This Period </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Ultrasound material property sensor (UMPS)
<UL>
<LI> Successfully able to identify several fluids: water, ethanol,
methanol, isopropal alcohol.
<LI> Done preliminary rock identification studies; have experimented
with two different granite rock types and have been able to
discriminate the two.
</UL>
<LI> Object Acquisition with the WAM system
<UL>
<LI> A sequence of progressively more aggressive grasping/digging
techniques has been found to be very reliable in acquiring objects
buried within heavy gravel.  This sequence includes simple
grasping, shaking while grasping, and using the fingers to dig along
the major axis of the object while grasping.
<LI> Interacting with objects which are constrained in their motion
(such as hinged doors) has begun to be studied.  Using spatial
filtering of the path of the hand, the WAM can successfully find the
path of least resistance in order to open an arbitrarily oriented
door.
<LI> Gathering of information about multiple objects in the workspace
has been implemented.  For each object a frame grab of the camera
views, its location, approximate size, orientation, and aspect ratio
are collected.  In addition, a graspability ranking is associated with
each object based upon various criteria.  This information is then
displayed to a remote operator through a graphical user interface for
selection of objects to be retrieved.

<H2> MicroTelerobotics: Robot Assisted MicroSurgery (RAMS) </H2>

This task is a cooperative NASA-Industry effort to develop a telerobot for
breakthrough micro-and-minimally invasive surgeries. The resulting Robot
Assisted
Microsurgery (RAMS) workstation, via computer enhanced controls, will enable
new procedures beyond human manual dexterity, and allow a broader group of
practitioners to successfully deliver needed healthcare services at
reduced cost.
Surgical applications include the eye, ear, nose, throat, face, hand,
spine, and
brain. NASA-JPL's role is to design, fabricate, test, and document an
engineering R&D prototype -- a six degrees-of-freedom, position and force
scaling master-slave telemanipulator -- capable of relative positioning of 20
microns over a 10-to-20 cm*3 continuous volume (e.g., the eye).  The industry
partner, MicroDexterity Systems, Inc., working through independent funding,
defines medical requirements, collaborates in system engineering design,
develops and tests a pre-commercial clinical prototype, and with end market
support certifies and commercializes a final design. <P>

JPL successfully demonstrated a robot slave engineering
prototype in FY 1994, and in FY 1995, a master arm capable of simulating a
force feedback environment and manually controlling task space position of the
slave. In FY 1996, JPL will enable the handling of a surgical
instrument, demonstrate a realistic microsurgical procedure using the
telerobotic system and build a second prototype to allow external medical
laboratory testing of the RAMS technology. Further growth master-slave system
capabilities include textural
feedback at the master, and <i>in situ</i> imaging at the robot slave.
Beyond its medical significance, this new MicroTelerobotic system has potential
dual-use in ground-to-orbit and thermal-vacuum applications that include
EVA/IVA telescience and telemedicine, safe bio-and-materials processing,
micro-mechanical assembly, small-instrument servicing, and terrestrial
environmental testing. <P>

<H3> A. Significant Activities and Events </H3>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> <I>Loan of slave prototype to Cleveland Clinic: </I> Delivered and
	  installed the first prototype RAMS slave robot at the Microsurgery
	  laboratory of Dr. M. Siemionow of the Cleveland Clinic
	  Foundation. The delivered system includes a laptop and
	  joystick user interface in a stand-alone configuration requiring no
	  network interface. In addition, a cable-controlled forceps tip
	  was mounted on the robot end effector. It is controlled from
	  handles mounted on the joystick input device. Researchers at
	  the Cleveland Clinic were instructed on use of the RAMS
	  prototype system. Tests of the robot are being conducted to
	  determine its performance in a clinical setting.
<P>
<LI> <I>Second slave arm prototype:</I> Completed the fabrication,
	  assembly, integration and test of the second slave
	  prototype. The second slave prototype arm is now the robot
	  used on the RAMS system at JPL; the first prototype was
	  integrated into the system delivered to the Cleveland Clinic.
	  Design improvements in the second prototype allow more robust
	  and smoother motion in a lighter package.
<P>
<LI> <I>Microsurgery simulation: </I> Completed the design and
	  fabrication of a simulated eyeball for use in demonstration of
	  simulated microsurgery procedures. The simulated eyeball
	  realistically replicates the visual and mechanical features of
	  a real human eyeball including a retina and fluid inflation of
	  the eyeball. The simulated eyeball is free to move in its socket
	  and has the force interaction characteristics of a real
	  eyeball. Upgrades to the RAMS system for the microsurgery
	  simulation, including slave end effector instrument handling design,
	  software and hardware for indexed motion and pivoting
	  algorithms for constrained motion control, were initiated.

<P>
<LI> <I>Second master arm prototype:</I> Completed all mechanical
	  fabrication of the prototype-2 master arm. Anodizing, assembly and
	  wiring of encoders and motors are underway.
<P>
<LI> <I>External presentations: </I> Over the last quarter, the RAMS
	  system was shown to a number of visiting groups and was
	  also demonstrated as part of the JPL Open House
	  on June 8 and 9 where thousands of visitors including
	  JPL Director Ed Stone and Deputy Director Larry Dumas were
	  shown precise positioning with scaled manual control of the
	  slave robot tip tracing letters on a $20 bill.
<P>
<LI> <I>MDS Activity: </I>
<UL>
<LI> Underwent significant re-organization during this reporting
	      period. Kamran Siminou left MDS and Hal Wolbrink will be

<LI> Developed a new strategic plan for commercialization of the
	      microtelerobotics technology. Ideas and components from
	      JPL, Sandia, vendors and new concepts from Steve Charles
	      and others will be incorporated in the next generation
	      system.

<h1>Rover Self Inspection</h1>

During its long traverse across Mars, a rover will need to be periodically
inspected.  High wheel currents, or lack of vehicle motion may imply 
a stuck wheel or vehicle high-centering, which must be accessed by ground
controllers.  Also, a visual record of vehicle wear over time during the
traverse will help in planning the remainder of mission, as well future
vehicle and mission design.<p>

<p>
To detect success during digging and dumping operations, a visual 
verification is one of several checks employed.  For this operation,
the openned scoops are imaged before and after the manipulation 
operation.  Only the right images are needed, and are cropped for
the region of the scoop only.  These images show a close-up of this
region and its surroundings.  To detect the presense or absence of
soil  from the scoops after the operation, we check how many pixels
exceed an empirically determined and preset threshold in the difference of the
images.  For illustration, pixels which exceed the threshhold are 
false-colored red below.

<h1>Science Imaging</h1>

To improve upon imagery obtained from the rover-eye view, the mast
may be used to look down on science targets. This is usually a 
precursor to placement of the science instrument.

Note that in the left image, the stereo cameras a facing down, while
in the second image they are up.  Due to the stowage geometry,
the mast must rotate the masthead through 180 degrees between these
configurations.<p>

Unlike the mast imagery, the close-up imager attempts to obtain color
by illumination.  The RGB illuminating LEDs are at 700, 565, 466 nm.
Other LEDs at 590, 630, 880, 940 nm are also integrated into the
system.  Calibration compensation for uneven illumination is currently
being investigated.

We have integrated into Rocky 7 a commercially available point reflectance
spectrometer (Ocean Optics Model S1000,
<a href="http://www.oceanoptics.com/">
Ocean Optics Inc.</a>, 1104 Pinehurst Rd, Dunedin, FL 34698). This instrument was
selected because it was readily available, relatively low cost, and is
small enough to be integrated in the current rover platform.  <P> 

The spectrometer is configured for a wavelength of 360-850nm -
primarily the visual range (400-700nm) and very-near IR. (Other ranges
are available but wavelength is limited because a silicon CCD detector
is used.)  For in-depth scientific investigation spectral information
out to the near-IR (2.5um) and thermal-IR (10um) are desirable.
However, the Ocean Optic spectrometer provides a good (and cost
effective) starting point which can be enhanced in the future.<P>

The spectrometer operates by gathering reflected light via a
collimating lens at the end of a fiber optic cable.  The reflected
light is then passed through a diffraction grating and spread out over
the 1024 linear CCD array.  For the 360-850nm this results in ~0.5nm
spectral bands.  This data is then converted to analog signals which
are read by the host computer.  <P>

The spectrometer itself is located inside the chassis of the Rocky 7
microrover. A fiber optic cable is brought out along the two degree of
freedom sampling arm.  The end of the sampling arm, consisting of a
pair of scoops, has been specially configured for the spectrometer.
The lens at the fiber optic cable is mounted on the edge of the
sampling mechanism which is specially designed only to open and expose
the spectrometer to reflected light at one special scoop position, as
seen in the photos.  A calibration target has also been integrated
into the end of the sampling arm so that a reference reading can be
taken in the same lighting conditions as the sample.<P>

<h1>Mast Stereo Panoramic Imaging</h1>

Without the aid of a lander nearby, a long range rover must be able
to image the surrounding terrain from a relatively high vantage point.
This imagery is used for path planning, terrain feature tracking for localization,
and selection of science targets. Only monocular views are shown here.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>                         
December 20, 1996
<br><br>
NEXT GENERATION MARS ROVER PASSES FIRST NAVIGATION TEST 
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>A prototype of NASA's next generation of Martian rovers, 
nicknamed Rocky 7, has navigated successfully over a corner of 
Lavic Lake, an ancient lake bed about 275 kilometers (175 miles) east of Los 
Angeles, taking panoramic photographs and close-ups of the 
cratered terrain.     
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>The three-day experiment, conducted Dec. 17-19 by a team of 
engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other 
institutions, was designed to demonstrate the rover's ability to 
drive a much greater distance than current rovers over rugged 
terrain reminiscent of Mars. The tests also demonstrated new 
mechanical innovations for 21st century rovers, such as a robotic 
arm that would be used to dig into soil and an agile mast that 
could be used to image the surrounding terrain and position 
miniature science instruments in tricky locations, said Dr. Samad 
Hayati, experiment engineer at JPL.
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>"The rover was very successful in making a long journey on 
its own, driving more than 200 meters (655 feet) to its target 
and relying on only specified location points along the way and 
information about the target," Hayati said. "Some of the key 
objectives of the next series of rovers will be their ability to 
navigate much greater distances autonomously and their ability to 
study the nooks and crannies on Mars where other robots were 
unable to go."
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>Robotic exploration of Mars over the next 10 years will 
focus on climate, the search for water and hints that life may 
have existed once in Mars' early history, and the identification 
of natural resources that could be mined and used for eventual 
human expeditions to the red planet. Autonomous rovers capable of 
traversing long distances, making in-situ measurements of soil 
and rock properties, and caching the samples for later return to 
Earth will be central to those scientific goals.
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>The Rocky 7 experiment team working with Hayati included 
scientists and engineers from NASA's Ames Research Center in 
Mountain View, Calif., Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., 
Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., and scientific institutions 
abroad. Most of the team congregated at the test site to observe 
Rocky 7's performance in the 29 Palms Marine Corps Base near Palm 
Springs, Calif. The site was chosen because it is a playa, not 
unlike some regions of Mars, with flat areas, mud-cracked areas, 
regions strewn with basalt rocks and numerous craters and ejecta 
generated by Marine Corps shells. 
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>The Rocky 7 rover represents the newest, super-deluxe model 
of rover, but looks very similar to its predecessor, Sojourner, 
which is currently on its way to Mars. Rocky 7 weighs slightly 
more at 15 kilograms (33 pounds) compared to Sojourner, which 
weighs a petite 11.5 kilograms (25 pounds). The Rocky 7 robotic 
vehicle stands about as tall and has about the same dimensions as 
Sojourner, measuring 48 centimeters (19 inches) wide by 64 
centimeters (25 inches) long by 32 centimeters (12.5 inches) 
tall. The rover also sports the same six-wheeled chassis and 
springless "rocker-bogie" mobility system, which allows the 
vehicle to conform to the contours of the surface and scale 
objects almost as tall as itself without tipping over. 
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>Rocky 7 carries a 32-centimeter (12.5-inch) long manipulator 
arm with four degrees of freedom. Mounted on the front of the 
vehicle, the arm can reach 10 centimeters (4 inches) below the 
surface. Among its many uses, the arm will help scientists 
determine whether there are traces of water locked beneath Mars' 
polar ice caps or buried deep inside its crust.     
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>Engineers have also fashioned a new 1.5-meter (5-foot) tall, 
antenna-like mast, which would be deployed once the robot was out 
and about on Mars. The mast has three degrees of freedom and 
carries three cameras: a pair of wide-angle stereo imagers for 
panoramic shots of the landscape and a narrow-angle imager for 
close-up shots of rocks and other geologic features. The mast can 
be used in much the same way as an arm, deploying science 
instruments against rocks or aligning them in the nadir, or down-
pointing, position.
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>During testing, Rocky 7 carried all three cameras on its 
mast, in addition to a spectrometer on its digging arm and a pair 
of stereo imagers on the front and back of the vehicle, which 
acted as its "eyes." The rover was furnished with simulated 
descent imaging to recreate landing, then asked to deploy its 
mast and take a panoramic photograph of the landscape. Part of 
the field testing also involved demonstrating how well the rover 
could be controlled remotely from JPL using a World Wide Web 
operator interface, called the Web Interface for Telescience 
(WITS).  
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>"The data system worked very well and the images that were 
delivered to the team were quite adequate," said Dr. Ray 
Arvidson, science team leader from Washington University. "Once 
the panoramic image was shot, the rover proceeded to traverse 
over a fairly smooth surface, using its hazard avoidance software 
to avoid obstacles. 
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>"If you compare Rocky 7's first traverse of more than 200 
meters (655 feet) to Sojourner's capability, you'll see the 
improvement," he said. "Sojourner can only travel tens of meters 
around the immediate landing site and relies 100 percent on a 
companion lander to relay and receive information. Rocky 7, on 
the other hand, is not only capable of roaming greater distances 
but is far more autonomous. Eventually, this new robot will be 
able to go over the horizon and conduct a full day's worth of in-
situ experiments entirely on its own." 
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>In addition to the navigation and mobility tests, the rover 
team staged a remote commanding experiment using a class of 
sixth-graders from Eagle View Middle School in Colorado Springs, 
Colo., who sent commands from the classroom to the rover.  A 
local computer systems integration company, 3SI of Englewood, 
Colo., assisted in setting up the software interface for the 
remote communications experiment.
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>"The students sent commands to Rocky 7 over the Internet to 
carry out a 'dig and dump' experiment using the rover's robotic 
arm," said Dr. Paul Backes, a JPL engineer on the remote 
operations team. "The arm was instructed to scoop up some soil 
near one of the craters at Lavic Lake, then dump it out. All of 
this was done remotely using WITS, which was accessible from a 
common Web browser that scientists on a future rover mission 
might use. This distributed data and command system will allow 
scientists to participate in future planetary rover missions from 
their home institutions." 
<br><br>
<spacer size=25>Results of the Rocky 7 field tests will be documented and 
posted on the Internet in a variety of formats as soon as they 
are available. Internet users may access the results at

<br><br>
<spacer size=25>The Rocky 7 rover development and field testing was 
supported by JPL's Robotics and Mars Exploration Technology 
Program Office for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington,

<H4> 
A two-armed telerobot now undergoing development can manipulate
objects with dexterity approaching that of a human. It is designed to
be remotely operated by a human. The human operator wears a harness
with exoskeleton-like sleeves and gloves; the remote manipulator
follows the operator's arm, hand, and finger movements and feeds back
position and force information so that the operator has a sense of
manipulating the object held by the telerobot. Eventually, as control
electronics becomes more advanced, it may be possible to give the
robot autonomy over routine manipulative tasks, although human control
will still be needed for unstructured activities.

<TITLE> Distributed Space Telerobotics Task </TITLE>

<H1> Distributed Space Telerobotics
<p> 
<IMG SRC="images/dst.gif"></a>
<BR>

<H4> 

This effort is being developed as a cooperative research and
development activity between NASA-JPL and the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) -- Electrotechnical Laboratory
(ETL) of Japan.  The main technical thrust of the project is safe
ground control of orbital robots under operational uncertainties
caused by impaired remote viewing, communication time delay, and
tasking contingencies.  The main Japanese application interest is in
space assembly, while the focus of the United States is space
servicing.
<p>

There are two key research areas currently under development:
teleprogramming and Intelligent Viewing Control (IVC).
Teleprogramming is done by the
<a href="/tasks/gcs/homepage.html">Ground Control Station</a>.  IVC
involves computerized planning and sequencing of multicamera views
that are fused with calibrated three-dimensional virtual work-space
presentations.  This capability includes software facilites for
interactive modeling -- the capture of new work-space features, their
rendering/presentation, and calibration -- intended to improve
work-space perception and facilitate camera management.

<TITLE> Ground Control Station Task </TITLE>

<H1>Ground Control Station Task
<p> 
<a href="images/gcsComp.gif"><IMG SRC="images/gcsComp.small.50.gif"></a>
<BR>

<H3>

The Ground Control Station is a system which allows an operator
to interactively build, simulate and execution task sequences.
The interface provides the ground control station functionality
of a ground-remote telerobot control system.  
Time delay between the ground control station and the space-based
robot control system prevent the use of control modes which
require closed loop control between the local and remote sites.
All ground control commands are executed autonomously at the remote site.
<P>

There may be applications, such as for Space Station, where there will
also be a remote operator control station.
In such a system, the ground or the remote control stations could control
the robotic system or work together.  
For example, the ground station could generate task sequences and 
telemeter them to the remote control station from which they could be executed.
The remote control station might also use direct teleoperation since time
delay may not be a significant factor.
<P>
 
The operator develops commands at the local site by selecting command types
and providing specific data to the commands and providing logic
around the commands.
The operator will interact with the system in multiple ways.
The operator can command the system via menu interaction,
voice input or in a graphical environment where desired commands
are implied by the operator's actions.

<DL>
<DT>Description</DT>
<DD> Select a representative sample of proximity sensors available from
commercial companies or research labs.  Also select a representative
sample of space craft surface materials.  Perform initial proximity
measurement characterization of all sensors.  Demonstrate robot
collision avoidance capability, though simple real-time experiments
with a single sensor.
</DD><P>

<DT>NASA Needs / Significance </DT>
<DD>The use of robots in near flight hardware requires collision avoidance
capability to prevent inadvertant damage to either system.
Non-contact sensing of the proximity of the flight hardware surface
position will enable the moving robot move so as to avoid contact.
</DD><P>

<DT>Status / Accomplishments </DT>
<UL>
<LI>A full spectrum of proximity sensors have been selected and tested:
    <UL>
    <LI> Intensity of reflection (infrared)
    <LI> Triangulation (infrared, visible laser)
    <LI> Time of flight (visible laser, microwave)
    <LI> Capacitive  
    <LI> Inductive
    </UL>
<LI> A full spectrum of spacecraft surface materials have been been obtained.
    <UL>
    <LI> Aluminums (bare, painted, anodized)
    <LI> Kaptons, Mylars, Teflons
    <LI> Beta Cloths
    <LI> Shuttle tiles
    <LI> etc.
    </UL>
<LI> Simple real-time controlled, robot collision avoidance has been
  demonstrated.

<H1> Laboratory Tending Telerobot Task

<H3>

Space science is an important application domain for NASA missions
such as Space Shuttle and Space Station.
An important activity of Shuttle astronauts is to tend space science
experiments.  The astronauts are highly trained on the ground to
accurately tend the experiments.
But because astronaut time is so valuable, space science experiments
often are not allocated the amount of tending time that a principal
investigator desires.
Ground based telerobotic tending of space science experiments is one
solution to allow increased tending of space science experiments.
Additionally, by putting tending mechanisms internal to the experiment
apparatus, the apparatus does not have to be opened for tending which will
allow more accurate experiment environment control and tending of
hazardous environment experiments.
The Laboratory Tending Telerobot (LaTT) task developed a prototype kinematic
design of a robotic mechanism for tending a plant growth chamber
experiment which is planned for Space Station.

So you found my hidden page, eh?  Well, here are some links
to pages of interest at Caltech...
<p>
Hi!  Well, it's a new year.  Nope, I still haven't gotten time to
organise my Peru photos, much less put them on this page.  It'll
happen someday, I promise!  So far this year seems to be a bit
calmer than the last one...no major expeditions planned, for
example.  However, I am inching ever closer to that elusive Ph.D....

<H2>Technical Objectives:</H2>

The objective of this work element is to use telerobotic technology to
assist engineers as they ground test satellites or spacecraft in the
large Space Simulation Chambers at JPL. Inside these test chambers
spacecraft are exposed to extremely cold temperatures, high vacuum,
and simulated sunlight thereby approximating a space-like
environment. This project calls for the development and demonstration
of a mobile, multi-axis, multi-camera, telerobotic inspection system
that will be deployed inside the thermal/vacuum test chambers and
provide test operators with live high-resolution mono and stereoscopic
video and real-time infrared thermal imaging of the spacecraft article
under test. This will augment and improve current test procedures. The
STAR IR camera may also be employed to calibrate solar flux
intensities across the entire chamber volume. The anticipated cost
savings and technical enhancements provided by these capabilities will
be assessed.


<h2>Approach:</H2>

STAR is a three year development effort that began in 1992. During the
first year an initial three-axis configuration of STAR was built and
demonstrated in ambient conditions. It consisted of a 25-foot vertical
axis, a pan/tilt unit, and a general purpose instrument platform
equipped with three high-resolution CCD cameras, one having a zoom
lens. Mono and stereoscopic viewing of a spacecraft mock-up was
demonstrated on a rudimentary operator control station (OCS).

The STAR design was validated in 1993 by successfully undergoing more
than 50 hours of rigorous thermal/vacuum testing in the 10-Foot
Chamber in a joint test conducted with hardware being developed for
JPL's Cassini Spacecraft. The vertical axis had been modified and an
IR Camera had been added to the instrument payload, providing vivid
thermal images of the Cassini hardware and introducing a non-contact
measurement capability inside the chamber.

In 1994 a 25 ft. diameter azimuthal axis gantry system will be
designed to permit full lateral motion around the inside diameter of
JPL's 25-Foot Space Simulation Chamber. STAR's Operator Control
Station (OCS) will also be upgraded and enhanced to provide a
user-friendly graphical interface, position data logging and automated
test sequences.

The funding for this task is currently planned through end of FY'94.

<h4>
JPL recently developed 
a virtual reality calibration technique that enables reliable and accurate 
matching of a graphically simulated virtual environment in 3-D
geometry and perspective with actual video camera views.
This technique enables high-fidelity preview/predictive
displays with calibrated graphic overlay on live video
for telerobotic servicing applications. Its effectiveness was successfully
demonstrated in a recent JPL/NASA-GSFC 
ORU (Orbital Replacement Unit) changeout remote servicing task.
In September 1993, with NASA's recent thrust for industry collaborations,
JPL and 
<a href="http://www.deneb.com">Deneb Robotics, Inc.</a>
established a technology cooperation agreement.
In this JPL-Industry cooperative Deneb Commercialization Task,
JPL transfers the virtual reality calibration software technology to Deneb,
and Deneb inserts this software technology into its commercial product
TELEGRIP.  This joint technology collaborative work thus enables Deneb 
to commercialize an upgraded industry product that will greatly benefit 
both space and terrestrial telerobotics applications. <P>

Key new features of the JPL calibration technique include; 
1) An operator-interactive method is adopted to obtain
reliable correspondence data.  2) A robot arm itself is used as a calibration
fixture for camera calibration, eliminating a cumbersome procedure of
using external calibration fixtures.  
3) The object localization procedure is added after the camera calibration 
as a new approach to obtain graphic overlay 
of both the robot arm and the object(s) on live video and 
enable effective use of the computer-generated trajectory
mode in addition to the teleoperation mode. 
4) A projection-based linear least-squares
algorithm is extended to handle multiple camera views for object localization.
5) Nonlinear least-squares algorithms combined with linear ones
are employed for both camera calibration and object localization.
Details of the algorithms and their software listings can be found in the 
recent JPL Document D-11593, which was prepared as part of this JPL-Industry 
cooperative task. <P>

An example of a calibrated graphic overlay after the virtual reality
calibration for the JPL/NASA-GSFC remote servicing demonstration
is shown in Fig. 1.
The positioning alignment accuracy achieved in inserting a tool
into the ORU hole using 4 camera views
was 0.51 cm on the average with a 1.07 cm maximum error
at 95% confidence level. Fig. 2 shows
a snapshot of a preview/predictive display providing effective visual
prediction/verification. <P>

The JPL virtual reality calibration option is currently being implemented
on Deneb's TELEGRIP which is an open architecture based upon
Dynamic Shared Objects (DSO's).
The TELEGRIP video overlay implementation will be based upon an application
programmers interface (API) layer which insulates the overlay developer from 
the specifics of video hardware, thus enabling support over a wide range
of video products.
Graphic models can be overlaid in wire-frame or in solid-shaded
polygonal rendering, with varying levels of transparency to produce different
visual effects. <P>

The virtual reality calibration option implemented 
on TELEGRIP will provide 1) immediate benefits
to NASA for ground-controlled telerobotics servicing in space,
2) immediate benefits to the National DOE (Department of Energy) Labs
working on the disposal of nuclear waste, 3) significant enabling
technology for the decontamination and decommissioning of commercial
nuclear reactors, and 4) foreseeable applications in automotive, medical,
and servicing industries. <P>

This work is being performed partly by Won S. Kim of Caltech for NASA's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and partly by Robert G. Brown, Brian K. Christensen,
and  Chris Beale at Deneb Robotics, Inc., Auburn Hills, Michigan, through 
a JPL-Industry Technology Cooperative Agreement. <p>

<TITLE>DARTS: Dynamics Algorithms for Real-Time Simulation</TITLE>
 <P>
<STRONG>DARTS</STRONG> is a spacecraft dynamics
simulation package for real-time, hardware-in-the-loop simulations for
testing and verification of flight software and hardware. It runs on
embedded processors, special purpose vector-processing boards and can
also be used in work-station for off-line dynamics simulations for the
design and evaluation of control algorithms and software. Currently the
<STRONG>DARTS</STRONG> package is in use by the <A
HREF="http://tsunami.jpl.nasa.gov/~leem/rto-home/rto_home.html">Cassini</A> project and by the <A
HREF="http://atlas2/fst/home.html">Flight System Testbed</A>. On completion, the new
version of <STRONG>DARTS</STRONG> will be used by the <A
HREF="http:http://mpfwww/">Mars Pathfinder</A> and the <A
HREF="http://olivaw.jpl.nasa.gov/gll/phk/galileo_project.html">Galileo</A> projects as well.

<STRONG>DARTS</STRONG> can simulate the dynamics of
tree-topology, flexible multibody systems such as spacecraft, robots,
vehicles, molecular systems etc. <STRONG>DARTS</STRONG>
makes use of algorithms developed using the <A
HREF="~jain/www/soa.html">spatial operator algebra</A> framework for
multibody system dynamics. The <STRONG>DARTS</STRONG> S/C dynamics computational
engine has been integrated into the <A HREF="http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/dshell">Dshell</A> spacecraft simulation environment.

<TITLE>A Complaint About Many HTML Documents</TITLE>

</HEAD>

</BODY>

The following text is a copy of a form letter that I have been sending to
more and more authors of Web pages. Read it and you will see why I think
there is a problem.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LISTING>

I am writing to notify you of a misuse of HTML in your Web page which makes
that page virtually unreadable to some people, myself included. The error
relates to your use of a directive like

	<<CODE>body bgcolor=#ffffff</CODE>>
or
	<<CODE>body background=/bright-image.jpg</CODE>>

to override the default background color of the document. The problem with
these directives is that they assume that all users have light backgrounds with
dark letters on top. If, like me, they normally have a dark background with
light letters, then those foreground letters will likely be hard to see over
your chosen background color.

What to do? Must you give up designating a background color that you think
looks good? No. You need merely do more than just define the background that
you want. You must define all of the foreground colors as well. Look at this
example taken from the Alta Vista home page (http://www.altavista.digital.com/)
for a way to do it right:

	<<CODE>body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000ee"
		vlink="551a8b" alink="ff0000"</CODE>>

Here the following colors are defined:

	bgcolor	- background
	text	- normal text
	link	- link which has never been visited
	vlink	- link which has been visited
	alink	- link which is active (in the process of being visited)

If you will go to the effort to define all of these items instead of merely the
background, many more people will be able to read your Web page.

On the other hand, I would encourage you to consider refraining from doing any
overriding of user colors (background or foreground) unless you have a very
good reason. Those of us who have chosen to go to the effort to define our own
background and foreground colors for net browsing, have done so for very good
reasons. My own reason is that I find the bright backgrounds very hard on my
eyes. I cannot look at them for long periods of time without experiencing
increasing levels of discomfort and fatigue. So I am generally annoyed when the
author of a page has chosen to override my choices. In a very few cases there
are good reasons for this. These I don't mind. But in the vast majority of
cases the Web-page author is simply imposing his sense of aesthetics on me for
no good reason. Please exercise restraint in this matter.

Thank you.

<H1>EXPLORATION OF SMALL BODIES</H1>

<HR>

Of the 15 Discovery proposals submitted by JPL in 1994, six were 
destined for small bodies, and three included plans to obtain samples from 
the surfaces of those bodies. Landing and operation in the low 
gravity environments of small bodies is an extremely challenging problem
and requires technology development in a variety of areas to ensure these 
missions are a success. The Exploration 
of Small Bodies task is therefore focusing on developing the technologies 
enabling in-situ scientific studies of these interplanetary objects.  This
multi-year task will explore three key technology areas: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Surface and Subsurface Sampling - The gathering of surface and 
subsurface samples for scientific exploration will be an important
part of any mission.  Low mass/power mechanims for sample acquisition will 
be explored as well as concurrent development of sensors and control 
methods enabling autonomous operation in materials of unknown 
compositions.  <P>
<LI> Sample Manipulation - Once a sample is acquired, it must be delivered
to on-board science instruments for in-situ analysis.  Systems for sample
handling and sample preparation for a microgravity enviroment will therefore 
be developed.<P>
<LI> Landing and Anchoring - The low-gravity environment of small bodies
allows for free-fall and unpowered landing but requires ways of absorbing
impact engery as well as attaching the lander to the surface to react
sampling forces.  Passive energy absorbtion systems such as crushable 
materials will be explored as well as anchoring systems such as rocket
deployed spikes.<P>
</UL>

In FY '95 work began (under the Remote Scientist task) to develop 
and test sampling systems specific to comets to meet the technology 
needs of the JPL/CNES Champollion comet lander (ESA Rosetta mission).
The comet sampling system is required to gather several cm3 of material 
from up to a 
meter beneath a comet's surface and deliver that sample to multiple 
on-board instruments within an extremely challenging mass/power budget.
A prototype system is being developed which incorporates multiple sensors 
not only allowing
autonomous operation but also gathering data on material
properties as sampling is done.  A cryogenic test chamber is also being
assembled enabling testing of a prototype sampling system in cryogenic comet
facsimile materials of various densities.<P>

<H4> Mobile robot enables remote reconnaissance of hazardous material sites </H4>

HAZBOT III mobile robot <P>

<HR>

Enabling Safety and HAZMAT personnel to remotely and therefore safely explore dangerous terrestrial environments, particularly those where hazardous materials have been accidently released, is the primary objective of the Ground Emergency Response Vehicle Project.  Begun in October 1990, the project has succeeded in prototyping a teleoperated mobile robot used by the JPL Fire Department HAZMAT Team in four simulated reconnaissance missions.  The current robot, called HAZBOT III, is shown in the image above.  The project has also been very successful in publicizing the use of robotics in HAZMAT as well as establishing ties with US industry and successfully transferring technology. <P>

The use of robotic technology allows people to remotely explore and work in dangerous environments without risk of injury or death.  It is therefore understandable that the JPL Fire Department HAZMAT Team and Safety offices have been very supportive of the development of a tool enabling them to remotely explore areas where hazardous materials are involved.  The robot can provide vital information on spill location, magnitude, material type and concentration so a well prepared response team can safely enter the site. <P>

This project has been directed at emergency response missions where accidental spill or release of hazardous material must be addressed immediately to protect people located nearby.  This is of course important at JPL as well as all NASA centers where a variety of dangerous and toxic materials are used and stored.  Other applications include law enforcement, monitoring and remediation of EPA super fund sites, and nuclear plant decommissioning. <P>

The JPL HAZMAT Team members have been an integral part of the project from the beginning and are the end users of this robotic system under development.  During the first year of the project two REMOTEC ANDROS Mark V mobile robots were procured as a base to work from rather than trying to develop a system from scratch.  Testing and training with the HAZMAT Team led to a list of modifications and requirements to make the robot a useful tool for first entry/reconnaissance of hazardous material incident sites at JPL without risking team personnel. <P>

The last two and a half years have focused on implementing many of these modifications leading to the HAZBOT III system.  The main driver in the system redesign is to enable robot operation in potentially combustible atmospheres.  This required rebuilding the REMOTEC vehicle from the track drive up to enclose all electrical components in areas which can be positively pressurized.  As added protection all solid state electronics and brushless DC motors are used which under normal operations do not electrically arc providing a source of ignition.  This capability is extremely important in HAZMAT response since combustible materials are frequently encountered and a priori knowledge as to the presence or absence of combustibles may not be available to the incident commander.  Other modifications included the addition of a sophisticated on-board computer system to enable close-loop control of a new stiffer manipulator, incorporation of a chemical gas detector, development of specialized tools for unlocking and opening doors, and enhancement of the operator interface. <P>

The last demonstration mission, carried out in April of 1994, demonstrated the HAZBOT's readiness for field operations.  The demonstration required HAZMAT team members to respond to an incident without prior knowledge of the location or incident type.  The operator (who had never been inside the building before) was able to use HAZBOT to gain entrance to the building through a locked gate, locate the suspected hazard, and access the situation in less than an hour. <P>

Plans to further improve performace include additional modifications such as the implementation of an RF link replacing the tether and enabling behind closed door operations and more complex mission scenarios.  Continued field testing and demonstrations will be done to prove the system and efforts are being made to transfer technology developed in the project back to US industry. <P>

This work was done by Caltech for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  For further information see "Applying Robotics to HAZMAT," by R. Welch and G. Edmonds, Proceedings of the Forth National Technology Transfer Conference - NASA Technology 2003, Vol. 2, pp 279-287, Anaheim, CA, December 1993. <P>

HAZBOT operator control panels <P>

<HR>

The use of robotics in situations involving hazardous materials can significantly reduce the risk of human injury.  The Emergency Response Robotics Project is developing a teleoperated mobile robot allowing HAZMAT (hazardous materials) teams to remotely respond to incidents involving hazardous materials.  The current robot, called HAZBOT III, can assist in locating, characterizing, identifying, and mitigating hazardous material incidents without risking entry team personnel. <P>

Rather than developing a system from scratch, the project procured commercially available robots from REMOTEC (Oak Ridge, TN).  Training and experimentation by the JPL Fire Department HAZMAT Team with these commercial robots identified several modifications to improve performance.  One of the most important was the redesign of the operator control panel.  The control panel supplied with the system, shown in the bottom of the image above, used an array of simple toggle switches to actuate a joint in the robot manipulator.  For example, one switch was labeled elbow up/down.  This type of control was very difficult for the trainees to master because whether or not the elbow joint caused the forearm of the manipulator to move up or down was dependent on the current position or configuration of the manipulator.  This type of control therefore led to many mistakes during operation of the manipulator.  <P>

A new control panel was constructed that used a simple side view graphic of the robot with controls for each joint placed at the corresponding point of the drawing as shown in the top of the image above.  The toggle switches were replaced with spring loaded potentiometers; for instance, rotation of the elbow potentiometer clockwise caused the elbow joint to also rotate clockwise.  This system was found much more intuitive for the HAZMAT team personnel and led to far fewer mistakes during manipulation tasks.  The control panel redesign has been successfully transferred back to REMOTEC and is being used as a prototype for their new control panels.  We have kept REMOTEC up to date on other modifications to the system and are identifying what other technology can be transferred to REMOTEC for use in their commercial systems. <P>

<h4> 

The Supervisory Telerobotics (STELER) Laboratory provides a technology
development and demonstration site for telerobotics technology.  The
focus for the technology developed in the STELER lab is on
telerobotics architectures, supervised autonomy and autonomous
control, and on the development of complete integrated systems.  In
supervised autonomy, commands are generated at an operator control
station and sent for autonomous execution at a separate robot control
system.  <P>

Various component technologies have been developed and integrated to
support the application domains.  <A

<TITLE> A Generalized-Compliant-Motion Primitive </TITLE>
 
<H2> A Generalized-Compliant-Motion Primitive </H2>
<H4> A task primitive provides multi-sensor based control </H4>
<IMG SRC="images/gcmCrank.gif"></a> 
 
<H3>

A computer program that bridges the gap between planning and execution of 
compliant robotic motions has been developed and installed in the control 
system of a telerobot at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
The program, called the "generalized-compliant-motion primitive," is one 
of several task-execution-primitive computer programs, which receive 
commands from higher-level task-planning systems and execute those commands 
by generating the required trajectories and applying the appropriate 
control laws.
<P>

The program comprises four parts that correspond to nominal motion, 
compliant motion, ending motion, and monitoring, respectively. 
Nominal motion is motion of the robot along the specified trajectory. 
Compliant motion is perturbation of the nominal motion due to sensory inputs, 
e.g., force control, teleoperation, and joint and Cartesian space 
virtual forces. 
Ending motion begins at the end of nominal motion and continues during a 
specified time or until specified ending conditions (e.g., attainment 
of a desired position and contact force) are satisfied. 
Monitoring involves verifying that the commanded task or motion is 
being executed safely and stopping the motion if an anomalous condition 
(e.g., excessive contact force or motion beyond a limit position) is detected.
<P>

Commands from higher-level systems are received in the form of parameters: 
the generalized-compliant-motion-primitive computer program provides a 
rich set of such input parameters, which specify the details of a 
variety of compliant-motion tasks - for example, opening a door, 
turning a crank (see figure), seating and turning a bolt, pushing, 
sliding, leveling, and insertion or removal of a pin. 
The parameterization scheme provides for general compliant motion, 
nominal motion, force control, and sensing;
separate nominal-motion, compliant-motion, and sensor reference frames 
for control and safety monitoring; 
combined position and force control in all six degrees of freedom of the 
control reference frame; 
and testing for, and responses to, ending conditions.
<P>

The program implements a split-rate force-control technique. 
Force and torque data are read from a six-axis force sensor. 
Contact forces are computed by subtracting, from sensed forces, 
the contributions of the weight of the manipulated object in the given 
robot pose. 
The program is written in the C language, with utilities from the RCCL robot programming and control software system.

<TITLE> Dual-Arm Generalized Compliant Motion With Shared Control </TITLE>
 
<H2> Dual-Arm Generalized Compliant Motion With Shared Control </H2>
<H4> A unified control scheme provides for cooperative dual-arm tasks </H4>

<a href="images/dualBlockColorCrop.gif">*<IMG SRC="images/dualBlockColorBiglines.small.50.gif"></a> 
 
<H3>

The Dual-Arm Generalized Compliant Motion (DAGCM) 
primitive is a computer program that implements an improved
unified control scheme for two manipulator
arms cooperating in a task in which they both
grasp the same object.
The DAGCM primitive provides capabilities
for autonomous, teleoperation, and
shared control of two robot arms.
It unifies cooperative dual-arm control with multi-sensor-based
task control and makes the
complete task-control capability available to a higher-level task-planning
computer system via a large set of input parameters that are used
to describe the desired sensor-based and position trajectories to be 
followed by the manipulator arms.   <P>

Two or more arms holding an object can apply both forces that cause 
the object to move and forces that build up within the object 
but do not cause it to move:
the former are called ``external'' or ``move'' forces, while
the latter are called ``internal'' or ``squeeze'' forces.
The DAGCM primitive decomposes the forces sensed at the wrists of 
the two manipulators into
move and squeeze forces, which it then controls separately.
The desired contact interaction
between the held object and its environment
is specified via contact-force-control parameters in the move subspace;
the desired internal forces in the held object are specified via force-control
parameters in the squeeze subspace. <P>

The DAGCM primitive uses the generalized-compliant-motion concept to
control the motion of the held object on the basis of 
a specified trajectory of the object in
Cartesian coordinates, the control of the
move forces from the move/squeeze decomposition, and the outputs of
several sensors in addition to the force sensors on the wrists.
The sensors can be either real (e.g., force and torque sensors)
or virtual (e.g., a computed distance to collision).
Each sensor is provided an individual task space for control, and the
resulting motion commanded by each sensor is merged in the 
common coordinate frame
in which the actual position of the held object is measured. <P>

Various tasks have been performed in the laboratory using the primitive such as
orbital replacement unit manipulation, fluid coupler mating and 
capture of a spinning satellite. <P>

This work was done by Paul G. Backes of Caltech for NASA's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  A patent is pending.

The Modular Telerobot Task Execution System (MOTES) 
remote site telerobotics control system provides for 
supervised autonomy, shared control, and teleoperation control
of space robots.
MOTES is implemented in the
JPL Supervisory Telerobotics (STELER) laboratory initially
for control of a 7 degree of freedom redundant arm.
MOTES was developed as a prototype system for space telerobotics
applications and therefore its design addresses expected constraints 
of a flight system, e.g., it is implemented in the Ada programming
language and it provides data-driven execution.
<P>

MOTES was designed to provide maximum capability with minimized 
computational resources.  
Capability is maximized by providing
simultaneous control based upon various real and virtual sensors.
The permutations of the behaviors of the various
control modules provides the wide range of capabilities of the system.
The desired behavior of each module is specified via 
command parameters from the
local site which are issued by the remote site command interpreter.
The result of all the modules is the desired emergent command execution.
Monitors determine when to stop motion and the Dispatcher
transitions the system between commands, either to next
expected commands, or to reactive commands.
This approach provides a wide range of capability
without the need for reprogramming the remote control system.
<P>

The Communication Module handles communication with the local site system.
It places new commands into the Task Command Queue and returns status and data.
The Dispatcher Module controls the transition between execution states
by checking the
status of the various modules and specifying the appropriate commands
and parameters to the various modules via shared memory.
The Sensor Modules provide sensor data processing.
The Control Modules provide the control associated with the
various real and virtual motion sources.
Each Control module generates a task space motion command.
The Fusion Module merges the motion commands of the various
Control modules into task space motion commands for the manipulators
and other physical devices.
The Task to Joint Map Module maps the task space
command of the Fusion Module to the actuator space of the physical
devices.
The Device Drivers Modules communicate with the physical devices
to send the actuator space commands and receive status data.
The Monitor Modules provide monitoring of the status of execution
for both intended termination conditions and unintended error conditions.
<P>

The MOTES system has been used for various satellite servicing type
tasks in the laboratory such as grasping, door opening, and insertion
and removal operations.

<TITLE> System for Research on Multiple Arm Robots </TITLE>
 
<H2> System for Research on Multiple Arm Robots </H2>
<H4> A modular system provides flexibility for programming and control.  </H4>
<a href="images/KaliSystem.small.horiz.gif">*<IMG SRC="images/KaliSystem.small.80.horiz.gif"></a>
 
<H3>

The Kali system of computer software and equipment provides an environment 
for research on distributed control of coordinated-multiple-arm robots.  
The Kali system is suitable for 
telerobotics research involving sensing and execution of low level tasks.  
The software and the configuration of the hardware in Kali are designed to 
be flexible so that the system can be modified easily to test various 
concepts in the control and programming of robots, including multiple-arm 
control, redundant-arm control, shared control, traded control, 
force control, force/position hybrid control, 
the design and integration of sensors, teleoperation, task-space 
description and control, methods of adaptive control, control of 
flexible arms, and human factors.  
<P>

At the high level of the Kali system, 
a collection of functions in the C programming language enable the user to 
describe and implement coordinated motion of multiple manipulators.  
At the lower level of the Kali system, processes are distributed over 
multiple processors in a VMEbus hardware environment (see figure).  
<P>

The interface between the user and Kali is intended to provide a software 
environment in which the user can, as generally and easily as possible, 
describe a task that requires the motion of one or multiple coordinated arms.  
This is done by separating 
the description of the task from the specifics of the underlying 
mechanical system.  The user describes the task in task space; 
i.e., the motion and forces of a Cartesian frame along with task-space 
constraints. Underlying constraints on the mechanical system can be 
specified independently from a specific task and can be considered 
automatically by the Kali system, which removes the burden of the 
details of the underlying mechanical system from the user.  
<P>

The dynamical constraints of the underlying mechanical system are 
considered in the generation of trajectories.  The limitations on the 
loads that can be applied to a manipulator can be specified, and the Kali 
system determines a trajectory that does not require the arm to produce 
forces greater than the specified limits.  This requires the user to 
provide dynamical models of all manipulators and objects.  
<P>

An important feature of the Kali system is its modular functionality.  
Modularity simplifies the customization of software and hardware, 
resulting in a convenient environment for research or customization 
for a specific installation.  Such software modules as those devoted 
to the generation of trajectories and to servo control have defined 
functionalities that make it possible to replace them without altering 
other parts of the system.
<P>

The equipment was selected for simplicity of implementation, 
speed of computation, and compatibility with advancing processor technology.
The distributed overall design of the equipment in the Kali system 
provides for parallelization of computations, simplified integration of 
sensors, and modular functionality of hardware.

<TITLE> FLAT DOCKING TARGET</TITLE>

<H1> Flat Docking Target</H1>

<a href="images/flattarg.gif"><img src="images/flattarg_medium.gif"></a>

<h2>
Flat docking target provides a Space Station teleoperator with
a high resolution image for end-effector alignment with a grapple lug
at a much lower mass/volume than current targets.</h2>


<H3> A lenticular array of tiny lenses was designed and developed to
enable the fabrication of a very thin (1mm) flat target device which
still provides appropriate alignment cues to an operator when viewed
through an end effector mounted camera.  In order to provide a large
viewing angle, the micro lenslets are shaped spherically.  The design
implemented for this research activity generates an apparent
three-dimensional image from the whole array, with parallax in both x
and y planar directions so that the operator perceives relative
movement of the target pattern in all directions on approach.  The
prototype design uses a cross that is divided into three segments that
appear to be at different depths.  The inner portion of the cross
appears to be closest to the viewing surface.  The intermediate
segment appears to be slightly below the closest image.  The bottom
outer segment appears to be at the greatest distance from the top
image.  When viewed over the center of the target, normal to the
surface, the three segments line up to form a single cross.  As the
viewer moves off normal, the three portions appear to separate.<p>

The difference in depth between the bottom and intermediate segments
is fairly small, so that the relative motion is slight and only aids
coarse alignment as the end effector camera approaches the target.
The difference in depth between the intermediate and top segments is
relatively large, so that the relative motion is sizeable for fine
alignment.  The optical arrangement used to put the pattern on the
back of the lenslet array is a Fresnel lens with a 9-inch nominal
focal length and a 10-inch aperture.  The target is placed 13 inches
from the Fresnel lens when the photosensitive backing is ex- posed.
Multiple exposures for the three cross segments are made with a slit
allowing light from a uniform light source to pass.  The cross
projected onto the target was 1/16-inch thick.  The distances of the
slits from the Fresnel lens were 39, 29, and 27 inches respec- tively
causing the images to be nominally -1.11, .05, and .5 inches behind
the target.  In order to record the images on the back of the target,
they are first coated with Liquid Light, a commercially available
photographic emulsion and, after exposure, developed.  After
developing and drying, the back of the target is coated with Krylon
white enamel to protect the emulsion and produce a reflecting backing.

<TITLE>KSC LOCAL-REMOTE TELEROBOTIC INSPECTION</TITLE>

<H1>KSC Local-Remote Telerobotic Inspection</H1>

<H2> A telerobotic inspection of a PAM-D booster rocket was
implemented using JPL as the primary operator local site control
station and NASA, Kennedy Space Center as the remote site where the
robot inspection was executed</H1>

<a href="images/ksc-inspection.gif">
<IMG SRC="images/ksc-inspection_medium.gif"></a>

<H3>The local-remote telerobotic inspection of a PAM-D booster rocket
mounted in a Shuttle payload cradle was the first major demonstration
of precise autonomous control of a robot under substantial time delay.
With JPL acting as the Earth based local site, and KSC acting as the
on-orbit Space Station inspection site, the total communication time
delay was on the order of 2-3 seconds.  This demonstration was
considered the first major step towards developing the robot control
architecture that would enable safe, reliable servicing of Space
Station from the ground; therefore, saving a significant amount of
on-orbit EVA astronaut hours.

The payload cradle represented a realistic obstacle environment for
the robotic inspection system.  Three inspection sites were selected
to test the robot control and imaging system.  A 12ft ASEA IRB90 robot
arm stationed on a 30ft track was outfitted with a custom end-effector
composed of a set of Hitachi KP-140 stereo cameras mounted on a
horizontal fixture.  A uVax computer platform was used to grab,
compress images from the cameras, and forward robot motion commands to
the robot controller.  The KSC uVax was connected to the JPL uVax via
a commercial serial link.  The Symbolics operator workstation at JPL
was linked to the JPL uVax via a DECNET point-to-point
connection. Using a CAD model of the booster and Shuttle cradle, the
operator at JPL selected inspection sites for the robot end- effector
to reach by highlighting the position with a cursor.  An AI based path
planner was then executed to identify the optimal trajectory and robot
arm configuration to avoid hitting any part of the cradle or other
booster related components.  Once an appropriate trajectory was
determined, the robot end point and joint control parameters were
forwarded to the KSC robot 3000 miles away for execution.  Because of
the time delay, the AI path planner and simulator were essential to
insuring safe negotiation of obstacles.  Once the the robot reached
the correct site, images of the inspection site were sent back to the
JPL workstation.  Using a graphic overlay of the correct conponent
configuration over the stereo image, the operator was able to inspect
for damage or missing/disconnected components.  The joint KSC/JPL
robot teams were successful in executing the series of inspection
tasks without one collision incident.

<TITLE>The Social Aspects of ISRR'95</TITLE>
<BODY BACKGROUND = "pictures/personal/bkgnd.jpg">
<!-- Changed by: Paolo Fiorini,  6-Nov-1996 -->

<H4> After four days of hard work, the Participants to the 7th
International Symposium of Robotic Research relaxed with a refreshing
hike in the woods and a visit to an ancient monastery with annexed 
brewery. <BR><BR>

This short march made me think of a humouristic way to frame the
pictures of the Symposium good-bye party. The following is my
imaginary rendition of that event. <BR><BR> </H4>

<BR><BR>

<H1>The Cyberaedis </H1>
<BR><BR>

My few readers will forgive this daring attempt of summarizing
the long and strenuous quest undertaken by a group of Knights for
the Ideal Solution of the Robotic Revolution (ISRR, for short), which
would make all machines intelligent and all demos successful. <BR> <BR>

The History of Science tells us that Robotics was born just a few
years ago, in dark laboratories of technical universities. <BR><BR>

This is far from the truth.  <BR><BR>

The true birth of this Science was in fact on the sunny shores of a
city called Troy, where the Xanthus river meets its death in the
sea.<BR> <BR>

At that time, the war between the Achaian and the Trojan armies had
been fought for a long time, and knights and soldiers were tired and
eager for peace.  The king of Ithaca proposed then to build a machine
that would hide in its inside a group of warriors, and that would take
them into the inaccessible Troy. <BR><BR>

His engineering team devised a machine that looked like a horse. 
It would have walked from the shores to the City walls, and the Trojans
would have worshiped it as a god. <BR><BR>

It was a difficult project, since the technology was not quite there,
and the first demo to the Achaian management failed. <BR><BR>

We all know what followed, that the horse was built on wheels and that
the war was over. But history does not tell us what happened to
the engineering team after the project was cancelled. <BR><BR>

They took the sea on a boat in search of virtue, knowledge and
technologies that would fix their demo, the mythical ISRR the Delphic
Oracle had told them about. They are still sailing the high seas,
coming to shore only during fall, when the fog is dense and only few
can see them. <BR><BR>

This is the true account of their last sighting, on the German shores 
of the Alps. <BR><BR><BR>


<H4> Liber 7th: The Herrshing Castle </H4>

Finally the Ocean was over and the Knights saw the <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic1.gif"> promised land </a>. The morning was
foggy and the view not clear, but the ambiguous words of the Oracle
were crisp: reach the shore where the <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic2.gif" > castle </a> of all mechanisms is
guarding the waters. <BR><BR>

Off they went to the land, the castle <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic3.gif"> overlooking </a> their shoulders. No
turning back was in their mind, although they were sure of the dangers
expecting them. <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic4.gif"> Monsters </a>
blocked their way. Knights fell and were <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic5.gif"> tortured </a>. Four days lasted the
battle, and finally the castle yielded to them. It was a time to
celebrate. <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic6.gif"> Music </a> and <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic7.gif"> dances </a> filled the night, sure as
they were that the quest for the mythical ISRR was over. <BR><BR>

The battle was successful, but not enough technology was found. The
Oracle did not say that this castle was the end of the quest. Disappointment
overcome the knights. <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic75.gif"> Alcohol
</a> started flowing in their <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic8.gif">
midst </a> and <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic9.gif"> music </a> was
hiding their sorrow. Frustration they discharged among themselves with
last blood fights. Bare handed they <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic10.gif"> attacked </a> each other, deadly
weapons they pulled in resounding <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic11.gif">
duels </a>.<BR><BR>

Food was <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic12.gif"> scarce </a>, hunger and
thirst were showing on their <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic13.gif"> faces
</a>.  But, finally, a new hope lighted their <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic14.gif"> eyes </a>: for sure  next place
would yield all the necessary technology, for sure they would fight their
last battle!  At that, all the Knights stood up <a
href="pictures/isrr95/pic15.gif"> cheering </a> the new adventure.  Out they
went, one last <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic16.gif"> look </a> at this
land, and off they <a href="pictures/isrr95/pic17.gif"> marched
</a> to their quest.
