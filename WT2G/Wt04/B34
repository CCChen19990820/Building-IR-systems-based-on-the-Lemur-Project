			<P>Part research lab, part hospital and part university
			campus, The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry has facilities
			for psychiatric research, education, diagnosis and
			treatment. Operating as a hospital and resource centre for
			clinicians, educators and investigators in the mental health
			field, all of The Clarke's activities are directed to the
			conjoint aims of advancing knowledge and caring for
			patients. The Clarke operates as a public hospital with its
			own Board of Trustees and, although funded by the Ontario
			Ministry of Health, it is not part of the Ontario
			psychiatric hospital system.</P>
			
			<P>The Clarke is named in honour of <A
			HREF="history.html">Dr. Charles Kirk Clarke</A>, the first
			professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto and
			often considered the father of Canadian psychiatry. His
			efforts led to the opening of the first psychiatric
			out-patient clinic in Toronto in 1909, and eventually to the
			founding of the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital, The Clarke's
			predecessor, in 1925, one year after Dr. Clarke's death.</P>
			
			<P>Specializing in the development of new and innovative
			treatment approaches, The Clarke plans and provides programs
			with the highest level of academic an dclinical standards,
			and with a sensitivity to the needs of the province.</P>
			
			<P>The Clarke's basic treatment approach includes a full
			program of psychiatric rehabilitation. A Continuing Care
			Division for the chronically disabled matches treatment to
			each stage of the illness. A Day Centre provides a variety
			of skill training programs for patients living at home,
			while an innovative home treatment program uses home visits
			as an alternative to hospital admissions.</P>
			
			<P>The <A HREF="forensic_division.html">Forensic
			Division</A> at The Clarke conducts research and treatment
			for problems of sexual violence and impulse control, and
			also operates the <A
			HREF="forensic_division.html#metfors">Metropolitan Toronto
			Forensic Service (METFORS.)</A></P>
			
			<P>For children, The Clarke operates a <A
			HREF="../about_services/child_and_family_studies.html">Child
			and Family Studies Centre</A>. A day treatment program for
			children includes schooling and supportive therapies. A
			separate facility on Yonge Street, the Family Court Clinic,
			provides care and counselling for children of divorce,
			abused children and young offenders.</P>
			
			<P>The Institute also operates a range of outpatient and
			inpatient services. These include a <A
			HREF="../about_services/mood_and_anxiety.html#mood_disorders_inpatient">Mood
			Disorders program</A>, specialty clinics for anxiety
			disorders, cognitive therapy, deafness, speech pathology,
			assessment, and an Emergency Department and Crisis Unit.</P>
			
			<P>These services represent only a portiion of the
			activities at The Clarke; others include a cross-cultural
			psychiatry training program, consulting services on Baffin
			Island on the mental health of native people, programs in
			culture, community and health, and research into the
			biochemical molecular and neuroendocrinological bases of
			psychiatric illness. A new Positron Emission Tomography
			Facility provides sophisticated new brain imaging
			technology.</P>
			
			<P>Its close ties with the University of Toronto permit The
			Clarke to provide undergraduate and graduate medical
			education, and training of students in seven other health
			disciplines. As research is a primary mandate of the
			Institute, research activities occur throughout The
			Clarke.</P>
			
			<P><A HREF="travel.html">Located on College Street</A> close
			to downtown Toronto, The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry
			provides, promotes and enhances psychiatric research,
			education,, and clinical care as mutually enhancing
			activities. Serving as a centre of expertise and learning,
			The Clarke continues to be a provincial resource striving to
			provide leadership to investigators, educators and
			clinicians in the mental health field.</P>

			<TD><P>The Occupational Therapy Department provides services
			that promote, maintain, or restore occupational performance
			in the areas of self-care, productivity, leisure and
			recreation. Intervention may include individual and group
			sessions with clients seen as inpatients, outpatients and
			within the community. Occupational and Recreation Therapists
			work with clients to assess their functional abilities, plan
			programs, provide intervention, coordinate discharge plans,
			arrange follow-up and evaluate programs.</P>
			
			<P>The Department of Occupational Therapy includes: nine
			staff occupational therapists; four senior occupational
			therapists in the areas of clinical practice, research,
			education, and a senior who is the clinical associate to the
			University of Toronto; two recreation therapists; the head
			of the department; and a departmental secretary.</P>
			
			<P>Occupational Therapy Department staff work as active
			members of the multidisciplinary team and as consultants
			within and outside the Institute. The Occupational Therapy
			Department is decentralized and department members provide
			services to the Mood and Anxiety Division, the Child and
			Family Studies Centre, the Schizophrenia Division, Forensic
			Services, the General Psychiatry Division, and Society,
			Women and Health.</P>
			
			<P>The Occupational Therapy Department provides educational
			opportunities for students, staff and those in the
			community. The department, which is an accredited teaching
			facility for the Canadian Association of Occupational
			Therapists and the University of Toronto, provides over
			thirty student fieldwork placements each year. Eleven
			occupational therapists hold cross appointments in the
			Department of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine,
			University of Toronto and three therapists have
			cross-appointments in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty
			of Medicine, University of Toronto. The department also
			serves as a training facility for recreation therapy
			students.</P>
			
			<P>Members of the department contribute to the community by
			conducting lectures, teaching, and participating on
			committees. Each year the department plans and organizes a
			national conference. In addition, all staff participate in a
			program of staff development and continuing education.
			Currently, six members of the department hold Masters
			degrees, three therapist's are pursing graduate studies, and
			one therapist is working towards her Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>Department members are actively involved in research
			within the department and in their individual programs,
			collaborating with other members of the Occupational Therapy
			Department and with staff from other disciplines. Currently
			there are several internally and externally funded research
			projects underway exploring issues ranging from the
			development of a quality of life instrument for individuals
			with schizophrenia, to exploring the opportunities for
			activity in the community for persons with mental illnesses,
			to examining occupational competence in children with
			developmental coordination disorders. Our research goal is
			to conduct and participate in research activities aimed at
			serving the needs of those individuals whose occupational
			performance is impaired.</P>

			<TD><P>The Mood and Anxiety Division at the Clarke Institute
			contains a series of multidisciplinary clinical, research
			and educational programs. The Division Head is Sid Kennedy,
			MD, and the Senior Research Consultant and Vice President of
			Research at the Clarke Institute is Franco Vaccarino, PhD.
			Clinics with clinic heads are as follows: Psychobiology and
			Clinical Trials in Anxiety Disorders (Jacques Bradwejn, MD);
			Anxiety Disorders Clinic (Richard Swinson, MD); Bipolar
			Clinic (Sagar Parikh, MD); Depression Clinic (Robert
			Levitan, MD); Mood and Anxiety Inpatient Unit (Gary Hasey,
			MD); Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Unit (Zindel Segal,
			PhD).</P>
			
			<P>A Medical Research Council of Canada funded group grant
			to study CCK specificity in anxiety disorders is directed by
			Drs. Bradwejn, Vaccarino and Kennedy. This pre-clinical and
			clinical program is in collaboration with McGill and
			University of Alberta at Edmonton and has pre-clinical,
			molecular biology, genetic and clinical components. The
			Anxiety Disorder Clinic offers assessment and specialized
			treatment in obsessive compulsive disorder with a behaviour
			and pharmacological perspective. Additional research in
			social phobia, specific phobia and panic disorder is
			underway.</P>
			
			<P>The Bipolar Clinic focuses on assessment and treatment
			optimization for bipolar patients and develops a close
			community link with family practitioners and psychiatrists.
			Psychosocial and educational components of treatment for
			bipolar patients are emphasized and research in genetics and
			molecular biology continues.</P>
			
			<P>The Depression Clinic assesses approximately 800 new
			patients annually and operates a clinical research program
			for the study of depression during acute and continuation
			treatment. Using functional brain imaging, the regions of
			abnormality and sites and timing of changes during
			antidepressant treatment are foci of current research. In
			addition, serotonergic mechanisms in response to
			serotonergically mediated pharmacological challenges are
			being evaluated using PET scanning. Dysregulation of the
			hypothylamic pituitary adrenal axis in relation to reverse
			neurovegetative symptoms, seasonality and the overlap
			between mood and eating disorders is an additional area of
			study as is the phenomenology of depression and its
			relationship to personality measures.</P>
			
			<P>The Mood and Anxiety Inpatient Unit has established an
			ECT research unit and a clinical research inpatient unit
			which focuses on the assessment and treatment of refractory
			depression.</P>

			<TD><P>Psychology is often defined as the scientific study
			of behavior. Psychologists at the Institute have been
			involved in delivering care, training mental health
			professionals and carrying out research since The Clarke was
			founded.</P>
			
			<P>The Department of Psychology includes 20 psychologists, 5
			psychological associates/psychometrists, 3 C.P.A./A.P.A.
			interns, and a secretary. Psychology staff work in programs
			in the six clinical Divisions of the Institute. In addition,
			there are 6 psychologists in the Research Division.</P>
			
			<P>Psychology staff generally work in multidisciplinary
			teams where they carry out assessment and therapy. Most
			clinical research is carried out in the context of the
			delivery of clinical service.</P>
			
			<P>The Department functions as a major training site for
			clinical psychology students as well as a significant
			resource for training in research. The <A
			HREF="../about_education/internships.html">Internship
			Training Program</A> is accredited by the Canadian
			Psychological Association and the American Psychological
			Association and each year has three salaried intern
			positions. In addition, approximately 25 <A
			HREF="../about_education/practicums.html">practicum
			students</A> receive training each academic year.
			Psychologists at the Institute hold appointments in the
			Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto and
			many are cross-appointed to the Department of Psychology at
			the University of Toronto, York University or the University
			of Waterloo.</P>

			<P>Psychology takes a biopsychosocial approach to research
			in mental illness. Psychologists participate as principal
			investigators and collaborators in a wide variety of
			research studies seeking to improve our understanding of how
			mental health problems develop and how we can intervene
			effectively.Over the past few years, psychology staff have
			received grants from most major granting bodies in Canada
			and some from the United States. This research productivity
			has resulted in widespread publication of their work in
			professional journals. Information about these publications
			can be found in the section on <A
			HREF="../about_research/index.html">Research at The
			Clarke</A>.</P>

<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="aohcgifs/centres.gif" WIDTH=459 HEIGHT=87 ALT="[Health Centres: CHCs
& HSOs]"></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres' membership is made up of <STRONG>Community
Health Centres</STRONG> and <STRONG>Health Service Organizations</STRONG>.  This page
describes these organizations in more detail.
<P>
<H2>Community Health Centres (CHCs)</H2>
Community Health Centres are non-profit, community-based organizations that provide
primary health care and health promotion services, using multidisciplinary teams of
health providers -- which often include physicians, nurse practitioners, dietitians,
health promoters, counsellors and others -- that are paid by salary rather than through
a fee-for-service system.  Services are designed to meet the specific needs of a
defined community.  In addition, CHCs provide a variety of health promotion and illness
prevention services which focus on raising awareness of the broader determinants of
health such as employment, education, environment, isolation and poverty.  CHCs have
been in existence in Canada since the 1920's; today, there are over 300 CHCs across
Canada.
<P>
In many communities, CHCs provide their programs and services for those people who have
difficulties accessing a full range of appropriate primary health care services.  Some
examples of priority groups are members of linguistic or cultural groups, individuals
who live in remote underserviced communities, individuals with low incomes, and the
elderly.
<P>
The unique and distinguishing features of CHCs are best explained in our article
entitled <A HREF="happen.html">We Make It Happen!</A>.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>Health Service Organizations (HSOs)</H2>
Health Service Organizations represent another innovative approach to the delivery of
high quality, cost-effective primary care in Ontario.  Like CHCs, they operate outside
the traditional fee-for-service payment system, but unlike CHCs, their primary health
care services are funded primarily on a capitation (rather than salary) basis.  Under
capitation, an HSO receives a set amount of Ministry of Health funding each month for
every patient on its roster.  As long as rostered patients do not go outside the HSO
for services that the HSO is expected to provide, the full amount is paid without any
deduction or negation.
<P>
More information on HSOs is provided by the Ontario Ministry of Health's Community
Health Branch:
<P>
<H3>"Objective</H3>
<P>
The Health Service Organization (HSO) Program's objectives are to:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>create an environment which is supportive of physicians and other health care
personnel and which allows flexibility in responding to the health care needs of the
population served;
<P>
<LI>develop a co-ordinated system of health care delivery which makes the most
appropriate use of health care resources and which is accessible, efficient and
economical;
<P>
<LI>provide special attention to health maintenance and illness prevention measures
which will enhance the health status of the population served;
<P>
<LI>decrease institutional health care by giving emphasis to ambulatory care, self care
and home care.
</OL>
<P>
These objectives are promoted by funding HSOs to provide primary health care services
on a capitation basis rather than the traditional fee-for-service method of payment.
<P>
<H3>Program Size</H3>
<P>
Currently, there are 71 physician sponsored HSOs and 6 non-profit HSOs.  Presently over
300 physicians are engaged in the HSO Program serving a population of approximately
440,000 enroled patients.
<P>
<H3>Models</H3>
<P>
There are three HSO models:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Physician-Sponsored Model</STRONG> - 71 HSOs are capitated practices owned
and operated by phsicians.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Community Board Model</STRONG> - 2 HSOs are sponsored by non-profit
corporations.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>University Model</STRONG> - 4 HSOs are sponsored by health science centres.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
<P>
HSOs are funded on the basis of a blended funding arrangement which includes capitation
payments for general practice, fee-for-service for designated medical specialty
services, program grants and chargebacks.  A chargeback or negation occurs if a roster
member of the HSO receives services from a non-HSO general practice physician.  The HSO
is charged 50% of the amount billed to OHIP by the non-HSO physician.
<P>
Under the terms of the contract, HSOs may also bill OHIP up to $30,000 per year in
fee-for-service charges per full time equivalent physician sponsor.
<P>
Funding rates for physician-sponsored HSOs are negotiated with the Ontario Medical
Association.  Funding rates for community board and health science centre sponsored
HSOs are negotiated with the governance of the HSO."

<CENTER><H2>COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES:</H2>
<H1>WE MAKE IT HAPPEN!</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
This paper is about two things.  First it is about community health centres (CHCs): 
who we are, what we believe, and how we do what we do.  Second, it is about where
CHCs fit in as a key element in Ontario's efforts to reform our health system.  
<P>
We hope that members of the general public, politicians, government officials, staff
and members of other health agencies and institutions will find this information
helpful in understanding CHCs and how we can be used as a vehicle for reforming
Ontario's health system. 
<P>
In many respects, we think our approach is ahead of its time.  For years we seemed
almost alone in our commitment to a more holistic approach to individual and
community health.  More recently it seems that leaders in the health system and
government fundamentally agree with our vision and would like to see it implemented
more broadly.  
<P>
<BR>
<H3>II. 	CHCs:  WHO WE ARE</H3>
<P>
Ontario's first community health centres got started in the 1960s and began to
receive funding from the Ministry of Health in the early 1970s.  The CHC movement
received a strong boost in 1972, when the Hastings Report endorsed CHCs as a good
model for primary care and health promotion.  By the mid-1970s, a pilot CHC Program
was set up at the Ministry to support the 10 urban health centres then in existence. 
Today the Community Health Centre Program is an established, full-fledged program at
the Ministry. 
<P>
CHCs are quite diverse depending on the populations we serve and the priorities of
our respective communities, but we share a common philosophy expressed by the
following fundamental principles:
<P>
<H4>   A. We are committed to providing accessible services.</H4>
<P>
CHCs make special efforts to serve individuals who have a higher risk of ill health
or have difficulty gaining access to appropriate health care due to linguistic or
cultural barriers, physical disabilities, poverty, isolation, or other special needs.
<P>
<H4>   B. We are committed to the empowerment of individuals and communities.</H4>
<P>
CHCs encourage clients to take charge of their own health by providing them with
accurate, easy to understand information so they can make healthy choices.  CHCs are
active in community development projects and social action initiatives. Every CHC
involves its clients directly in the centre's planning and operations -- as program
volunteers or as members of the elected board of directors.  
<P>
<H4>   C. We are committed to wellness and illness prevention.</H4>
<P>
CHCs promote good health and prevent illness in a variety of ways. In addition to
primary care, our health promoters, health advocates and community educators help
clients -- both individually and in groups -- learn to identify their own health
needs and resources.  This results in individual and communities taking
responsibility for their own health.
<P>
<H4>   D. We are committed to comprehensive care.</H4>
<P>
CHCs consider the needs of the whole person in our programs and services. We take
into account the physical, social, emotional, and financial needs of our clients
because health is affected by all of these aspects of living.   CHCs are able to do
this through a multi-disciplinary team of professionals.  Having staff from different
disciplines working closely under one roof helps in coordinating the services needed
by clients. The CHC team usually includes nurses, doctors, chiropodists, social
workers, nutritionists, health educators and community developers. By working
together with clients, the team is able to better respond to the needs of the the
clients.  We also take time to know about other community resources so we can help
people find the most appropriate source of service.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>III. 	HOW  ARE CHCS DIFFERENT FROM MEDICAL CLINICS?</H3>
<P>
Community health centres are truly consumer-centred.  In fact, new centres can only
be established through the direct participation of the local community -- who are
directly involved in establishing the need for a CHC in a particular area.  This
usually involves the members of the community and other individuals working together
in developing a plan that must show not only the health needs of the community but
also the programs and services that can respond to those needs. The close involvement
of the community in the activities of the CHC is key to its ability to readily adapt
and respond to the community's health needs.  
<P>
CHCs are also unique in that all of our staff are on salary -- including our
physicians.  Having all CHC staff on salary reinforces the multi-disciplinary team
approach to providing health services.  This practice ensures an equitable approach
to staff remuneration and at the same time recognizes the salary levels appropriate
to each health profession. The absence of a "piece work" approach to remuneration
allows CHC staff to give the time needed, as appropriate, by their clients.  As a
result, clients are able to gain a better understanding of their health status and of
ways to improve it.  A recent study of CHCs in Ontario finds a high degree of
enthusiasm among our consumers. Clients typically see CHC staff as warm, caring, and
non-judgemental and they particularly appreciate being given enough time to discuss
and understand the issue or problem that brought them to the centre in the first
place.  The skill and commitment of staff is recognized and highly valued by
consumers.
<P>
Funding for CHCs is program-based rather than volume driven.  Our cost to the system
is predictable and we are accountable for our expenditures.  This method of funding
has also given us the flexibility to offer our clients a range of innovative
services.  CHCs have the freedom to seek funding from sources other than the Ministry
of Health, allowing us to access other resources to address the broad determinants of
health.  For example, some CHCs receive funding from the Ministry of Community and
Social Services, the Ministry Housing and the Ministry of Labour for specific
projects and programs.  
<P>
<BR>
<A NAME="map"><H3>IV. 	WHERE ARE WE?</H3></A>
<P>
Today Ontario has fifty-six CHCs and plans for expansion are pending.  The following 
map shows where we are:

<H3>V. 	HEALTH REFORM -- A SHIFT TO COMMUNITY HEALTH </H3>
<P>
In 1991, the Premier's Council on Health, Well-Being, and Social Justice used
evidence gained from more than a decade of studies to create a new vision of health
for the province.  This vision emphasizes the need to prevent illness and promote
health by recognizing that peace, shelter, safety, a clean environment, education,
nutritious food, decent jobs, and social supports have major and positive influences
on personal health and on the health of our communities.
<P>
To achieve this vision, the Council proposed the following five goals -- which the
government adopted as official policy in 1992:  
 <P>
<UL><LI>Shift the emphasis to health promotion and disease prevention;
<LI>Foster strong and supportive families and communities;
<LI>Ensure a safe and high quality physical environment;
<LI>Increase the number of years of good health for the citizens of Ontario by
reducing illness, disability and premature death; and,
<LI>Provide accessible, affordable, appropriate health services for all. 
</UL>
<P>
These goals are being used to guide the Ministry of Health's reform agenda. 
Government has clearly stated that that the reform of our health system will require
a shift from the present system which is based on doctors and hospitals to one
wherein a mix of health providers work in the community and well as institutional
settings, with a strong emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention.  
<P>
In such a system, quality will be measured in terms of "health outcomes."  These
outcomes include: the clinical effectiveness of services; customer satisfaction; and,
perhaps most importantly, improvements in the overall health of the population.
<P>
Sensitivity to gender, culture and race, and responsiveness to the needs of special
populations are important measures of how good our system is.  Equally important is
the system's ability to address determinants of health such as literacy, housing,
poverty and violence.
<P>
Those who are familiar with Ontario's community health centres already know how well
the Ministry's health goals and reform objectives fit with our overall philosophy and
approach to service delivery.  We have a long history and a good track record. 
That's why we believe CHCs are ideal vehicles for actualizing the health reform
agenda at the local level.
<P>
Community health centres provide a range of health promotion services and strategies
which respond to needs identified by the communities we serve.  Clinical care is
complemented by counseling services, health education, community development, social
action and advocacy.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>VI. 	CHCs: A VEHICLE FOR HEALTH SYSTEM REFORM</H3>
<P>
In recent years, ideas about health have changed a great deal.  Numerous reports and
studies -- from the Lalonde Report in 1974 to those conducted during the 1980s,
(Evans, Podborski and Spasoff etc.) -- have helped us see that good health depends on
a wide range of factors.  Health services, and in particular, illness treatment
services, are only one of many influences that determine how healthy we are. Research
also suggests that there is room to improve the quality and appropriateness of our
health services.  In particular, efforts must be made to ensure that services are
delivered by the right person, in the right place, at the right time, in a
cost-efficient manner.
<P>
In light of this evidence, there is a growing consensus that Ontario's health system
must create a better balance between illness treatment and health promotion; and,
between institution and community-based services.  
<P>
The challenge of creating a better balance in the health system is what health reform
is all about. Health reform realizes a vision of health that CHCs have been
implementing for years.  CHCs have an established track record as organizations whose
holistic vision of health promotes a more balanced approach in service delivery.  
<P>
For example: 
<P>
<UL><LI>Our multi-disciplinary teams make it possible to achieve a better balance of
professionals and improves our ability to respond to the various determinants of
health;
<LI>Our commitment to providing a comprehensive range of services ensures that
clients have access to a broad range of health and social services;
<LI>The programs and priorities of each centre reflect the unique needs identified by
the community it serves;
<LI>Our centres emphasize health promotion and consumer participation in our programs
through a range of mechanisms; 
<LI>CHCs focus on the determinants of health through community development and social
action initiatives aimed at addressing the underlying causes and risk conditions that
lead to ill health; and,
<LI>CHCs promote equity by seeking to remove barriers that prevent some groups from
gaining access to service, and by helping the community achieve its full health
potential.
</UL>
<P>
As well as providing traditional treatment services, CHCs combine health and social
services at the local level and work together with our communities to strengthen
factors that promote good health.  Our clients are involved directly in the design
and delivery of high quality programs and services.
<P>
The versatility of our centres makes it easy to test new ideas in health service
delivery and social innovation which allows us to quickly adapt to the changing needs
of our communities.  We have a lot to share about our experiences and a lot to
contribute to the reform process.  
<P>
<BR>
<H3>VII. 	CONCLUSION</H3>
<P>
We hope this description has helped you understand more about how we translate our
philosophy and beliefs into action.  Community Health Centres have proven to be
excellent vehicles for innovative and effective health service delivery.  We
demonstrate how the ideas on health reform can be put into action and how our
approach is consistent with the health goals of Ontario.  
<P>
Over the years we have demonstrated our effectiveness in providing services which
meet the needs of our communities and we have the strong support of our clients.  In
short, we have a proven track record and a base of experience which should be built
upon.  
<P>
The Ministry of Health has recognized our potential in its recently completed reports
on the Strategic Planning and Evaluation Project of the CHC Program and urge the
government to support the recommendations in these reports. With our considerable
experience, we welcome the opportunity to assume a greater role in the reform of
Ontario's health system.

<H2>The Factors that Affect Health</H2>
<P>
What determines your health?  What determines the health of a community?  With our
current health system's focus on the treatment of illness, it is easy to overlook the
very real effect that other factors have on our health, factors outside the realm of
doctors and hospitals and prescriptions.  Sure, most people will acknowledge that
regular exercise and good eating will contribute to a person's well-being, but how
often are other factors commonly recognized as real <STRONG>determinants of
health</STRONG>?  For the growing number of people interested in health promotion and
illness prevention, the answer is definitely not often enough.
<P>
Evidence continues to mount that shows how directly health is affected by many
different things in our lives.  Some examples from the 1990 Ontario Health Survey:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unemployed Ontarians suffer more stress, anxiety, and poor health than those with
jobs.
<P>
<LI>Among Ontarians having post-secondary education, 70% say their health is very good
or excellent, as compared with only 48% of Ontarians having primary education.
<P>
<LI>Nearly one in four recipients of social assistance (24%) classify their health as
fair or poor, compared with fewer than one in ten Ontarians earning a salary.
<P>
<LI>Ontarians who "hardly ever" feel loved and appreciated are three times as likely
as people who feel loved and appreciated "most of the time" to describe their health
as fair or poor.
<P>
<LI>People with high levels of workplace stress are more likely to miss work due to
illness.
</UL>
<P>
While it may be difficult to make a definitive list of every factor that affects
well-being, the following are generally recognized as broader determinants of health:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=40%>
<UL>
<STRONG><LI>Employment
<LI>Education
<LI>Environment
<LI>Income
<LI>Shelter</STRONG>
</UL>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=60%>
<UL>
<STRONG><LI>Food
<LI>Social justice and equity
<LI>Family, friends and social supports
<LI>Peace and safety
<LI>Culture and race relations</STRONG>
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Other factors such as <STRONG>language</STRONG>, <STRONG>learning</STRONG>,
<STRONG>meaningful work</STRONG>, <STRONG>literacy</STRONG>, <STRONG>recreation
programs</STRONG>, <STRONG>self-esteem</STRONG>, and <STRONG>personal control</STRONG>
are also often mentioned as contributors to well-being.
<P>
Recognition of these broader determinants of health is essential if efforts to improve
community and individual health are ever to be successful.  Poor health is both an
individual and a collective problem, and to problem-solve effectively it is necessary
to look behind the symptoms and the illnesses in our communities, to try and
understand, and wherever possible address, the underlying causes and contributing
factors that result in poor health.  
<P>
What does this mean on a practical level?  In a given community, it may mean
organizing a neighbourhood meeting about a nearby PCB storage facility, or scheduling
community cooking classes, or offering mediation or translation or child care
services.  In a given workplace, it may mean providing time for continuous learning,
or organizing teams to identify and reduce workplace stress.  In a given health
system, it may mean shifting resources from treatment to prevention, from institutions
to community groups, from a narrow to a broader definition of health.  And so on.

<H2>AOHC's PSA Campaign on the Determinants of Health</H2>
In 1995 the Association of Ontario Health Centres began a public awareness campaign
aimed at popularizing the "determinants of health" concept. Focusing on four basic
determinants, AOHC created posters, buttons, and public service announcements for
television and radio that carried the messages <STRONG>"Education Determines Health" 
"Poverty Determines Health"  "Employment Determines Health" and "Isolation Determines
Health"</STRONG>.
<P>
Response from the Ontario public and media has been very encouraging.  Many television
and radio stations have generously donated broadcast time to air the PSAs, and many
individuals and organizations have purchased the posters and buttons.  Interest in the
campaign has also extended to other provinces across the country.
<P>

<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="aohcgifs/greenbook.gif" WIDTH=459 HEIGHT=87 ALT="[CHC Health
Promotion Programs]"></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
One of CHCs' key contributions to the communities of Ontario is in the work done to
promote health and to prevent illness.  True, CHCs all have a team of health
professionals who provide immediate primary care and treatment where required, but
promoting healthy living in all its aspects is considered by CHCs to be an equally
important part of their daily activities.
<P>
To this end, CHCs offer a wide variety of <STRONG>health promotion programs</STRONG>
to the members of their communities.  At last count, there were well over 400
different programs offered by the province's 56 CHCs: programs for children, parents,
women, men and seniors, programs on nutrition, self-esteem, grieving, smoking
cessation, back exercise, breast health awareness, entrepreneurship, racial harmony,
teen pregnancy, stress management, and literally hundreds of other health-related
topics.  In offering such a wide array of choices, CHCs acknowledge that individual
health and community health are directly affected by many broader <A
HREF="determinant.html">determinants</A>, from employment and poverty to environment
and housing.
<P>
For several years, the Association of Ontario Health Centres has published a
<STRONG>Green Book</STRONG> listing and describing all health promotion programs
offered by Ontario CHCs.  What started as a fairly modest listing grew over the years
to become, in 1995, a 450 page book!
<P>
<BR>
<H2>1996 Green Book Diskettes Now Available!</H2>
<P>
For the 1996 version, the AOHC has compiled the Green Book information in a
database (FileMaker Pro) format, and the data is available for purchase on diskette
either as a word processor file (Mac or PC) or as a comma-separated text file (for
importing into your own database).  Please <A HREF="home.html#contact">contact the
AOHC</A> for more information on pricing and availability.  
<P>
Eventually, we hope to have a searchable on-line version of the Green Book at this WWW
site.  However, this will depend upon funding and resource availability.  (Donations
of FileMaker Pro CGI's gratefully accepted!)
<P>
For more information on health promotion programs in your area, contact the CHC
nearest to you.  See our <A HREF="memberlist.html">mailing list</A> and our <A
HREF="happen.html#map">map</A> for locations.

<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="aohcgifs/papers.gif" WIDTH=459 HEIGHT=87 ALT="[AOHC Position
Papers]"></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
As the organization representing community health centres in Ontario, the Association
of Ontario Health Centres makes regular contributions to provincial and national
discussions on health and health reform.  Most often, these contributions take the
form of position papers that are researched, written and distributed by AOHC staff in
collaboration with AOHC's Board and Committees.  A survey of the papers produced in
the past few years reveals a wide range of health-related issues to which AOHC has
contributed a voice from the community:
<P>
<H2>Released in 1996</H2>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="pp96prebudget.html">AOHC Submission ... (on) Annual Pre-Budget
Consultations</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Conclusion: "The AOHC is convinced that health reform can only
be achieved if there is accord between health and financial policies.   Lack of
congruence between these areas will inevitably result in barriers which will
jeopardize the emergence of a truly reformed health care system.  To ensure that the
health care budget changes the status quo, the process must be within a multi-year
context such as that laid out for the reductions in hospital transfers.  This allows
for an incremental, predictable approach to both health and financial policy setting
which is essential in meeting Ontario's health goals."

<P>
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="pp95success.html">Building on Success: A Blueprint for Effective
Primary Health Care</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Proposal section: "AOHC believes that, in conjunction with the
appropriate funding structure,  a healthier Ontario will emerge only when the
elements of Community Direction & Accountability, Range of Services & Approaches,
Team Approach, Partnerships & Collaboration, and Leadership & Innovation are
integrated as components of primary health care delivery models.  This paper will
provide an explanation of why AOHC believes these components are critical to the
ensuring effective primary health care."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp95workfare.html">Workfare in Context</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Overview: "In anticipation of the implementation of significant
welfare reform in Ontario,
and to ensure that any formal position taken by AOHC is well researched, AOHC
undertook a review of recent literature on workfare and other measures aimed at
supporting the transition from welfare to work in Canada as well as in the United
States."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp95bill26.html">Submission ... on the Matter of Bill 26</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Executive Summary: "Within logistical constraints, AOHC has
taken a close and temperate review of the provisions of Bill 26 relating to health
services.  We have found provisions that we believe are necessary to effect the
reform of the health care system in Ontario.  However, we are deeply concerned with
specific provisions ..."

<DT><A HREF="pp94ment_hlth.html">Response to: "Implementation Vision" -- Mental
Health Reform</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Executive Summary: "CHCs believe that mental health is directly
linked with determinants of health such as, among others, social relationships,
employment status, education, housing, etc. While AOHC supports the essence of the
work that has resulted in the "Implementation Vision" paper, we are concerned that
the focus continues to be the psychiatric care system without serious consideration
for the promotion of  mental health."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp94bill173.html">Position Paper on Bill 173 -- "An Act Respecting Long
Term Care"</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Executive Summary: "We believe that equity in health implies
equal opportunity to achieve and maintain health, including access to programs and
services. As such, we believe that, passed in its current form, Bill 173 will
negatively affect access to programs and services thus affecting fundamental
resources for health.  AOHC generally supports the reform of the long term care
services and the attempt to implement reform through Bill 173.  However, we believe
that certain sections erode the overall merits of the bill."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp94socsec.html">Canada's Social Security Review</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Executive Summary: "We believe that an effective social security
system is one wherein there is balance between national standards and regional
approaches to the implementation of these standards.  It builds on the capacities of
the individuals and communities by filling in the 'gaps' where such exists. 
Community involvement, ownership and responsibility in the reform process is critical
to its success and viability."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp94delist.html">AOHC Position on Proposed OHIP Delisting of Certain
Procedures</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Conclusion: "Delisting opens the door for private insurance and
two-tiered health system.  It encourages physicians to protect and supplement their
income by off-loading charges onto clients and third parties.  For those who cannot
afford to pay these charges, this practice will result in a reduced access to health
care and will heighten the financial burden of illness.  'Delisting' of services, if
implemented, is likely to progressively increase in coming years to the detriment of
the principles of the Canada Health Act of 1984."

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="pp93medicare.html">A Position Paper on Medicare</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Preamble: "The goal of Medicare was and remains equity in the
use and financing of services.  The AOHC believes that the principles of Medicare
must be upheld and health care reform must happen, with federal and provincial
governments working together towards a coordinated 'health system'.  This position
paper describes the erosions that have already occurred to Medicare, outlines a
number of crucially important reforms that will help preserve Medicare and further
improve the performance of our health system, and makes recommendations pertaining to
these reforms to the federal government."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp93NAFTA.html">AOHC Response on the Proposal for a North American Free
Trade Agreement</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Conclusion: "AOHC firmly believes that any free trade agreement
must be based on the protection and concern for people's health in broadest possible
sense.  We strongly caution that, while NAFTA has the potential to be a positive
determinant in improving people's health in all three countries, it cuts both ways
and can drastically bring living conditions down to the lowest common denominator."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp93fairtax.html">Position Paper on Fair Taxes</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Introduction: "Fair taxes and good health are different sides of
the same coin!  Each needs the other to be effective.  Their common objective is to
maintain a quality of life which Ontarians value.  Within the context of our Beliefs
& Principles, the Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) believes tax reform is
essential in the movement toward "fair tax" for all Ontarians ... This paper promotes
a fair tax system, based on social values and social investment, not merely on the
economic or administrative requirements of the province and country. To this end, the
AOHC supports the following principles and types of tax reform as a method to
increase the well-being of Ontario's people."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp93drugprog.html">Our Response to the Drug Programs Framework for
Reform Consultation Paper</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Conclusion: "We generally support the reform principles as
stated in the report 'Drug Programs: Framework for Reform', but strongly believe that
drug reform must not occur in isolation.  Drug reform must be undertaken in relation
to other health reform initiatives, such as the Community Health Framework and must
occur in the context of the overall picture of health reform."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp93people.html">AOHC Position Paper on "People Centred Access: Design
and Implementation Options"</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Introduction: "Reform of the non-profit housing system should be
based on a recognition that people's good health is determined by the level of
respect, empowerment as well as fair and equitable treatment existing in their
communities.   We believe that, in this reform initiative to the social housing,
government should commit to the preservation of human dignity as an underlying
principle. To this end,  AOHC supports the development of a policy that embodies the
following beliefs and principles of the Association: 1) The right to social justice/
equity; 2) The empowerment of users; 3) The use of health centres as a vehicle for
health promotion/community development; and 4) Support for community control in
addressing health issues."

<DT><A HREF="pp92LTC.html">A Role for Community Health Centres in Ontario's Long Term
Care System</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt from the Conclusion:  " ... the Community Health Centre philosophy of
community participation and a broad view of health allows us to look at health issues
from a unique perspective and to enter into productive partnerships with the
communities we serve.  The make-up of each Centre reflects these communities.  As the
shift to more community-based services occurs in Ontario, we see ourselves playing an
integral role: continuing with present services, expanding others and developing new
expertise to meet changing demands."

<P>
<DD>Excerpts:  "The evidence, both in the literature and in most community health
centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs), is that nurse
practitioners can provide much of the care which MD's currently deliver."  "Primary
care providers need skills in health education methods and health planning and
policy, in order to address, more effectively, the determinants of health."  "More
physicians need training in community-based health care."  "AOHC is of the opinion
that the reform of the 'fee for service' remuneration is a must if the principles of
Medicare are to be maintained in the health care system."
<P>
<DT><A HREF="pp91newbeg.html">AOHC Response to the "New Beginnings" Report</A>
<P>
<DD>Excerpt:  "In summary, we understand the need of the Ministry of Health to make
costs of the HSO system justifiable.  In effect by the alteration in the capitation
system and ACIP, the Ministry would release monies which could be directed to
encourage more 'exemplary' primary care.  This makes reasonable common sense, but
there are some dangers involved."

Until recently there was little in the way of community health information to be
found on the World Wide Web.  Happily, this situation is changing rapidly, and with
each passing month there are new treasures to be discovered.  What follows is a
sampling of some interesting health and community health resources that we have found
on our occasional forays into cyberspace.
<P>
Please note that this is not presented as a comprehensive listing, nor as an
endorsement of the content or philosophy of any particular site.  The links below are
simply offered as examples, starting points perhaps for your own search of on-line
community health resources.
<P>
This page is under constant construction. If you know of
any additional sites that provide information on community health or the determinants
of health, please <A HREF="mailto:mail@aohc.org">drop us a line</A> and tell us what
you've published or found.  Your suggestions will help us to keep this list
current and growing.

Principles]"></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>I. 	COMPONENTS OF HEALTH</H2>
<P>
<H3>A.  BELIEFS:</H3>
<P>
1. We accept the definition of health adopted by the World Health Organization. WHO
definition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Health is the extent to which an individual or group is able, on one
hand, to realize  aspirations and satisfy needs; and, on the other hand, to change or
cope with the environment.  Health is therefore seen as a resource for everyday life,
not the objective of living; it is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal
resources, as well as physical capacity."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. 	We believe that all people have the right to the fundamental conditions and
resources for good health which are: peace, shelter, education, food, income, a
stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.
<P>
3. 	We believe in a comprehensive approach to meeting health challenges.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>B. PRINCIPLES:</H3>
<P>1. 	Health Centres are vehicles for health promotion.  This includes: primary
care, health education, individual advocacy, community development, social action,
building healthy public policy, and creating supportive environments. All of these
components need to be present to optimize the health of the community.
<P>
2. 	Health Centres are committed to providing accessible, affordable, appropriate
health services.
<P>
3. 	Health Centres seek to address inequities which impact on the health status of
individuals and communities.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>II. 	GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. BELIEFS:</H3>
<P>
1. 	We believe that the health of a community is maximized through a partnership
which combines the skills, knowledge and life experience/expertise of individuals and
community with those of the health centre staff.
<P>
2. 	We believe that Health Centres should be directed by the communities they are
established to serve.

<H3>B. PRINCIPLES:</H3>
 

       1. Health Centres have an identifiable community which is defined.
 

       2. Where non profit incorporation exists, the membership of a Health Centre
reflects its defined community and
 the board should be elected by its membership.
 

       3. Management and staff have a responsibility to the community to share
information and knowledge that facilitate 
informed decision making.
 

       4. Board members are knowledgeable of their roles and responsibilities and act
to fulfill them.
 
<H2>III. 	ROLES AND ACTIVITIES</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. BELIEFS:</H3>
1. We believe that the primary role of the Health Centre is to support the community
in meeting its health goals.
 
2. We believe that research, innovation and collaboration are necessary in the
development of effective strategies which address health priorities.
 
3. We believe that a broad range of  services, programs and activities are necessary
to respond appropriately to community health issues.
 
4. We believe that communities and individuals have the right to services, programs
and activities that are respectful, relevant and effective.
 
5. We believe that people have the right to the best available information and
resources to help them make healthy decisions.
 
<H3>B. PRINCIPLES:</H3>
1. Health Centres support the community in health planning and health action.
<P>
2. Health Centres regularly evaluate their services, programs and activities in
collaboration with the community.
<P>
3. Health Centres strive to remove barriers which prevent people and communities from
achieving their full health potential.
<P>
4. Health Centres strive to equalize access to health care among all members of the
community.
<P>
5. Health Centres use a multidisciplinary, team approach to ensure holistic,
effective health care.
<P>
6. Health Centres have a responsibility for the dissemination of health information
and resources to their community.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>IV. MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. BELIEFS:</H3>
<P>
1. We believe that the management structure of Health Centres should strengthen the
process of building and supporting a healthy community.
<P>
2. We believe that Health Centres should incorporate in their structure the ability
to respond to changing community priorities on an ongoing basis.
<P>
 <H3>B. PRINCIPLES:</H3>
<P>
1. Management decisions are based on input from both staff working closely with the
community and the community itself.
<P>
2. Management is responsible for ensuring the provision and evaluation of programmes
and services which make the most effective use of available resources.
<P>
3. Where a board of directors exists, the staff works with the Board to initiate and
support action to achieve progressive 
health and social policy.
<P>
4. Health Centres should be models of fair democratic and equitable employment
practices.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>V. THE HEALTH CENTRE MOVEMENT</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. BELIEFS:</H3>
<P>

Development of Health Centres in Ontario]"></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
Health centres in Ontario (that are directly funded by the Ministry of Health) have
been in existence in one form or another since the mid-1970's.  A notable exception to
this is the Group Health Centre in Sault Ste. Marie which opened in October 1962.  In
1975, there was no distinction between community health centres (CHCs) and health
service organizations (HSOs).  Some of the centres in existence at that time are now
CHCs, while others are now HSOs.  Ministry funding was initially provided to these
centres as "experimental pilot projects".  
<P>
Originally, centres were paid on a capitation basis.  However, centres that were not
considered financially viable were initially provided with a program budget, which was
to be converted to capitation funding once viability was achieved.  These centres, now
operating as CHCs, decided to stay with the program budget system as their preferred
way to fund the type of program, operation and philosophy by which they deliver their
programs and services.

</DL>
<P>
In 1982, then Health Minister Larry Grossman announced that CHCs and HSOs were no
longer to be considered experimental pilot projects, but will be part of the mainstream
of legitimate health care services.  Targets were set for annual growth rates, so that
the CHC and HSO components of the system would grow across the province.  Mr. Grossman
also provided financial support for the creation and activities of the Association of
Ontario Health Centres (AOHC).
<P>
Under subsequent Health Ministers Murray Elston and Elinor Caplan, health centres began
to thrive, to the extent that in August 1987, then Premier David Peterson announced the
government's intent to double, within five years, the number of Ontario residents
receiving primary care through alternative funding arrangements.  By November 30, 1989,
93.75% of the former Premier's target had been achieved.  In 1985, there were 11 CHCs
in operation, serving approximately 29,000 people.  The 1991 Ministry of Health Annual
Report noted that as at March 31, 1991, there were 81 HSOs serving a population of
535,000, and 36 CHCs serving a population of 110,000.
<P>
A review of the HSO program and funding began in June 1990, resulting in the Ministry
report "New Beginnings".  A moratorium on HSO development and applications was adopted
at the start of this review, and is still in place today.  In May 1991, the Ontario
Medical Association (OMA)-Ministry agreement on HSO physicians was ratified,
effectively giving the OMA the authority to negotiate the terms of the general HSO
contract with the government.  Since then, HSOs have short-term contracts with the
Ministry of Health.
<P>
A joint AOHC-Ministry of Health evaluation of the CHC program was begun in February
1992, the Strategic Planning and Evaluation Project (SPEP).  Completed in 1993, it
resulted in then Health Minister Ruth Grier's announcement of the Strategic Directions
for the CHC Program.  Under Health Ministers Gigantes, Lankin and Grier, 18 CHCs
received funding approval.  As of April 1995, there were 79 HSOs and 56 CHCs in
Ontario.  In addition, there are approximately 60 groups, at various stages of
development, that are currently developing proposals to become CHCs.

AOHC SUBMITS SOCIAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

The Association of Ontario Health Centres is actively involved with
the current review of social services by the House of Commons'
Standing Committee on Human Resource Development.  Last July AOHC
submitted a brief to the Hon. Lloyd Axworthy that recommended that
Medicare's principles of universality, comprehensiveness, public
administration, portability and accessibility  are appropriate
principles to guide the reform of the social security system.  The
brief was expanded into a full AOHC position paper presented to the
Standing Committee's special hearings in Toronto on November 30.

AOHC acknowledged that current realities such as insecure employment,
increased personal taxes, rapid changes in the nature of work, an
aging population and the concern about management of the deficit
necessitate a reassessment of Canada's social safety system.  At the
same time, the Association had concerns that the current review may
restrict the focus to simply readjusting current programs, rather than
shaping a broader vision of an equitable national social security
system.

Failure to address the broader issues will result in a further erosion
of social programs, with "disastrous consequences."  Community
involvement, ownership and responsibility are cited as key ingredients
for the success of the reform process.

The AOHC position paper goes on to describe an effective system as one
that builds on the capacities of individuals and communities by
filling in the "gaps" where such exist, a system whose objective is
"on increasing the self sufficiency of those currently supported by
social programs and services while acknowledging that a certain
percentage of the population may continue to need full support."  In a
reformed system people have opportunities to participate in the
economy, learn new skills and get timely support when the need occurs.

To arrive at that more effective system, AOHC recommended the
following measures:

1. Review and clearly articulate the intent, eligibility and funding
scheme for the Unemployment Insurance System.

2. Encourage self sufficiency by providing workers and employers with
opportunities for increasing worker marketability through the
development of a range of skills, expertise and experience.

3. Provide working parents with family supports that would allow
greater participation in training and employment opportunities, such
as child support and support for working children who provide care and
housing for elderly parents.

4. Ensure that the education system provides a basic level of
education and training to increase worker marketability across the
employment sector.

5. Ensure that self sufficiency, individual and community
responsibility and highlighted through appropriate incentives for the
educational system, community based organizations, employer
associations, etc.

6. Encourage the development of community managed and delivered
employment opportunities such as in cooperative ventures, cottage
industries, etc.

7. Establish national standards for targeting the reduction of child
poverty through the funding and implementation of appropriate programs
and services. Transfer payments to provinces for this purpose must be
contingent on the provinces meeting national standards.

8. Develop an expanded system of student loans with the repayment
being based on the borrower's ability to pay, and with provisions for
system review a few years after implementation.

9. Establish "reducing disincentives to work for welfare recipients"
and "reducing child poverty" as national goals for social activity
reform.

10. Establish universality, comprehensiveness, public administration,
portability and accessibility as national principles to federal
support for social assistance and services.

11. Establish guaranteed annual income based on national standards and
have needed additional funding come from the restructuring of Canada's
tax system to raise overall revenue more progressively.

12. Combine the Child Tax Benefit with other social spending on behalf
of children to create a new benefit for children of all low-income
families, regardless of whether the family is on welfare, unemployment
insurance, or earning wage.

13. Combine the new income benefit for children with an intensive
community development strategy to increase the parents' capacities for
the transition into the job market.

The Building Healthier Organizations Initiative - A "Quality" Project

Efforts to support and promote an ongoing commitment to quality in
community health centres in Ontario are off to a good start with the
launching of the "Building Healthier Organizations" initiative, a
project jointly sponsored by the AOHC and the Community Health Branch.
 The Association of Ontario Health Centres has a history of commitment
to the concept and measurement of quality, and the BHO project is
designed to assist CHCs to continue to develop and improve the quality
work that they do.

AOHC's interest in the concept of quality began as early as 1988, with
the development and subsequent adoption of "Proud of Our Work"-
Initial Standards for CHCs and HSOs in Ontario.  In 1992/93 the AOHC
and the Community Health Branch agreed to examine total quality
management as a potential new method of promoting quality in CHCs.

In 1993/94, after exploring a variety of known techniques, methods and
theories on quality, the AOHC's Quality Management Work Group found
that most of these could not be readily applied to CHCs due to their
unique nature.  The Building Healthier Organizations Project
represents a new and creative approach to promoting quality, and
builds on the strengths of a combination of approaches in order to
best approximate the unique circumstances of community health centres.

The Building Healthier Organizations Project is intended to be a multi
year initiative.  The "Initial Project" of the initiative, a year long
project is currently in its first phase — the Research Phase.  There
are three phases to the initial project- a Research Phase, a Design
Phase and a Pilot Projects Phase.  Part of the Research Phase are
workshops for CHC administrators and board members across the
province.  The workshops will serve as a consultative tool to get
feedback from CHCs around questions such as "what it means to be a
healthy organization," what factors influence the building of healthy
organizations," and "why would CHCs want to be healthy organizations?"

To date, workshops have been held in South-western Ontario, Ottawa and
Toronto, with 44 participants representing 34 CHCs.  Workshops are
also scheduled for February, in Toronto and Thunder Bay.  The Design
Phase, will focus on developing an operational plan for the pilot
project phase.  Potential pilot CHC sites will be selected through a
voluntary proposal process, based on eligibility criteria which will
be developed.  Components to be pilot tested will be determined based
on information gathered from the workshops, as well as the needs of
prospective centres.  These may include things such as team
development, process improvement, performance measurement, etc.

During the final phase, the project will be pilot tested at two
selected CHC sites. The community health centres which are selected as
pilot sites will each establish internal teams to guide the pilot
project.  Ongoing consultation and support will be provided from the
AOHC Quality Management Work Group.  The results of the pilot projects
will be evaluated, and next steps will be identified based on the
experience of all 3 phases of the project.

The initial BHO project is expected to be completed by the end of
September 1995, at which time a presentation of the initial project
and next steps is planned for the national conference of the CHC
Network of Canada, "Taking Back Our Health," scheduled for October 5,
6 & 7 in Toronto.

This project currently underway provides the foundation for the
implementation of a full Building Healthier Organizations initiative. 
It is expected that this initiative will provide CHCs with a basket of
tools and resources that will assist them in achieving excellence. 
All CHCs will be provided opportunities to become involved in this new
and exciting project.  Stay tuned for further updates.

CHC EVALUATION WORK GROUP PREPARES THE GROUNDWORK

"Measures of Effectiveness"

Work on a comprehensive evaluation of the Community Health Centre
Program in Ontario is underway.  As in the Strategic Planning and
Evaluation Project (SPEP), completed in 1992, AOHC is once again
working in partnership with the Community Health Branch of the
Ministry of Health in this important and timely initiative.

The Strategic Planning and Evaluation Project had two components, the
Strategic Planning Project and the Evaluability Assessment Project. 
The move to formalize evaluation in Community Health Centres began
with the recommendations flowing from the Evaluability Assessment
Project.  The primary purpose of the original evaluability assessment
was to assess the readiness of the CHC Program for comprehensive
evaluation.

As reported in the Final Report of the Evaluability Assessment of
Ontario's Community Health Centre Program, the CHC Program was
"evaluable," but that certain conditions needed to be in place before
actual evaluation activities could be undertaken.  The report
highlighted the lack of common indicators and common data collection
system across the CHC network.  The report also noted that  individual
CHCs have undertaken evaluation of individual programs.  The current
CHC Program Evaluation Project is being developed with the 1992
Evaluability Assessment Report as starting point.

To implement the recommendations of the 1992 report, the CHC Program
Evaluation Project was initiated in the Spring of 1994.  To date,
several activities have been undertaken, including the formation of a
joint AOHC/CHB Evaluation Work Group which will oversee the
development and implementation of a two year evaluation plan for the
CHC Program.  The work group is made up of both AOHC and CHB, Ministry
of Health representatives and chaired by Charlotte Rosenbaum, AOHC
Vice-President. The AOHC representatives were selected through a
voluntary nominations process and appointed by the AOHC Board. In
addition, outside consultants will be hired to assist in project
implementation.

The objective of the CHC Program Evaluation Project is as follows:

To design an evaluation framework that accounts for the various
aspects of the CHC Program, both qualitative and quantitative measures
of effectiveness, and that provides for ongoing evaluation of
community health centres.

Over a two year period, the work group will develop a feasible
evaluation plan. It is expected that this plan will provide the
groundwork for the future evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency
of the CHC program.

In Year One of the Project, the focus will be on developing an
overview of evaluation projects and the development of indicators
appropriate to evaluation in the CHC context .  In Year Two, the work
group will focus on the development of data collection methods.  It is
important to note that although the ultimate goal is to evaluate the
CHC Program, actual evaluation of CHC programs will not take place
until Year 3 of the project.

Community health centres will be involved and have input into the
development of the evaluation plan.  CHCs will also acquire tools for
future evaluation of programs and services.  In addition, in-depth
work may take place with a sample of CHCs, particularly those centres
with established data collection and process indicators.  The work
group intends to enlist both the expertise and resources of local CHCs
to ensure maximum participation and detailed understanding of CHC
programs and processes.

The time has come to evaluate the CHC Program.  Community health
centres (CHCs) are uniquely positioned to provide communities with
opportunities for innovation and local responsiveness which are key to
taking control of factors affecting their health.

With the number of CHCs in Ontario increasing from 12 to 52 in the
last decade, the CHC Program must be proactive in fostering and
ensuring innovation and responsiveness in working to achieve the
health goals for Ontario.  Evaluation provides an opportunity to do
just this.  It will afford CHCs the opportunity to both learn from
their experiences and widely share their achievements.  This is an
exciting and timely venture for Ontario communities.

For more information about the Evaluation Project, contact JoAnne
Doyle at the AOHC (416) 236-2539.

NEW PSA CAMPAIGN IN THE WORKS

Building on the successes of the 1994 MediaLink Project and the first
annual Community Health Week held in October, the AOHC Board of
Directors approved the Association's embarking on a new project
designed to further heighten public awareness  and increase the
opportunity for public debate on the determinants of health.   This
time around, the mechanism  will be a multi-media Public Service
Announcements (PSA) campaign, scheduled for launching in mid-February.
 The television and radio ads will be distributed to all interested
Ontario TV networks and radio stations with a request for donated
air-time.  A telephone campaign to raise awareness and interest among
the TV and radio networks is underway. Matching posters and buttons
will be distributed to all AOHC member centres to facilitate local
support for this provincial initiative.

Each television ad, radio announcement, poster and button will contain
one of four basic messages: "Employment determines health", "Poverty
determines health", "Education determines health", and "Isolation
determines health".  With only 15 seconds to get the message across on
television and 30 seconds to do so on radio, these ads provided a real
challenge for the AOHC project team.  From the storyboards and scripts
so far, the AOHC team (staff & consultants) seems to be meeting the
challenge with simple, straightforward images and facts that present
the concepts effectively and encourage the viewer/listener to think
about both problems and solutions. The material produced for this
campaign will have an indefinite shelf-life and can be used repeatedly
in various public awareness campaigns.

If current election rumours are true, however, the timing of the PSA
campaign's initial launch would also allow AOHC and its member centres
to incorporate the messages into a larger provincial election
strategy.  In keeping with AOHC's non-partisan status in elections,
the PSA campaign can help ensure that all political parties consider
the health determinants and the achievement of Ontario Health Goals in
their respective positions and party platform on health reform.

"Designing Channels for Health" - CHC CAPITAL PROJECTS

In the context of community health centre development, CHC capital
projects has emerged as another area requiring the development of
resource tools.  With the ongoing increase in the number of CHCs and
the number of CHCs involved in some form of renovations, the need for
guidelines in the capital project is evident.  For instance, funding
approval for 4 new CHCs is expected by Spring of 1995 and last fall,
Health Minister Ruth Grier announced funding for capital projects for
4 Ontario CHCs - South Riverdale CHC, West Central CHC, Parkdale CHC
and North Lanark CHC. In response to the need for resources, a joint
AOHC/Community Health Branch project "Designing Channels for Health"
will be underway shortly.  The project is aimed at developing resource
material for CHCs undertaking capital project development with the
following objectives:

* to provide centres with tools that ensure that the CHC philosophy
underlies the CHC capital project development process;

* to encourage board, staff and clients involvement in all aspects of
planning;

* to review the experience of the CHC network in identifying critical
steps and issues in CHC capital project development;

* to assist centre in making informed decisions in selecting
architects, space planners, development consultants, building
contractors, etc. * to develop tools that will assist CHCs to comply
with Ministry of Health requirements, capital approvals process,
including the documentation required at key decision points.

Over the years, a wealth of experience in capital projects has
developed within the CHC network.  The "Building Channels for Health"
project is intended to result in resource tools that will minimize
what can be a highly frustrating and time consuming experience for CHC
boards and staff.  Information about such things, among others as
criteria for considering a capital project, constituting a capital
project team, site selection and guidelines for selecting an architect
or contractor will be covered.  The resource tools will include a
primer, a resource guide and an interactive video with the intent that
each can be used as a "stand alone" or interactively with the other
tools.

Building a CHC is more than just erecting a building.  Trying to
ensure that a capital project remains based in the community -
everything from the look, feel and accessibility of the structure, and
that the outcome reflects the particular CHC's philosophy and needs
while being cost-effective can be a challenge to even the most
experienced and resourceful of organizations.  The resource materials 
are intended to provide much needed assistance to CHC boards and
executive directors who are often undertaking this process for the
very first time.

This one-year project will be under the direction of an AOHC/Ministry
resource team that will provide guidance to the development of the
variety of tools discussed. Part of the process will include input
from community health centres on their experience and expertise on
capital projects.

AOHC REVIEWS PROGRAMS & SERVICES

In the last five years, the Association of Ontario Health Centres has
become increasingly diverse in the kinds of services and activities it
undertakes for member centres and general public.  To ensure
continuing responsiveness to the needs of member centres, and to
prioritize allocation of available resources, AOHC is currently
reviewing its programs and services.

The AOHC office recently conducted an inventory of both existing and
potential (needed but not yet provided) services, seeking feedback
from member centres regarding the level of support for the various
categories of services.  In November, a survey was mailed to member
centres in order to document this feedback. Twenty eight out of 56
member centres responded to the survey.  At least two key themes have
emerged:

* there is overwhelming support for the 4 core program areas of AOHC
(i.e.. General Public Information/Education, Community & Centre
Development Programs/Services, Member Centre Operations-Support
Services, Advocacy & Lobbying)

* there is general agreement, based on comments, that maintaining
current AOHC services and expanding others is essential, particularly
given the current health reform climate, but there is less consensus
about how best to finance these services ( i.e.. member centre fees,
government funding , other alternatives etc.)

The AOHC Board of Directors have reviewed the survey results and have
determined that additional information along with feedback on survey
results be provided to member centres.  The  Board expects to complete
its review prior to the June 1995 Annual General Meeting.

More Than Words

Comprehensive health care - Services that are intended to meet all the
health care needs of a patient; outpatient, inpatient, home care and
other.

Continuity of care - The degree to which the care of a patient  is
continuous, that is, without interruption.  Interruptions occur
sometimes because the patient does not follow through, sometimes
because the system has gaps, often because of lack of facilities or
because of financial impediments.

FOUR NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES ANNOUNCED

On February 17 Health Minister Ruth Grier announced that local groups in
Peterborough, Temiskaming, Cambridge and Hamilton will receive a total
of two million dollars to start new CHCs in their communities.  The
announcement was welcome news for the four groups, who have been waiting
since the Ministry's November 30 submission deadline to hear whether
their proposals would be funded. The new additions will bring the total
number of Ontario CHCs to fifty-six.

Reflecting the Ministry's priorities for the CHC program, each group
will address a particular population's health needs:

The Peterborough Community Wellness Centre will serve low-income
residents in Peterborough and surrounding rural and isolated areas.  The
CHC will provide primary care, professional & peer counseling, nutrition
action programs, and a community development / advocacy program.  It
will have its administrative base in the city, but will also undertake
outreach programs through a variety of sites in the county.

The Centre de Sante Communautaire de Temiska-ming will serve north-east
Ontario's Francophone population, with health promotion programs that
will address health needs for those in farming, mining and forestry, as
well as for single-parent families, young families and persons dealing
with mental health issues.  On-site services are planned for
Francophones in each of three regions: Kirkland Lake in the north, Elk
Lake/Earlton/Belle Vallee, and Tri-Town in the south.

The Langs Farm Community Health Centre will serve people in the Langs
Farm and Preston Heights communities near Cambridge, with a special
emphasis on children and youth.  The CHC will build upon the past
successes of the Langs Farm Village Association, currently operating a
Community Resource Centre which serves as a home base for a wide variety
of Association programs including a preschool program, a youth and teen
outreach, and an adult support service.

The Hamilton Urban Core Community Health Centre will serve the homeless
and other low income people in the heart of Hamilton.  The proposal
prepared by the Wesley Urban Ministries charitable organization
identifies the specific target groups for the CHC as homeless and
under-housed women, men and youths, as well as poor ethnic families and
poor elderly, living in the inner-city core.  To reduce any barriers to
access (such as transportation) for these priority groups, the CHC will
provide its services at four separate downtown locations, as well as a
mobile service to reach into the streets.

The process of obtaining approval for a new CHC is one that can take a
community many months, or at times even years, to complete.  The
interest must first arise within the community and the committee
subsequently formed to develop the idea has much work to do.  Foremost
among their tasks is the completion of a comprehensive assessment of
their community's health needs.  This involves a review of existing
services and gaps in service, gathering available statistics for the
area, and obtaining needed information through focus group studies,
surveys and other methods.  A clear need for a CHC in the area,
demonstrated by the research, must be expressed in a proposal to the
Community Health Branch of the Ministry of Health.  A total of twelve
groups submitted proposals for the current round of approvals.  At
present there are approximately sixty various developing community
groups, known to AOHC, that are at some stage of developing a CHC
proposal. The pre-determined Ministry annual limit in the number of CHCs
to be approved annually results in a competitive process.  As such, not
all CHC proposals that pass through the district health councils'
process are guarranteed funding approval. Like most other areas, the CHC
Program budget has been negatively affected by the government's
cost-cutting efforts over the last few years.  Although the current
Ministry of Health Strategic directions for the CHC Program call for
"100 CHCs by March 31, 1997", the rate of CHC approval in the past few
years will make this objective difficult to achieve.  It is noteworthy,
in the context of the cutbacks in other areas in the health sector, any
sign of growth can be interpreted as a hopeful one.  Representatives of
all three provincial parties (Hon. R. Grier[NDP], D. Ramsay [Lib], J.
Wilson [PC]), at a recent CHC administrators conference, affirmed their
support for community health centres and, while they individually varied
in  their commitment to a fixed number, all indicated their goal of
increasing the number of CHCs in Ontario.

Medical Student Placements at AOHC

AOHC is once again playing a part in the University of Toronto's ongoing
efforts to educate medical students about community health.  Since
February of 1994, AOHC has acted as one of several "pivotal agencies"
selected by the Faculty of Medicine to give students some first-hand
"field" experience in community health work.  In addition to Community
Health Centres, other agencies chosen for this program include Elderly
Persons Centres, Child and Family Centres, and Drug and Alcohol Centres.

The medical learner program is part of the "Achieving Health in the
Community" component of a first- and second-year med school course
entitled "Health, Illness and the Community".  Described as "active,
self-directed, problem-based and experiential", the course is designed
to provide students with community-based opportunities to acquire
relevant knowledge, skills, and attitudes in relation to the health of
individuals and communities.  Students negotiate a volunteer placement
with the "pivotal agency" of their choice, and the Faculty of Medicine
hopes that through their involvement with the community organization
they will gain a better understanding both of the determinants of health
and of the variety of strategies that can be used to prevent disease and
promote health.

For the AOHC, this represents an opportunity to expose future physicians
not only to health centres and the concepts of health promotion, but
also to the current state of health reform in general.  Using
presentations, discussions, videos and written material, AOHC staff
provide the students with information on CHCs & HSOs, health promotion,
community development, the health system, and the role of physicians in
health centres.  As part of its presentation outline, AOHC staff take
the students to tour a nearby CHC and view the available programs.  This
could lead to an extended observation period if the students express an
interest in observing a CHC physician's work directly.

To date, feedback from students who chose AOHC as their agency has been
very favourable.  They said that they gained a good understanding of how
the AOHC is promoting health and wellness, and how doctors could use CHC
services for their patients.  They also appreciated gaining a broader
perspective of health reform, and felt that overall the experience was
relevant to their education.

AOHC Prepares a Place for Health Centres in the Electronic Community

It is a sunny spring morning in 1997, and the Smalltown Community Health
Centre in Rural, Ontario is starting another busy day of health-related
activities.  In one office, the nurse practitioner checks her electronic
mail box and retrieves three new messages from colleagues around the
province, two from CHC nurses in Australia, and ten from an Internet
mailing list group on health issues that she subscribes to.  Down the
hall, the health promoter is composing a question on his computer that
he will send to his peers on the CHC network's newsgroup reserved for
health educators.  Meanwhile, the medical secretary arranges the
electronic transfer of a client's health records to another institution
that will be providing specialized care.  Later that day, the Executive
Director will download an updated Board Development Manual from another
social service agency's computer network, search their database for
other useful resources, and then join an on-line conference with other
CHC administrators to exchange information about common challenges and
successes.

If recent funding applications by the AOHC are successful, such a
scenario may well become a reality at member centres in the
not-too-distant future.  AOHC has recently participated in the
submission of three separate grant applications, seeking assistance to
create a CHC network and to connect our network to those of other health
providers and social service organizations.

With the continuing refinement and increased accessibility of
communications equipment and software, more and more companies and
organizations in Canada and around the world are establishing thriving
electronic networks and bulletin board services (BBS's).  But what do we
mean by "network", and why do we want one?

In the present context, a network is simply a group of people or offices
whose computers have the ability to contact and communicate with each
other.  For example, within a large individual CHC or office today, the
computers in the building are often connected to each other in what is
known as a "Local Area Network" (or "LAN" in techno-speak).  Within such
a local network, employees can send electronic messages ("e-mail") to
each other, share such things as word-processing and spread-sheet files,
participate in special-topic discussions on "bulletin boards", and
search through a common database of information.

The concept is quite similar for a network between different CHCs and
HSOs, except that now the connections between computers are made with
telephone lines instead of direct cables.  Using a modem to reach the
network's phone line, and communications software to make and manage the
connection, a CHC's computer will be able to access the network and send
and receive all kinds of electronic mail and information.  Such a
network will also serve as a member centre's connection to other
organizations' networks and information, and to the enormous world-wide
network of computer networks known as the Internet.

Since all of this takes money to create and time to learn, one may well
ask why such a network is necessary at all.  While it is true that there
are those among us who revel in the joys of technology for its own sake
(we're the ones who assign adjectives like "cool" and "neat" to the most
obscure technological accomplishments), for the vast majority of people
such tools are only useful if they help to make work significantly
better, quicker, cheaper, or easier.

Networks are all about communicating: sending and receiving useful
information in ways that improve upon the phone, the fax and the post
office.  The most popular network use is undoubtedly e-mail, a quick way
to send and receive messages and files without paying a long-distance
phone bill.  Another convenience is the ability to send large documents
in their original format - for example, a draft of a manual in Word for
Windows, complete with margins, fonts, italics and so on - so that the
recipient can make edits without having to retype the whole thing.  Also
popular are the special-interest discussion groups, where people in the
same field - for example, CHC dietitians - can post comments, questions
and news of mutual interest, creating a type of on-line conference
without the expense of airplanes and hotels.  Overall, creating a
network of CHCs & HSOs would allow inexpensive and instantaneous
communication between centres, as well as access to all manner of
electronically-stored information in other institutions around the
world.  If the network can be reached with a local call or a 1-800
number, this is likely to be especially advantageous to centres in more
remote areas.

In an effort to create a place for community health on this vast
electronic landscape, AOHC has participated in the submission of the
following grant applications:

1. R.E.A.C.H. Ontario Network:  Submitted to the Trillium Foundation,
the REACH (Research, Education and Action on Community Health) proposal
was developed by David Thornley (now at the Community Health Branch). 
Its aim is to create a network of community-based organizations,
including CHCs and HSOs, and to develop and share tools and "best
practices" resources among all groups.  Of the three initiatives, this
one most directly combines network plans with a community health
sensibility.

2. Ontario Social Development Network:  Headed primarily by the Ontario
Social Development Council and the Ontario Prevention Clearing-house,
this project is an application to bring network capabilities to a large
number of non-governmental organizations, and in so doing to "facilitate
in social policy development through networking, policy analysis,
resource sharing and collaborative action".  AOHC is one of seven
co-sponsors, along with the above groups and NirvCentre (which operates
the Web network), Ontario Healthy Communities Coalition, the Social
Planning Network of Ontario, and the Coordinating and Advisory Groups of
Ontario. This application was submitted to the Ontario Network
Infrastructure Program (ONIP).

3. Ontario Health Providers Alliance:  AOHC was part of a third network
application, also to ONIP, with other members of the Ontario Health
Providers Alliance, a group of seventeen associations representing
hospitals, specific health providers, long term care and community based
organizations.  This project proposes to study the feasibility of a
standard method of health data collection, which would allow the
electronic transfer of such information between different health
providers.  The end result will be the development of a business plan to
ensure regional and province-wide network compatibility.

NAME="psa"></A>****************************************************************

PSA Campaign Launched

Employment, education, poverty and isolation determine health - this is
the message of a new public awareness campaign launched recently by the
AOHC.  The Association has produced a set of four thought-provoking
Public Service Announcements for television and radio that point out the
direct connection between health and specific "health determinants". 
All television and radio stations in Ontario have been contacted by the
AOHC with a request for free air-time to help get the messages out to
the public.

Using straightforward images and eye-opening statistics, the PSAs
publicize the fact that employment, education, poverty and isolation all
affect the health of the individual in society.  "Our intention is to
make the ‘determinants of health' concept better understood by the
general public," said AOHC Executive Director Sonny Arrojado.  "These
days most people are aware that nutrition, exercise and smoking affect
health, but other equally important determinants are still too often
overlooked."

The current PSA campaign is part of the AOHC's larger ongoing efforts to
promote a community approach to health, an approach that is being looked
to increasingly by those concerned with the reform of the present health
care system.  AOHC's hope is that by emphasizing the ways that
employment, education, poverty and isolation determine health, future
decisions and discussions on health will include a consideration of
these and other important factors.

In addition to the video and audio messages, AOHC produced matching
posters and buttons to improve the effectiveness of the campaign.  All
materials have been distributed to provincial (across Canada) and
federal politicians, government officials, all member centres, and other
health related organizations and offices.

AOHC office has received numerous orders of additional copies of posters
and buttons. Feedback on the quality of the campaign materials has been
very positive from all corners, and AOHC has received reports of TV and
radio PSAs being aired.

<A
NAME="ele"></A>****************************************************************

Election Countdown?

Rumours abound that the next provincial election is just around the
corner.  Many consider the 1995 election as a "watershed" event due to
its timing in relation to the state of health reform initiatives in the
province.  Within this context, the AOHC Board of Directors determined
that 1995 priorities will continue to be mainly in the areas of
community health and health human resource strategy.  Included under
these categories are such concerns as provincial and federal health and
social reform, CHC growth and resource security, community awareness and
social contract implications.

In preparation for the eventual call, AOHC has already formulated its
election strategy, and work is well under way to reach strategy
objectives:

To raise political parties' awareness of issues related to health,
health services, health reform and community health centres.

Ways of increasing political awareness of health issues include:
identifying key contacts in each of the political parties to inform them
of the activities of AOHC and its member centres; ensuring that the
determinants of health are acknowledged in the political platform of all
political parties; and providing a vehicle for addressing political
parties' information needs regarding health issues.  Meetings between
AOHC and representatives from all three parties are now taking place,
and AOHC is also participating, as member of the Health Reform
Coalition, in the preparation of a candidates' "score card" based on
their responses to a questionnaire on health goals and the determinants
of health.

To solicit maximum multi-party support for community health centres as
vehicles for reform.

For the past three years AOHC has provided regular information to all
Ontario MPPs through mailings of HealthLink, CHC News for CHC People and
other information bulletins.  Copies of selected AOHC position papers
have also been provided to MPPs with these regular mailouts.  Most
recently, AOHC distributed copies of the "CHC Vision" videotape to all
MPPs.  During the elections, the results of the Health Reform
Coalition's survey will also be communicated to candidates of all
parties.

To ensure availability of AOHC resources to achieve objectives.

Limited resources for undertaking an effective election strategy will be
maximized by combining the efforts of the AOHC, the Health Reform
Coalition, and AOHC member centres.  AOHC has prepared and distributed
an election kit for members, with helpful election and health reform
information and suggestions for local "grass roots" action.  An
"Election Watch" bulletin is also being fax-broadcast to members
periodically, as well as updated lists of MPP candidates as these become
known.

While not a direct part of the election strategy, AOHC's current
"determinants of health" PSA campaign can also help bring community
health issues to the forefront during an election campaign.  Television
and radio ads will hopefully run on stations throughout the province,
and associated materials (posters, buttons) can be used by member
centres as a resource to increase local awareness of health centres and
of the importance of a broader understanding of health and community.

<A
NAME="wrks"></A>****************************************************************

In the Works

Preparations are currently underway on a number of AOHC projects and
upcoming events, including:

Annual AOHC Conference The 1995 AOHC Conference will take place from
June 1st to 3rd at the Holiday Inn in Sault Ste. Marie.  The conference
program has recently been printed and mailed out to all health centres. 
It once again boasts a wide array of workshop topics, on issues of
relevance to health reform and the health centre movement.  In addition,
participants can look forward to networking sessions, a tour of the
Group Health Centre, a reception and a dinner dance.  This year's
conference will also feature a special presentation by Dr. Fraser
Mustard, one of Canada's foremost medical scientists and educators.  A
new feature this year is the International Film Festival Night, which
will feature screenings and discussion of films from around the world on
the theme of health care.

National CHC Conference This year AOHC is hosting the Second National
Conference of Community Health Centres, to take place from October 5th
to 7th at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Toronto.  The theme of this
important gathering is "Taking Back Our Health - CHCs in Canada".  Watch
for more detail on this event in upcoming issues of CHC News and AOHC
HealthLink.

The 1995 Green Book The data has been gathered and the entries are now
being compiled for the 1995 AOHC Green Book.  This annual publication
lists health promotion programs offered at health centres around
Ontario.  Member centres have sent hundreds of program updates to the
AOHC office, indicating that this year's Green Book will likely be the
biggest ever.  Look for publication in time for the Annual Conference at
the beginning of June.

Community Health Week '95 In response to feedback from centres that
expressed the need for more preparation time, the dates have already
been chosen for this year's Community Health Week: it will be held from
September 29 to October 6, 1995.  It's not too early to form your
centre's CHW Committee to begin updating your media list and planning
the type of events that you will host.  Once again all local efforts
will be aided by centralized AOHC publicity and support.  This year's
CHW dates overlap with those of the national CHC Conference, a lead-in
that will hopefully help us to attract more media and public attention.

Election Call An Opportunity For Health Reform Advocacy

After months of rumours and speculation, Bob Rae finally named June 8
as the date when Ontario voters will get a chance to choose who leads
their next government. For the AOHC, which has been developing its
election strategy for several months, the announcement marks the
official starting point to bring the issues of community health and
health reform to all three political parties at both local and
provincial level.

Although the last few years have been marked by numerous health
cutbacks in many different areas, the number of community health
centres in Ontario has steadily grown, albeit at a slower rate, with
the most recent rate of four (4) new CHCs per year.  Notwithstanding
this growth and the established multi-party support for CHCs since
the mid-70s, continued political support for CHCs cannot be taken for
granted.

In October 1994, the AOHC Board of Directors identified the
Association's involvement in the impending provincial election as a
strategic priority to ensure that the voice of the community is not
lost in public debate on health and health care.  As a non-partisan
non-profit charitable organization, AOHC's election strategy favours
no particular party or platform, but seeks to promote the serious
consideration of the broad determinants of health and community
involvement in the planning and funding of Ontario's health system. 
Over the past few years, AOHC maintained periodic contact with all
elected officials through a regular mailing of newsletters, position
papers, and related information to all MPPS on a regular basis. 
During the recent pre-election preparations, special meetings were
also arranged with representatives from all three parties, to raise
their level of awareness of health reform issues and to solicit
all-party support for CHCs as vehicles for reform.

At the local level, AOHC  provided election support to its member
centres, each of whom has received an Election Kit to provide
suggestions on ways to get involved in the elections at the local
level.  The kits provide helpful information on the general election
process in the province of Ontario, tips on planning a local
strategy, ideas for individual action and group action, and
post-election follow-up suggestions.  Also included are relevant
statistics and facts on health and health reform designed to provide
local centres with food for thought in identifying health issues in
their communities.

The timing of the election call brings added relevance to AOHC's
current public awareness campaign on the determinants of health. 
Since mid-February, television and radio stations across the province
have been broadcasting AOHC PSAs that point out the connection
between health and factors such as poverty, isolation, education and
employment (see article, page 6).  It is hoped that these messages
will reach candidates and voters alike and contribute to the election
debates on health and health care.

In addition to internal preparations for the elections, AOHC has also
actively participated in shaping the election strategies for the
Health Reform Coalition (HRC). As part of its strategy, HRC sent a
survey to all MPPs and to candidates from the three main political
parties in an attempt to gauge their support and hear their plans for
health reform in Ontario.  Survey responses indicate that, while all
three parties affirm their support for Ontario's health goals and the
concepts of health reform, none offered a clear vision or specific
implementation plans that would make such reforms a reality. As a
member of the Ontario Health Providers Alliance (OHPA), AOHC
participated in the exchange of relevant election information among
member organizations. OHPA members are collaborating in several ways,
sharing up-to-date candidates lists and discussing ways of working
together on holding the respective politicians (post election)
accountable for campaign promises on health-related issues.

Early media reports from this election campaign identify health as a
major election issue, and it will be very interesting to see to what
extent community based organizations such as the AOHC and its member
centres are able to get provincial politicians to commit to a real
shift towards community-based services and health promotion.

CHC EVALUATION UPDATE

AOHC's Evaluation Work Group is pleased to announce that the
Evaluation Framework Planning Project got underway successfully in
April.  After a rigorous selection process the Work Group selected
the ARA Consulting Group to assist the AOHC with this two year
process.

The purpose of this project is to develop an evaluation framework
(plan) that will help CHCs and the Ministry of Health's Community
Health Branch (CHB) identify and collect information useful for
evaluating broad community health centre objectives that are shared
across the province.  The final product will enable CHCs and CHBto
share information and develop common evaluation initiatives.

The project is designed to provide numerous opportunities for CHCs
and members of their communities to have meaningful input in the
development of the framework. Each CHC has designated a
representative who will act as a liaison with the Evaluation Work
Group throughout the next two years.  An initial workshop for these
representatives was held at the end of April.  During May and June
each CHC will be completing a survey on their information resources
and as well will be conducting focus groups with stakeholders to
identify key evaluation priorities.  Additional workshops and working
groups will be held throughout the next year to enable participation
from all centres across the province.  The next scheduled workshop
will be held at the June AOHC conference in Sault Ste. Marie. 
Everyone is welcome to attend.

Updates on the progress of the project will be included in future
newsletters.

AOHC Undertakes Strategic Programs & Services Review

At its February 22 meeting the AOHC Board of Directors determined
that, in response to the rapid growth and expansion of AOHC in the
past few years, there was a need to undertake a strategic planning
process related to programs and services. Subsequent to this
decision, the AOHC Board approved the framework for the review. The
objectives of the review are:

* To review programs and services provided by AOHC. * To provide
additional opportunities for member centres to give feedback to the
AOHC about services, structure and communications. * To review other
relevant provincial organizations' services, structure and
communications. * To develop options for planning services, structure
& communications.

The Board also identified some key principles for the review.  The
Board determined that the review process must allow for maximum
opportunities for member centre participation and that it must take
into consideration the historical context of the organization, the
current objects, by-laws, beliefs and principles as well as current
resources.  The Board also noted that some aspects of the review
process have been underway for sometime and will  be incorporated in
the framework for this broader review.

Jim Shea of Shea & Company has been contracted to assist in the
review process. The review is divided into 2 stages: Research and
Implementation.  The research phase will include the following:

1) Inventory of AOHC Programs and Services (completed) 2) Member
centre survey (completed) 3) Development of strategic review
outline/Board approval (completed) 4) Communication to member centres
re overall 1995 strategic review process and workshop at Annual
Conference (completed) 5) Workshops (3) at AOHC June conference (June
1,2) 6) Interactive display at Annual Conference (June 1, 2) 7)
Summary of information from workshops to all member centres for
comment (June 23) 8) Deadline for member centre comments (August 25)
9) Report to AOHC Board with summary of information and recommended
options for action (September 8)

As noted above, there will be three (3) participatory discussion
groups and interactive displays at the AOHC Conference.  The
discussion groups, which will be facilitated by Jim Shea, will start
off with a brief summary of current AOHC programs, services and
existing mechanisms for member centre input and participation
followed by identification of areas of strengths and areas for
improvement.  A historical pictorial display in the workshop room
will provide an additional context for the discussion.  The
interactive display will be located in the Registration area to
maximize opportunities for participation.  The display will also
invite participants to indicate their "beefs" and "bouquets" for the
organization.

In early September, the incoming AOHC Board will undertake a
strategic retreat which will include the consideration of the
research phase findings and recommendations in the development of the
Implementation Phase.

Toronto CHC Contributes to Upcoming U. N. World Conference on Women

Women's Health in Women's Hands Attends Preparatory Meeting in New
York

For health promotion coordinator Vuyiswa Keyi-Ayema, advocating
social change doesn't stop at her CHC's doorstep - or, for that
matter, at any doorstep.  A passionate advocate for universal access
to health and equality for women, Ms. Keyi-Ayema recently represented
Women's Health in Women's Hands at the U.N.'s 39th Session of the
Commission on the Status of Women in New York.  This conference was
held between March 15 and April 7, in preparation for the upcoming
World Conference on Women taking place later this summer in Beijing.

For years the United Nations has hosted many conferences on specific
topics such as human rights, population & development and the
environment.  The Beijing Conference will be the U.N.'s fourth
international gathering dealing specifically with women's issues; the
first was in Mexico in 1975, the second in Copenhagen in 1980, and
the most recent was in Nairobi in 1985.

One of the outcomes of the '85 Nairobi conference was a document
called the Forward-Looking Strategies, which listed a wide range of
areas in which governments around the world had agreed to work to
ensure equality, development and peace for women.  According to Ms.
Keyi-Ayema, who is hoping to be there, one purpose of the Beijing
conference will be to act as a type of report card, for governments
to show the world what progress they've made on improving the status
of women in their own countries with respect to the Nairobi
Strategies.  Another goal will be to finalize agreement on the next
step, called the Platform for Action, which lists eleven "critical
areas of concern" where further action on women's rights is required.

Participants of both the New York preparatory meeting and the
upcoming Beijing conference are organized into two main groups: NGO
(non-governmental organizations) representatives and official
government delegates.  Each group has its own sessions, and in
general one of the roles of the generally more progressively-thinking
NGO reps is to try and influence the extent to which their government
counterparts will commit their countries to positive action on
women's issues.

Not surprisingly, health is one of the identified "critical areas",
and many of the others are in fact determinants of health such as
poverty, human rights, education, and the environment.  In New York,
Women's Health in Women's Hands played an active role in NGO
discussions about health issues and their effects on women.  In fact,
the Toronto-based CHC had been chosen by the Canadian Beijing
Facilitating Committee as the lead group to deal with the "health"
critical area of concern. Their task is to coordinate all the changes
that the NGO women want to lobby the Canadian government to put
forward in the Platform for Action in Beijing.  Among the topics
dealt with were reproductive health issues, maternal and child
health, pre-natal sex selection, female infanticide, female genital
mutilation, female ferticide, early marriages, prostitution, sexual
harassment, and many other aspects of health as they relate
specifically to girls and women of all ages.  Among other things,
WHWH was able to push for budgetary allocations for community health
centres for women, and also contributed some of the wording for the
NGO recommendations.

Achieving consensus on controversial topics in an international
meeting is not always possible, though with each new conference
progress is evident.  Some issues require considerable sensitivity to
ensure that condemnation of a harmful practice, such as female
genital mutilation for example, does not become an attack on the
culture of those countries where the practice is still found.  As Ms.
Keyi-Ayema put it, "You have to separate out the negative practices
from the whole culture - the harmful practices that hinder the
positive aspects of culture."

One key health concept which met with some resistance in New York was
the notion that health is a fundamental human right.  Although
defined as such by no less than the World Health Organization, NGO
participants such as Ms. Keyi-Ayema were dismayed to learn that,
albeit for different reasons, both Canada and the United States
succeeded in having the concept "bracketed" (a U.N. convention where
brackets are placed around wording that is objected to by a
participant, to flag it for further discussions in Beijing). 
Ironically, though Canada is among the closest in practice to a
philosophy of universal health access, its government delegates did
not want health to be named as a fundamental human right for fear
that it could then become subject to litigation.  Americans, on the
other hand, lobbied to include the word "affordable" in the
statements on health care.  Since they do not presently have a system
of universal access to health care, they saw ensuring affordability
as a step forward, at least in respect to their own situation. 
Unfortunately, for countries like Canada it is a step backwards,
changing health from a fundamental right to a consumer product with a
negotiable price tag.  "The minute we start talking about
affordability, we are back to discussing privilege, back to making
health inaccessible to the communities that (CHCs) are trying to
reach," said Ms. Keyi-Ayema.

To her, this issue is but one example of how global issues and local
actions are related.  "The Platform for Action will be very important
for CHCs, because we can look at it and hold the provincial
government accountable to the things that the federal government
agrees to internationally.  That's part of our role as CHCs - to
implement the actions agreed to in Beijing at the community level."

The United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women will be held in
Beijing from August 30 to September 8 for NGOs, and from September 4
to 15 for government delegates.  Over 30,000 people are expected to
attend.  Women's Health in Women's Hands is currently seeking
funding, either from the Canadian Beijing Facilitating Committee or
from a corporate sponsor, to be able to bring the voice of CHCs to
this important international forum.

How do you make "determinants of health" a household expression?

AOHC Promotes the Concept and Attracts Provincial and National
Attention

-- The rationale --

To transform the current system health  care delivery into a health
system, it is essential for people to learn to take charge of their
health and other factors that directly and indirectly affect health. 
At the present time a large sector of the public as well as key
policy and decision makers believe that "health care" is the same as
"Health". Notwithstanding the voluminous studies and reports
available on the effects of the broad determinants of health on the
health status of the community, at the present time, health planning
and funding are still very much directed towards strategies that deal
with illnesses or diseases.

Health educators point to things like poverty, isolation, education,
employment, family supports, environmental conditions and housing as
significant factors - "determinants" - that contribute to or detract
from an individual's overall state of health.  However, anything
related to illnesses/diseases/injuries and the corresponding dramatic
"high tech" doctor/hospital based interventions attract the type of
"headline appeal" that can not help but influence political and
bureaucratic decisions on how health dollars are spent.  In addition
to mass media stories, the entertainment field also invariably
produce material that cater to the notion that salvation can only be
found in a hospital or through a doctor. As such, AOHC decided to
undertake a public education campaign that would be directed at
linking the idea of a person's health status with certain selected
determinants of health.

-- The challenge --

Among the many challenges faced by AOHC in undertaking this project
are:  low budget, tight time frame, translating a concept into a
tangible product, a product that would have a long shelf life, a
product generic enough to gain a broad base of support yet effective
so that message is not diluted, a high quality product that would
encourage broadcasters to donate free air time, seek additional funds
to produce the French version.  In addition, in line with AOHC office
approach to working with consultants, not lose "ownership" of the
process and content and allow learning opportunities for AOHC in the
development and production process as well as learning opportunity
about community health for consultants.

-- The product --

To make "determinants of health" a household expression, AOHC decided
on a multi-media public health education campaign focusing on four
selected determinants of health "employment", "education" "poverty"
and "isolation".  The mode of delivering these messages would be
through TV and radio PSAs, posters and buttons. The PSA campaign
would communicate, by way of simple images and scripts, four
straightforward messages: "isolation determines health", "employment
determines health", "education determines health", and "poverty
determines health".  The messages were decided upon after intensive
internal brainstorming sessions on the merits of negative versus
positive images.  Finally, there was consensus that AOHC needed to
consider the strategies that have been shown to effective in
attracting the viewer or listener's attention.  Four 15-second
television PSAs and four 30-second radio PSAs were produced, each one
containing one of the above messages supported by a few select
statistics to highlight the problem.  For TV, these concepts were
illustrated by visual images that portrayed the issue and hinted at a
solution.  To support the PSAs, corresponding sets of four posters
and buttons were produced which carried the same messages and images
as the ads.

-- The response --

To date, responses to the   AOHC's public health education campaign
has been overwhelmingly positive, both by the media and from
organizations and individuals who have seen the material.  The PSAs
were sent to 93 television stations and 128 radio stations across the
province, with a request for free air time.  A phone follow-up sample
survey indicates that over 90% of these stations are now broadcasting
AOHC's PSAs, or plan to do so in the near future.  Several stations
commented on the professional quality of the material, and described
the ads as interesting, effective or thought-provoking.  In most
cases it was not possible to obtain exact broadcast times, because
the PSAs are often put on the air whenever free time is available. 
The length of time that the ads are kept in rotation is also quite
varied, but several stations noted that as the messages in AOHC's
PSAs are not dated, they  have a longer shelf life than usual.

In addition to sending the PSAs to the media, AOHC also distributed
the campaign material to many health and community organizations, as
well as to key government offices in Ontario and across Canada. 
Almost all have given AOHC very favourable feedback.  Thanks and
compliments have been sent from the offices of the Prime Minister and
the Leader of the Official Opposition, from the Premiers of Ontario,
New Brunswick, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland & Labrador, P.E.I.
and Québec, and from the Health Ministers from Alberta and Manitoba
(see samples of letters on next page).  Many other provinces
commented that they too are working to increase awareness of health
determinants, and feel that the AOHC campaign made a significant
contribution.  Additional letters and calls of support have been
received from the Ontario Ministry of Education and Training, the
Ontario Community Health Branch, and Health Canada, who congratulated
AOHC for taking the lead in attempting to popularize the concept of
determinants of health.

Many community groups in Ontario and beyond responded with interest
and requests for posters and buttons when AOHC announced the
launching of the campaign on "HealthNet", a Canadian Internet mailing
list group.  One respondent from that group, from the Health
Communications Unit of the University of Toronto, felt that the
material was very well done, with a "simple, strong" message.  Many
of the AOHC's member centres were also very positive about the
overall quality and effectiveness of the material, and are
reinforcing local media exposure by displaying the posters and
handing out the buttons, which they say are generating much
discussion on the determinants of health.

As with any public action, it was not all bouquets and applause: a
few CHCs expressed concerns about the way that the campaign's
messages were communicated, and one centre noted that the television
images were inappropriate because they may inadvertently have the
opposite effect of reinforcing a negative self-image of people from
disadvantaged backgrounds.  Another centre felt that the posters were
too "dark and dreary", and some people have expressed disappointment
that "one-liners" were used on the posters instead of explanations or
references to health centres.

All in all, the AOHC campaign has been positively received and has
certainly generated much interest and discussion on health
determinants, both in Ontario and across Canada.  Comments received,
both positive and critical, will be used by the AOHC to improve any
subsequent public awareness campaign.  Judging from the some of the
comments received, many other organizations and governments also wish
to communicate the same message to the public, and AOHC looks forward
to working with others in building upon this first effort.

National CHC Conference Changes Dates (Slightly) and Gears Up (Big
Time)

Canada's second National Conference of Community Health Centres is
shaping up to be quite an event.  It is scheduled to take place at
the Toronto Hilton on October 4,5 and 6, 1995 (not Oct. 5-7 as
previously announced), and conference organizers have been meeting
regularly for several months to shape the programme and make all
necessary arrangements.

The conference, "Taking Back Our Health - CHCs in Canada", will
include the following workshops:

+ Advocacy and Social Action + Determinants of Health + Community
Participation and Governance + Education, Research and Evaluation +
Developing New CHCs + Show and Tell

In addition to the workshops, networking sessions will be held, on
topics such as:

+ How Not to Be Road Kill on the Information Highway + New CHCs -
Getting a Head Start + Partners in Health (Francophone)

Community health centres are operating today in eight out of ten
provinces, as well as in the Northwest Territories.  One aim of the
fall conference is to bring representatives from around the country
together in a founding meeting for a formal national CHC
organization.  To date, communication among the various centres has
been conducted through the more informal CHC Network of Canada.

Organizers are still adding items to the conference agenda, and plan
to have the official programme available for distribution in
mid-summer 1995.  To obtain your copy or find out more about this
historic event, call the AOHC.

More Than Words

patient-directed care:  A trend in medical practice stemming from the
concept that patients should be empowered to make choices (decisions)
as to their own health and health care.  In patient-directed care,
the physician advises and collaborates with the patient in
determining the steps to be taken to discover the causes of problems
and in treating those problems.

respite care:  Short term care (usually a few days) for a long-term
care patient in order to provide a respite (rest and change) for
those who have been caring for the patient, usually the patient's
family.  Respite care may involve hospitalization of the patient, or
provision of round-the-clock care at home or in a nursing home as
needed.

well-baby care:  Health care services to normal babies in order to
detect any problems early and to give preventive advice.  This is the
counterpart of prenatal care for pregnant women.

AOHC Participates in JPPC "Think Tank"

The Restructuring Sub-Committee of the Joint Policy and Planning
Committee (JPPC) recently invited over 80 of the province's leaders
in health and health care to participate in a special two-day "think
tank" session entitled "Advice to Government: Focusing on the Levers
for Change in Healthcare".  Other invited guests included experts
from other Canadian provinces, the U. S. and the U.K. AOHC's
Executive Director Sonny Arrojado was among those who participated.

The JPPC is a partnership between the Ontario Hospital Association,
on behalf of the Ontario public hospitals, and the Ministry of
Health.  Its role is to recommend and facilitate implementation of
hospital reform within the context of the broader health care reform
agenda in Ontario.

To achieve its stated objectives, JPPC brought together leaders in
the field to specifically address the issues of hospital
restructuring and prepare advice for the government.  The stated aim
of the think tank was "to generate innovative and useful ideas ...
about the vision and policy options that might be used to restructure
the Ontario hospital sector".  Discussion topics were organized into
the four main issues of governance and accountability, funding, the
physician role, and the work force.

A remarkably progressive tone for the forum was set by Judith
Maxwell's address which highlighted the need for the critical
consideration of the broad determinants of health in health planning
and funding. The following are excerpts from the initial summation of
the discussions which took place.  The final summary is expected to
be available shortly.

The Larger Context

Prior to dealing with the four (4) primary discussion issues,
participants expressed the need to examine the larger context - the
overall vision of healthcare in this province.  The group consensus
was that there is no apparent clear vision of the desired framework
for healthcare in Ontario, but that there are different visions held
by different participants in the system, from the consumers of
healthcare services to the Ministry itself.

Viewpoints included the acknowledgment that the philosophy of
healthcare goals remains unchanged, that what is needed is an
integrated system with a multidisciplinary perspective, and that the
first decision that must be made is an economically driven political
decision.  There was consensus that the government must show
leadership in articulating, implementing and funding the vision,
while leaving the managed delivery of services to the community. 
Opinions varied as to the definition of "community", but there was
agreement that they may be different sizes and must be independent.

Governance and Accountability

Participants did not agree as to the importance of the governance
issue: for some, it is a mechanism that can facilitate change, but
will not necessarily decrease costs; for others, it provides the
model/framework within which the whole can work more effectively.  It
was clear, however, that no one model will be appropriate for every
situation in Ontario, but that a variety of models will be required. 
The challenge is to create an environment in which organizations can
flourish and excellence is rewarded.  An obstacle is that government
bureaucracies are not aligned with the goal of system integration. 
One model of governance, that of purchaser/provider, was explored in
detail.

Funding

It was agreed that a vision of the future for hospital funding
includes a desire to deliver the right care at the lowest level of
intervention for the least cost. Several requirements for this to
occur were put forth, including a competitive environment that
promotes consumer choice while containing cost and maintaining
effectiveness, and incentives that promote appropriate behaviour
change.  Among the funding challenges identified in the current
system are: the Ministry of Health structure which prevents creative
opportunities for improved cost-effectiveness and efficiency, a
historical disregard for differences in geographical, economic and
socio-demographic environments throughout Ontario, a lack of
cooperation among providers, a lack of risk-sharing by physicians and
hospitals, a lack of political will, a lack of communication and
planning within the system, and the current physician payment system
that encourages a volume-driven system.

It was agreed that funding provides the most compelling argument for
changes in behaviour for consumers, providers and governments. 
Incentives to find alternate delivery options are key.  It was
recognized that government needs to create the necessary legislation
and then stay out of operations management, and to consider the
entire continuum of care, understanding the full range of
determinants of health.

Physician Role

Participants suggested that primary care should be integrated and
that a team-based approach should be developed.  Unfortunately, in
this vision, primary care physicians will assume a gatekeeper role
and have the responsibility to "manage" their patients through the
system.  It was recognized that the existing system has barriers to
communication and cooperation, and that the current focus on volume
does not encourage physicians to "do the right things".

Among the solutions put forth was the suggestion that capitation
funding for primary care physicians should be supplemented by
incentives based on specific service targets.  It was also thought
that a move to a purchaser/provider model would provide the "key
lever" for changing the role of the physician, with fund envelopes
administered through regional authorities.  Primary care physicians
should be the purchasers for a defined range of services, and medical
education must be restructured to align with this new vision. 
Incentives also need to be aligned for physicians and hospitals.  A
variety of models can be implemented for remunerating hospital-based
physicians, and a variety of incentives and disincentives can be
instituted to create desired behaviours.

The Work Force

A smaller, older workforce, with more part-time workers and
generalists is predicted for the future.  This vision includes
stronger community partnerships in local workforce decisions, local
approaches for workforce adjustment based on individual communities'
needs, and the downward delegation of authority  to teams based on
commonality of purpose.  In this vision organized and unorganized
labour participate and develop new relationships.

To achieve the above noted vision, participants had a lengthy list of
factors that needed to be overcome such as the lack of public
understanding, the lack recognition of the consuming public as
"client" rather than "patient", the existing confrontational
collective bargaining process, the lack of research on the
availability of alternate jobs in other sectors, and the insecurity
and low morale within the workforce, among others.

In addition to the new HSTAP programme to facilitate workforce
readjustment, additional initiatives were thought to include a clear
articulation of the healthcare vision for the province, government
efforts to improve the bargaining structure and process, support for
community empowerment and community involvement in healthcare
workforce adjustment to broaden the perspective on alternate jobs.

A pervasive theme in the discussion was the concept of redefining
employability - moving to "people security" rather than "job
security", reskilling the workers for continuous learning,
versatility and flexibility.

National CHC Organization Established

Representatives of Community Health Centres across the country turned
a new page in Canadian health care history recently with the creation
of the first national CHC organization, the Canadian Alliance of
Community Health Centre Associations (CACHCA). The new organization
was founded on Friday, October 6, 1995 during the Second National
Conference of CHCs in Toronto, hosted by AOHC and attended by over
200 representatives from community health centres across Canada.

For many years CHCs worked together as an informal network and  the
recent Founding Meeting marked the  beginning of a formal alliance
whose main objective is to ensure the provision of better health
services for individuals and their families in communities across the
country.   CACHCA will use the extensive expertise and experience of
its member organizations to promote the CHC model as an excellent
example of successful and cost-effective primary health care.

Community Health Centres are not-for-profit, community-based
organizations that provide primary health care services using
multidisciplinary teams of health providers -- which often include
physicians, nurse practitioners, dietitians, health promoters,
counsellors and others - - that are paid by salary.  Services are
designed to meet the specific health needs of a defined community. 
In addition, CHCs provide a variety of health promotion and illness
prevention services which focus on raising awareness of the broader
factors affecting health such as employment, education, environment,
isolation and poverty.  CHCs have been in existence in Canada since
the 1920's, when the first centre was established in Manitoba.  
Today there are over 300 CHCs across Canada.

With the CACHCA by-laws adopted and the founding board of directors
formally constituted, the Alliance is poised and ready to contribute
a strong community voice to the current national debate on health
care reform.  According to founding CACHCA Chairperson Dennise
Albrecht, "Many of the remedies that are now being proposed for the
health care system as a whole have already been working in community
health centres for years.  In communities fortunate enough to have
them, CHCs have long been showing that there are viable alternatives
to fee-for-service."  The Alliance believes that CHCs are an
effective model for primary care delivery.  As Ms. Albrecht stated,
"These centres work well -- not only in providing primary health care
needed by individuals, families and communities, but also as proven
mechanisms for actively involving people in optimizing their health."

The founding meeting was attended by CHC representatives from British
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  The organization's
first board of directors includes: Chair Dennise Albrecht of the
Sandy Hill CHC in Ottawa; Vice Chair Terry Kaufman of the CLSC N.D.G.
in Montreal; Treasurer John Silver of Reach CHC in Vancouver;
Secretary Patrick Lapointe of the Community Health Services
Association of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon; Patti Sullivan of Klinic
CHC in Winnipeg; Debbie MacDonald-Connoly of Sherwood CHC in
Charlottetown; Sharon Thurston of Boyle-McCauley Health Centre in
Edmonton; Carolann Wright of North End CHC in Halifax; Sonny Arrojado
of the AOHC in Toronto; and Maurice Payette of the Federation des
CLSC de Quebec in Katevale.

AOHC Releases Primary Care Position Paper

The Association of Ontario Health Centres chose the recent national
CHC conference in Toronto as the venue for the release of a new
position paper on primary care entitled "Building on Success: A
Blueprint for Effective Primary Health Care".  At a news conference
attended by health reporters from the major dailies, AOHC Executive
Director Sonny Arrojado announced the paper's release and outlined
the relevance of the paper's salient features to the current health
reform debate.

The paper is latest expression of AOHC's ongoing call for effective
reform of the province's health care system, an initiative that needs
a  shift of emphasis to community based health services.  Figures
quoted in the document drive the point home: "At the present time,
more than 90% of the over 17 billion dollars that Ontario spends in
health care goes to disease/illness care.  Only a minimal portion
goes to illness prevention."  The report goes on to say, "Limiting
the scope of health services to treatment of disease/illness ignores
the capacity of the individual and the community to be actively
responsible for their health.  Effective primary health care
addresses factors that directly and indirectly affect the health and
lives of the people in the community.  It encourages people to be
self-reliant and to share responsibility for their health with the
health provider."

Sub-titled "A Proposal from the Association of Ontario Health
Centres", the "Building on Success" document recommends several key
components for effective primary health care delivery.  Specifically,
the paper calls for the integration of:

•	community direction and accountability
•	a range of services and approaches
•	a team approach
•	partnerships and collaboration
•	leadership and innovation

Much of the position paper is devoted to exploring and explaining
each of these key recommended elements, pointing out the benefits
that these can bring to an improved health care system.  Several
real-life examples taken from daily experiences at community health
centres across the province are used as examples of how the
previously noted elements are applied on a practical basis.

The AOHC paper highlights a excellent opportunity to build on
approaches to health services delivery, already in existence iin
Ontario, that have been shown to be successful in integrating the
critical elements essential to effective primary health care. Indeed,
many of the health system reforms that are currently being considered
by various groups across Canada (as seen in documents such as the
"Kilshaw" Report - see article, page 8) have already been implemented
in CHCs, where extensive community involvement, a multidisciplinary
team approach, a range of available services, and a viable
alternative to fee-for-service payments are not theory but daily
practice.  As the paper concludes, "

The CHC model embodies these elements and is an excellent example of
how an effective primary health care model works."

NAME="eval"></A>****************************************************************

Evaluation Project Update

The AOHC/MOH sponsored Evaluation Project, focused on developing a
CHC-wide evaluation plan, is moving along at a more rapid pace. 
Involvement of representatives from all CHCs in the province has been
a key to the development of the evaluation framework to date.

A representative from each CHC has volunteered to act as a liaison
between their centre and the team guiding the development of the
framework, the CHC Program Evaluation Work Group.  They have
volunteered their assistance for the one-and-a-half year duration of
the project.  These site representatives are responsible for
disseminating information to their centres about the project's
progress and about the elements of the evaluation plan as they are
developed.  They are also responsible for co-ordinating their
centres' feedback to the consultants and the Project Steering
Committee, so that adjustments to the elements of the framework can
be made during the development process.  In essence, these site
representatives keep the project alive in CHCs across the province.

Additional CHC representatives have given their time, and will
continue to participate, in working sessions designed to develop the
details of the CHC-wide evaluation framework.  These working sessions
will be held throughout November and December.

A report reviewing both the research literature that could be
relevant to the CHC evaluation framework and the results of a CHC
survey examining the current status of evaluation activity and human
and technological evaluation resources available across the CHC
system is now completed.  CHC site representatives' assistance in the
survey effort was invaluable!

The main themes or objectives around which the evaluation framework
will be developed have  been identified and include:  accessibility
of CHCs; the provision of co-ordinated and efficient services; 
improving the health and well-being of individuals and the community
through prevention;increasing individual and community control over
determinants of health; and the provision of holistic programs,
activities and services.

The key evaluation questions related to each of the themes
highlighted above have also been developed in draft form.  The
assistance of the CHC site representatives and working session
participants has ensured that this important phase of the project has
been reached.

And the work goes on ... We will keep you updated on the progress of
the project.

Community Health Week

When AOHC launched the first annual Community Health Week (CHW) last
year, the objective was to raise public awareness throughout Ontario
of the relationship between the factors that affect the health of
individuals, their families and communities.  This year, over 35
Ontario community health centres (CHCs) celebrated CHW with their
various communities through displays, open houses, lectures and other
special events during the week of September 29 to October 6 with this
year's theme of "Taking Back Our Health".   The theme was an urgent
call for community responsibility, action and self reliance in the
matter of life and health.  Overall reports indicate that most events
were very successful.  Many organizers noted that the CHW provided
opportunities for individuals, families and communtities to discuss,
with CHCs and other community agencies, ways to address health
issues. Some highlights from CHW:

Mary Berglund CHC Makes the Papers

The Mary Berglund CHC in Ignace attracted media attention for their
celebration of CHW in their community, officially started by Board
Acting Chairperson Sherry Gascon and Ignace Reeve Andre Tardiff, at a
kick-off Community Walk.  Among the activities undertaken by the CHC
were: a community meeting at Ignace Public Library to generate
interest in developing a community committee to provide palliative
care to those who are terminally ill,  a Blood Pressure Clinic, an
Influenza Vaccine Clinic which proved to be "overwhelmingly
successful".  According to Suzanne Smith, Mary Berglund's Human
Services Co-ordinator "It was a good way to bring many people in in
one night - we really hit our target population," which were seniors
and those with chronic illnesses.   The week ended with a Community
Forum, featuring presentations by the CHC's Chairperson, Executive
Director and a CHC physician, as well as by representatives from the
ambulance service, home care and the Health Unit.  It proved to be an
excellent forum for information dissemination and exchange on CHC
services and how they relate to other agencies.

Generating Discussion

Guelph CHC used CHW to generate community and internal discussions on
the determinants of health.  Guelph CHC co-hosted a public forum at
the Holiday Inn featuring Dr. Fraser Mustard speaking on "Economic
Growth, Human Development and the Implications for Community Health
Planning".  Over 120 community members attended the talk, which "tied
in quite nicely to Community Health Week themes," according to Mary
McNally, Co-ordinator of Health Promotion Programs.  The CHC also
took time consider the determinants of health, role and mandate of
CHCs as well as the early childhood intervention research paper
developed recently by Guelph CHC's Infant Development Program, an
in-service with about 20 staff members gave much

Grand Opening in Ottawa

The Somerset West CHC celebrated CHW with the Grand Opening of a new
computer recycling and training program at the Ottawa Boys and Girls
Club.  The program, entitled "Bits and Pieces", provides young people
with an opportunity to learn high-tech skills by repairing and
re-assembling old or broken computers obtained from the federal
government.  In addition to this inauguration, Executive Assistant
Linnet O'Connell-Graham says that other CHW events, which included a
Seniors Tea and a Community Lunch, were successful.  The lunch, which
brought people from the community together with agency workers and
politicians, attracted about 80 people to informally talk about the
community and at the same time enjoy the good cooking provided by a
community volunteer.

Language Determines Health

For Nancy Nadeau, Community Nurse at the Centre Medico Social
Communautaire in Toronto, CHW was a good time for her centre to bring
important health information to the city's francophone community. 
The CHC lined up a radio interview at Radio Canada to promote their
French Medical Interpreter Service, which arranges interpreters for
francophone clients interacting with English-speaking health
professionals.  In addition to accompanying clients to appointments
and interviews, the service also provides French-speaking labour
coaches, assists visiting clients in finding inexpensive temporary
lodging while in town for medical appointments, orients those
visitors to Toronto, and co-ordinates visits to the hospital.  The
radio interview helped to raise awareness of the availability of  the
service among Toronto francophones, and underlined the importance of
language to the health consumer.  In addition to the interview, CMSC
also hosted a tour of their centre to approximately 40 participants
of the national CHC conference, held in Toronto during CHW, and
collaborated with the Centre des Pionniers to provide information to
the elderly on the relation between alcohol and medication
consumption.

Visiting in Thunder Bay

For Thunder Bay's Ogden East-End CHC, CHW was an occasion to open its
doors to educators and students and explain the centre's services and
programs.  Health Promoter Alison McMullen said that the centre used
the week to explain what they do, first to a tour of 18 teachers from
a local school, and then to a group of 56 Nursing students from
Lakehead University.  The teachers, who had previously identified a
need for a counsellor at the CHC, were provided an opportunity to
meet the counsellor and discuss how she could work with them.  At the
nurses' visit, Ogden East-End staff members told stories about their
on-the-job experiences, prompting students to comment that they
benefited from "hearing it like it is".  Other CHW events at the
centre included a planning meeting with local seniors, and an annual
general meeting that featured a community panel discussion on the
past and future of the CHC. (See also "Health Fair Attracts

Minister of Health, MPP Helen Johns , Liberal Health Critic Elinor
Caplan and NDP Health Critic Floyd Laughren individually toured the
Fair and spoke with exhibitors.   In brief speeches, each speaker
acknowledged the important role of community agencies in the health
of the community. Each speaker also reaffirmed their party's support
for the CHC model of providing health services to the community. Ms.
Johns subsequently expressed the government's support of the Fair and
AOHC in a statement to the Ontario Legislative Assembly (see inset,
below).

Community health centres represented at the fair included Access
Alliance, Black Creek CHC, Centre Medico Social Communautaire,
Davenport-Perth CHC, East End CHC, Flemingdon Health Centre, Four

MPP Helen John's Statement in the Legislative  Assembly October 3,
1995

"Yesterday, I had the pleasure of sponsoring and speaking at the
Community Health Fair on the front lawns of the Legislature.  It was
sponsored by the Association of Ontario Health Centres and launched
the second annual Community Health Week.  This year's theme is
entitled Taking Back Our Health.  In other words, in the words of the
executive director of the association: 'Meaningful health reform can
only be achieved through the active involvement of individuals,
families and communities.  [This] is an urgent call for community
responsibility, action and self-reliance in the matter of life and
health.'  Over 50 agencies, including community health centres,
presented information about the important factors that affect our
health.  Community Health Centres are the kind of innovative
organizations that this government wants to encourage.  Community
Health Centres have strong community involvement, high volunteer
participation and foster partnership with other non-profit and
charitable groups from outside government.  Many of the community
health centres have also been leaders in making maximum use of their
limited resources, and I would like to take this opportunity to
congratulate them on their outstanding contributions to our
community."

CHCs Across Canada - A Progress Report -

Participants of the recent National Conference of CHCs in Toronto
were provided an up to date briefing on CHC activities across the
country during a special session entitled "Cross Canada Check-Up". 
This session featured descriptions and updates by representatives
from nine provinces where community health centres are active.  The
reports highlighted the similarities and differences that exist among
CHCs in different locations, and the varying degrees to which each
province has utilized the CHC model to date.  The following is a
brief summary of the Cross Canada Check-Up reports that were given at
the conference:

Prince Edward Island

Report given by: Debbie MacDonald-Connoly, Program Developer of
Sherwood CHC in Charlottetown

At present, there are two developing CHCs in P.E.I., one urban and
one rural.  For approximately 18 months the province has had a
regionalized structure; the government funds five provincial health
agencies which are responsible for the allocation of resources, the
delivery of services and the setting of direction.  The province is
committed and currently working towards the use of the
"interdisciplinary" model, and towards having physicians on salary. 
There are changes occurring within the hospital sector: smaller rural
hospitals are being affected (and some re-named as CHCs), and there
is downsizing of hospitals for long term care.  For CHCs to grow,
there needs to be more community involvement, a funding base, and
legislation.

Nova Scotia

Report given by: Heather McCleave, Health Team Coordinator at North
End CHC in Halifax

CHCs were first started in Nova Scotia twenty-five years ago.  Today
there are eight CHCs receiving varying levels of financial support
from the government: one urban CHC and one rural CHC receive funds
from the Ministry of Health, while the other six do not.  Except for
one salaried physician in an urban CHC, the CHC doctors are currently
paid by fee-for-service.  In Nova Scotia there are plans for
Community Health Boards, elected from the community and involved in
policy and planning (though not service delivery) at the local level,
and Regional Health Boards, made up of ex-hospital executives, for
financial management and delivery of acute care.  Support for the CHC
concept has been given by the Department of Health's O'Brien Report
and the Royal Commission of Health's Goals.

New Brunswick

Report given by: Monica Chaperlin, Director of the Community Health
Centre, St. Joseph's Hospital in St. John

In New Brunswick, where 80% of the population is rural, two pilot
CHCs were begun in 1993.  They are funded by the government and
governed by the regional hospital corporations in their areas.  One
CHC is rural and the other is urban; to date only the rural CHC has a
physician.  Provincial concerns which will affect the CHC movement
include hospital closures, a lack of physicians, and the impact of
cost-cutting measures.  Nevertheless, there is much potential for
CHCs.  They require a higher profile, more credibility, more
resources, and an evaluation process in order to generate the public
and political will to support the growth of CHCs.

Quebec

Report given by: Terry Kaufman, Executive Director of the CLSC N.D.G.
in Montreal

The province of Quebec has the most developed CHC program in the
country, comprised of 161 CLSCs ("centres locaux de services
communautaires", or Local Community Service Centres).  Of those, most
are rural, and five (5) have small hospitals as part of their
operations.  The CLSC program has a $750 million budget, and includes
1,200 physicians, 95% of whom are on salary.  They are governed by a
group that includes an Executive Director, five elected community
members, three appointed members and three staff.  All CLSCs offer
primary health and psychosocial services.  A recent study by the
Quebec Health Service revealed a higher level of psychosocial
problems than physical health problems within the population. 
Several issues are of concern to CLSCs at present, including: added
pressures due to hospital downsizings, the impact of federal cuts,
the impact of the upcoming referendum, increased resource needs, and
the relationship between CLSC and private physicians.

Ontario

Report given by: Sonny Arrojado, Executive Director of the
Association of Ontario Health Centres in Etobicoke

There are currently 56 CHCs in Ontario, of which approximately two
thirds are located in urban areas.  They range in size from having
one to 75 staff members.  CHCs are funded by the Community Health
Branch of the Ministry of Health.  At least forty per cent of Ontario
CHCs are multi-service, and receive part of their funding from
sources other than the Ministry of Health, such as other Ministries,
municipalities, and federal sources.  Concerns that presently affect
CHCs include current government spending cuts, hospital
restructuring, and health reform uncertainty.  Work is being done
provincially by AOHC to put CHCs forward as a recommended model for
primary care delivery at the community level.  In addition, the AOHC
recently completed a well-received public information campaign to
increase awareness of the broader determinants of health.

Manitoba

Report given by: Barbara Wiktorowicz, Executive Director of Women's
Health Clinic in Winnipeg

Manitoba is the site of the country's oldest CHC, Mount Carmel, which
was started in the 1920's.  Today there are 14 CHCs in the province,
nine rural and five urban, that are members of the Manitoba
Association of CHCs.  In addition, there are five other CHCs not
affiliated with the provincial organization.  Overall, CHCs in
Manitoba have various funding arrangements and offer a range of
different services.  Federal funding cuts are a concern for CHCs.
While the government's 1992 vision for health reform was commendable,
it subsequently  cut hospital beds without re-allocating funds to the
community.  Several factors are required to boost the CHC model,
including public and health professional education about CHCs,
effective outcome evaluation, political support and greater
involvement by community boards.

Saskatchewan

Report given by: Patrick Lapointe, Executive Director of the
Community Health Services Association of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon

In Saskatchewan, a 1963 medical crisis resulted in the establishment
of 15 CHCs, 10 of which have closed since the crisis passed.  Today,
the remaining five CHCs serve approximately 85,000 people, which
represents about 10% of the population.  Two of the CHCs are co-ops
and three are under the Mutual Health and Medical Benefit Act. The
five are recognized as CHCs according to the community definition
endorsed by the new Canadian Alliance of Community Health Centre
Associations, but there are also examples where the province has
closed approximately 52 rural hospitals and converted them to CHCs
without community ownership.  There is a need for a common management
information system and a need to market the CHC concept in the
province.

Alberta

Report given by: Sharon Thurston, Executive Director of the
Boyle-McCauley Health Centre in Edmonton

Alberta has had CHCs for 23 years.  Today there are three urban CHCs
that serve priority groups such as low income, aboriginal and ethnic
groups.  The CHCs are funded by Alberta Health and regional health
authorities.  The province is also downsizing some hospitals and
renaming them as CHCs, and this is also occurring with one health
unit.  For the past three to four years there has been an informal
provincial CHC program, but it has limited resources.  There is
little support for CHCs in the province because the public is largely
uninformed about them.  Concerns that CHCs face at present include
the rapid and constant changes put in place by the provincial
government, and the threats to Medicare with privatization creating a
two-tiered system.  CHCs need to change from being reactive to
proactive, build alliances, gain resources and increase public
education. British Columbia

Report given by: Robin McMillan, Executive Manager of Programs at the
James Bay Community Project in Victoria

There are between six and nine CHCs in British Columbia, as there is
no standard definition of CHCs in the province at present.  There is
no provincial CHC association.  There was a Ministry of Health
document about CHCs approximately two years ago that spoke of
regionalization and integration, but the outcome has been different
in different cases.  CHCs in the province recognize the need for
political support and public education.

Primary Care Models - A Comparison of PCOs and CHCs

In early October, the July 1995 report of the Advisory Committee on
Health Services to the Conference of Ministers of Health entitled "A
Model for the Reoorganization and Funding of Primary Care and the
Introduction of Population-based Funding"  was publicly released.

The report is a discussion document which describes a model for
change in the way that the primary care system in Canada is organized
and funded.  This move was in response to direction given at the
September, 1994 meeting of the Federal/Provincial/Territorial
Conference of Ministers of Health for the development of a strategic
plan for the establishment of population-based (capitation) funding
for primary care physicians.  The report, commonly known as the
"Kilshaw Report" is attracting much attention, and is generally
regarded to be a positive step in the process of primary care reform.

The report introduces a model of care known as a "primary care
organization,"and proposes a range of organizational requirements and
fundamental responsibilities which would apply to these
organizations.  One fundamental characteristic of primary care
organizations is their capitation-based funding, a clear alternative
to Fee-for-service.

What is of particular interest is that Ontario community health
centres have, for more than twenty years, already sucessfully
implemented many of the "newly recommended" solutions being proposed
in relation to the proposed primary care organization model. 
Elements such as the rejection of fee-for-service as a funding and
payment modality, support for the utilization of a range of health
providers in delivering primary care, and a focus on prevention and
health education are just some of the direct similarities to
community health centres.

Although the  paper represents a positive step in the process of
primary care reform, opportunities for further discussions around
those elements of the model which are still felt to be somewhat
regressive will be welcome.  An example of one of the more
traditional elements of the model is the idea that the primary care
organization would be centred around physician services.  Another
concern is the more limited approach to health education & health
promotion which primary care organizations would take, based on the
description in the document.

The table illustrated in the next page identifies selected
characteristics of a primary care organization described in "A model
for the Reorganization of Primary Care and the Introduction of
Population-Based Funding" considered at the recent meeting (Victoria,
B.C.) of health ministers in comparison with the existing Community
Health Centre model in Ontario.

Ontario Health Minister Jim Wilson, at a recent meeting with AOHC
representatives, indicated that the Ministry of Health will be
developing a formal response to the "Kilshaw Report".  He also noted
that the AOHC paper: "Building On Success:  A Blueprint For Effective
Primary Care" is among the reports on primary care being considered
by the  Ministry.

CHCs to be Featured at OHA / OHPA Workshop

The Ontario Hospital Association, in conjunction with the Ontario
Health Providers Alliance, will sponsor a special workshop on
November 23 and 24, 1995 entitled "Health Care Facilities and the
Community: Working Better Together".

As part of the program for this conference, the Somerset West
Community Health Centre will be featured in a session exploring
different models of primary care service delivery.  Somerset West CHC
Executive Director Jack McCarthy and CHC physician Donna Bowers will
present the CHC viewpoint at this session.

Additional CHC representation at this conference will be provided by
Carolyn Acker, Executive Director of Regent Park Community Health
Centre, who will participate in a panel presentation later in the day
on pioneering linkages between programs and services.

Workshop sponsors hope to bring together hospitals, long term care
organizations, community health agencies and organizations, and
health provider groups in order to facilitate open dialogue and
improve service linkages.

Specific objectives of the program are: a) to communicate the role of
the Ontario Health Providers Alliance in fostering partnerships in
the health care community; b) to communicate ideas and concerns
between hospitals, health centres, long term care organizations, and
their community service partners; c) to provide strategies for
partnership and encourage the adoption of best practices in
communication and co-ordination between health care facilities and
the community; d) to provide examples of successful links between
health care facilities and community programs and services; and e) to
encourage collaboration in health promotion, prevention and treatment
initiatives.

AOHC has been a member of the Ontario Health Providers Alliance since
its inception in 1993.  The Alliance has eighteen member
organizations from four main sectors: hospital, long-term care,
community-based and specific health providers.  The organizations
first met informally as a result of Social Contract talks under the
previous government.

"Health Care Facilities and the Community: Working Better Together"
will take place at the Ontario Hospital Association's Conference
Centre in Toronto.  For registration or more information, contact the
OHA Education and Convention Services at 416-429-2661 Ext. 3302/5591.

CHC Physician Editor of Prescription Guide for Primary Care Providers

After more than two years of development, what was to be a study of
prescribing practices in CHCs and HSOs has been released as a book
for primary care providers. Editors and physicians Mitchell Levine,
Joel Lexchin and Rosana Pellizzari (Davenport Perth CHC) have
published a formulary entitled Drugs of Choice: A Formulary for
General Practice, which addresses over 130 common primary care
problems. The book gives prescribers recommendations which are
evidence-based and cost-effective.  For each problem, the formulary
identifies the best published information and then rates the strength
of the evidence consistent with ratings used for practice guidelines.
The editors will direct all proceeds from sales of the book to
continuous, ongoing updating of the entries. The book, which was
initially hoped to be piloted in member AOHC centres, was supported
in part by a grant from the Drug Reform Secretariat of the Ontario
Ministry of Health.  The cost, which includes shipping, handling and
taxes, is $16.21 for Canadian Medical Association members, and $19.42
for non-members. Drugs of Choice is available from Membership
Services, Canadian Medical Association, 1867 Alta Vista Drive,
Ottawa, ON  K1G 3Y6.  Call 1-800-663-7336 or 613-731-8610, ext. 2307,

Determinants of Health Campaign Message Continues to Spread

Ten months after the AOHC launched its public awareness campaign on
the determinants of health, support and interest in the campaign
continues to grow throughout the province and around the country.

First made public by the AOHC in February 1995, several television
and radio stations are still giving free air time to the
"Determinants of Health Public Service Announcements.  At the same
time AOHC also distributed copies of the "Determinants of Health"
posters and buttons to all federal and provincial ministers of
health, many of whom subsequently sent letters of commendation to the
Association for taking the lead in this venture.

The 15-second television and 30-second radio PSAs use straightforward
statements and images to make the point that isolation, employment,
education and poverty all determine health.  Television stations in
Ontario such as CBC, YTV, the Life Network, CHCH and CFMT have
broadcast the PSAs recently, some up to four times a day.  As well,
the messages will likely be aired in other parts of the country. 
AOHC recently approved a request from the Health & Community Services
Agency, in Prince Edward Island, for the use of the AOHC PSAs in
their province.

The "Determinants of Health" posters and buttons also remain popular.
 In addition to continued positive reaction to the items at AOHC
displays and conferences, over 800 posters and close to 4,000 buttons
have been ordered by many Ontario CHCs, as well as by a wide variety
of groups across the country, including: U. of T.'s Department of
Occupational Therapy, the Jewish Vocational Society in Toronto, the
Boyle-McCauley Health Centre in Edmonton, the District Health's Rural
Health and Development Department in Saskatoon, North Shore Health in
North Vancouver, the Ontario Healthy Communities Secretariat, St.
Joseph's Community Health Centre and Stone Church Family Health
Centre in Hamilton, the Algoma Health Unit, Street Health Toronto,
the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, and Sherwood Community
Health Centre in Prince Edward Island.

The positive response to AOHC's initial efforts to bring the
"determinants of health" concept to the public forum have struck a
responsive chord among many decision policy and decision makers,
communities and community workers, both within Ontario and across
Canada.

The campaign is intended to be a starting point in generating public
debate and conciousness of the impact of various factors on the
health of individuals, families and communities and ways of health
issues.

<H2>I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHC) and some health service organizations (HSO) in Ontario. 
Our mission is to represent member centres in the "promotion of healthy public policy,
healthy individuals and communities through the creation and continuing development of
health centres which embody principles of accessible quality primary care, health
promotion and active community ownership and participation."
<P>
As such, AOHC believes that the reform of Ontario's health care system is long
overdue.  In various submissions to government over the past few years, we have called
for measures that would result in the achievement of Ontario's Health Goals. 
Notwithstanding the Ontario government's formal adoption of these goals in 1987, they
have remained largely rhetoric to date. A review of the funding allocation within the
Ministry of Health over the past five (5) years revealed no significant shift in
either policy or funding to illness prevention and health promotion services.  
<P>
Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party promised to preserve the province's health
care funding at $17.4 billion with the commitment to change the status quo.
Nonetheless, the November 1995 Economic Statement  showed that policy does not easily
translate into implementation and that front-end, preventive community-based services
are still not regarded as priority.  The demands for chronic and acute care, as well
as emergency services, are significant, and are likely to grow with the aging of
Ontario's population.  Health promotion and disease prevention programs and services
which do not instantly address dramatic "life and death" situations, such as those
found in acute or chronic care situations, cannot compete for the attention of the
media and policy/decision makers.    Instead of simply responding to pressures created
by ongoing demands for acute or chronic care services, there is currently a window of
opportunity to make the long overdue shift to build up community services.  
<P>
The current funding "silos", largely historic in origin, have not been based on health
needs and have no place in a reformed health system.    Options that could be
considered in designing a funding system that will allow us to track effectiveness of
health strategies include developing funding categories according to promotion,
prevention, early intervention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.  
<P>
The AOHC is convinced that health reform can only be achieved if there is accord
between health and financial policies.   Lack of congruence between these areas will
inevitably result in barriers which will jeopardize the emergence of a truly reformed
health care system.    We urge the Standing Committee on Finances and Economic Affairs
to seriously consider the following recommendations: 
<P>
<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS:</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>We strongly recommend that the "silo" approach to the Ministry of Health budget
allocation be revamped in favour of funding allocation according to identified
objectives.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that wellness, health promotion, illness prevention and
other early intervention strategies be identified as a priority in funding allocation.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that, at the very least, an additional allocation of  $700
million be transferred to community services from savings derived from other sources
within the Ministry of Health budget.
<P>
<LI>We further recommend that, such transfer be implemented on an incremental basis
over the next three (3) years  (1996/97, 1997/98, 1998/99).
<P>
<LI>We recommend that the additional allocation to community services be directed to
organizations with the capacity to provide:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>better coordination of care across community-based services and coordination with
more restricted hospital-based services
<P>
<LI>more responsive community-based promotion, prevention and early identification of
health issues (for example, through public health services and resources in community
health centres) in order to reduce the need for hospital-based services
<P>
<LI>pre-natal and post-natal supports to families to promote healthier child and youth
development which will ultimately improve the overall health of Ontarians
<P>
<LI>greater access to some services which have traditionally been hospital-based, such
as laboratory services, through community-based provision of these services
<P>
<LI>community-based follow-up after hospital discharge to reduce the likelihood of
hospital readmission and/or extended use of hospital-based services
<P>
<LI>physiotherapy and occupational therapy prior to hospital procedures to reduce
hospital stays as well as after hospital-based procedures.

<H2>II.	INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHC) and some health service organizations (HSO) in Ontario. 
AOHC has 60 member centres supporting thousands of Ontarians, directly in primary
health services, counselling, housing, employment and other programs, and benefiting
many others indirectly through  health promotion and capacity building activities for
individuals, families and communities.  The scope of the programs and services
provided by health centres is reflected in the following AOHC mission:
<P>
To represent member centres in the promotion of healthy public policy, healthy
individuals and communities through the creation and continuing development of health
centres which embody principles of accessible quality primary care, health promotion
and active community ownership and participation.
<P>
Accordingly, over the past few years, the AOHC has called strongly for the reform of
Ontario's health care system.  Although various "health reform initiatives" have been
initiated over the past few years, the health care "system" has remained fundamentally
untouched.  Despite various attempts to undertake system reform, the "silo" system of
health services planning, funding and delivery has remained intact while system costs
have continued to rise.  
<P>
The lack of momentum in the reform of Ontario's health care system was acknowledged by
the Hon. Jim Wilson, Minister of Health, in his remarks regarding Bill 26: The Savings
and Restructuring Act, 1995 when he stated: "Anyone who knows anything about Ontario's
health care system recognizes the need to stop tinkering with it and to move ahead
with comprehensive reform of the system itself."    AOHC believes that comprehensive
reform can only take place if the "silo" approach to the Ministry of Health budget
allocation is revamped in favour of funding allocation according to identified
objectives.
<A NAME="step"></A>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>III. STEPS TO REFORM</H2>
<P>
The Ministry of Health budget is approximately 34% of the over $50 billion in
operating expenditures of the Ontario Budget.    As such, it plays a pivotal role in
the lives and health of Ontarians both as funders and consumers of the system. Policy
announcements made by the current Progressive Conservative government in Ontario
strongly suggest the presence of the political will to undertake the complex and
difficult task of  reforming the system.  As stated in the September 27, 1995 Speech
From The Throne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>".....Everyone knows that simply throwing more money at health care is not
the answer.  The public and professionals who work in the system agree that the
government does not need to spend more on health care; it needs to spend dollars more
effectively.  Within the health care budget are the potential for savings and
opportunities for reinvestment.  We will continue to redirect savings in ways that
maximise outcomes and provide the greatest benefit to people."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The AOHC generally agrees with the above noted objective.  However, we believe that,
"in redirecting savings in ways that maximise outcomes and provide the greatest
benefit to people", there are critical elements that require government's particular
attention.  Simply shifting dollars from one area to another is not reform.  In
shifting health care spending, the focus must be more on wellness than on treatment. 
Health promotion, illness prevention and other early intervention approaches need to
be considered alongside the curative/treatment oriented approaches. The PC Party made
the following commitment in the "Bringing Common Sense to Health Care" (BCSTHC)
document:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"A key way to contain health care costs and effectively manage resources
is to invest in preventive health care.  The best health care system is one that
promotes wellness and prevents illness." </BLOCKQUOTE>  
<P>
This commitment fits well with recommendations from a variety of reports, particularly
those released in 1991 by the Premier's Council on Health Strategy which identified
specific health goals for Ontario.
<A NAME="ont"></A><P>
<H3>a) Ontario Health Goals</H3>
<P>
The context for what a reformed system should produce has been set several years ago. 
In 1992, government adopted, as government policy, the health goals identified in the
1991 report of the former Premier's Council on Health Strategy report entitled "A
Vision of Health:  Health Goals For Ontario". These health goals are as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>shift the emphasis to health promotion and disease prevention;
<LI>foster strong supportive families and communities;
<LI>ensure a safe, high quality physical environment;
<LI>increase the number of years of good health for the citizens of Ontario by
reducing illness, disability and premature death;
<LI>provide accessible, affordable, appropriate health services for all.
</UL>
<P>
Albeit formally adopted as government policy and endorsed by all three (3) Ontario
political parties, the health goals have remained largely rhetoric to date.   This
rather unique multi-party support was affirmed by the leaders of the three (3)
political parties (Harris, McLeod, Rae) in a pre-election survey in early 1995.  In
fact, the 1991 Premier's Council on Health Strategy , recommended to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"redirect resources within the health care envelope so that, by 2000,
resource allocation to community services is doubled to 10%."</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
Five years later, the above recommendation has not resulted in a significant dent in
the health care system, a system which has continued to operate under the longstanding
emphasis on the curative/treatment oriented system. 
<P>
For this submission's purposes, "community services"  include community health,
community mental health and other community services.  We conducted an analysis of the
funding levels of the Ministry of Health "silos" over the past five (5) years and
found that the bulk of the Ministry of Health budget still goes to institutions,
insurable services and payment of drug benefits (Appendix A)*.  Only 5% is allocated
to community services.   In fact, we found that funding for community mental health
has dropped by 54.2% over the period (Appendix B)*.
<P>
In 1991, funding for community services totalled $860 million while the 1995/96
Ministry of Health estimates show these same categories at $1.03 billion. For
community services funding to be "doubled to 10%", as noted the 1991 Premier's Council
report, then $700 million needs to be transferred to community services from savings
derived from other sources within the Ministry of Health budget. We strongly believe
that this objective is achievable and very much in line with the parameters set by the
Finance Minister in his November 1995 Economic Statement.   We also believe that it is
the very least of what is needed in a comprehensive reform of the health care system.
<A NAME="sta"></A><P>
<H3>b)	Status Quo Unsustainable</H3>
<P>
In the BCSTHC document, Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party promised to preserve
the province's health care funding.  In his November 29, 1995 Economic Statement,
Ontario's Finance Minister, the Honourable Ernie Eves, repeated this commitment when
he said, "We will ensure that total health care spending at the end of our term of
office is protected at no less than $17.4 billion."  At the same time, Mr. Eves
cautioned, "But this is not a commitment to maintain the status quo."  
<P>
AOHC shares the government's concern with the status quo. The establishment of the
$17.4 billion ceiling on health care funding eliminated any room for further delay in
reforming the health care system.  Notwithstanding this reality, the Finance
Minister's November 1995 Economic Statement  showed that policy does not easily
translate into implementation and that front-end, preventive community-based services
are still not regarded as priority.  For instance, the "savings" identified as a
result of reducing transfers to hospitals, over a three (3) year period, totalled $1.3
billion (approximately 18% of the 1995-96 transfer level) yet the main areas
identified for the reinvestment of savings are still in acute and chronic care, i.e. 
brain injury, kidney dialysis, emergency paramedic services, out of country emergency
services, etc.
<A NAME="shi"></A><P>
<H3>c) Shift to Community Based Services</H3>
<P>
In the BCSTHC document, the PC Party promised to make a shift to community-based
services:
<P>
The current NDP government, and the Liberals before them, promised to shift more
resources out of institutions and into community-based care.  So far, we've
experienced only one-half of that equation--since 1990, close to 8,000 beds have been
removed from hospitals in Ontario, and there has been a freeze on nursing home and
long term care beds.  There has not been an expansion of community based health care
services.  As a result, dramatic cutbacks to hospitals have produced a gap in health
care treatments and services.  With the savings achieved in managing the system
better, we will close the gap by re-investing funds directly into community-based
health care services, including mental health and long-term care services. 
<P>
It is true that reductions in hospital spending will result in increased pressures on
communities and community-based services because of the reduced availability and
restricted use of hospital services.  For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>reduced availability and possible unavailability of some services
<P>
<LI>restricted or delayed admissions, and
<P>
<LI>earlier discharges from hospital.
</UL>
<P>
To respond to these pressures, the AOHC recommends increased financial support to
community-based services to provide:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>better coordination of care across community-based services and coordination with
more restricted hospital-based services
<P>
<LI>more responsive community-based promotion, prevention and early identification of
health issues (for example, through public health services and resources in community
health centres) in order to reduce the need for hospital-based services
<P>
<LI>pre-natal and post-natal supports to families to promote healthier child and youth
development and ultimately improve the overall health of Ontarians
<P>
<LI>greater access to some services which have traditionally been hospital-based, such
as laboratory services, through community-based provision of these services
<P>
<LI>community-based follow-up after hospital discharge to reduce the likelihood of
hospital readmission and/or extended use of hospital-based services
<P>
<LI>physiotherapy and occupational therapy prior to hospital procedures to reduce
hospital stays as well as after hospital-based procedures.
</UL>
<P>
The demands for chronic and acute care, as well as emergency services, are
significant, and are likely to grow with the aging of Ontario's population.  Health
promotion and disease prevention programs and services which do not instantly address
dramatic "life and death" situations, such as those found in acute or chronic care
situations, cannot compete for the attention of the media and policy/decision makers. 
These services are usually delivered through small community based organizations which
do not have the resources to undertake full scale public education/awareness campaigns
on the benefits of health promotion and disease prevention programs.  Instead of
simply responding to pressures created by ongoing demands for acute or chronic care
services, there is currently a window of opportunity to make the long overdue shift to
build up community services.  
<A NAME="eme"></A><P>
<H3>d) Emergence of a reformed health system</H3>
<P>
AOHC believes that we have to start thinking about our  health care dollar in a new
and radical way.  Today, because of the way funding is allocated, we have only a vague
idea of how much of our health care dollar is spent on promotion, prevention or early
intervention.   The health for the whole Ontario population in line with a
community-based approach to service delivery must be the basis for setting objectives
for funding.  
<P>
The ultimate mission of the health goals process is the achievement of health for the
whole Ontario population. The core values which underpin the Panel's vision for
achievement of this mission are health as a resource, a sense of community, equity,
and quality of life.  In this vision, the people of Ontario would support each other
in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential. 
Disease, disability and premature death would be minimized.  Creating a healthy
community would involve the members of that community in devising and implementing
strategies to enhance their own health.  
<P>
The current funding "silos", largely historic in origin, have not been based on health
needs and have no place in a reformed health system.   Options that could be
considered in designing a funding system that will allow us to track effectiveness of
health strategies include developing funding categories according to promotion,
prevention, early intervention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. 
Whatever the alternative is, it should not be according to the type of institution,
agency or provider but must be treated as investment toward improved health outcomes
for the people of Ontario.
<A NAME="conc"></A>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>IV.	CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
The AOHC is convinced that health reform can only be achieved if there is accord
between health and financial policies.   Lack of congruence between these areas will
inevitably result in barriers which will jeopardize the emergence of a truly reformed
health care system.  To ensure that the health care budget changes the status quo, the
process must be within a multi-year context such as that laid out for the reductions
in hospital transfers.  This allows for an incremental, predictable approach to both
health and financial policy setting which is essential in meeting Ontario's health
goals.   
<P>
While community based preventive services are not as readily understood or commonly
acknowledged as curative or treatment services, the Health Minister, Hon. Jim Wilson
recognized the need to shift to community services when, in his May 1995 address to
the Lexium Conference,  he stated, "Instead of talking about prevention, we must start
doing it."

<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>BUILDING ON SUCCESS:</H1>
<H2>A Blueprint For Effective Primary Health Care</H2>
<H3>A Proposal from the Association of Ontario Health Centres</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>I.	PROPOSAL:</H3>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is committed to an Ontario-wide
adoption of a primary health care delivery system that allows individuals, families
and communities reasonable opportunities to achieve their full capacity for health and
provides the health services according to the identified need.  AOHC believes that, in
conjunction with the appropriate funding structure,  a healthier Ontario will emerge
only when the elements of Community Direction & Accountability, Range of Services &
Approaches, Team Approach, Partnerships & Collaboration, and Leadership & Innovation
are integrated as components of primary health care delivery models.  This paper will
provide an explanation of why AOHC believes these components are critical to the
ensuring effective primary health care.
<P>
<H3>II.	OVERVIEW:</H3>
<P>
Health care reform and fiscal constraints are forcing governments and the public to
review the primary health care delivery systems.  As noted in the 1978 World Health
Organization Report on Primary Health Care, "Primary Health Care is essential health
care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means
acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost the community and
country can afford...It forms an integral part of the country's health care system of
which it is the nucleus... It is the first level of contact of individuals, the family
and the community with the national health system bringing health care as close as
possible to where people live and work and constitutes the first element of a
continuing health care process... Primary health care addresses the main problems in
the community, providing promotive, preventative, curative, supportive and
rehabilitative services accordingly."  
<P>
In Ontario, there is currently no coherent policy direction regarding the most
appropriate way of providing primary health care services. While most of the
province's population of over ten million receive primary care mainly through the
physician "fee for service system", various primary care models are in existence
across the province such as community health centres (CHCs), health service
organizations (HSOs), comprehensive health organizations (CHOs), aboriginal access
centres (ACCs) as well as other developmental models.   It was hoped that the
Community Health Framework Project would yield consensus on what components are
essential in an effective primary care model, however, this expectation has not been
realized to date.
<P>
Among other outcomes, effective primary health care helps prevent illness in
individuals, families and communities.  At the present time, more than 90% of the over
17 billion dollars that Ontario spends in health care goes to disease/illness care. 
Only a minimal portion goes to illness prevention.  To develop an effective primary
health care system, health reform must take into account factors such as allocation of
health dollars, public education, shared client/provider responsibility, government
and community leadership etc. that allow primary health care to be more effective at
building healthier individuals and communities.  
<P>
Although it can be said that health and illness belong to the same continuum, the
focus of health reform must be towards optimizing health and preventing illness rather
than just treating illness. Limiting the scope of health services to treatment of
disease/illness ignores the capacity of the individual and the community to be
actively responsible for their health.  Effective primary health care addresses
factors that directly and indirectly affect the health and lives of the people in the
community.  It encourages people to be self-reliant and to share responsibility for
their health with the health provider.  Health and well-being are determined by many
factors such as employment, education, income, housing, caring and supportive
relationships, and good nutrition.  These factors are recognized as determinants of
health.  Effective primary health care recognizes the direct impact of these factors
on the health of individuals, families and communities.  As such, the use of a range
of health providers who provide the skills and expertise appropriate in responding to
the health issues identified is an important element in an effective primary care
model.
<P>
<H3>II.	ELEMENTS OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE</H3>
<P>
<H4>Community Direction & Accountability</H4>
<P>
The traditional approach to health care is centred on the role of the physician with
other health providers only as supports to the physician. This approach emphasizes
full planning, direction and service delivery by professionals and sees
clients/patients as passive recipients of services.  It does not fully recognize the
importance of accountability to individuals, families and the community. Community
direction and accountability is an integral component of an effective primary health
care delivery model.  Individuals, families and communities have various capacities to
take on active roles in the delivery of primary health care.  With support from
community agencies/organizations in developing their potential to be an active
participant in their health system, individuals, families and communities can be
involved in planning and evaluating health services.  In some primary care models such
as in community health centres (CHCs), clients are involved in identifying health
problems in the community, planning the programs and services needed to address these
problems and providing direction in the delivery of these services.  
<P>
When the community is actively involved, community members are able to pool their
individual and collective skills, expertise and experience in addressing health
issues.  Each community is equipped with a unique set of resources that can be put
into action when the community is mobilized. This approach increases community
resources, actual and potential, and adds value to the funding structure and health
dollars allocated for health services. As people take on more responsibility for their
health, they become informed consumers, planners and evaluators of their health
system.  To be effective, this approach must be combined with a funding structure that
is predictable, accountable and not "volume driven" such as program (salary) or global
funding (capitation).  Governments have the responsibility to set the policy framework
and funding structure that ensures appropriate opportunities for communities to
effectively participate in the setting of directions and priorities for their health.  
<P>
<H4>Range of Services & Approaches</H4>
<P>
Effective primary health care covers a range of services and approaches.  These
services include primary health care, health promotion and community development.  In
the context of a traditionally "medical"  concept of health care, many health
providers believe that "health promotion" is already practiced through specific health
education advice/counselling.  In this traditional approach, health promotion is seen
only as the health education exchange between patient and physician.  For example,
instructions regarding smoking cessation, diet management, physical exercise and
stress reduction are seen as "health promotion".  Although these medically prescribed
activities are helpful in preventing the aggravation of specific health risks, they do
nothing in terms of getting clients to be actively involved in the planning, provision
and evaluation of their health care.  Physicians are trained to provide medical care
and the use of their services extensively to provide health education, when other low
cost health providers can do the job, is a costly and inappropriate use of health
dollars.  The traditional medical approach reinforces the passive role of the
patient/client and ignores other living conditions that contribute to the incidence
and onset of illness such as isolation, nutrition, etc.
<P>
Effective and efficient primary health care models are comprehensive and recognizes
the effect of the determinants on the health and lives of individuals, families and
communities. These models include primary health care, health promotion and community
development services.  These models acknowledge the particular expertise of the range
of health providers available within the health system such as nurse practitioners,
health promoters, social workers, and dietitians.  Physicians working within effective
primary care models have the opportunity to work closely with other health providers,
in a mutually supportive working environment, for the benefit of the clients/patients. 
The appropriate use of the mix of skills/expertise of the various health providers in
an effective primary health care model results in cost efficiencies that are lost in
the traditional "medical system".  
<P>
Significant barriers to access continue to exist in today's health care system.  In
Ontario, various segments of the population experience difficulties in accessing
health services.  Barriers to access include, among others, geographic,
socio-economic, cultural and linguistic factors. Effective primary health care
involves forming partnerships and coalitions to promote such mechanisms as, among
others, healthy public policy, adequate jobs and housing, environmental health, and
excellence in education.  These mechanisms have significant impact on the health of
individuals, families and communities.  Unresolved, determinants of poor health result
in diseases/illnesses which require high cost, highly specialized treatment care and
support.  In effective primary health care models, providers are actively involved in
a continuous process of assessing and adjusting services to ensure these services lead
to healthier individuals, families and communities.   As such, effective primary
health care models provide full 24-hour coverage (on call) for its clients which
reduces the use of more expensive emergency departments. 
<P>
<H4>Team Approach</H4>
<P>
Team approach is critical to the delivery of effective primary health care.  In this
model, health providers function jointly with a common set of goals based on a common
set of values.  Team members are made up of providers from various disciplines, each
of whom contribute their particular expertise to a comprehensive approach.  Teamwork
also recognizes the important role of the client in the process and ensures that, at
key points, the client is actively involved. Teamwork is more than a network of
referrals.  It involves team members working together, on an interdisciplinary basis,
to assess the health issues affecting the client and to determine the most effective
and efficient use of resources in addressing these health issues.
<P>
Teamwork in effective primary health care models calls for an integrated approach to
service delivery.  It requires a mutual acknowledgement among team members of the
unique skills and expertise each team member brings to the group.  Teamwork means team
members working in concert with each other to ensure that there are no gaps in the
health service delivery.  The adoption of an interdisciplinary approach to health
service delivery ensures that appropriate services are provided through the most
economically efficient means possible.  Teamwork works effectively when all staff is
on salary as each team member, paid according to the organization's salary scale, is
essentially on the same "level playing field".  In this case, the physician's skills
and expertise are utilized in those areas wherein only the physician can function
while other health providers such as nurse practitioners, health promoters, social
workers, etc. undertake areas which best fit their particular skills and expertise. 
It is this best match between client need and provider expertise which can result in
efficiencies and cost savings to the system as a whole. 
<P>
<H4>Partnership & Collaboration</H4>
<P>
Effective primary health care also involves developing partnerships and other forms of
collaborative relationships outside of the organization.    These inter-organizational
linkages ensure greater integration within the health system which increases the
community's capacity to be responsive.  In the treatment component, these linkages
allow a streamlined approach to the client/patients' diagnostic, secondary and
tertiary care needs.  These connections enable clients to move more effectively
through the continuum of care.
<P>
From a broader health promotion perspective, partnerships and collaboration maximizes
the community’s resources in addressing the determinants of poor health among
individuals, families and communities.  Coordination of services results in closer
linkages among community members and community agencies/organizations in identifying
living conditions and patterns of behaviour that lead to illness.  Knowledge of these
patterns are essential in developing appropriate programs and services for the
community. Partnerships and collaboration result in increased effectiveness achieved
through joint planning and action,  sharing of resources and learning together and
reduces the likelihood of having duplication in services.
<P>
<H4>Leadership & Innovation</H4>
<P>
In the wake of drastic fiscal constraints and the advent of new information
technology, the health care system must adjust quickly to ensure that health services
continue to be comprehensive, accessible, portable and affordable.  Health providers
must also be flexible enough to adapt to the changing environment. 
<P>
The viability of the health care system is threatened by its inherent complexities and
challenges. Continuing erosion in federal/provincial transfer payments adversely
affect Ontario's  capacity to provide appropriate health services.  The lack of
relevant and useful information systems across the health sector impairs useful
information flow within the current traditional health care delivery system.  Health
human resource planning and management continues to be a critical issue.  Traditional
provider roles and scope of practice are well entrenched and resistant to change.  To
be effective, leadership and innovation must exist at both provincial and local level. 
In setting the policy framework for the delivery of effective primary health care ,
governments must allow opportunities for leadership and innovation to occur at the
local level. 
<P>
Effective primary health care organizations are especially capable of identifying the
forces of change and adopting new ways of organizing and delivering services.  These
organizations are adept at maximizing existing resources and advocating for ways to
secure additional resources from a variety of sources to meet identified needs.  These
organizations support creative and innovative ways of providing primary care services
and engaging in health promotion activities.  Effective primary health care
organizations are models of leadership and innovation.  As the needs of the community
are revealed, these organizations, with the appropriate funding structure, have the
capacity to adapt to meet identified needs and secure necessary resources to address
these needs.  
<P>
<H3>IV.	CONCLUSION</H4>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres believes that a primary health care delivery
system can be effective only with the integration of the following components:
Community Direction & Accountability, Range of Services and Approaches, Team Approach,
Partnerships & Collaboration, and Leadership & Innovation.  These components ensure
that primary health care services are responsive to the needs of the community in the
context of the various challenges within and outside the health system.  The CHC
model, as shown by the stories contained herein, embodies these elements and is an
excellent example of how an effective primary health care model works.

<H2>Effective Primary Health Care in Action</H2>
<I>Stories in this document are based on actual events at CHCs in Ontario.  Numerous
stories can be found in any CHC.</I>
<H3>CASE 1:</H3>
A 59 year old woman with metastatic laryngeal cancer, at the last stages of her
disease, was referred to the CHC  because she was no longer able to go to the doctor's
office and her family doctor did not do home visits.  The patient wanted to be cared
for and die at home.
<P>
<H4>CHC Intervention:</H4>
The CHC primary care team provided nurse and physician home visits to provide medical
palliative care - mostly pain management, emotional support to the patient and her
family and medical back up for VON home care nurses.  The CHC team also prepared the
family for the likely situations, as a result of the patient's cancer that could
arise, such as massive bleeding.  The preparation was timely which allowed the family
to manage, in a calm and capable manner, the two incidents of massive bleeding that
did occur.
<P>
<H4>Outcomes:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Elimination of likely hospital costs through the use of available family resources
in the provision of quality care at home
<LI>More efficient use of community resources through improved coordination
<LI>Improved quality of life at terminal stages of disease as patient was able to be
cared for and die at home.
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>CASE 2:</H3>
A frantic young mother brought her distraught 3 year old son with a bleeding finger to
the CHC.  Her son caught his finger on the door of his day care centre which resulted
in a cut to his finger.
<P>
<H4>CHC Intervention:</H4>
The CHC nurse practitioner examined the child's finger, ruled out a fracture, stitched
the deep laceration on the finger and ensured that the mother understood how to care
for the wound to prevent infection. The mother noted that, had the CHC not been
available, she would have taken the child to the hospital emergency.
<P>
<H4>Outcomes:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Elimination of emergency room costs
<LI>Efficient use of nurse practitioner skills
<LI>Readily available and responsive service to needs of mother and child
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>CASE 3:</H3>
Prior to using the CHC, a 73 year old man, with prostate problems, regularly visited
the hospital emergency when he had a cough or when he had to urinate more than 4 times
a night.  With the services of the health centre, he now only calls the CHC nurse as
opposed to going to the emergency room for minor problems.
<P>
<H4>CHC Intervention:</H4>
A 24-hr "call coverage" provided by a CHC team of health providers through direct
care, telephone assessment and support ensures that the CHC nurses are able to provide
the client reassurance and continuity of support to deal with the problems that
concern him. 
<P>
<H4>Outcomes:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Reduction in the use of emergency services
<LI>More efficient use of health services
<LI>Improved support, reassurance and regular monitoring of client's complaints
through continuity of contact
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>CASE 4:</H3>
Two years ago, a 65 year old woman with a 35-year history of smoking joined the local
CHC after moving into the neighbourhood.  Today she is an active volunteer, serving on
the CHC board of directors and several other program committees.
<P>
<H4>CHC Intervention:</H4>
The CHC primary care team used a computer generated reminder system and chart audits
to assist in ensuring the client received her annual flu shot, regular mammography and
blood pressure monitoring.  She is able to access the appropriate member of the CHC
health team to deal with issues of nutrition and exercise.  She participated in the
smoking-cessation group facilitated by the nurse practitioner.  The health team
provided her with health information and follow up for episodic illness on site and by
telephone.
<P>
<H4>Outcomes:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Anticipatory primary health care reduces premature death by 22%
<LI>Improved utilization of preventive health services
<LI>High quality primary care supported through information and quality assurance
systems
<LI>Opportunity for consumer participation for local decision making
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
A 33 year old man with HIV and pneumothorax had been in an abusive relationship and
ended up living on the street for a year.  The CHC helped the client obtain I.D.,
social assistance, housing and was linked to a community AIDS group.  The CHC staff
also set up a volunteer team for care and homecare and provided regular monitoring and
treatment of HIV.  These measures helped in: 
<UL>
<LI>Provision of humane quality care for the client in the terminal stages of the
disease as CHC assisted the  client to die at home as he wished
<LI>Elimination of high costs associated with fee for service billings for labour
intensive care through a salaried team
<LI>Elimination of hospitalization costs
<LI>Enhanced community capacity to help community members in need with the use of
volunteer team
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
A CHC Community Development Worker discovered that many women in the CHC catchment
area had difficulty accessing health services due to social isolation and household
chores and responsibilities.  The worker also found that the high cost was a barrier
to the women in preparing nutritious food for their families. With information and
support from the public health unit, the CHC introduced the idea of Community Kitchens
to the women in the community. Twice a month, the women got together at the CHC,
pooled their money so that they were able to buy and cook, in bulk, nutritious food. 
With their exposure and familiarity with the CHC, the women were able to get their
health needs assessed by the CHC primary care team.   In effect, the CHC Community
Kitchen resulted in:
<UL>
<LI>Improved meal preparation and budgeting skills for the women
<LI>Improved dietary intake for their families
<LI>Reduced social isolation through the creation of a supportive network
<LI>Early assessment, identification of health issues and early intervention with
minimal cost to the system.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
A visually and hearing impaired 75 year old woman, with a history of hypertension, who
was socially isolated and had family relationship problems, started going to the CHC a
year ago.  Shortly after, she revealed that her daughter was abusive to her.  The
abuse escalated to include restrictions on her movements and use of the facilities of
their apartment. The CHC monitored the client's physical problems through regular
office visits and had her fitted with a hearing aid.  The centre's clinical and
seniors case worker worked together to provide counselling and support to the abusive
situation and her social isolation.  Primary care providers also helped her become
involved in a daily seniors' program.  The CHC health team members advocated on the
patient's behalf to find her a suitable residence.  The team approach to service
delivery resulted in:
<UL>
<LI>Elimination of potential use of emergency and hospital services
<LI>Increased capacity of client to deal with other life situations. 
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Prior to using the CHC, a 50 year old woman, with severe terminal emphysema on home
oxygen, used to be in hospital 3-6 times a year and had frequent emergency room
visits.  She also has manic depression as well as multiple family relationship
problems.  For the past two and a half years, the CHC provided her support at home
resulting in no hospital admission until just prior to her death.  The CHC provided
regular physician and nursing home visits, phone calls to check on her status, on call
assistance, counselling and support through regular home vists and phone contact and
liaised with Community Occupational Therapy Associates (COTA) and the Metro Toronto
Housing Authority (MTHA) to provide a collaborative approach in the provision of
support. The CHC activities resulted in:
<UL>
<LI>A decrease in hospital and emergency room visits
<LI>An increase in the quality of life with homestay - client was able to fulfill
desire to stay at home, where she is more comfortable, until two days before she died
<LI>Facilitated reconciliation between the client and her daughter.
</UL>
Recognizing that not all issues could be resolved with the resources available at
their CHC, the team collaborated with other community agencies such as COTA and MTHA. 
Joint planning, sharing of resources and learning together worked to maximize the use
of resources available in the community.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
During the 1995 summer heat wave, upon hearing about the deadly effects of the heat on
many seniors in Chicago, a Toronto CHC developed a "seniors peer outreach" for their
clients to link seniors who were found to be "at risk" would be linked with a group of
health providers.  The CHC nurse practitioner trained volunteer seniors to check, on a
"one one one" basis, seniors who were isolated.  Volunteers were provided guidelines
on recognizing situations that would put a senior "at risk" from the heat wave.  Any
senior identified "at risk" is then linked to the health providers at the CHC for
closer assessment and regular monitoring regarding possibility of dehydration.  These
measures resulted in:
<UL>
<LI>Early  intervention to reduce risk of dehydration for seniors identified "at risk"
for dehydration
<LI>Use of "no cost" community resources such as volunteer seniors for prevention of
likely effects of heat such as dehydration or death
<LI>Elimination of possible hospitalization cost

<H2>WORKFARE IN CONTEXT</H2>
<A NAME="exec"></A><P>
<H3>1.	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3>	
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization  of
community health centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs).  With
member centres throughout Ontario which support tens of thousands of Ontarians
directly in primary care, counselling, youth education and employment programs, AOHC
believes the health status of Ontarians are heavily influenced by circumstances and
living conditions to which people are exposed.  
<P>
Current economic realities have created undue pressures on funding levels at both the
national and provincial level.  These financial constraints have resulted in the
widespread questioning of the merits of the welfare state in context with the
increased costs and its relative value to society.  Various levels of government in
North America have attempted to decrease welfare costs  through initiatives such as
"workfare". There appears to be four (4) main arguments which have been presented in
support of this particular initiative:  to influence welfare beneficiaries, to address
budgetary constraints; to respond to the demands of voters and to improve the supply
of labour. In Canada, several provinces have implemented some form of "workfare"
primarily to address budgetary constraints with inconclusive results to date.
<P>
AOHC is greatly concerned that, in the pursuit of changing the behaviour of welfare
recipients, addressing budgetary constraints and responding to voter demands, no
apparent consideration is given to the deterioration of the health status of those
negatively affected.  AOHC member centres have already reported a number of instances
where the health of clients is in jeopardy due to significant reductions in benefit
levels affecting adequate living conditions such as nutrition and housing.  As such,
and, in consideration of the position of the new Progressive Conservative government
on the matter of "workfare", AOHC is of the opinion that the most productive
contribution it can make to this issue is by identifying factors that could reduce
risks to the health of welfare beneficiaries involved in "workfare". 
<P>
<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The AOHC recommends that the provincial government consider the broad determinants
of  health as the context for the reform of Ontario's welfare system. 

<LI>The AOHC recommends that the provincial government acknowledge the value of the
integration of health and community/social services in  addressing individual, family
and community needs in areas of employment training/retraining and appropriate social
supports.

<LI>The AOHC recommends that the provincial government assist in the provision of
support services that would address the particular needs of  individuals facing
greater barriers to returning to the work force.  These individuals include:
<UL>
<LI>young adults<BR>
<LI>women with children who are less than six years of age<BR>
<LI>the disabled<BR>
<LI>the permanently unemployable.
</UL>
<LI>The AOHC strongly recommends that the reform of Ontario's welfare system be
implemented on a careful incremental basis, with provisions for adequate and
appropriate resources, through the use of pilot sites at community based agencies and
organizations such as community health centres (CHCs) . 
</OL>
<A NAME="intro"></A><P>
<H3>II.	INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization  of
community health centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs) in
Ontario.  AOHC member centres throughout Ontario support tens of thousands of
Ontarians directly through primary care, counselling, youth education and employment
programs. Underlying the AOHC mission statement to promote good health in Ontario is a
common set of beliefs and principles (Appendix A) which includes the adoption of the
World Health Organization definition of health as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Health is the extent to which an individual or group is able, on one
hand, to realize aspirations and satisfy needs; and, on the other hand, to change or
cope with the environment.  Health is therefore seen as a resource for everyday life,
not the objective of living; it is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal
resources, as well as physical capacity."</BLOCKQUOTE>
In accordance with this definition, AOHC believes that health is determined by factors
such as education, employment and access to sustainable income.  Clients of AOHC
member centres are people who normally bear a higher burden of risk for ill health due
to their living conditions. At the June 1995, AOHC Annual General Meeting, health
centre representatives who were concerned about the potential effects of "workfare" on
the already precarious health status of some of their clients, passed a resolution
opposing "workfare" and called for AOHC to publicly communicate such a position.
<P>
The current Progressive Conservative government in Ontario was elected on a mandate of
welfare reform.  Since taking office, it has clearly indicated its intent to implement
workfare.  The PC "Common Sense Revolution" document which underlies the government's
approach to welfare reform, states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"...We want to open up new opportunities and restore hope for people by
breaking the cycle of dependency.  That will be the goal of our welfare reform.  The
best social assistance ever created is a real job, and this plan will generate
hundreds of thousands of those.  In the meantime, we must move to control costs and
help people return to the workforce...."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="over"></A><P>
<H3>III.	OVERVIEW:</H3>
<P>
In anticipation of the implementation of significant welfare reform in Ontario and to
ensure that any formal position taken by AOHC is well researched, AOHC undertook a
review of recent literature on workfare and other measures aimed at supporting the
transition from welfare to work in Canada as well as in the United States. The bulk of
literature available (noted in the attached list of references - Appendix B) suggests
that initiatives identified as "workfare" in other jurisdictions have not been 
successful in most instances. 
<P>
In Ontario, the scope and components of the proposed "workfare" program has not yet
been fully defined. As such, this paper will not deal with the merits of a defined
workfare program rather it will attempt to provide a context and discuss factors which
could affect the impact of work initiatives on the health status of affected
individuals, families and communities.  
<A NAME="ways"></A><P>
<H3>IV.	WAYS OF LOOKING AT WORKFARE:  ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST</H3>
<P>
The available literature suggests that there are four (4) most likely reasons why
workfare is proposed and/or implemented by government:
<UL>
<LI>to influence welfare beneficiaries; 
<LI>to address budgetary constraints; 
<LI>to respond to the demands of voters; or
<LI>to improve the supply of labour.
</UL>
<P>
These four arguments will be explored in some detail as these provide a useful
framework for examining most of the arguments for and against workfare in the
literature.  The Ontario government's rationale for "workfare" appears to be closely
related to the first three reasons noted above.  
<A NAME="arg1"></A><P>
<H4>Argument # 1:     Workfare can influence beneficiaries.</H4>
The PC Common Sense Revolution document states:	
<BLOCKQUOTE>"....our plan includes a commitment to invest $500 million in new and
innovative programs to help those in need and those who genuinely want a hand up, not
a handout...."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The argument that workfare can influence beneficiaries is complex.  The following sets
of rationale show that the blame is either laid on the system or, alternatively, on
the welfare recipients themselves.  The latter view gives rise to measures which
attempt to promote behavioural change through a variety of incentives to work and
disincentives to collecting welfare.  The most controversial measure which
distinguishes workfare from other welfare-to-work approaches is the mandatory
provision.  The available literature identifies rationale for and against the above
argument as follows:  
<P>
<H4>For:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>That the main reason why many welfare recipients are not working is that work is
not mandatory. The existing system is so lax that it has made them dependent.  
<LI>That the value of workfare is seen in the social message to both recipients and
non-recipients that "one's income is the result of one's labor and this exchange
should not cease to function just because one is receiving government transfers".  
<LI>That workfare encourages individuals to be more effectively socialized to engage
in behaviors that can prevent or minimize their own dependence. 
<LI>Social assistance programs are in themselves a major cause not only of chronic
poverty, but also of unemployment, female-headed families, falling educational
achievements and crime.  Programs intended to help recipients give the wrong
incentives and trap many into "dependency".
<LI>Another way of influencing beneficiaries is to deter them from applying for
welfare to begin with. 
<LI>Social policy should be concerned with promoting social responsibility among
welfare recipients,
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Against:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Concepts of adjustment and reintegration rather than concepts of dependency and
incentives are more appropriate solutions for social problems such as poverty and
unemployment.
<LI>Choosing welfare is based not on the attractiveness of the welfare system, but on
labour market considerations such as the availability of jobs, wage rates, and
benefits levels.
<LI>Policymakers' focus on the supply of, rather than the demand for, labor seems to
place the responsibility for unemployment on lazy individuals, rather than on a sick
economy. 
<LI>Workfare rewards those willing to work, sometimes through increased benefits, and
punishes those who are perceived as unwilling through sanctions such as a loss of
benefits.  This approach presents an overly simplistic view of  what should be a
complicated philosophical argument about justice, where justice requires "respect of
individuals as free and equal people".
<LI>At best, the impact of work requirements on welfare participation is small.   
Recent studies tend to identify modest, positive impacts of workfare on employment and
earnings, and marginal effects on welfare caseloads and expenditures.  Income gains,
however, are too small to lift participants and their families out of poverty. 
<LI>The only way to deter someone from applying for welfare because they haven't got a
job is to supply them with a job.
<LI>Workfare fails as a means of achieving social responsibility in comparison to
other social programs such as schemes that enable individuals from a wide range of
socio-economic backgrounds to work on community projects organized by volunteer and
charitable societies.
</UL>
<A NAME="arg2"></A><P>
<H4>Argument #2:    Workfare can address budgetary constraints.</H4>
 <P>
The PC Common Sense Revolution document states:	
<BLOCKQUOTE>"...Coming out of the current recession, we have four times as many people 
in the welfare system, and our costs are more than 6 times higher - an astonishing
$6.3 billion a year........ we anticipate at least a 5% reduction in the number of
people on welfare in each of the first three years...."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Often associated with the dependency/deterrence arguments, this argument suggests
important economies can be achieved with workfare, through reductions in the number of
beneficiaries.  The available literature identifies arguments for and against the
above rationale as follows:  
<P>
<H4>For:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Coming out of the 1982 recession, the total welfare costs in Ontario were $930
million.  In 1995 there are four times as many people in the welfare system and the
costs are six times higher - $6.3 billion a year. 
<LI>In 1995, there are 663,513 people collecting social assistance cheques in Ontario.
The government estimates that, with the 21.6% cut in benefits, it will have annual
savings of $750 million - $1 billion.
<LI>Workfare can reduce expenditures substantially if accompanied by real reductions
in benefits levels.  These reductions are intended to act as a further deterrent to
accepting welfare and often form part of larger cost-reduction package.
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Against:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>A genuine commitment to transform welfare would be expensive, at least in the
short and medium term. Unless major investments are accepted to make workfare an
extensive measure, savings are likely to be minor, if not marginal.  
<LI>Administrative costs alone would overshadow any savings from successful job
placements.  
<LI>During the "good times" (when unemployment is low) work requirements may be both
unnecessary and expensive if most of those who are affected are already working.
During "bad times" (when unemployment is unacceptably high) there may not be enough
jobs for everyone on welfare.
<LI>Monitoring and implementation of the mandatory provisions workfare would require
increased government capacity for these functions. Adequate information to justify
cutting people off welfare is difficult and complex.  Existing systems are inadequate
to accommodate the beneficiaries' right to appeal need. 
</UL>
<A NAME="arg3"></A><P>
<H4>Argument #3:    Workfare responds to voters' demands.</H4>
<P>
The PC Common Sense Revolution document states:	
<BLOCKQUOTE>"....You have told us that you want to replace welfare with a work,
education and training social policy that rewards individual initiative and demands
responsible behaviour from the recipients of public assistance, even as it expands 
opportunities for  self-sufficiency...."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The tension and contradiction which are part of the workfare debate are tied to a
recognition of the value of work in society. Work in itself, apart from income,
occupies a central place in liberal democracies. A message which speaks to stricter
controls on the payment of welfare benefits is consistently heard from voters in
liberal democracies.  Politicians have increasingly used opinion polls in building
party and government policies. The NDP government in Ontario introduced stricter
controls on welfare based on feedback from focus groups.  A much stronger message was
part of both Liberal and Conservative party policies in the recent Ontario elections,
and voters confirmed their support of this stronger message with the election of a
Conservative government.  The available literature identifies arguments for and
against the above rationale as follows:  
<P>
<H4>For:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>A Gallup poll conducted March 31, 1994 indicated that 86 percent of the Canadian
public surveyed were in favour of "making people on welfare go to work." 

<LI>Responding to the message of stricter control can be seen to safeguard public
support for the welfare state. 

<LI>The exercise of one's right to welfare is viewed as a sign of failure in the North
American context.  
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Against:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>In a democracy, work serves as a testimony that a person is an autonomous, equal
and independent agent able to participate in the community. 

<LI>Any move to implement workfare is seen by proponents of the welfare state as only
serving to dismantle it. 
</UL>
<A NAME="arg4"></A><P>
<H4>Argument #4:   Workfare can improve the supply of labour.</H4>
<P>
The PC Common Sense Revolution document does not specifically identify improving
labour supply as a goal of Ontario's welfare reform. However it does suggest that
workfare will provide beneficiaries with a chance at part-time jobs.  It states:	
<BLOCKQUOTE>"....While we can no longer afford the growing costs of the welfare
system, we can keep benefits above the national average, and give the recipients a
chance to earn more money at part-time jobs...."</BLOCKQUOTE>
Improving the labour supply involves not only upgrading, but also integrating or
reintegrating groups excluded from the labour market back into the labour market. 
This argument for workfare is one promoted by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) although it is suggested that it has more relevance
to a country such as Sweden which has traditionally fought unemployment by attempting
to keep the unemployed "labour-market ready". Arguments both for and against the above
rationale are noted as follows:  
<P>
<H4>For:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Canada stands out as a country that devotes a disproportionately high share of its
labor market expenditures to "passive" income support via UI, as opposed to more
‘active' programs that subsidize mobility and acquisition of new skills.  Some authors
advocate for more active policies, including workfare and learnfare.

<LI>Efforts to "make work pay," directly through income supplements and indirectly
through programs designed to increase individual employability, offer more
constructive definitions of the welfare "problem" and the accompanying solution, but
their potential impact will be limited during times of high unemployment.
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Against:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>What stands as workfare is associated with a package of measures that make the
labour market flexible, flexibility being understood less as the "static" (or
defensive) freedom to hire and fire and to pay low wages, than as the "dynamic" (or
offensive) capacity to negotiate change, upgrade skills and improve productivity. 
<LI>As long as unemployment remains at double-digit levels, no incentives of any sort
are likely to lead to substantial overall employment gains.  What is a macroeconomic
problem of job scarcity cannot be resolved at the micro level by tinkering with work
incentives. 
</UL>
<A NAME="welf"></A><P>
<H3>V.	"WELFARE TO WORK" MEASURES IN CANADA </H3>
<P>
Despite a history of voluntary training and employment programs, the concept of
"workfare" (or, more accurately, "learnfare") was included in the Canadian federal
government's October 1994 discussion paper about improving social security in Canada. 
The government raised the possibility of making UI benefits conditional on attendance
at employment programs if the claimant was filing a third claim in five years. 
"Workfare" and variations on "workfare" have also been discussed in relation to
provincially and/or municipally administered social assistance programs and provinces
have begun to move in the direction of implementing some form of workfare as social
assistance expenditures have increased. 
<P>
Various provinces have imposed sanctions, including the full or partial withdrawal of
benefits, and have used other enforcement mechanisms.  Other mechanisms include, the
requirement to report all job searches, and the requirement to reapply for assistance
on a monthly basis as a way of reinforcing the ideally short-term nature of
assistance.  The available literature on the Canadian experience to date gives the
most attention to "New Brunswick Works"--New Brunswick's way of implementing its
bilateral Employability Agreement with the federal government.  The program's
objective is to provide training and work experience to 3,000 welfare recipients over
six years with a cost of $177 million.  Its overall goal is to reduce the cost of
social assistance.   
<P>
Recent media reports indicate that, in Quebec, government training and work experience
programs have not been successful in getting steady jobs for people on welfare.  One
report showed just 30 per cent of participants were employed 11 months after
completing such program.  The media reports also noted that more than 50 per cent of
private sector employers who hired welfare recipients as part of a provincial wage
subsidy program said they would have hired anyway, confirming some fears the
government is simply subsidizing the private sector.  Furthermore, of the 80 per cent
of welfare recipients considered fit for work, only 10 per cent were participating in
work or training programs as of January 1995 and only 12 per cent were waiting to be
placed in a program.  Other research has shown that the existing administrative
structures were totally inadequate resulting in welfare recipients often being placed
in inappropriate programs or simply left on waiting lists.  
<P>
What is evident from a review of the available literature on workfare is that the
results of this program and other similar programs throughout Canada are mainly
inconclusive.  In terms of the New Brunswick Works federal/provincial project,
workfare would be quite expensive if applied on a broad scale.  
<A NAME="wio"></A><P>
<H3>VI. 	'WORKFARE' IN ONTARIO - FACTORS WHICH COULD INFLUENCE THE IMPACT OF WORK
INITIATIVES</H3>
<P>
Dealing with workfare in Ontario today involves a decision of either focusing on the
whole or its parts--the broad principles of "workfare" or the individual components of
a defined program.  It is to be noted that these components remain linked to the
ideological underpinnings of workfare. It is arguable, based on available literature,
that Ontario's Workfare Program, as a mechanism for addressing budgetary constraints,
could prove to be more successful in Ontario than those implemented by other
provinces.  Nevertheless, media reports suggest that the Ontario initiative may be
achieving initial success in influencing beneficiaries' behaviour as well as
addressing budgetary constraints.  For instance, the 21.6% cut in welfare benefits
which was effective October 1, 1995 directly resulted in a province wide caseload
reduction of more than 19,000 cases (36,000 individuals) for the month of October 1995
(-2.9%), the largest monthly drop in 25 years.  General Welfare Assistance caseloads
were 304,000, a drop of 18,000 or 5.6% since September 1995. Family Benefits caseloads
totalled 329,513, a drop of 1,253 or 0.4%. In addition, the latest public opinion
polls indicate continued and increasing public support for welfare reform in Ontario.
<P>
AOHC is greatly concerned that, in the pursuit of changing the behaviour of welfare
recipients, addressing budgetary constraints and responding to voter demands, no
apparent consideration is given to the deterioration of the health status of those
negatively affected. AOHC member centres have already reported a number of instances
wherein the health of clients is in jeopardy due to significant reductions in benefit
levels affecting adequate living conditions such as nutrition and housing.  As such,
and, in consideration of the position of the new Progressive Conservative government
on the matter of "workfare", AOHC is of the opinion that the most productive
contribution it can make to this issue is by identifying factors that could
potentially reduce risks to the health of welfare beneficiaries involved in workfare.
These areas include:
<UL>
<LI>recognition of the varying levels of needs related to the maintenance of health

<LI>recognition of the inherent value of incentives to work or training through
voluntary partnership/involvement of the larger community

<LI>specific and identifiable mechanisms which allow for the consideration of the
adequacy of living conditions as these affect the health status of  individuals and
families affected

<LI>the availability of supports, especially supports to families, such as child care

<LI>the availability of other social programs, such as subsidized housing

<LI>the specific nature and effect of sanctions, including what happens to children of
welfare mothers who are cut off welfare or receive reduced benefits	

<LI>the adequacy of benefits levels to maintain factors essential for health such as
adequate nutrition and housing

<LI>the use of a range of employability programs from job search through to work
experience and job subsidies
</UL>
<A NAME="conc"></A><P>
<H3>VII. 	CONCLUSION:</H3>
<P>
As noted in the arguments for and against "workfare", welfare recipients are caught in
the midst of a complex social problem resulting from a combination of factors.  The
Ontario government's "workfare" program will undoubtedly not only affect the lives of
welfare recipients but will also have varying consequences on other members of the
greater community.  For welfare recipients, the extent to which health status is
affected will depend on the availability of other supports.  For non-welfare
recipients, the effect will depend on the impact of "workfare" on other aspects of
community life.  AOHC acknowledges that, while there is no single way of addressing
the many aspects of this issue, it is possible to mitigate the negative effects of the
Program through the use of mechanisms that tap community resources and capacities to
the fullest extent possible in the implementation of Workfare.  Community
organizations and agencies have a long history of assisting those "less able" and can
play an essential role in this respect.  
<P>
As noted in the AOHC Beliefs and Principles (Appendix A) AOHC believes that "the
health of the community is maximized through a partnership which combines the skills,
knowledge and life experience/expertise of individuals and community with those of the
health centre staff".  Several  AOHC member centres have worked with the training of
volunteers as well as paid trainees in various capacities which provide opportunities
for developing skills and experience in computer/data entry, clerical, building
maintenance, driving, fundraising, translation, child care, clothing/food bank.  These
are but a few examples of effective mechanisms that may be achieved, with appropriate
and adequate supports, through community agencies.  
<P>
AOHC, therefore submits the following recommendations for the consideration of the
provincial government:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The AOHC recommends that the provincial government consider the broad determinants
of  health as the context for the reform of Ontario's welfare system, 
<P>
<LI>The AOHC recommends that the provincial government acknowledge the value of the
integration of health and community/social services in  addressing individual, family
and community needs in areas of employment training/retraining and appropriate social
supports.
<P>
<LI>The AOHC recommends that the provincial government assist in the provision of
support services that would address the particular needs of  individuals facing
greater barriers to returning to the work force, in particular:
<UL>
<LI>young adults<BR>
<LI>women with children who are less than six  years of age<
<LI>the disabled
<LI>the permanently unemployable.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>The AOHC strongly recommends that the reform of Ontario's welfare system be
implemented on a careful incremental basis, with provisions for adequate and
appropriate resources, through the use of pilot sites at community based agencies and
organizations such as community health centres (CHCs).

<H3>I.	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3>	
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of community
health centres (CHC) and some health service organizations (HSO) in Ontario.  Our mission is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"To represent member centres in the promotion of healthy public policy, healthy
individuals and communities through the creation and continuing development of health centres
which embody principles of accessible quality primary care, health promotion and active community
ownership and participation."</BLOCKQUOTE>

In this context, AOHC supports the reform of Ontario's health care system. Although we primarily
view fiscal constraint as an inappropriate reason for reforming the health care system, we
acknowledge its practical role in the current push for health care reform.   
<P>
We also acknowledge that Ontario's Progressive Conservative government was elected with a mandate,
among others, of fiscal restraint and management.  Our concern for the inevitable effects of
funding cuts to the health budget was somewhat lessened by the Progressive Conservative Party (PC)
goals and commitment for the health care system as identified in the document "Mike Harris Forum
on Bringing Common Sense to Health Care - December 2, 1994" (hereinafter referred to as BCSTHC). 
We generally supported all of the goals identified in the BCSTHC document.  In particular, we
believed that the PC goals specific to "management and accountability", "health care bill of
rights", "individual responsibility" and "fostering community involvement", combined with the
party's political will, could provide a functional framework for a truly reformed health care
system.  
<P>
Within logistical constraints, AOHC has taken a close and temperate review of the provisions of
Bill 26 relating to health services.  We have found provisions that we believe are necessary to
effect the reform of the health care system in Ontario.  However, we are deeply concerned with
specific provisions that grant unqualified extraordinary powers to government, erode and nullify
the authority and autonomy of local incorporated boards of directors, undermine community
capacities and ownership, open up the potential for unfair treatment and grant unprecedented
access to and use of personal health records.  On balance, we believe that these provisions would
put in great jeopardy the health care goals and commitment articulated by the Progressive
Conservative Party as contained in its December 2, 1994 BCSTHC document.
<P>
AOHC urges the Standing Committee on Finances and Economic Development to seriously consider our
recommendations.  We strongly believe that the legislative structure and framework for health care
reform must be one which provides for a prudent balance between the rights and responsibilities of
consumers and health providers with the powers and authority of the Health Minister and those to
whom these powers are delegated.
<P>
<H4>RECOMMENDATIONS:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>We strongly recommend that the provisions of Bill 26 respecting health care services be
amended to ensure that the health care goals articulated in the document "Mike Harris Forum on
Bringing Common Sense to Health Care - December 2, 1994" are not nullified. 
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that public input and consultation be incorporated into Bill 26
provisions as criteria for the Health Minister's consideration of what is "in the public
interest".  Furthermore, we urge that, in considering what is in the "public interest", the Health
Minister  (or Lieutenant Governor in Council) give regard to the diversity of Ontario's population
as it relates to the varying levels of health status as influenced by  gender, age, disability,
socio - economic level, geography, culture, ethnicity and language.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that a "sunset clause" on the extraordinary powers of the Health
Minister or his designate be incorporated into the relevant provisions of Bill 26.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that the government's stated intent to "facilitate the restructuring of
the hospital system"  in establishing the Health Services Restructuring Commission be incorporated
into the provisions of Schedule F of Bill 26.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that government use regulations only in defining, in greater detail,
powers that are already broadly referred to in the legislation.  In this respect, we urge the
government to delete Section 8. (8) of Part I of Schedule F of Bill 26.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that government incorporate appeal mechanisms into Bill 26 to ensure
that the public is a key player in determining local community health care priorities. 
<P>
<LI>We recommend that some form of public or quasi public disclosure/review be incorporated in
Bill 26 provisions specific to  the Ontario Drug Benefit Act to ensure transparency in the
negotiations between the Health Minister and drug manufacturers. 
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend the deletion of  Section 42(1) 31 of Schedule F - Part IV which allows
the Minister of Health to pass regulations "prescribing conditions under which the Minister may
collect, use or disclose personal information under subsection 37.1(1) and conditions under which
the Minister may enter into agreements under subsection 37,1(2):"

<H3>II.	INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of community
health centres (CHC) and some health service organizations (HSO) in Ontario.  AOHC has 60 member
centres supporting thousands of Ontarians, directly in primary health services, counselling,
housing, employment and other programs, and benefiting many others indirectly through  health
promotion and capacity building activities for individuals, families and communities.   The scope
of the programs and services provided by health centres is reflected in the AOHC mission which is:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"To represent member centres in the promotion of healthy public policy, healthy
individuals and communities through the creation and continuing development of health centres
which embody principles of accessible quality primary care, health promotion and active community
ownership and participation."</BLOCKQUOTE>

In this context, AOHC supports the reform of Ontario's health care system - a process that has
been consistently recommended by various task forces, commissions, committees, and the like since
the July 2, 1972 Report of the Community Health Centre Project to the Conference of Health
Ministers (commonly known as the Hastings Report).  Although we primarily view fiscal constraint
as an inappropriate reason for reforming the health care system, we acknowledge its practical role
in the current push for health care reform.   
<P>
We also acknowledge that Ontario's Progressive Conservative government was elected with a mandate,
among others, of fiscal restraint and management.  Our concern for the inevitable effects of
funding cuts to the health budget was lessened by the Progressive Conservative Party (PC) goals
and commitment for the health care system as identified in the document "Mike Harris Forum on
Bringing Common Sense to Health Care - December 2, 1994"" (hereinafter referred to as BCSTHC).  We
generally supported all the goals identified in the BCSTHC document.  In particular, we believed
that the PC goals specific to "management and accountability", "health care bill of rights",
"individual responsibility" and "fostering community involvement", combined with the party's
political will, could provide a functional framework for a truly reformed health care system.  As
noted, these particular goals are:

<P>
In this context, the AOHC committed to working with the government in its above noted goals as
strategies to achieving Ontario's health care reform.  Therefore, given our understanding of the
government's stated intent, we are alarmed at the common themes throughout the proposed
legislative amendments contained in Bill 26 - An Act to achieve Fiscal Savings and to promote
Economic Prosperity through Public Sector Restructuring, Streamlining and Efficiency and to
implement other aspects of the Government's Economic Agenda.  
<P>
We acknowledge that Bill 26 is intended to achieve fiscal savings.  We also recognize the
pressures on this government to undertake measures which result in this outcome.  As noted by the
title of Bill 26, the overall thrust of the proposed amendments is to grant government the
legislative powers and tools to meet its fiscal objectives.  However, certain provisions in Bill
26 cause AOHC to be greatly concerned that, in the pursuit of fiscal savings, government would end
up enacting legislation that will effectively nullify the Progressive Conservative Party goals on
achieving health care reform.  
<A NAME="con"></A><P>
<BR>
<H3>III. AOHC CONCERNS</H3>
<P>
The voluminous nature of Bill 26, combined with the extremely short notice AOHC had, makes it
virtually impossible for us to review Bill 26 in its entirety.  Therefore we have limited our
review, commentary, and recommendations to those sections of the bill pertaining to health
services.  In this respect, we found several portions of Bill 26 in direct conflict to most of PC
Party health care goals noted in the BCSTHC document.  We must note, however, our opinion that
certain provisions of Bill 26 would provide the necessary legislative levers to move the health
reform agenda.   We support the government's proposed amendments specific to these particular
provisions. Unfortunately, logistical limitations hinder us from commenting on these areas in this
presentation.  We would be pleased to discuss those areas directly with the Minister of Health at
his convenience.  
<P>
In AOHC's review of relevant portions of Bill 26,  specific provisions have caused us great
concern.  Provisions under Part IV of Bill 26 - Schedule F of Bill 26 open up the potential for a
range of facilities such as CHCs, to be deemed as independent health facilities within the meaning
of the Act.   AOHC hopes that the Health Minister will provide us with the opportunity to be
consulted if such a possibility is being contemplated.  For this presentation, we have attached
(Appendix A) more detailed commentary on areas that are of immediate concern.  During our review,
we noticed common themes emerging from certain provisions of Bill 26 and we have categorize these
themes as follows:
<A NAME="unq"></A><P>
<H4>a)	UNQUALIFIED SWEEPING POWERS</H4>
<P>
<B>Existing legislation already provides broad powers</B>
<BR>
Existing legislation already provides the Health Minister with a wide range of authority and
powers.  Not the least of these are those contained in the Ministry of Health Act and, in
particular, the extensive provisions of Section 6 of the Act.  Without a clear rationale for the
additional extraordinary legislative powers, AOHC is gravely concerned with the potentially
dangerous consequences of having one individual, albeit the Health Minister, having unrestricted
extraordinary powers over health matters affecting all Ontarians. We acknowledge that the current
Health Minister has already publicly indicated that he will not likely use all the powers that are
referred to Bill 26.  With due respect to the Health Minister, AOHC is gravely concerned that
these sweeping powers be enshrined in law without a corresponding set of checks and balances as
part of these amendments.  We further acknowledge that, in certain instances, the Health Minister
may need specific extraordinary powers to effect the changes necessary to reform Ontario's health
care system.  However, it is imperative that the rationale for these extraordinary powers is
widely communicated and clearly understood.  In addition, it is essential that some form of
"sunset clause" to these powers be included to ensure that such extraordinary powers are not used
beyond the original intent of the legislation. 
<P>
<B>Extensive use of the term "public interest" without a clear indication of how this
determination will be arrived at</B>
<BR>
The only apparent qualification for most of these extraordinary powers is the proviso that the
Health Minister or the Lieutenant Governor in Council. consider the "public interest".   We
conducted a brief literature review and have found that it is difficult to define "public
interest" and that there is no firm criteria that will hold for every single situation.  There
appears to be no definitive legal precedent that can be broadly applied.  MaCaulay, in his
"Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals", notes that one of the problems in
assessing the public interest is that a benefit to one group is often a detriment to another.   
<P>
AOHC accepts that the concept of public interest is dynamic and can change from situation to
situation depending on the values of those who are in the position to make the determination.  We
are, nevertheless, perplexed that the concept of "public interest" is not reflected in Bill 26
amendments to the Private Hospitals Act.  Albeit owned privately, private hospitals still use
public funds to provide services to members of the public.   As such, we are particularly
concerned with unqualified legislation that relates to how "public interest" is determined.  In
the relevant sections of Bill 26, this power is vested in the Health Minister or Lieutenant
Governor in Council.  AOHC believes that these powers need to be filtered through a process which
includes public input and consultation and that such be incorporated into Bill 26 as a criteria
for the Health Minister's or Lieutenant Governor in Council's consideration of what is "in the
public interest".  Furthermore, we believe that, in considering what is in the "public interest",
the relevant authority must give regard to the diversity of Ontario's population as it relates to
the varying levels of health status as influenced by  gender, age, disability, socio - economic
status, geography, culture, ethnicity and language.
<P>
<B>Legislation being subordinate to the regulations process</B>
<BR>
Amendments proposed in Schedule F - Part I of Bill 26 do not define the function of the Health
Services Restructuring Commission being created.  Notwithstanding this lack of definition, the
amendment proposed in section 2. (1) grants the Health Minister the power to make regulations for
"assigning duties to the Health Services Commission and respecting any conditions with respect to
the assigning of those duties."  AOHC is greatly concerned that the proposed amendments will allow
for the subsequent granting of extensive powers through the regulations process.  For example
Section 8.(8) of Schedule F - Part I of Bill 26 states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Where a regulation is made assigning a duty to the Commission, the Lieutenant
Governor in Council may provide that only specified members of the Commission are to carry out
that duty or that only specified members of the Commission are to carry out that duty within a
specified geographic area, and where the regulation so provides, any action or decision of those
members shall be deemed to be an action or decision of the Commission."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This amendment is clearly dangerous not only in the sense that specified individuals can act
without the need for their authority and direction to be sanctioned by the Commission as a whole. 
It is also alarming in that it confers to individuals extensive powers that have not previously
been given scope by legislation.  
<P>
The regulations process, as such, is not subject to credible public scrutiny nor is it open to
debate as required by the legislations process.  In this case, there is great potential for the
subsequent granting of extensive powers to be "hidden" from public scrutiny.  We believe that
regulations must only be used to define, in greater detail, powers that are already broadly
referred to in the legislation and strongly caution the government against this approach. 
<P>
<B>Potential for Bill 26 amendments to be in conflict with existing legislation</B>
<BR>
Once proclaimed,  the provisions of Bill 26 will be disconnected from their original purpose which
is "fiscal savings and restructuring."  When these provisions are consolidated into specific
existing statutes such as The Ministry of Health Act, The Public Hospitals Act, etc., they become
subordinate to other purposes, not envisioned by the drafters of Bill 26, which open the door to
potential abuse of power and disregard for the democratic process.  In addition, even some of the
seemingly more modest proposals for achieving savings contained in this Bill may be subject to
substantial abuse of power over time.  
<P>
<B>Intent of amendments is not incorporated in Bill 26 provisions</B>
<BR>
Bill 26 amendments respecting the Health Services Restructuring Commission create only the shell
that would subsequently allow for the granting of potentially extensive powers through the
regulations process.  In its November 29th Fiscal and Economic Statement, the government clearly
stated its intent, in creating the Commission, as being to "facilitate the restructuring of the
hospital system".    Section 8.1 (4) of the  existing Ministry of Health Act defines in detail the
functions of a district health council (DHC).  Restructuring of Ontario's health care system
requires significant and massive shifting and readjustment of funding, governance structures,
services, provider roles, etc.   It is, and will continue to be for sometime, a painful and
frustrating process for most Ontarians.  Nevertheless, AOHC believes that some mechanisms open to
government could alleviate some of the frustration, through a clarity of direction and and
transparency of process.  It is imperative that the functions of the Health Services Restructuring
Commission be defined to ensure a clear delineation of the role of the Commission as it relates to
the existing role of DHCs.  
<P>
<B>Lack of built in appeal mechanisms</B>
<BR>
Although Bill 26 provisions are unprecedented in the scope of the powers it gives to the
Lieutenant Governor in Council and the Health Minister or his designate, there is no corresponding
set of appeal mechanisms.  The government's previously noted health care goals will only be given
life if tested against a system that allows concerns arising from government decisions to be
heard.  As noted in the BCSTHC document, "the public should be a key player in determining local
community health care priorities".   AOHC urges the government to incorporate appeal mechanisms
into Bill 26 that would allow the public at the local level a key role in determining their health
priorities.
<A NAME="ero"></A><P>
<BR>
<H4>b)	EROSION/NULLIFICATION OF AUTHORITY & AUTONOMY OF DULY INCORPORATED LOCAL BOARDS OF
DIRECTORS</H4>
<P>
<B>Existing accountability/authority through the Corporations Act</B>
<BR>
In Ontario, local public hospital boards of directors are incorporated under the Corporations Act. 
In addition, specific corporate powers are also provided for under certain sections of the Public
Hospitals Act.  This approach provides an assurance that the local facility or agency is subject
to appropriate lawful checks and balances contained in the respective legislation.  At the same
time, this also allows community input and local autonomy and authority in decision making.  Bill
26's provisions specific to amending various portions of the Public Hospitals Act have the direct
effect of undermining and nullifying a local board of directors' authority and autonomy.  For
instance, the ministerial powers detailed in Section 6. (1) - (8) of Part II - Schedule F of Bill
26 tantamount to the displacement, by default, of the corporate status of the local board.  In
effect, the proposed amendments render the local board of directors merely an instrument of the
Health Minister to do as he wishes with little or no qualification.  In concert with other
provisions of Bill 26, this approach eliminates the capacity of local boards to ensure that the
community has more say in establishing their health priorities.
<P>
<B>Creation of a parallel system of authority and accountability by default</B>
<BR>
We strongly believe that government's role is to set the general policy on health, define broad
parameters for the health care system and ensure  appropriate monitoring systems that will provide
accountability to both the public and government. The process and structures for health services
delivery must satisfy broad parameters set by government but these parameters should be flexible
enough to adapt to the local situation and preserve those community structures that allow for
effective management.  In fact, we were encouraged by the Progressive Conservative Party's
commitment on management and accountability, articulated in the BCSTHC document, which states: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>"We believe that Ontario's health care system would benefit from a team approach to
management at all levels. Under our approach, professionals would be encouraged to bring
innovative ideas forward and assist in system management, creating more of a team environment. 
This would lower barriers between professional and management and focus everyone on improving
health care for the people of Ontario." </BLOCKQUOTE>

Bill 26 provisions effectively grant the Health Minister or his designate with the authority to
"manage" at the local level.  Notwithstanding the retention of the existing Section 7 of the
Public Hospitals Act which provides for the powers of public hospitals under specified acts they
are created under, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of Part II of Schedule F of Bill 26 essentially allow
the Health Minister to establish a parallel system of management and authority accountable only to
the Health Minister. 
<P>
Bill 26 must be amended to clearly delineate powers and authority that are exercised at the local
level, regional level and at the provincial level.  Without qualification, certain provisions in
Bill 26 will create a parallel system of authority without the corresponding accountability. This
situation could lead to disorder, parallel systems competing for control, regulatory powers being
applied inequitably throughout the province and other chaotic situations which would categorically
undermine any possibility of achieving a "co-ordinated system of management, with health care
professionals leading the way, working with government and incorporating community and consumer
concerns" as noted in the BCSTHC document.
<A NAME="und"></A><P>
<BR>
<H4>c)	UNDERMINING COMMUNITY CAPACITY BUILDING/OWNERSHIP</H4>
<P>
As it currently stands, existing administrative structures have been inadequate in maximizing
public input into health care decisions.  This situation was recognized by the PC Party in the
BCSTHC document which states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"For too long, the public has been a silent partner in important health care
decisions, and has had to defer to politicians and administrators to manage Ontario's health care
system.......In too many cases, there has been no real consultation with the public before
services which people value highly are reduced....True consultation only occurs when government
not only listens to the people, but hears what they have to say and responds to their concerns
with action."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Ironically, Bill 26 provisions exclude existing legislation that allow opportunities for public
input and consultation in critical decisions regarding health services at the local level. For
instance, Section 13. (1) of Part II - Schedule F of Bill 26 amends Section 32. (1) (d) of the Act
which allows the Minister, in making regulations respecting hospitals, to prescribe matters upon
which by-laws are to be passed by hospitals.  The Bill 26 amendment proposes to add to the
previously noted section the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"prescribing provisions of by-laws to be passed by hospitals and providing for the
filing of by-laws with the Ministry"</BLOCKQUOTE>

The current Public Hospitals Act contains numerous provisions that already allow the Health
Minister broad powers which include, among others, the monitoring and supervision of hospitals,
the care of hospital patients, appointments to hospital boards, and approval of hospital by-laws.  
For example, Section 12 (1) of the Public Hospitals Act already allows for the Health Minister
veto power on by-laws passed by hospitals.  The Bill 26 amendment would provide the Health
Minister the additional power to also prescribe the by-law provision.  In effect there is no
substantive decision making power left in public hospital boards of directors. Unless amended,
Bill 26 will result in the total lack of legislative requirement to involve the community in the
determination of health care priorities at the local level.  Unchecked, this situation will
inevitably lead to the breaking down of volunteerism, community self-reliance and community
ownership as we know it in Ontario.  
<P>
In addition, aside from the phrase "in the public interest", relevant Bill 26 amendments to the
Ministry of Health Act, Public Hospitals Act, etc. do not include a process through which the
public can be involved in the process.   It is essential that, in considering what is in the
"public interest", regard is given not only to the diversity of Ontario's population but also to
increasing public awareness, education and accessibility of process.
<A NAME="pot"></A><P>
<BR>
<H4>d)	POTENTIAL FOR UNFAIR TREATMENT</H4>
<P>
Provisions of Part IV- Schedule F of Bill 26 open the potential for a range of facilities such as
CHCs, to be deemed as independent health facilities within the meaning of the Act.  Section 5 (1)
- Part IV - Schedule F of Bill 26 provides for a director authorized by the Health Minister to
request one or more proposals for the establishment and operation of one or more independent
health facilities by:
<P>
a)	sending a request for a proposal to one or more specified persons; or<BR>
(b)	publishing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in Ontario, ...
<P>
This proposed amendment gives the government legislative authority to be selective in "who" can
send requests for proposals (RFPs) and how these are to be processed and awarded.  There is no
built in assurance that fair opportunity to the public must occur.  Furthermore, Section 7 (1) -
Schedule G - Part I of Bill 26 deletes from existing legislation reference to the Fee Negotiating
Committee which has joint representation from the Ministry of Health and the Ontario Pharmacists
Association (OPA) and excludes the OPA in determination of  dispensing fees.  While this could be
a mechanism for keeping prices down to allow for the "softening" of  co-payment provisions,
eliminating OPA's involvement results with the government dealing directly with the manufacturers.
Without some kind of public or quasi public disclosure/review included in the Act, AOHC is
concerned with the potential for selected manufacturers to drive the prices up. 
<A NAME="unp"></A><P>
<BR>
<H4>e)	UNPRECEDENTED DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</H4>
<P>
Bill 26 contains provisions that would allow the government to gain and use personal information
in an unprecedented manner.  Section 6 (2) d of the Ministry of Health Act already provides for
the Minister to have the power to: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>"collect such information and statistics respecting the state of health of the public,
health resources, facilities and services and any other matters relating to the health needs or
conditions affecting the public as are necessary or advisable, and publish any information so
collected."</BLOCKQUOTE>

In  Bill 26, Schedule F - Part IV, Section 42(1) 31 allows the Minister of Health to pass
regulations "prescribing conditions under which the Minister may collect, use or disclose personal
information under subsection 37.1(1) and conditions under which the Minister may enter into
agreements under subsection 37,1(2):"  
<P>
Section 6 (2) d of the Ministry of Health Act currently provides for the Minister to have the
power to"collect such information and statistics respecting the state of health of the public,
health resources, facilities and services and any other matters relating to the health needs or
conditions affecting the public as are necessary or advisable, and publish any information so
collected."  Bill 26 proposes to further extend these broad powers to provide the government with
the authority to disclose personal information to any party it enters into an agreement with.  
<P>
The highly confidential nature of health records requires its handling with the utmost care. While
the information medium (paper, electronic, etc.) may be owned by the respective health provider or
facility, the actual personal health information belongs to persons referred to in the respective
health records.  With the opening of Ontario's health care sector to foreign owned businesses, 
information which these firms receive resulting from agreements with the Ontario government
becomes subject to a non-Canadian authority.  
<P>
The Progressive Conservative Party's commitment in a "Health Care Bill of Rights" identifies,
among other rights, the following: "right to participate in decision-making regarding own's own
health and the right to treatment free of discrimination and which recognizes one's privacy,
dignity and individuality."  AOHC is gravely concerned that the relevant Bill 26 provisions will
put at great risk the privacy, dignity and individuality of Ontarians. 
<A NAME="conc"></A><P>
<BR>
<H3>IV.	CONCLUSION</H3>
<P>
Within logistical constraints, AOHC has taken a close and temperate review of the provisions of
Bill 26 relating to health services.  We have found provisions that we believe are necessary to
effect the reform of the health care system in Ontario.  However, we are deeply concerned with
specific provisions that grant unqualified extraordinary powers to government, erode and nullify
the authority and autonomy of local incorporated boards of directors, undermine community
capacities and ownership, opens up the potential for unfair treatment and grant unprecedented
access and use of personal health records.  On balance, we believe that these provisions would put
in great jeopardy the health care goals and commitment articulated by the Progressive Conservative
Party as contained in its document "Mike Harris Forum on Bringing Common Sense to Health Care -
December 2, 1994 ."
<P>
We urge the Standing Committee on Finances and Economic Development to seriously consider our
recommendations.  We strongly believe that the legislative structure and framework for health care
reform must be one which provides for a prudent balance between the rights and responsibilities of
consumers and health providers with the powers and authority of the Health Minister and those to
whom these powers are delegated.
<P>
<H4>RECOMMENDATIONS:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>We strongly recommend that the provisions of Bill 26 respecting health care services be
amended to ensure that the health care goals articulated in the document "Mike Harris Forum on
Bringing Common Sense to Health Care - December 2, 1994" are not nullified. 
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that public input and consultation be incorporated into Bill 26
provisions as criteria for the Health Minister's consideration of what is "in the public
interest".  Furthermore, we urge that, in considering what is in the "public interest", the Health
Minister  (or Lieutenant Governor in Council) give regard to the diversity of Ontario's population
as it relates to the varying levels of health status as influenced by  gender, age, disability,
socio - economic level, geography, culture, ethnicity and language.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that a "sunset clause" on the extraordinary powers of the Health
Minister or his designate be incorporated into the relevant provisions of Bill 26.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that the government's stated intent to "facilitate the restructuring of
the hospital system"  in establishing the Health Services Restructuring Commission be incorporated
into the provisions of Schedule F of Bill 26.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that government use regulations only in defining, in greater detail,
powers that are already broadly referred to in the legislation.  In this respect, we urge the
government to delete Section 8. (8) of Part I of Schedule F of Bill 26.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that government incorporate appeal mechanisms into Bill 26 to ensure
that the public is a key player in determining local community health care priorities. 
<P>
<LI>We recommend that some form of public or quasi public disclosure/review be incorporated in
Bill 26 provisions specific to  the Ontario Drug Benefit Act to ensure transparency in the
negotiations between the Health Minister and drug manufacturers. 
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend the deletion of  Section 42(1) 31 of Schedule F - Part IV which allows
the Minister of Health to pass regulations "prescribing conditions under which the Minister may
collect, use or disclose personal information under subsection 37.1(1) and conditions under which
the Minister may enter into agreements under subsection 37,1(2):"

<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>Response to: "Implementation Vision"</H1>
<H1>Mental Health Reform</H1>
<H3>Association of Ontario Health Centres
<BR>
June 1994</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>I.	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs) in
Ontario.  Over 50 member centres (referred to as CHC's in this paper) support tens of
thousands of Ontarians, directly in primary care, counselling, housing, employment and
other programs, and benefit many others indirectly through health promotion, community
development and advocacy activities. 
<P>
Underlying the AOHC mandate to promote good health in Ontario is a common set of
beliefs and principles <A HREF="beliefs.html">(Appendix A)</A>.  We believe that
equity in health implies equal opportunities to achieve and maintain health, including
access to programs and services.  CHCs offer a variety of services addressing the
needs of their communities, usually to under-serviced and specific populations who,
due to a variety of barriers (geographic, cultural, linguistic, etc.), require
improved access.
<P>
Among the factors directly and indirectly affecting the mental health status of the
health centre's clients are existing barriers to access to the appropriate type of
mental health services.  CHCs believe that mental health is directly linked with
determinants of health such as, among others, social relationships, employment status,
education, housing, etc.
<P>
While AOHC supports the essence of the work that has resulted in the "Implementation
Vision" paper, we are concerned that the focus continues to be the psychiatric care
system without serious consideration for the promotion of  mental health.  In fact, we
are of the opinion that the "reform" could be more accurately termed "Reforming the
Psychiatric Care System".  We see the reform of the psychiatric care system as only
one aspect of a true mental health reform. In our response to the the "Implementation
Vision" paper, we hope to be able to provide some options for critical consideration
of the Ministry of Health in ensuring that mental health reform in Ontario is truly
"reformed" to respond to the health needs of Ontarians.
<P>
The "Implementaion Vision" claims to be a comprehensive community support and service
system.  In this current draft, it is not.  The Association of Ontario Health Centres
stresses that, in order for the mental health system to be truly reformed, there must
be a greater emphasis on health promotion within the context of people's lives in the
community.  Without this context, the mental health system will neither be reformed or
as supportive of people in the priority population.
<P>
<H4>RECOMMENDATIONS:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>We recommend that the "priority population" be defined by degree of function.
<P>
<LI>We recommend a values based definition that defines "community services that
espouse and strive to operate services based on values which :
<UL>
<LI>recognize program participants as citizens;
<LI>provide accessible services to consumers on the basis of their expressed needs;
<LI>provide individualized needs-based services designated to promote wellness and
generally improve the individual's quality of life;
<LI>provide meaningful involvement of consumers in governance planning, delivery, and
evaluation of all aspects of the service. 
<LI>provide services in the least restrictive environment, using the minimum
intervention
</UL>
<LI>We recommend a functional and effective relationship be established between the
various provincial ministries to ensure that factors affecting mental health are duly
considered in policy setting and resource allocation.
<P>
<LI>We recommend that the human resource strategy in the health sector be reflective
of consumer service needs and, as such, provide for appropriately trained mental
health providers and that, appropriate training programs be in place to ensure
adequate supply of trained and qualified mental health providers.
<P>
<LI>We recommend that government develop a defined fiscal strategy for mental health
reform and that specific transitional funds be dedicated to ensure that the "shift to
community" in mental health services is made a reality.
<P>
<LI>We recommend that consumers be  key players in the planning and accountability
structure and, further, that the accountability structure be clearly linked to outcome
measures.
<P>
<LI>We urge the Ministry of Health to formally acknowledge the serious impact of the
current mental health reform strategy on community based organizations' ability to
provide appropriate services to their communities.
<P>
<LI>We further urge the Ministry of Health to actively consult community based
organizations such as CHCs in subsequent stages of the multi-year plan.
</OL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) Beliefs and Principles <A
HREF="beliefs.html">(Appendix A)</A> recognizes that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Health is the extent to which an individual or group is able, on one
hand, to realize aspirations and satisfy needs; and, on the other hand, to change or
cope with the environment.  Health is therefore seen as a resource for everyday life,
not the objective of living; it is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal
resources, as well as physical capacity."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Among the beliefs of AOHC are:
<UL>
<LI>that all people have the right to the fundamental conditions and resources for
good health which are: peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable eco-system,
sustainable resources, social justice and equity.
<P>
<LI>that the health of a community is maximized through a partnership which combines
the skills, knowledge and life experience/expertise of individuals and community with
those of the health centre staff.
<P>
<LI>that communities and individuals have the right to services, programs and
activities that are respectful, relevant and effective.
<P>
<LI>that health agencies must strive to remove barriers which prevent people and
communities from achieving their full health potential.
</UL>
We believe that the framework for community service delivery for people with mental
health problems must be comprehensive, health promoting, and framed in the belief that
individuals, with appropriate support, can improve their lives.  We also believe that
that the service delivery process must emphasize collaboration, partnership, client
empowerment and elimination of barriers to access.  Regardless of the severity of
their mental illness, or their social or economic background, we believe that, to be
healthy, people must be in control of their health.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES</H3>
<P>
Community health centres (CHCs), which are community owned, provide "one-stop
shopping" with a consumer driven approach.  Their mental health programs are often
generic and based on specific need or issue brought to light by their clients.  CHCs
provide a holistic approach and deal with needs and issues rather than diagnosis. 
They usually focus on systemic issues such as poverty and housing rather than focus on
illness.  They have found that while most of their clients lack  a "diagnosis", many
suffer from complex mental health problems.  It is noteworthy that many of their
clients are currently unable to access the mainstream mental health system due to the
complexity of their multiservice needs.
<P>
Community mental health issues are a growing concern within community health centres. 
The majority of CHCs rate mental health issues within their top 3 priorities.  CHCs
report that 10%  to 50 % of clients have mental health problems, with the urban CHCs
indicating larger proportions.  CHCs are seeing a greater number of children, families
and economically disadvantaged clients experiencing mental health problems.  They
usually present a multiplicity of problems, with an increasing number of people with
depression, anxiety, family problems, and abuse, added to problems of addiction,
housing, etc.
<P>
In many CHCs, "severely mentally ill" clients make up anywhere from 2% to 30 % of the
total clientele.  A large proportion of clients seen by CHCs are street people.  Many
street people who go to a CHC may initially present physical ailments such as sore
feet or a "cold" are subsequently found to have multiple problems including mental
health problems.

<BR>
<H3>CONSULTATION QUESTIONS</H3>
<P>
<H4>What are the strengths of the implementation vision?</H4>
<P>
For the most part, we find the vision, values and principles in keeping with AOHC's
beliefs  and principles (Appendix A) and we endorse the general thrust of the vision. 
The following highlights areas we would like to emphasize:
<P>
Recognition of the broader determinants of health - A key strength of the
"Implementation Vision" is the formal acknowledgement and  recognition of role
determinants of health play in the health status of individuals.  There is an
inextricable link between health determinants such as housing, employment and
education and mental health status.
<P>
Emphasis on community services - The emphasis on role of community services is long
overdue.  A  seamless continuum can only be actualized if it goes beyond the medical
model which has limited points of entry.  Clients needing mental health services
usually access CHCs due to availability and accessibility of crisis response services. 
These services, which focus on effective and efficient use of resources, help "divert"
individuals from inappropriate hospitalization.   Non medical crisis intervention
which focuses on mental health issues are required to provide psychological and social
support. 
<P>
Consumer Driven- We support the "Statement of Values and Definitions" which focuses on
the consumer survivor in core and support service provision.  We see the reformed
mental health system providing services according to need, as expressed by the
consumer/ survivors with a minimum of restriction and intrusion.
<P>
Self Determination - We support the emphasis on the participation of consumer/
survivors in all aspects of the mental health system, including governance, planning,
program development, program delivery and evaluation.  Reinforcement of the concept of
consumer empowerment in ensuring accountability to the consumer is an added strength.
<P>
Inter-ministerial collaboration - The strength of this element is somewhat weakened by
the lack of defined implementation plans.  To  increase community tenure for
individuals with mental illness and reduced dependence on inpatient services in "a
system that will be a seamless continuum" is essential for decreasing systemic
barriers. However, rhetoric alone can not be considered a strength.
<P>
<H4>What are the weaknesses of the implementation vision?</H4>
<P>
Priority Population Definition:  Definition of the "priority population" of the
severely mentally ill as defined by diagnosis, duration, and disability rather than by
need continues to have service access driven by a medical "diagnosis".  This approach
impedes the access to the mental health system by individuals who are in high and
continuous need of service but who are not willing or able to obtain a diagnosis.  
<P>
This will be particularly difficult for individuals who have multiple problems such as
the homeless or people who have become disenfranchised from the system.  We believe
that the definition should be based on degree of function.  The access to service
through a generic system is often less labeling or threatening to individuals in need.
<P>
It is ironic that there is almost no mention of the concepts of illness prevention and
health promotion in the report.  This is in direct contrast to previously released
reports of the Premiers Council on Health.  The determination of whose needs are the
highest priority must rest on the community as a whole and not based on a
pre-determined government definition.
<P>
<H4>Definition of community services</H4> 
<P>
Proposed components of health reform require a significant redirection of health
resources toward the community.  The AOHC believes community-based services are
integral to health reform.  They are an excellent avenue to promote provincial health
goals to shift emphasis from an illness treatment to health promotion and illness
prevention. A "reformed" system is not merely a replication of institutional programs
now located in the community. Community means must be not only community based but
also community owned and driven. 
<P>
<H4>Inter-ministerial collaboration</H4>
<P>
The lack of inter-ministerial collaboration has been identified in many reports and
forums as a barrier to effective program planing and resource allocation. Reform of
the mental health system requires that serious consideration and action be undertaken
to implement inter-ministerial collaboration.  AOHC has raised this issue repeatedly
at various levels of government and have yet to see any real change in the status quo.
<P>
In terms of mental health reform, we are concerned that approaches to health and
social issues will remain divided without any true reform occurring. 
<P>
We are especially concerned about mental health for children and the lack of linkages
between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Community and Social Services. 
Children's mental health services are not mentioned within the Implementation Vision
document.  Prevention of adult mental illness by addressing the needs of children and
youth should be of paramount importance to Ontarians.  Services for children and youth
ranging from mental health promotion to Counselling and treatment services are needed
for children and youth. The framework for these services must be integrated at the
ministerial level.
<P>
<H4>Reform  of treatment</H4>
<P>
A "reformed system" dictates that reform extend to the treatment modes. Alternative
forms of treatment covering the full range of bio-psycho-social treatments need to be
considered. Along with this approach, there is a need for an adequate supply of
appropriately trained mental health providers.
<P>
<H4>What do you see are the opportunities for implementing this vision?</H4>
<P>
Although the current fiscal climate may be viewed as a hindrance to implementing the
vision, it is also forces government's policy setting and implementation to be more
functional and effective.  A current trend for regional planning, as indicated by the
various responsibilities delegated to District Health Councils (DHC), provides a
mechanism through which the vision could be integrated into the various health reform
initiatives underway.  In consultation with other health organizations and agencies,
DHCs can play a key role in integrating the vision with related initiatives at a
regional and local level.  Health reform initiatives that stand alone are in great
danger of not influencing a system approach to the issues.
<P>
<H4>What are the barriers for implementing this vision?</H4>
<P>
The remaining components of the multi-year agreement will be significant in either
strengthening or limiting the success of reform.  These are the labour strategy,
fiscal structure, and structure of accountability for the reform process.  We
encourage the Ministry to move towards eliminating the potential barriers for
implementing reform in the multi-year agreement by adjusting your strategies in the
following areas:
<P>
Labour strategy - The report recognizes that the people working in the mental health
system are an important resource.  Though job security must be considered in the
process it should not outweigh "putting people first" in the mental health system. 
The hospital restructuring has resulted in a significant number of institutional
workers being displaced.  It is important to note that the requirements in community
health services, including community mental health, requires the appropriate personnel
if reform is to be effective.  It can not be assumed that a worker who is able to
function in a hospital/institutional setting will automatically be able to function if
a community.
<P>
For a health human resource strategy to be successful, the  following are essential
elements:
<UL>
<LI>clear  definition of the community's own requirements regarding functions, skill
sets and personal suitability criteria of those who will be providing mental health
services;
<P>
<LI>job screening and matching based on suitability;
<P>
<LI>appropriate training of community service providers with sensitivity  and
anti-racism training where indicated;
</UL>
<P>
(See Recommendation #4)
<P>
Fiscal Strategy -  Mental health reform requires that a fiscal strategy be in place. 
Funds "saved" from cuts to hospital/institutional services have been diverted to
reduction in deficits.  The shrinking health envelope of funding has resulted in
resources lost from the hospital base without a shift to the community.  
<P>
Unless there is a clear fiscal policy on reallocation of funds there is a real danger
of ending up with a system where services will be provided by those who have the funds
not those who are the most appropriate to provide the service.  
<P>
We cannot emphasize enough the need for transitional funding during the movement or
services and supports to the community to ensure community services and supports are
in place prior to further  hospital bed closures.
<P>
<H4>Accountability</H4>
<P>
The literature repeatedly underlined the importance of clear accountability to ensure
the success of reform.  This form of accountability goes beyond what is currently in
the District Health Councils' mandate and capacity.  
<P>
The model of accountability should go beyond planning to include maintenance of
information systems, evaluations that hold the services accountable to standards and
the consumer, an appeal process for those who have been denied service, as well as
service disputes, systems advocacy, the method of local resource allocation and
process to manage service non-compliance.  The planning and accountability structure
within the implementation planning document does not clearly link program planning to
outcomes and ensure program monitoring of the shift from hospital to the community.
<P>
On a broader view, there is currently accountability between the community, the DHCs
and the funders.  As it presently functions the DHC has minimum, if any,
accountability to the community. From the experience of some "community"
representatives on  DHCs, there is both real and perceived lack of "power" by
non-hospital DHC representatives.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
<P>
Implementation of mental health reform requires a variety of key elements to be in
place. A multi-year approach provides an incremental process through which elements of
the reform can be either established or integrated with other health reform
intiatives.  Community health centres provide an excellent vehicle for the integration
at the local level of the various health reform initiatives.
<P>
The "Implementaion Vision" claims to be a comprehensive community support and service
system.  In this current draft, it is not.  The Association of Otnatio Health Centres
stresses that, in order for the mental health system to be truly reformed, there must
be a greater emphasis on health promotion within the context of people's lives in the
community.  Without this context, the mental health system will neither be reformed or
as supportive of people in the priority population.

<H1>Position Paper on Bill 173</H1>
<H2>"An Act Respecting Long Term Care"</H2>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHC) and some health service organizations (HSO) in Ontario. 
With 53 member centres (referred to as CHCs in this paper) supporting tens of
thousands of Ontarians, directly in primary health services, counseling, housing,
employment and other programs, and benefiting many others indirectly through  health
promotion, community development and advocacy activities. CHCs provide a variety of
services to under serviced communities who, due to a variety of barriers (geographic,
cultural, linguistic, etc. ), need improved access.  
<P>
Underlying the AOHC mandate to promote good health in Ontario is a common set of
beliefs and principles <A HREF="beliefs.html">(Appendix A)</A>.  We believe that
equity in health implies equal opportunity to achieve and maintain health, including
access to programs and services. As such, we believe that, passed in its current form,
Bill 173 will negatively affect access to programs and services thus affecting
fundamental resources for health.  AOHC generally supports the reform of the long term
care services and the attempt to implement reform through Bill 173.  However, we
believe that certain sections erode the overall merits of the bill.  We are concerned
with the inconsistencies of provisions in the bill with the previously announced
thrust of reform in long-term care services ("Partnerships" documents, May 1993,
September 1993).
<P>
We believe that the role of the community needs to be acknowledged and valued in any
reform initiative.  Bill 173 must be amended to clearly delineate those areas that are
controlled locally, those controlled regionally, and those controlled at the
provincial level.  Government should set the broad parameters for the delivery of long
term care services but it must not attempt to "manage" at the local level.  Any model
of service delivery used in long term care services must satisfy broad parameters set
by government but flexible enough to adapt to the local situation and preserve those
community structures that allow for effective management.  Ontario's community health
centre (CHC) model funded through the Community Health Branch is an excellent example
of such a model.  Indeed, where it fits with the local situation, the CHC may be the
best vehicle for MSA designation.   On the whole, and at the very least, the reform
process must result in improved accessibility, quality of service, cost-effectiveness
and improved accountability to the clients, the community and government.  
<P>
We strongly urge the Standing Committee on Social Development to seriously consider
our recommendations which we believe will ensure that the legislative structure and
framework for long-term care services provide for a balance that would allow both
consumers and providers a true partnership in the delivery of services within the
context of a provincial framework.

<H2>I.	INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
The Beliefs and Principles of the AOHC <A HREF="beliefs.html">(Appendix A)</A> reflect
a holistic approach to health.  Health is, therefore, seen as a "resource for everyday
life, not the objective for living; it is a positive concept emphasizing social and
personal resources, as well as a physical capacity".  
<P>
Among the beliefs of AOHC are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>that all people have the right to the fundamental conditions and resources for
good health which are: peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem,
sustainable resources, social justice and equity.
<P>
<LI>that the health of a community is maximized through a partnership which combines
the skills, knowledge and life experience/ expertise of individuals and community with
those of the health centre staff.
<P>
<LI>that communities and individuals have the right to service, programs and
activities that are respectful, relevant and effective.
<P>
<LI>that health agencies must strive to remove barriers which prevent people and
communities form achieving their full health potential.
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>II.	COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES</H2>
<P>
In Ontario, community health centres (CHC) are community based, community owned, and
community driven organizations which provide a comprehensive  approach, at the local
level, to health service delivery.  CHCs operate through annual program funding by the
Community Health Branch.  A significant proportion of the CHC clients are elderly,
people with disabilities, as well as those convalescing from an illness.  A number of
CHCs currently provide long-term care services and programs.  These programs and
services are developed in close consultation with the clients and are based on the
specific needs or issues brought to light by these clients.  These CHCs also work
closely with other agencies to advocate for services and resources the community needs
within the CHC and other agencies.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>III.	AOHC AREAS OF CONCERN RE: BILL 173</H2>
<P>
Bill 173 outlines the service standards for Ontario's long-term care services but it
fails to incorporate the concept of "wellness" as a key principle of long-term care
reform.   The concept of wellness calls for an acknowledgment of the role played by
the determinants of health in long term care reform.  With wellness as a component of
the legislative framework, service provision would be directed not only towards
identified consumer "needs" but also towards maximizing, to the extent possible, the
consumer "capacities" for health.  Community capacities are tapped through measures
which provide for effective community control and participation in service delivery.   
As such, reform of long term care services can only be achieved through a service
delivery model that is based on wellness and health promotion principles.   Bill 173,
as written, lacks this vision and must be critically reviewed in the context of "true
health reform".
<P>
<H3>A.	Holistic Approach to Service Delivery</H3>
<P>
The "long-term care needs" of an individual are the result of a variety of health 
factors and risks that are inextricably linked. As such, it makes sense to provide for
these needs through a holistic, interdisciplinary approach in service delivery. The
blueprint for MSAs (multi-service agencies,  September/93) indicated that MSAs would
combine the responsibilities of home care and placement co-ordination with the
existing services of professional services, community groups.  However, Part II of
Bill 173  makes a distinction between community support services, homemaking services
and personal support services.  This distinction reflects more of a medical
(institutional) approach as opposed to an integrated holistic approach.  It is
reminiscent of the Service Coordination Agency (SCA) model which was brought forth in
earlier government initiative and subsequently abandoned. 
<P>
Among the purposes of Bill 173, as noted in Part I, are to: "simplify and improve
access to the continuum of community services...."; "to promote, the efficient
management of human, financial, and other resources involved in the delivery of
community  services."   These imply an intent to reduce fragmentation and duplication
of services, where such exist.  We are opposed to the service distinctions as noted in
Part II.  These distinctions  reflect an inflexibility and a rigidity of structure
which will be barriers to service accessibility and consumer choice. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #1</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that Part II be amended to provide for an integrated approach to 
health and social service delivery.</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>B.	Community Participation</H3>
<P>
We strongly believe that a fundamental cornerstone of health reform is the active
participation of individuals in their own health as well as that of their community. 
As noted previously, we believe that "the health of a community is maximized through a
partnership which combines the skills, knowledge and life experience/ expertise of
individuals and community" with those who provide health and social services.  
<P>
Although Section 20 of Part VII of the bill provides an opportunity for the client's
participation in their "plan of service", the section is silent on the role of the
community as a whole in the process other than by representation on the board.  At any
given time, there are a variety of community activities which influence the health and
social well being of individuals in their respective communities through partnerships
with a variety of community agencies.  The capacity of communities to help themselves
must be recognized by any legislation on long term care services.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #2</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We would recommend that Section 20, Part VII be amended to reflect a stronger
commitment to community participation.</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>C.  Volunteerism</H3>
<P>
We believe that communities have a right to service that is respectful, relevant, and
effective which includes the use of local volunteer experience to respond to local
needs.  We further believe that any legislation that provides for community service
delivery needs to acknowledge, emphasize and support the value of volunteerism. 
Community service delivery must ensure an appropriate balance between the role of paid
and non-paid health providers.  Community service that draws from the experience and
expertise gained by volunteers encourages the community to build upon its capacities
to help itself. 
<P>
Bill 173 does not appropriately recognize the role of volunteers.  The minimal mention
of volunteers which, as stipulated in Part XI, Section 56, #11, states that the
Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations "requiring multi-service agencies
to develop and implement a plan for recruiting and using the services of volunteers"
does not adequately recognize the role of volunteers in a collaborative,
interdisciplinary approach to community service.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #3</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that Bill 173 be amended to acknowledge the key role of volunteers in
community service delivery.</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>D.	Role of Ministry of Health/Role of District Health Councils</H3>
<P>
We believe that the health of a community is maximized through partnerships of
community people and health providers in the various activities that affect health. 
These partnerships are generally based on the knowledge, life experience, expertise
and mutual respect of the individuals involved.  Like any number of services provided
to the community, long term care services can only be truly effective if it builds not
only on the needs but also capacities of the community.
<P>
A number of areas in Bill 173 are in direct conflict with this principle.  Several
provisions, which provides for Ministry of Health and District Health Council control,
are prescriptive to the point of "managing" (in the abstract) specific local
conditions.  This approach is not consistent with the policy framework which indicated
that "multi service agencies" (MSAs) will be community-based and work at arms length
with the Ministry.  The Partnership documents also indicated that MSA planning will be
done at the local level through District Health Councils.  These documents recognized
the appropriate role for DHCs in their function as an advisory body to the Minister of
Health.
<P>
Examples of sections which reflect significant government control:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Part IX - stipulates the appeals process in the event of consumer disagreement
with the local MSA's decision regarding access, type and volume of service.  The only
level of appeal available by-passes the local MSA, the local DHC and go directly to a
provincial "Appeal Board".  The appeal process and structure contained in Bill 173 not
only take the accountability from the local level but it also eliminates the
capacities of local agencies to be responsive in a timely manner.
<P>
<LI>Part X - stipulates the powers of the Ministry to revoke or suspend an approval of
an agency, the approval of premises given to an agency, the designation of an MSA,
etc. This section provides for total government control in revocation of MSA
designation and unqualified takeover powers. 
<P>
<LI>Section 56, Part XI- stipulates the powers of the Lieutenant Governor in Council
to include the governance and management of a number operational issues within
approved agencies.  These include: "governing assessments" by approved agencies
(Subsection 15) as well as "governing the determination of the eligibility of persons"
applying for community services (Subsection 16).  In addition, Subsection 24 indicates
that quality management systems would be centrally controlled instead of being the
responsibility of the individual MSA.
</UL>
<P>
Example of provisions which reflect significant DHC role:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Section 62, Part XII - state that the functions of a DHC are:
<P>
a) to advise the Minister on health needs and other health matters in the council's
geographic area;<BR>
b) to make recommendations on the allocation of resources to meet health needs in the
council's geographic area;<BR>
c) to make plans for the development of a balanced and integrated health care system
in the council's geographic area; and,<BR>
d) to perform any other duties assigned to it under this or any other Act or by the
Minister.
</UL>
<P>
These legislative provisions confirm the "planning and advisory" role of district
health councils (DHCs).  As written, however, subsection (d) allows, should the
Minister see fit, the assignment of a "management" role to DHCs.  We have concerns
regarding the notion of DHCs being involved in "management" at the local level.  DHCs
were designed and resourced as planning and advisory bodies and should not have a
"management" role.  We are opposed to layers of management structures which are costly
and not necessarily effective. The previously noted "Partnerships" policy documents
indicated that MSAs are to function as independent agencies, with elected boards of
directors whose terms of office will be determined by each agency's bylaws.  Any
additional "management" layer will threaten and undermine the authority of local
agencies in addressing local needs and concerns. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #4</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that Part X and Section 56, Part XI be amended to include a community
consultation process prior to the ministerial decision for revocation or
takeover.</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #5</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that Part IX be amended to ensure greater community control and that
Section 62. (1) be amended by deleting  8.1 (4) (d).</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>E.	Balanced Approach to Service Delivery</H3>
<P>
Part III of the bill outlines a "bill of rights" for the consumer but fails to
acknowledge the broad policy and financial context which dictate the extent service
delivery can be provided.  Consumer rights as noted in Bill 173 can readily raise
expectations to a level that is not achievable and can not be ensured by the service
provider.  Section 3 (1) of Part III puts a mandatory onus ("shall") on the service
provider to ensure that specific rights and specific conditions for service delivery
are provided to the consumer.  The capacity of the service provider to meet the
conditions, as set out in this section, is directly related to the availability and
level of funding.  At the operational level, an unqualified "bill of rights" could
easily evolve as a barrier to a collaborative approach in service delivery. As
currently written, Section 3 (1), Part III, undermines the possibility of a mutually
workable partnership between consumers and providers.  This section needs to be
amended to provide for a balance between what consumers can and should expect and what
providers can reasonably deliver.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #6</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that Part III be amended by providing qualifications on the extent of
services can be ensured by the health provider.</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>F.	Flexibility</H3>
<P>
We are strongly opposed to an approach that inherently eliminates flexibility in the
delivery systems at the local level.  Bill 173 is full of provisions which imply
centralized control.    For example, Section 13 of Part VI imposes limits on the
amount an MSA can purchase community services (no more than 20%), limits on purchase
of homemaking services (no more than 20%), limits on the purchase of personal support
services (no more than 20%), limits on the purchase of professional services (no more
than 20%).  Similarly, Section 15 allows the Minister to exempt a designated MSA from
the responsibility of providing mandatory service.  Although this exemption is,
ostensibly, only for a period of four years, it sets the tone for management practices
that are dictated from Queen's Park.  
<P>
The provisions of Bill 173 must be amended to provide local management with the
responsibility and the authority needed to respond to the local situation. The
capacity of consumers and providers to develop and implement an appropriate service
plan as they see fit must not be subsumed by government.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #7</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that flexibility be integrated into the provisions of Bill 173.</H4>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>G.	Other</H3>
<P>
Notwithstanding that the terms "director" and "program supervisor" are identified in
Part II ("Interpretations"), their actual role in the MSA service delivery process is
not clearly defined.  A clear definition is critical to understanding the roles that
these positions would have in the reformed  system. Part IV of the bill  stipulates
the process and conditions for the appointment of "directors" and "program
supervisors".   As noted in Part IV, the Minister unilaterally makes these
appointments which suggest that these positions will wield a significant amount of
power in the long term care delivery system.  We reiterate our previously stated
concerns regarding centralized control.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation #8</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We recommend that the roles "director" and "program supervisor" be clearly
defined.</H4>
</DL>

<H2>IV.	CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
AOHC generally supports the reform of the long term care services.  We believe that
the role of the community needs to be acknowledged and valued in any reform
initiative.  Bill 173 must be amended to clearly delineate those areas that are
controlled locally, those controlled regionally and those controlled at the provincial
level.  Government should set the broad parameters for the delivery of long term care
services but it must not attempt to "manage" at the local level.  
Any model of service delivery used in long term care services must satisfy broad
parameters set by government but flexible enough to adapt to the local situation and
preserve those community structures that allow for effective management.  Ontario's
community health centre (CHC) model funded through the Community Health Branch is an
excellent example of such a model.  Indeed, where it fits with the local situation,
the CHC may be the best vehicle for MSA designation.   On the whole, and at the very
least, the reform process must result in improved accessibility, quality of service,
cost-effectiveness and improved accountability to the clients, the community and
government.

<STRONG>November 30, 1994</STRONG>

<P>
<H2>I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs) in
Ontario.  In July 1994, we submitted to the Hon. Lloyd Axworthy  (Appendix A) a brief
wherein we recommended that the Minister consider the principles of universality,
comprehensiveness, public administration, portability and accessibility as appropriate
principles to guide the reform process.  In the discussion paper "Agenda: Jobs and
Growth, Improving Social Security in Canada" released by the Minister in October 1994,
creating opportunity, investing in people, mutual responsibility , preventing future
problems, putting people first, greater fairness, and affordability are identified as
guiding principles of reform in the review of the social security net. We believe that
both sets of principles are complementary and can be meshed into a productive
framework of a reformed social security system.
<P>
AOHC recognizes that current realities such as insecure employment, increased personal
taxes, rapid changes in the nature of work, an aging population and the concern about
management of the deficit necessitate a reassessment of Canada's social safety system. 
We agree that the status quo can not continue and should not be maintained.  We are,
however, concerned that the review may be specific to a "readjustment" of the current
programs and not on a broader view and vision of an equitable national social security
system.  A narrow focus will result in a further erosion of social programs with
disastrous consequences.
<P>
We believe that an effective social security system is one wherein there is balance
between national standards and regional approaches to the implementation of these
standards.  It builds on the capacities of the individuals and communities by filling
in the "gaps" where such exists.  Community involvement, ownership and responsibility
in the reform process is critical to its success and viability.  
<P>
The objective of a social security system  should be on increasing the self
sufficiency of those currently supported by social programs and services while
acknowledging that a certain percentage of the population may continue to need full
support.  A reformed system is one wherein people have opportunities to participate in
the economy, learn new skills, and get timely support when the need occurs. We believe
that an effective  system integrates components of prevention, incentives and
deterrents into the support framework.  We are convinced that the strategies that work
for health reform can and will also work for the social security system.  As a
society, we are interdependent on each other and we need to rekindle the spirit of
communitarianism  among Canadians for the reform process to work.  
<P>

<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Review and clearly articulate the intent, eligibility, and funding scheme for the
Unemployment Insurance System.
<P>
<LI>Encourage self sufficiency by providing workers and employers with opportunities
for increasing worker marketability through the development of a range of skills,
expertise and experience.
<P>
<LI>Provide working parents with family supports that would allow greater
participation in training and employment opportunities such as child support and
support for working children who provide care and housing for elderly parents.  
<P>
<LI>Ensure that the education system provides a basic level of education and training
to  increase worker marketability across the employment sector.
<P>
<LI>Ensure that self sufficiency, individual and community responsibility are
highlighted through appropriate incentives for the educational system, community based
organizations, employer associations, etc.  
<P>
<LI>Encourage the development of community managed and delivered employment
opportunities such as in cooperative ventures, cottage industries, etc.
<P>
<LI>Establish national standards for targeting the reduction of child poverty through
the funding and implementation of appropriate programs and services. Transfer payments
to provinces for this purpose must be contingent on the provinces meeting national
standards.
<P>
<LI>Develop an expanded system of student loans with the repayment being based on the
borrower's ability to pay and with provisions for system review a few years after
implementation.
<P>
<LI>Establish "reducing disincentives to work for welfare recipients" and "reducing
child poverty" as national goals for social activity reform.
<P>
<LI>Establish universality, comprehensiveness, public administration, portability and
accessibility as national principles to federal support for social assistance and
services.
<P>
<LI>Establish guaranteed annual income based on national standards and have needed
additional funding come from the restructuring of Canada's tax system to raise overall
revenue more progressively.
<P>
<LI>Combine the Child Tax Benefit with other social spending on behalf of children to
create a new benefit for children of all low-income families, regardless of whether
the family is on welfare, unemployment insurance, or earning wage.  
<P>
<LI>Combine the new income benefit for children with an intensive community
development strategy to increase the parents' capacities for the transition into the
job market.

<H2>II. INTRODUCTION </H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs) in
Ontario.  In July 1994, we submitted to the Hon. Lloyd Axworthy  (Appendix A) a brief
wherein we recommended that the Minister consider the principles of universality,
comprehensiveness, public administration, portability and accessibility as appropriate
principles to guide the reform process.  In the discussion paper "Agenda: Jobs and
Growth, Improving Social Security in Canada" released by the Minister in October 1994
creating opportunity, investing in people, mutual responsibility , preventing future
problems, putting people first, greater fairness, and affordability are identified as
guiding principles of reform in the review of the social safety net. We believe that
both sets of principles are complementary and can be meshed into a productive
framework of a reformed social security system.
<P>
With the exception of  Old Age Security, Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Pension
Plan and transfer payments for health care, the government's discussion paper "Agenda:
Jobs and Growth" invites comments on aspects of the "social safety net" and identifies
some options for consideration.  We do not intend to cover all the options and areas
identified in the paper.  We will focus on the areas which we believe are essential
and those strategies which we have found to be effective.   
<P>
We believe that an effective social security system is one wherein there is balance
between national standards and regional approaches to the implementation of these
standards.  Community involvement, ownership and responsibility in the reform process
is critical to its success and viability.  To illustrate this point, we are providing
you with copies of our video "The CHC Vision" which  shows how the community ownership
can effectively influence a reform process.  We believe that an effective  system
integrates components of prevention, incentives and deterrents into the support
framework.  We are convinced that the strategies that work for health reform can and
will also work for the social security system.  As a society, we are interdependent on
each other and we need to rekindle the spirit of communitarianism  among Canadians for
the reform process to work.  
<P>
<BR>
<H2>III. 	COMPONENTS OF REFORM</H2>
<P>
We believe that a "social safety net" is only effective if it builds on the capacities
of the individuals and communities by filling in the "gaps" where such exists.  The
objective of the system should be towards increasing self sufficiency in those
currently supported by social programs and services while acknowledging that a certain
percentage of the population may continue to need full support. 
<P>
Social security programs and services need to be periodically reviewed in the context
of current and future realities. A reformed system is one wherein people have
opportunities to participate in the economy, learn new skills, and get timely support
when the need arises.  
<P>
<H3>WORKING</H3>
<P>
<H4>Unemployment Insurance</H4>
<P>
We generally agree that, to address the current problems with the UI, we need better
tools, better management and better access.   We also agree that having secure
employment is an effective way to achieve social security.  We also agree that more
attention should be given to appropriate training and readily accessible tools for job
market information.  We are opposed to the creation of separate systems for frequent
and non-frequent users of the unemployment insurance system  but would support
innovative, creative approaches to providing incentives for employment.  We would
support adjusting the existing UI program by increasing the length of time a person
must work to receive benefits.  It is extremely important that there is recognition of
the direct relationship between between length of unemployment and continuing need for
support.  However, we agree that there is merit in exploring the effect of a graduated
rate of benefits for situations wherein there is unaccountable frequency in the claims
history.
<P>
<H4>Financing UI and employment development services </H4>
<P>
The intent of unemployment insurance must be clearly defined prior to the
determination  of the UI eligibility criteria and funding scheme.  As an insurance
system, it must be redesigned to have the flexibility to adapt to the evolving nature
of the labour market.  As a funding scheme, it must be sufficient to meet the expected
requirements of the system and its purpose.  Otherwise, it is only a matter of time
before the system is used for ends other than its defined purpose. Determination of
the intent, eligibility and funding scheme of the Unemployment Insurance System  must
occur prior to the adjustment of other components of the "social safety net".  
<P>
<H4>Meeting the needs of working parents  </H4>
<P>
We strongly support measures that would allow parents to participate productively in
the work force.  Working parents need family supports that would allow greater
participation in training and employment opportunities.  In addition to child support,
consideration should also be given to supports for working children who provide care
and housing for elderly parents.  Among the support mechanisms that could be
considered are greater accessibility to childcare, provision of incentives to
employers to allow flexibility of work week hours,  shorter work weeks to allow for
better distribution of available jobs, etc.
<P>
<H3>Recommendations:</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Review and clearly articulate the intent, eligibility, and
funding scheme for the Unemployment Insurance System.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>2.</STRONG> Encourage self sufficiency by providing workers and employers
with opportunities for increasing worker marketability through the development of a
range of skills, expertise and experience.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>3.</STRONG> Provide working parents with family supports that would allow
greater participation in training and employment opportunities such as child support
and support for working children who provide care and housing for elderly parents.  
</DL>
<P>
<H3>LEARNING</H3>
<P>
<H4>Prevention</H4>
<P>
The discussion paper (p. 44) notes various circumstances that cause unemployment in
workers such as seasonal use of highly skilled workers, single purpose resource based
industries, regional disparities in levels of employment, lack of marketable skills,
etc.  We believe that this situation is indicative of an educational system that has
failed to provide the education and skills necessary to adjust to the changing nature
of work.
<P>
While it is not possible to address all these circumstances with a single mechanism,
it is critical that the education system provide a basic level of education and
training that would increase worker marketability across the employment sector.  
<P>
We note that the discussion paper also identifies"workers and employers who
intentionally make decisions about hiring and layoffs around the availability and
duration of UI benefits as well as workers who make similar calculations about when
they will work" among the reasons for the increase in the number of frequent users of
unemployment insurance.  This situation suggests an insidiously negative attitude
towards work  on the part of both these employers and workers.  While we recognize
that steps need to be taken to curb this negative and non-productive attitude, we are
more concerned with the perpetuation in future generations of the lack of incentive
towards work.  Children who grow up being exposed to the family income being "earned"
through these means would be inclined to view this method as the "norm". These
children will be the future workers and employers and we need to ensure that the cycle
is not repeated.  Self sufficiency, individual and community responsibility need to be
highlighted through education, community development activity, etc.  
<P>
We strongly support measures that would target the reduction of child poverty but
would be opposed to these measures being under the absolute jurisdiction of the
provincial governments.  Without experience to date with Medicare, we know that funds
transferred to provinces without qualifications will likely be used according to the
priorities set by the province with disregard for the national standards.
<P>
<H3>Recommendations:</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD><STRONG>4.</STRONG> Ensure that the education system provides a basic level of
education and training to  increase worker marketability across the employment sector.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>5.</STRONG> Ensure that self sufficiency, individual and community
responsibility are highlighted through appropriate incentives for the educational
system, community based organizations, employer associations, etc.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>6.</STRONG> Encourage the development of community managed and delivered
employment opportunities such as in cooperative ventures, cottage industries, etc.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>7.</STRONG> Establish national standards for targeting the reduction of
child poverty through the funding and implementation of appropriate programs and
services. Transfer payments to provinces for this purpose must be contingent on the
provinces meeting national standards.
</DL>
<P>
<H4>Post Secondary Education </H4>
<P>
The discussion paper suggests several options for reforming the federal funding for
post secondary education.  We support the option that deals with the development of an
expanded system of student loans with the repayment being based on the borrower's
ability to pay. We would, however, recommend that this system be reviewed a few years
after implementation. We have concerns with the suggestion that RRSPs be used for
retraining because it would render people more financially vulnerable in their senior
years.  
<P>
<H3>Recommendations:</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD><STRONG>8.</STRONG> Develop an expanded system of student loans with the repayment
being based on the borrower's ability to pay and with provisions for system review a
few years after implementation.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>SECURITY</H3>
<P>
The discussion paper suggests several options for consideration in the reform of the
Canada Assistance  Plan (CAP).  We agree that"reducing disincentives to work for
welfare recipients" and "reducing child poverty" are appropriate national goals for
social activity reform.
<P>
We support the concept of guaranteed annual income based on national standards. Needed
additional funding should come from the restructuring of Canada's tax system to raise
overall revenue more progressively. 
<P>
While there is some appeal in the notion of "block funding" to the provinces, we can
not support this approach because it further erodes the federal government's
responsibility and authority to ensure national standards as shown by examples in
Medicare such as extra billing practices of private clinics in Alberta.
<P>
We support the option of redirecting funding to new priorities.  While this approach
requires a broad public consensus and agreement with the provinces, we believe that it
is a worthwhile investment in ensuring that the reformed system has a critical mass of
support among Canadians.  We support improving child benefits with the focus on low
income families.  We agree with the concept of combining the Child Tax Benefit with
other social spending on behalf of children to create a new benefit for children of
all low-income families, regardless of whether the family is on welfare, unemployment
insurance, or earning wage.  This approach can give low-income families a more secure
source of income support for  children and put parents in a stronger position to leave
social assistance for the job market.  We strongly suggest that this approach needs to
be combined with an intensive community development strategy to increase the parents'
capacities for a transition into the job market.
<P>
<H3>Recommendations:</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD><STRONG>9.</STRONG> Establish "reducing disincentives to work for welfare
recipients" and "reducing child poverty" as national goals for social activity reform.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>10.</STRONG> Establish universality, comprehensiveness, public
administration, portability and accessibility as national principles to federal
support for social assistance and services.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>11.</STRONG> Establish guaranteed annual income based on national
standards and have needed additional funding come from the restructuring of Canada's
tax system to raise overall revenue more progressively.
<P>
<DD><STRONG>12.</STRONG> Combine the Child Tax Benefit with other social spending on
behalf of children to create a new benefit for children of all low-income families,
regardless of whether the family is on welfare, unemployment insurance, or earning
wage.
<P>

<TITLE>AOHC Position Paper: OHIP Delisting</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>AOHC Position on Proposed OHIP Delisting of Certain Procedures</H1>
<BR>
<STRONG>January 10, 1994</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>I.	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P>
The Ontario government has identified the "delisting" of certain services (Appendix A)
from OHIP coverage as one of the strategies being considered in exploring ways to
reduce health care costs. The Ontario government is proposing to remove these services
from the schedule of insured benefits. Nineteen (19) such services have been
identified as being "not medically necessary", as determined by the Ontario Medical
Association and the Ministry of Health. 
 <P>
The current proposal to delist certain services appears to be a piece-meal approach to
"cost savings" for the government. Inadequate information and consultation time have
essentially eliminated effective input the public and other stakeholders in the health
sector. As such, the AOHC is not able to fully assess the rationale for this
particular strategy and is therefore limited in our ability to provide a comprehensive
feedback.  Of additional concern to us is the arbitrary definition of what is
"non-essential" and the assumption that delisting is an effective and appropriate cost
containment strategy.
 <P>
The current proposal for delisting opens the door for the erosion of the principles of
the Canada Health Act.  User charges bring about the reverse philosophy,  distributing
some of the benefits on the basis of ability to pay and some of the costs on the basis
of need.(1) The Canadian medical insurance system is based on the philosophy that the
benefits of a health care system should be distributed on the basis of need and the
costs of the system be distributed on the basis of ability to pay. This represents
another erosion of the principles of Medicare.  
<P> 
<H3>Recommendations:</H3>
<P> 	
<OL>
<LI>We recommend that an overall strategy to review and refine Medicare at the
provincial level, based on the principles of the Canada Health Act, be developed. 
Thus, any approach to OHIP delisting must be part of and directly linked to a
comprehensive strategy with in the context of the determinants of health, cost
effectiveness and cost containment.
<P>
<LI>Opportunities for consumer participation must be integral to any review and must
ensure that adequate information and time are part of the process.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that any approach to the delisting of services be put on
hold pending:
<BR>
a) information (such as incidence, related costs, etc) upon which the government
proposal is based be made available to parties affected by the impact of the proposal
so that there can be a truly collaborative consultation process;
<BR>
b) an extended consultation period to allow affected parties an appropriately 
reasonable time to assess implications of delisting.
<BR>
c) evaluation of fee for service billing as a major contributing factor in the
inflation of health care costs.
<P>
<LI>We recommend that, further to the implementation of recommendations 1 - 3,
compelling reasons indicate the need for delisting certain services, that this occur
under qualified conditions so as to ensure that, in a specific situation, an
individual's health is not threatened. 
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>I. INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) has critical concerns regarding the
current review process and procedure of "delisting". It is our opinion that the
"non-collaborative" nature of the process will have strong negative implications for
consumer health.  We also believe that it is not a viable strategy for cost savings in
Ontario's health system.  
<P>
The AOHC represents all community health centres (CHCs) and some health service
organizations (HSOs) in the province.  AOHC strongly advocates for the principles of
the Canada Health Act, 1984 as noted in the AOHC Position Paper on Medicare (Appendix
B).  Generally, we see the "delisting of services" as another form of user fees and,
as such, a threat to Medicare as we know it in Ontario.  We believe that delisting of
services is another way to gradually erode the principles of Medicare and will result 
in the creation of a 2-tiered system.  Among the recommendations in our Medicare paper
are those which have relevance to related issues on "delisting of services".  The
following are recommendations, listed in order of priority, from our Medicare paper: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Recommendation #3
<P>
We recommend that the federal government, in its commitment to the principles of
Medicare, ensure that: a) provincial proposal to de-insure services give careful
attention to their likely impact on economically disadvantaged groups; and b)
consumers have input in the determination of medically necessary services.
<P>
Recommendation #4
<P>
We recommend that the federal government, in its commitment to the principles of
Medicare, denounce user fees and prohibit provincial/territorial governments from
applying user fees to hospital or physician services.
<P>
Recommendation #5
<P> 
The AOHC recommends that the federal government work together with the
provinces/territories to establish a national health reform strategy that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>addresses the determinants of health:<BR>
<LI>ensures the most effective use of health care personnel<BR>
<LI>provides remuneration for services using a system that is not volume or procedure
driven:<BR>
<LI>expands health services to include health promotion, illness prevention and
community development;<BR>
<LI>reallocates resources from institution to community based services to ensure that
health services respond to community needs."
</UL>
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
<HR>
<H2>II. ISSUES</H2>
<P>
AOHC is opposed to the current process of delisting and to the arbitrary designation
of "non-essential" services.  Our position will specifically focus on concerns
regarding:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The negative effect that unqualified delisting of services will have on an already
disadvantaged sector of the community;
<LI>The ineffectiveness of delisting as a means of cost savings;
<LI>The need for  a truly collaborative consultation process and active consumer
involvement in any  process that will result in a reduction of insured services. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>A. Procedures Slated For "Delisting"</H3> 
<P>
<STRONG>"Non-essential" as a Category</STRONG> - Nineteen (19) services have been
labeled "non-essential" without a definition of what constitutes "non-essential". 
Some procedures that may or may not be "medically-indicated"  can have a direct
bearing on the whole person.Some procedures have significant medical benefit.  An
example of this would be surgery to correct snoring. This would correct breathing
problems and provide for a more restful sleep not only for the client but for family
members as well. In addition, as health is not only physical but also psycho-social,
the inclusion of the annual examination as "non-essential" is difficult to understand.
<P>
<STRONG>Annual health exam</STRONG> - We do not have the reasons behind the inclusion
of this item in the slated services for "delisting" and therefore unable to comment on
those reasons.  It may be that some physicians only use the annual examination for
physical and/or lab work. 
<P>
In CHCs, the annual health examination provides a way for the health practitioner to
assess health risks related to the patient/client's lifestyle. It is also used to
exchange information which may reveal psycho/social factors and other determinants of
health that contribute to the patient's health status. Finally, annual health exams
allow for early detection of symptoms related to illness.  Delisting of health
examinations will discourage individuals from becoming better educated and informed
about their health and lifestyle needs.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>B. Cost-containment and Cost-effectiveness</H3>
<P>
The sketchy information available indicates that the intent for delisting services is
to "save" $20 million annually, an "arbitrary figure" according to a Ministry of
Health staff member.  Whether $20 million will actually be  "saved" is questionable.
AOHC is of the view that the current high costs of Ontario's health system (based on
figures from Ministry of Health annual reports) is directly related to physicians'
billing practices. We believe that lack of effective monitoring  is the real problem. 
OHIP suffers from a chronic under-monitoring of physician billings as well as
inadequate audit and evaluation. Efforts should be directed towards the implementation
of effective audits and evaluation.
<P>
Prior to any piece meal approach to cost savings, we strongly; suggest that a thorough
review, with public input,  of the these practices be undertaken.  We are aware that
some form of review is under the purview of the OMA/MOH Joint Management Committee
(JMC).  It is our position that a much broader forum is necessary in the review of
Ontario's health system. The health system is publicly funded and must have public
accountability, not a select few.  
<P>
In addition, cost pressures in Ontario's health care system are also caused by
reductions in federal transfer payments and Canada's sluggish economy.(2) The
implementation of "delisting" resulting in user charges can not be expected to bring
in a substantive revenue to the system but is an approach that will definitely erode
the principles of Medicare as we know it.  Services that maintain and enhance health
should continue to be insured. This would include services that are medically
indicated and proven effective.  We believe that delisting will make it more difficult
to regulate physician billing.  If is likely that once a physician has billed OHIP to
the maximum, he/she can supplement their income by performing delisted services.  
Physicians will be at liberty to charge <STRONG>above the fee schedule</STRONG> for
these services.  Such increases would result in greater reductions in access for an
increasingly larger segment of the population.  Who will get to the operating table
first - the low-income person who needs a hip replacement or the rich banker who can
pay for a delisted, non-essential service? This practice would be in violation of the
Canada Health Act and represents an increased financial burden to the consumer.
Delisting encourages over-billing and will not necessarily produce cost effective
measures.  
<P>
<H3>C. Inappropriate Review Process.</H3>
<P>
There is a glaring lack of available statistical information upon which the proposal
for "delisting" is based.  AOHC spent a considerable amount of time contacting the
Review Committee Chair and Ministry staff in an attempt to get background information. 
Unfortunately, relevant background information was not  available.  From the
information we did get, we understand that the current proposal for "delisting" stems
from the 1991 agreement between the OMA and the Ministry of Health.  We further
understand that "list" originated from the OMA who identified a package of services
for possible delisting.  The package was then referred to the JMC for evaluation and
the list of the 19 services slated for delisting was born. The current  review process
is to ostensibly provide the public and interested others with the opportunity  to be
consulted on the proposal to "delist" services. It is also our understanding that the
Review Panel has the mandate to approve any or all of the recommended 
items, as determined through public "consultation".  The conclusions and findings of
the Review Panel would then be presented to the JMC where a final decision will be
made.
<P>
AOHC's concerns, based on our recent experience with the process are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Lack of relevant background information
<P>
<LI>Lack of consumer representation in the Review Panel
<P>
<LI>Inadequate time for public consultation
<P>
<LI>Lack of knowledgeable Ministry or Review Panel personnel to facilitate information
needs of stakeholders.
 </OL>
 <P>
<STRONG>Lack of relevant  information background information</STRONG> -  The $20
million annual savings was projected without available supporting documentation on the
issue. We, in the AOHC, who have experience in the health system and have some
capacity to seek relevant information experienced great difficulties in getting what
we got. One can only imagine the impossibility of a similar task for the average
health care consumer who has a limited understanding of the health system and OHIP. 
Concise relevant information must be prepared and readily available to those who are
interested to provide input to the review process. 
<P>
<STRONG>Inadequate consumer representation in the review process</STRONG> - The OMA
and the Ministry of Health are the primary decision makers in a process that will have
a definite impact on the health care consumer. From the information available to AOHC,
only the OMA and Ministry  are represented on the JMC.  Apparently 2 out of 6 Review
Panel members are "consumer representatives" but  we are still awaiting written
confirmation of this information.  Even if there are indeed  "consumer
representatives" and they somehow emerge being critical of the process, it is hard to
envision their opinions making any real difference in the final decision.  A broader
based representation of well informed consumers is critical to this review process.
<P>
<STRONG>Inadequate time for public consultation</STRONG> - The time allocated  for
consultation is inadequate. The consultation process was made public in early part of
December 1993. The submission deadlines was slated for January 10, 1994. Even without
the holiday break at this time, the total time is absolutely inadequate and does not
allow for a truly collaborative consultation process. 
<P>
<STRONG>Lack of knowledgeable Ministry or Review Panel personnel to facilitate
information needs of stakeholders</STRONG> - AOHC periodically responds to a variety
of task forces, commissions, review process, etc.  While we have had difficulties in
getting relevant information in the past from government personnel, our experience
with this review process has been appalling.  We have had to devote an inordinate
amount of staff resources to get the meager information that we have.  Review process,
etc. should not be undertaken without knowledgeable staff support.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>D. Effects on Community Health</H3>
<P>
The Association supports the World Health Organization's definition of health as
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Health is the extent to which an individual or group is able, on one
hand, to realize aspirations and satisfy needs; and, on the other hand, to change or
cope with the environment.  Health is therefore seen as a resource for everyday life,
not the objective of living; it is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal
resources as well as physical capacity."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>1. Determinants of Health</H3>
<P>
Determinants of health include: peace, shelter, education, food, a sustainable income,
access to appropriate health service, and social equity. Access to these determinants
of health vary dramatically from one segment of the population to another and such is
true of Ontario. As such certain segments of the Ontario population are more
vulnerable to changes in insured health services.  The following identify the affected
areas:
<P>
<STRONG>a) Access</STRONG> - Delisting creates a two-tiered system where access to
certain procedures will be income-based; with the wealthy retaining access to the
range of health care procedures available. AOHC is committed to the principle of
universality and the reduction of inequities in the health of low-versus high income
groups in Ontario. OHIP delisting of procedures will promote further inequities in
access.  
<P>
<STRONG>b) Social Equity</STRONG> - The Canada Health Act of 1984 was based on equal
treatment of all individuals in our society.  An OHIP delisting of certain procedures
will encourage the imposition of "user fees".   User charges redistribute the cost of
health care away from the "health" or non-user and onto the "sick" or user.  It is a
statistical fact that wealthy people are healthier and poor people are sicker.  The
healthy rich will have more to gain by the introduction of user fees and the poor will
have more to lose.(3) The poor will be penalized by and as a result of their social
and economic status.
<P>
<STRONG>c) Empowerment</STRONG> - Self-sufficiency is an important component of good
health.  Health status is optimized when individuals can identify and respond to their
own needs. Delisting imposes limitation on consumer options for responding to their
individual health needs. Choices, beyond their economic reach will not be pursued. 
This will result in consumers having fewer resources with which to establish and
maintain personal standards of "good health". The review process (Appendix A) does not
make available much needed information required for consumer involvement and
empowerment.  Delisting represents an attempt by the OMA and the provincial government
to "manage the health system," as outlined in an agreement between the two parties.(4)
The Ministry of Health has targeted a savings of $ 20 million without establishing 
the basis for this figure.  An informed consumer is an empowered consumer.  The
current  review process and the inadequate time limits are barriers to community
development and public participation. 
<P>
<HR>
<H2>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>We recommend that an overall strategy to review and refine Medicare at the
provincial level, based on the principles of the Canada Health Act, be developed. 
Thus, any approach to OHIP delisting must be part of and directly linked to a
comprehensive strategy with in the context of the determinants of health, cost
effectiveness and cost containment.
<P>
<LI>Opportunities for consumer participation must be integral to any review and must
ensure that adequate information and time are part of the process.
<P>
<LI>We strongly recommend that any approach to the delisting of services be put on
hold pending:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a)	information (such as incidence, related costs, etc) upon which the government
proposal is based be made available to parties affected by the impact of the proposal
so that there can be a truly collaborative consultation process;
<P>
<LI>b)	an extended consultation period to allow affected parties an appropriately 
reasonable time to assess implications of delisting.
<P>
<LI>c) evaluation of fee for service billing as a major contributing factor in the
inflation of health care costs.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>We recommend that, further to the implementation of recommendations 1 - 3,
compelling reasons indicate the need for delisting certain services, that this occur
under qualified conditions so as to ensure that, in a specific situation, an
individual's health is not threatened. 
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>IV. CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
Delisting opens the door for private insurance and two-tiered health system.  It
encourages physicians to protect and supplement their income by off-loading charges
onto clients and third parties.  For those who cannot afford to pay these charges,
this practice will result in a reduced access to health care and will heighten the
financial burden of illness.  "Delisting" of services, if implemented,  is likely to
progressively increase in coming years to the detriment of the principles of the
Canada Health Act of 1984.

<H1>A Position Paper on Medicare</H1>
<STRONG>September 1993</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>I. PREAMBLE</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) is the provincial organization of
community health centres (CHCs) and some health service organizations (HSOs) in
Ontario.  Over 50 member centres (referred to as CHC's in this paper) support tens of
thousands of Ontarians, directly in primary care, counselling, housing, employment and
other programs, and benefit many others indirectly through health promotion, community
development and advocacy activities.  Although member centres are autonomous and may
represent views to whomever they wish, one of the roles of the AOHC is to represent
the collective interests of its member centres to government and other organizations.
<P>
Underlying the AOHC mandate to promote good health in Ontario is a common set of
beliefs and principles (Appendix A).  We believe that equity in health implies equal
opportunities to achieve and maintain health, including access to programs and
services.  Centres offer a variety of services addressing the needs of their
communities, usually to under-serviced and specific populations who, due to a variety
of barriers (geographic, cultural, linguistic, etc.), require improved access.
<P>
The goal of Medicare was and remains equity in the use and financing of services.  The
AOHC believes that the principles of Medicare must be upheld and health care reform
must happen, with federal and provincial governments working together towards a
coordinated 'health system'.  This position paper describes the erosions that have
already occurred to Medicare, outlines a number of crucially important reforms that
will help preserve Medicare and further improve the performance of our health system,
and makes recommendations pertaining to these reforms to the federal government.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P>
The Canada Health Act,  commonly known as Medicare, underpins the foundation of the
basic health care Canadians value and expect.   Although it is the envy of many
countries, numerous studies, task forces and commissions have recognized the need for
the reform of Canada's health care for many years.   More recently, governments
(federal,  provincial, territorial) have acknowledged the recommendations of these
reports and some have even gone as far as adopting the substance of these same
recommendations as government policy.  Fiscal crisis has prompted governments to react
in ways that threatens not only the reform of the health care system but fundamentally
attacks the very principles of the Canada Health Act of 1984.  
<P>
In keeping with our beliefs and principles, the AOHC urgently submits to the federal
government a series of recommendations which we believe outlines a number of critical
strategies in ensuring that Medicare is not only preserve but would move us unerringly
into a reformed health system.
<P>
<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS:</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>We strongly recommend that the federal government make an explicit commitment to
uphold the principles of Medicare as embodied in the Canada Health Act of 1984
<P>
<LI>We strongly urge the federal government to freeze existing federal transfer
payments at the 1993 levels and to negotiate a federal/provincial arrangement which
ensures a federal financial commitment to Medicare principles and enables the
provinces/territories to uphold Medicare principles.
<P>
<LI>We recommend that the federal government, in its commitment to the principles of
Medicare, ensure that:  a) provincial proposal to de-insure services give careful
attention to their likely impact on economically disadvantaged groups; and b)
consumers have input on the determination of medically necessary services.
<P>
<LI>We recommend that the federal government, in its commitment to the principles of
Medicare,denounce user fees and prohibit provincial/territorial governments from
applying user fees to hospital or physician services.
<P>
<LI>The AOHC recommends that the federal government work together with the
provinces/territories to establish a national health reform strategy that:
<UL>
<LI>addresses the determinants of health;
<LI>ensures the most effective use of health care personnel
<LI>provides remuneration for services using a system that is not volume or procedure
driven;
<LI>expands health services to include health promotion, illness prevention and
community development;
<LI>reallocates resources from institutional to community based services to ensure
that health services respond to community needs.

<H2>III. 	INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
<STRONG>Medicare is in crisis once again.</STRONG>  The current deep and long-lasting
recession, declining government revenues and tremendous cost increases in the
treatment-based system have brought severe fiscal difficulties to all levels of
government.  Cost containment has become the focus of health care policy decisions and
dominates the agendas of all provinces.  The sluggish recovery and the dismal
forecasts of the Canadian economy over the next few years have not alleviated, and may
have increased, a deeply felt anxiety about the future of Medicare.  <STRONG>It is now
clear that, to preserve the much cherished Medicare in Canada, governments must use
the next five year period as an opportunity to change their agendas from cost
containment to cost effectiveness, and to undertake bold health care reform, through
planned, coordinated and rational change.</STRONG> 
<P>
<HR>
<H2>IV. THE VALUE OF MEDICARE FOR THE FUTURE</H2>
<P>
The importance and desirability of Medicare is defined through its principles, which
are embodied in the Canada Health Act of 1984.  The principles of
<STRONG>universality, portability, reasonable accessibility, comprehensiveness and
public administration</STRONG> have been defended and reaffirmed by numerous
provincial and federal commissions of enquiry.  The AOHC believes that these
principles must continue to be the foundation of the health system as we move through
reform.
<P>
Medicare is immensely popular with Canadians.  It confers on Canada a sense of
national identity, unity and a social cohesiveness, all of which are increasingly
important in these turbulent and uncertain times.  Medicare has succeeded in bringing
about a greater degree of equality in health care benefits between the different
socio-economic groups, between provinces and regions.  It has been very successful in
preventing illness from bankrupting people and families, a phenomenon that is common
in the United States.  Access to services is determined by need and no longer ability
to pay.
<P>
Medicare has also meant that the administrative costs of our health insurance plans
are low compared with mixed or predominantly private insurance systems.  Since
Medicare means that government become the sole source of funding of insured health
care services, it has permitted provincial governments to control capital expenditure
and to prevent unnecessary and excessive duplication of technology-intensive programs,
equipment and facilities.  Unfortunately, provincial bureaucracies have not taken on
their full responsibility, as sole funder, to manage the health system effectively.
<P>
Medicare has the potential to  facilitate universally high health services and
standardization of information systems.  The latter is becoming increasingly important
in our effort to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health care
delivery system.  The AOHC  has no doubt that Medicare can be made more cost-effective
and we are equally certain that the cost of health care would have been even higher
without Medicare.
<P>
According to the World Economic Forum (1991), Medicare has also been good for business
in Canada, thanks to its relative success in keeping health care insurance costs. 
These costs are high for businesses in the United States, and the popular media has
been replete with stories about how high health care costs have compromised the
international competitiveness of American businesses.
<P>
All these existing and potential advantages of Medicare suggest to us that the
often-asked question:  "Can we afford Medicare?" is simply uninformed and not factual. 
Indeed, Canadians cannot afford to be without Medicare.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>V. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND MEDICARE TODAY</H2>
<P>
Over the past decade, in response to a continually high fiscal deficit, the federal
government unilaterally announced limits to its transfers to the provinces for
Medicare (and post-secondary education) in 1985, 1990 and 1991.  The result of these
successive reductions in the federal transfer to the provinces is a <STRONG>cumulative
loss</STRONG> in anticipated revenue to the provinces over the period 1986/87 to
1995/96 of about $30 billion for health services.  In effect, the federal government
off-loaded its own fiscal deficits to the provinces.
<P>
One obvious consequence of the changes in federal transfers for health is added
pressure on the provinces to contain health care costs.  The burden is especially
great on provinces with smaller tax bases, higher fiscal deficits and/or greater
health care needs.  Since one of the fundamental purposes of a federal role in the
financing of health care services was to bring about greater equity in health, it is
ironic that the reduction in federal financing is leading to increased regional and
inter-provincial disparities in the level and standards of health care services.
<P>
The federal government has also placed a limit of a 5 percent annual growth rate on
its transfer for social welfare program under the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP). 
According to CAP, the federal government was to pay 50 percent of the provincial
costs.  The imposed limit affects some of the non-Medicare health benefits that low
income Canadians receive under the CAP and it puts further financial pressure on some
provinces to contain social expenditure.  The effect of limiting the Canada Assistance
Plan is to widen the disparities between low income and better-off Canadians,
including health inequities between the two groups.
<P>
<STRONG>The federal government is responsible for ensuring provinces/territories
adhere to  principles of Medicare, as embodied in the Canada Health Act of
1984.</STRONG>  Over the next decade, the federal support to the provinces will be
eliminated, compromising the federal government's authority and its ability to enforce
the national standards and principles that are the key to making Medicare a truly
national program. Inter-provincial differences in Medicare are growing and the
principles of portability, comprehensiveness and reasonable access are threatened. 
The AOHC believes that an active federal role in the financing of Medicare is vital to
preserving Medicare.  Indeed, the historical evolution of our health care system
suggests that we would not have had Medicare without federal commitment to the
principles and policies that define Medicare.
<P>
<HR>
<DL>
<STRONG><DT>Recommendation # 1
<P>
<DD>We strongly recommend that the federal government make an explicit commitment to
uphold the principles of Medicare as embodied in the Canada Health Act of 1984.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation # 2
<P>
<DD>We strongly urge the federal government to freeze existing federal transfer
payments at the 1993 levels and to negotiate a federal/provincial arrangement which
ensures a federal financial commitment to Medicare principles and enables the
provinces/territories to uphold Medicare principles.</STRONG>
</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>VI.  COST CONTAINMENT  IS NOT EQUAL TO HEALTH REFORM</H2>
<P>
Throughout much of the 1980's, the growth in health care spending far outstripped
changes to inflation and increases in most government programs.  By 1990, a consensus
was already emerging that this trend was not sustainable over the long term and that
substantial reforms were required to redirect health resources and  use them more
efficiently.  In bringing about reform, it is critical that increased cost
effectiveness (demonstrable linkage between expenditures and improved health outcomes)
drive the process rather than simply cost containment.
<P>
Cost containment, in some instances, has led to reform of inefficient and ineffective
treatment systems and has reallocated resources more appropriately.   In most
provinces mergers between hospitals have occurred or are being actively considered as
a way to reduce administrative costs and improve operational efficiency.  Day surgery
and outpatient care is being substituted for inpatient stays.   Many provinces have
announced limits to and reductions in out-of-country benefits.  In some provinces some
hospitals will be entirely closed down.   Hospital budgets have been limited to meager
increases or even reduced, resulting in bed closures, staff lay-offs, program
cancellations, and a freeze on construction, renovation and capital expenditure. 
<P>
Other cost-containing measures, however, have merely cut governments' obligation to
pay for services and do not constitute health system reform.  The AOHC questions
whether much thought was given to the impact of de-insurance of some services on low
income Canadians, the elderly and other disadvantaged populations.  Cost containment
actions across some provinces included the de-insuring of basic vision assessment,
de-insuring of fluoride treatment of children up to age 4, the introduction of a
charge for insulin, an increase in the age of eligibility for coverage under
Dentacare, de-insured optometrist services for all persons between 18 and 40, reduced
chiropractic, podiatry and osteopathic fee levels and reduced assistive device
benefits. 
<P>
In some provinces, some drugs are now subject to price regulations and others are no
longer covered by the plans. Deductibles and co-insurance have been introduced or
raised. Some provinces have undertaken other expenditure-containing actions affecting
a variety of services including laboratory services, dental services, psychotherapy,
nursing homes, chronic care, long-term care, home care and health benefits covered
under the Canada Assistance Plan.  This list could be endless.  The AOHC wonders
whether all of the de-insurance does not violate the principle of comprehensive
services under Medicare.  To what degree is the portability of benefits assured when
the differences between provincial insurance plans continue to increase?
<P>
<HR>
<DL>
<STRONG><DT>Recommendation #  3
<P>
<DD>We recommend that the federal government, in its commitment to the principles of
Medicare, ensure that:  a) provincial proposal to de-insure services give careful
attention to their likely impact on economically disadvantaged groups; and b)
consumers have input on the determination of medically necessary services.</STRONG>
</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>VII. 	USER FEES</H2>
<P>
The AOHC is distressed by the openness to the reintroduction of user fees for hospital
and medical services on the part of some federal and provincial political leaders. 
The arguments against user fees are well known.  They are a tax on the sick and
seriously reduce the equity of our tax and expenditure system.  They reduce
accessibility to care by low income Canadians, the disadvantaged and the elderly. 
They do not have positive, and may have negative effects on efficiency.  User fees
often deter people who are most disadvantaged from accessing needed care resulting in
more serious illness and disability at a later stage and higher costs to the system. 
It is important to note that none of the many Royal Commissions or similar inquiries
in Canada recommended the reintroduction of user fees.   According to a report
released by the Premier's Council on Health, Well Being and Social Justice of Ontario,
only 1% of health care budgets are consumed by patients abusing Medicare.
<P>
The new charges on health care services compromise the principle of accessibility
under Medicare.  We especially wonder why such issues have not been addressed in any
public and meaningful way, why the federal government has not assumed its
responsibilities for enforcing the principles of Medicare as embodied in the Canada
Health Care Act of 1984.
<P>
<HR>
<DL>
<STRONG><DT>Recommendation # 4
<P>
<DD>We recommend that the federal government, in its commitment to the principles of
Medicare, denounce user fees and prohibit provincial/territorial governments from
applying user fees to hospital or physician services.</STRONG>
</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>VIII. MOVING FORWARD WITH HEALTH REFORM</H2>
<P>
Medicare and its principles have formed the basis for heath care over the past thirty
years.  Provinces have not upheld their responsibility for managing the health system
and have been reluctant to act in the face of powerful and entrenched interests such
as the medical profession, hospitals and drug companies.  As well federal and
provincial governments have not developed a national strategy to keep pace with the
current understanding that the health system is more than just access to health care. 
Reform is necessary to develop a health system that promotes health and is responsive
to the needs of Canadians.  We highlight several areas of reforms which are directed
toward making this shift and making our heath system cost effective and affordable.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The health system must become <STRONG>consumer-oriented</STRONG>.  The active
participation of consumers in identifying needs and priorities for health services is
essential for ensuring accountability to the community.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Regional coordination and effective planning</STRONG> is required to
achieve greater efficiency in the way funds are allocated for services.
<P>
<LI>The health system <STRONG>must shift its focus from illness treatment to health
promotion and wellness</STRONG>.  The delivery of health services must focus on
supporting individuals and communities to take greater responsibility for their own
health.  This requires an approach to health service delivery that incorporates health
education, health promotion, illness prevention and community development along with
primary health care.  This provision of a wider set of services beyond those insured
under Medicare is essential in addressing the <STRONG>determinants of health</STRONG>.
<P>
<LI>Governments <STRONG>must re-allocate resources from the institutional to
community-based health services</STRONG>.  This will facilitate the integration of
health services with other essential social and community services in a comprehensive
approach to meeting community needs.
<P>
<LI>The <STRONG>efficient use of health personnel</STRONG> is required to ensure that
health services/programs are developed and provided in a cost effective manner.  The
health system is highly labour intensive.  About three-quaters of health expenditure
is made up of wages, salaries and fees.  Human resource substitution through the
appropriate use of health personnel such as nurse practitioners, nurses, nursing
assistants, paramedics, social workers, heath educators and community developers can
improve efficiency and reduce costs.  At the present time, work that can be done by
nurse practitioners and midwives are often carried out by physicians at a
substantially higher cost. Further reduction <STRONG>in the number of
physicians</STRONG> through reduced school enrollments and residency training as well
as an appropriate geographic distribution of physicians will reinforce the efficient
use of health personnel.
<P>
<LI>A <STRONG>system for payment that is not volume or procedure driven</STRONG> is
required for all health personnel including physicians.  The fee-for-service method of
paying physicians contributes to unnecessary hospitalization, referrals, revisits and
the ineffective use of human resources.  We strongly support the salary form of
payment for health personnel as a means of reasonable expenditure control.
<P>
<LI>Governments must take a stronger role in the <STRONG>management of
bio-technology</STRONG>.  Technology assessment or outcome studies could reduce
inappropriate commitment of resources to services.
<P>
<LI>To <STRONG>encourage efficiency in hospitals</STRONG>, incentives and budgetary
policies must be implemented.  Peer reviews, utilization reviews, quality improvement
programs, hospital admission protocols, second opinion for surgery, discharge planning
are all mechanisms which could reduce inappropriate use of hospital resources.
</OL>
<P>
Each of these reforms has been advocated by health care analyst as essential reforms
for a long time in Canada and abroad.  To date, governments have substantially
abdicated their leadership role.  The inaction to implement reforms is particularly
inexplicable in light of current threats to Medicare.  The AOHC believes that
governments in Canada are not only responsible for paying for health care but also for
managing the system ins cost-effective way that is <STRONG>responsive to community
needs</STRONG>.
<P>
<HR>
<DL>
<STRONG><DT>Recommendation # 5
<P>
<DD>The AOHC recommends that the federal government work together with the
provinces/territories to establish a national health reform strategy that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>addresses the determinants of health;
<LI>ensures the most effective use of health care personnel
<LI>provides remuneration for services using a system that is not volume or procedure
driven;
<LI>expands health services to include health promotion, illness prevention and
community development;
<LI>reallocates resources from institutional to community based services to ensure
that health services respond to community needs.</STRONG>
</UL>
</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>IX. COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES - KEY TO HEALTH REFORM</H2>
<P>
Proposed components of health reform require a significant redirection of health
resources toward the community.  The AOHC believes community-based services are
integral to health reform.  They are an excellent avenue to promote provincial health
goals to shift emphasis from an illness treatment to health promotion and illness
prevention.
<P>
<H3>Community Health Centres - Partners for Change</H3>
<P>
Community health centres (CHCs) demonstrate a model of community health service which
embodies many of the components of a reformed health system.  They are responsive to
communities, provide accessible, affordable and appropriate services, and enjoy a high
level of consumer satisfaction. Community health centres have a long history in
Canada. We believe that CHCs are important partners in facilitating the move towards
health system reform through their focus on:
<P>
<UL>
<STRONG><LI>active participation of consumers in identifying community needs, setting
priorities for service, and program planning and participation;
<P>
<LI>health education and health promotion to foster increased personal responsibility
for health;
<P>
<LI>working with communities to address the issues that impact on health such as
unemployment, isolation, lack of housing, poverty, and illiteracy;
<P>
<LI>the development of innovative approaches to make health services more accessible
to those who do not or cannot gain access to appropriate services due to linguistic
and cultural barriers, poverty, isolation, age, physical disabilities or other
obstacles to needed services;
<P>
<LI>working effectively in inter-disciplinary teams integrating health promotion,
community development and advocacy with primary health care;
<P>
<LI>working collaboratively with other community-based agencies and services to
address individual and community needs such as employment training, social support and
self-help groups; and
<P>
<LI>continuity of care that promotes strong referral and support networks with other
community based agencies and services.</STRONG>
</UL>
<P>
Despite the CHCs' focus on many provincial health goals, including services which
address the determinants of health, they are still marginalized and underfunded within
a largely institutional health care system.  We believe that increasing the number of
CHCs will be an important step in moving towards health reform.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>X. CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
The <STRONG>federal government of Canada must enforce the Canada Health Act</STRONG>
if Medicare is to continue as a viable program.  As a minimum, the principles of
Medicare as outlined in the Act must be preserved.   Health reform can not occur
without the preservation of these principles and the current fiscal crisis is an
excellent opportunity for governments in Canada to push through these reforms.

<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>AOHC Response on the Proposal for a North American Free Trade Agreement</H1>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>I. INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC) welcomes the opportunity to provide a
brief to the Ontario Cabinet Committee on the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).  It is AOHC's understanding that, at the present time, "side discussions"
between Canada, the United States and Mexico are not completed therefore a document
which contains all the provision for such an agreement is not available.  In view of
this, AOHC prepared this brief without the benefit of a detailed review and analysis
of an actual proposal for NAFTA.  We are, therefore, not in a position to advocate for
or against such an agreement.  Nevertheless, we feel the utmost importance of putting
forth the priorities that must guide Canada's participation in the NAFTA discussions.
<P>
AOHC believes that any North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will have an impact
on the health of individuals, families and communities within Ontario and Canada as a
whole.  In line with our beliefs and principles <A HREF="beliefs.html">(Appendix
A)</A>, the AOHC is convinced of the correlation between economic practice and a
people's health status.  AOHC further subscribes to the concept of the relationship
between the state of a nation's economy and the state of a nation's health.  We
believe that the following principles and values must pervade any free trade agreement
that Canada agrees to be party to.
<P>
<H2>II. PRINCIPLES AND VALUES </H2>
<P>
<H3>A. Protection of the Canada Health Act</H3>
<P>
The five (5) essential principles of the Canada Health Act: <STRONG>universality,
equal access, comprehensiveness, portability and non profit administration</STRONG>
need protection.   These principles should be a model for all trade partners.  We are
particularly concerned that NAFTA will compound the negative effects already 
resulting from the current trend in federal legislation.  Federal legislation now
calls for the phasing out of financial support to the provinces for health care.  As
the responsibility for funding health care falls to the provinces (with the absence of
a federal social charter), Canada's government also relinquishes its right to set
national standards.  
<P>
This opens the door for NAFTA to become the bridge for  'for-profit' corporations
becoming a predominant mode for the delivery of health care services such as that
currently practiced the United States.   Recent federal legislation, Bills C-22 and
C-91, are now moving us in a direction which will result in Canadians spending
millions of dollars more on prescription drugs, adding significantly to our health
care costs.  We strongly believe in the concept that health as a resource for living
is a right which can not be treated as a "commercial enterprise".
<P>
<H3>B. Equitable income for workers</H3>
<P>
Today, the world has evolved to be a "global village" and, as such, any agreement on
free trade in North America requires guidelines that will ensure fair and equitable
distribution of income.  Many studies have established that poor people are "sicker"
people.  We only have to see and listen to the images we see and read about everyday
to know this to be true.  We are concerned not only with the workers in Canada but
also those in the U.S.A. and Mexico.  The acknowledgement that workers in the three
countries need a fair and equitable income must be incorporated in NAFTA provisions.
<P>
<H3>Empowerment of workers</H3>
<P>
AOHC believes that NAFTA must have provisions for worker participation in determining:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Occupational health and safety standards
<P>
<LI>Methods of fair compensation for time and energy
<P>
<LI>Working conditions which respects needs for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>day care, maternity/paternity/other leaves with job protection
<LI>benefits (health, disability, pension, vacation with pay, etc.)
<LI>unemployment insurance
<LI>training and staff development programmes
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Methods for workers to effect collective agreement
</OL>
<P>
<H3>D. Consistent utilization of standards</H3>
<P>
NAFTA must have provisions which would render those products, technology and other
resources declared or deemed to be illegal in one nation, such  as Canada, as illegal
and unacceptable for use in other two countries (U.S., Mexico).  Infractions of these
provisions must result in severe penalties.  For example, Ontario, which has strict
guidelines on disposal of used tires and paint sludges, can export these wastes to the
U.S. for disposal purposes.
<P>
<H3>E. Concern for the environment</H3>
<P>
Support for ecologically sound programmes must be inherent in NAFTA.  Only
environmentally friendly methods of waste management should be used in order to
protect people of the three countries from short and long term health hazards and
risks.  A 1987 environmental ruling in Mexico stipulated that foreign owned companies
are required to re-export and ship out all waste products.  This is not happening and
needs to be enforced.  For example, along the Mexican/U.S. border, mothers who are not
able to breast feed their children due to lack of safe water resort to feeding their
babies Coca Cola.(1)  Exporting waste to other countries outside the agreement must be
prohibited.  Each of the three participating countries must create the necessary
technology/processes to dispose of their waste prior to creating it.  AOHC wants
"teeth" in  NAFTA to provide for applicability of these requirements to all three
countries. An effective enforcement process must be in place.  Zero land, water and
air contamination needs to be a goal.
<P>
<H3>F. Agricultural/Food Policy</H3>
<P>
An integral component to NAFTA must be the protection of agriculture and food.  The
present North American mind set seek accessibility to "low cost" food.  This reflects
directly on the economic viability of the rural farm family.  The extreme social
stress presently experienced by farm families, coupled with violence and farm closures
in rural parts of Canada and the U.S. suggests that what is presently in place
economically for farms is not working.  Some facts about farming in Mexico are just as
alarming:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The average land holding by farmers is ten (10) hectares (20 acres), however 60%
of all farmers have less than four (4) hectares.
<P>
<LI>75% of the farms can only farm seasonally due to the lack of water most of the
year.
<P>
<LI>Between 1985 and 1990, 65% of Mexican farms had no source of credit to finance
their operations. those who do receive credit today pay interest rates often exceeding
35%
<P>
<LI>85% of Mexican families are corn producers with an average yield of 1.7 metric
tonnes per hectare, as opposed to 12 in the U.S.A. and Canada.
<P>
<LI>56% of Mexican farms have access to machinery and of this group only half own any
machinery themselves.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>G. Balancing Community  Interests With Individual Rights, A Vision for NAFTA</H3>
<P>
NAFTA provisions must include the principle of advocacy for community rather than
limit its focus to individual rights, as the basis for sound ethical decisions.  This
principle should serve as the context for creating freedom and responsibility within
the participating nations.  Experience with the U.S. and Canadian models, to date,
have shown a strong orientation toward an individualistic concept of human  rights. 
This tends to become interpreted as the  right of the individual over society, a "
strong versus the weak" approach which has a negative impact on peoples' health at
various levels. AOHC advocates for the inclusion of a social charter in NAFTA which 
provides for an appropriate balance between the rights of the individual with that of 
the community.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>III. CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
In summary, AOHC firmly believes that any free trade agreement must be based on the
protection and concern for people's health in broadest possible sense.  We strongly
caution that, while NAFTA has the potential to be a positive determinant in improving
people's health in all three countries, it cuts both ways and can drastically bring
living conditions down to the lowest common denominator.  Therefore a free trade
agreement which focuses only on the 'economy' without regard for its effects on the
determinants of the health will inevitably fail in its objective of improving the
lives of the people affected. Finally, AOHC believes that agreements among nations
must embody principles and values in the context of equality among all  nations rather
than the predominance of any one country at the exclusion of others.

<TITLE>AOHC Position Paper: Fair Taxes</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>Position Paper on Fair Taxes</H1>
<STRONG>June 1993</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
Fair taxes and good health are different sides of the same coin!  Each needs the other
to be effective.  Their common objective is to maintain a quality of life which
Ontarians value.  Within the context of our Beliefs & Principles <A
HREF="beliefs.html">(Appendix A)</A>, the Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC)
believes tax reform is essential in the movement toward "fair tax" for all Ontarians. 
<P>  
The AOHC currently represents 48 community health centres (CHC's) across Ontario,
which work with their communities to provide a diverse range of health and social
services.  Governed by community-based boards, CHC's support tens of thousands of
people directly in primary care, counselling, housing, employment and other programs,
and benefit many others through health promotion, community development and advocacy
activities.  CHC's operate under the principle that health is influenced by such
determinants as employment, income, adequate housing, social and physical
environments, as well as access to appropriate and effective health care, and that
people are healthier when they have a sense of belonging and purpose.  
<P>
Community health centres believe that reform of the tax system should be based on a
recognition that people are well and healthy when they are valued, nurtured, and
encouraged within the life of their community.  When people are recognized and
affirmed for their abilities to live interdependently, in a giving and receiving
model, the community, as a whole, is more resourceful.  When interdependence is
valued, then people, according to their abilities, are expected and challenged to
contribute to the health and well-being of all.  
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres believes that tax fairness is measured
ultimately by our social standards, which are not only morally important, but lay the
foundation for the material well-being of the society.  If we seek a society that
respects the interdependence of people and the well-being of communities, the same
principles must be embodied in the way our taxes are collected. 
 <P>
We also know that a fair tax system must involve the judicious spending of taxes as
well as their equitable collection.  Therefore, a fair tax system must also seek
adequate revenues to fund the social services and infrastructure that maintain our
social standards.    
<P>
This paper promotes a fair tax system, based on social values and social investment,
not merely on the economic or administrative requirements of the province and country.
To this end, the AOHC supports the following principles and types of tax reform as a
method to increase the well-being of Ontario's people.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>PRINCIPLES and SUGGESTED REFORMS</H2>
<H3>A. Investing in Determinants of Health:</H3>
<P>
Social standards include the determinants of good health: adequate housing, income
opportunities, appropriate education, as well as the cultural standards we take for
granted: social equity, mutual respect, collective responsibility, and ethnic
diversity.  Our taxes are not solely responsible for these standards, but they
certainly pay for many of the services and infrastructures that maintain them. A tax
system that reflects the importance of our social standards views social services
(such as Medicare and social assistance) as forms of social investment.  A reformed
tax system will recognize and ensure that tax dollars will be collected to provide
those structures and services which are essential for the health and well-being of all
members of the community. 
<P>
<H4>Suggested Reforms</H4>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>reward, through tax benefits, companies that create employment opportunities 
<LI>provide greater tax benefits to businesses that directly support community and
cultural activities
<LI>increase housing tax credits in personal income tax to assist those on low and
fixed incomes living in private rental housing
<LI>reduce property taxes on multi-residential housing
</OL>
<H3>B. Paying a Fair Share:</H3>
<P>
The current tax system allows many high income earners, wealthy people and profitable
companies to avoid paying income tax.  Families and individuals living on low or
limited income should not be required to bear a disproportionate tax burden.  A
reformed tax system will require those "able-to-pay" to contribute their fair share
towards society's maintenance and well-being. 
<P>
<H4>Suggested Reforms</H4>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>adjust the present tax system of personal tax deductions so that higher income
people are no longer favoured  
<LI>continue to reduce 'discretionary' deductions, such as entertainment tax
deductions
<LI>place higher taxes on luxury goods or holiday travel  
<LI>reduce consumption taxes (GST & PST) or increase the related tax credits in
personal income tax to reduce the burden on low income families who spend a larger
percentage of their income on these taxes 
<LI>support inheritance and wealth tax 
</OL>
<P>
<H3>C. Empowering People</H3>
<P> 
People are best able to look after themselves when they have their own economic means
and have access to an adequate social support net when difficulties arise.  When
people are recognized and affirmed for their ability to live interdependently within
their community, they can meet their individual needs as well as contribute to the
well-being of their society.  On this basis the tax system should foster economic
opportunities for those who are able to work and provide universal security for
individuals when they are unable to be financially independent. 
<P>
<H4>Suggested Reforms:</H4>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>lift the income ceiling for tax exemptions to ensure an appropriate level of base
income for all individuals to purchase essentials of living
<LI>within personal income tax, enhance credits for those who participate in skill-
producing opportunities through education and job training systems
<LI>recognize the importance of raising children in a supportive environment through
child related tax deductions and enhanced child tax credits
<LI>make child support receipts non-taxable
</OL>
<P>
<H3>D. Reward Contributors to Community</H3>
<P>
Taxes can reward individual and corporate behavior that contributes to the well-being
of the community and society.  When people are supported for their efforts, the
community as a whole benefits, resulting in greater mutual respect and
interdependence.  As well, companies which increase the burden on society (i.e.
environmental 'costs') should be taxed in proportion to the cost to society.  
<P>
<H4>Suggested Reforms</H4>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>reward, through tax benefits, companies that create meaningful jobs and contribute
to 'public good'
<LI>create incentives for the smaller, community-minded entrepreneur
<LI>increase the rewards to those who invest in Canadian small business
<LI>give tax benefits to low income people who advance their education 
<LI>create a environmental tax for those corporations whose waste products are not
ecologically safe
<LI>reward companies which support and encourage community activities
</OL>
<P>
<H3>E. Opening Up the Tax System</H3>
<P>
The current array of taxes and the complexity of their collection is untenable, with
even legal experts unable to keep up with regulations, qualifications and permeations
of the tax system. The complexity of the tax system discourages full payment of taxes,
public interest in the system and public accountability.  A simple and more open
system would encourage tax payers to take more interest in the payment of their taxes
and therefore possibly play a more constructive role in determining how tax revenues
should be spent. 
<P>
<H4>Suggested Reforms</H4>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>reduce the complexity of the system to ensure that regulations are clearer and
qualifications reduced to a minimum 
<LI>create more public awareness as to how members of the Ontario community are
accessing and utilizing their tax monies
<LI>provide a simple and easy interpretation of the tax system for all to comprehend
<LI>ensure consultation on tax issues as an aspect of ongoing reform
<LI>develop a report which describes the proportion of tax contributed by different
income groups
</OL>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>TIME FOR CHANGE</H2>
<P>
The ultimate objective of our social programs and tax system are the same - to
maintain our social standards.  A fair tax system must be founded on the principle of
social investment, the key to supporting Ontarians in maintaining their health and
well-being.  The Association of Ontario Health Centres believes in reforming the tax
system to one which is progressive and fair vs. regressive and inequitable.  
<P>
In conclusion we want to commend and support the work of Fair Tax Commission. We
appreciate how difficult the task is to reform the tax system and what is involved in
a serious public consultation as part of that reform.  However, if talk is not backed
up by action, the entire process will lose credibility and value. The results of the
FTC's efforts must emphasize the urgency of dealing with tax inequalities and tax
demands in a way that prioritizes Ontarian's health and standard of living.

<H2>I. PRELUDE</H2>
<P>
Three Seniors are sitting in their lounge on the ground floor of the Seniors' building
where they live. The topic of conversation today is about more cuts the government is
making in seniors' lives. Last week it was cuts in Home Care services and an increase
in the fees paid to pharmacists for filling their prescriptions and this week its
worse, it is their medication itself. To them it seems that just when they need the
most help it is being taken away. On limited incomes their concerns over cut backs and
higher fees are great.
<P>
One of them had been taking Tylenol for her arthritis and the Pharmacist told her it
was no longer covered by the government drug plan and she could buy it herself over
the counter. She was so upset that she left without waiting to hear any more. Another
one said that she was very worried because she was using a pill for her high blood
pressure and it was so expensive that there was no way she could possibly afford to
pay for it herself and maybe she would have to cut down on her food. The third senior
spoke only Italian and understood a little of what was being said, but she was already
terrified that she would be cut off her medication - putting her already poor health
in peril. she had been to the drug store and been told by someone there that many
pills were no longer paid for. In fact there was a long list on the wall that told you
which ones. She wasn't able to read the list and was too embarrassed to ask. She could
only sit and nod her head with worry.
<P>
As this discussion was taking place in the lounge, one of the Nurses from the
Community Health Centre, acting as a Seniors Community Outreach Worker, arrived at the
building to speak to them one-on-one and also to organize group information sessions
to talk about the changes. She knew most of the seniors already and would be able,
with her fellow workers, to speak with them in the language of their origin, and with
great sensitivity to their fears. A date was set for a community seniors' information
session to be held in conjunction with an already existing health support clinic held
regularly in the seniors' residence.
<P>	       
<BR>
<H2>II. OVERALL POSITION</H2>
<P>
The Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC), welcomes the opportunity to comment
on the proposed changes to the Ontario Drug Benefits Program (ODB).  Changes to the
ODB will definitely have an impact on many of the clients who use the network of the
49 community health centres represented by AOHC in the province.  This is an issue of
grave concern for us. 
<P>
We fully support the seven ODB reform principles and plans as stipulated in the
consultation paper "Drug Programs:Framework for Reform" released by the Ministry of
Health on June 29, 1993. We especially support the goal of extending ODB coverage to
the economically disadvantaged and people who require "catastrophic" drugs but are not
covered by any drug plan. 
<P>
While many the ODB reform initiatives that the Ministry has taken in the past and
pledged to act upon this year are laudable, we maintain that the reform has mainly
been a series of cost containment actions.  These have been targeted at consumers who
are generally aged and/or in the economically disadvantaged segments of society. 
Delisting of drugs as benefits, which was deployed as a quick and easy fix, should not
have been used as the first resort when greater savings could be achieved through many
other ways.  It is of paramount importance that the ODB reform process examine all
cost containment options and implement strategies that will make ODB program more
equitable as well as cost-effective. 
<P>
Within the framework outlined in the Consultation Paper, our comments will 
specifically focus concerns regarding equity, quality of care and cost containment.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>III. CONCERNS ON EQUITY</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. Greater consideration must be given to the aspect of equity of delisting drugs
from ODB.</H3>
<P>
Since the ODB reform, the government removed 665 (out of 2,700) drugs from the ODB
list.  Although the drugs removed are not for treating life-threatening conditions,
some of them are essential in reducing suffering and maintaining a reasonable quality
of life. Antihistamines and antacids are good examples.  Unlike vitamins and calcium
supplements, their effective alternatives are either unknown or at a fee (acupuncture
and other non-mainstream therapies).  There seems to be a prevailing assumption that
people on social assistance are the major drain on ODB resource.  Media coverage of
this issue to date has encouraged this perception. The fact is that ODB only spends a
relatively small percentage of its annual budget on people on social assistance, 17%
in 1990/91, 18% in 1991/92 and 20% in 1992/93 (even with our unemployment rate at a
record high).  We urge the government to reinstate some of the essential drugs or look
for ways to subsidize those in dire need.  
<P>
<H3>B. Eligibility for ODB and the requirement of cost sharing within ODB should be
based on financial need, not on age.</H3>
<P>
Inequitable coverage is the most serious flaw of the current ODB, ie. some people who
can afford to buy their own drugs or insurance receive full coverage under the
program, while others who are vulnerable to high drug costs are uninsured.  If ODB
coverage is to be extended to another 2 million people currently uninsured, a system
of cost sharing has to be developed.  The requirement of cost sharing through
co-payment or deductible or both should be adjusted on the basis of income and family
size. In addition, ODB should continue to cover people in long-term care facilities or
on Home Care.
<P>
<H3>C. Drug counselling, education and information material should meet the needs of
different language and cultural groups.</H3>
<P>
Community Health Centres (CHCs) everywhere in Ontario have been strong advocates on
the issue of equitable access to health and social services for priority populations
which includes minority groups.  CHCs have developed close links with their respective
communities and have gained a remarkable body of expertise in working with many
cultures.  CHCs can play a key role in the planning and delivery of drug counselling,
education and information dissemination services to the minority groups in their
various communities.  A special budget from ODB can help fund this cost-effective and
'equity oriented' initiative.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>IV. QUALITY OF CARE AND COST CONTAINMENT</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. High drug costs are the major contributor to the crisis ODB now faces and the
public is entitled to accurate information on the Canadian pharmaceutical industry.
</H3>
<P>
The Consultation Paper states that "Three-quarter of the total expenditure for drug
programs is for drug products.  In recent years a significant shift has been noticed
toward new, more expensive drugs when the older, less expensive treatment is still
valid."  It is a well established but not widely known fact that the cost of drugs has
been increasing at an alarming rate -- an average of 13.2% over the past decade.  We
acknowledge that Bill C-22 is a major factor in this regard and that the provincial
government has limited jurisdiction over the matter.  However, we believe the public
should be given the facts about the often claimed job creation by the pharmaceutical
industry.  
<P>
According to information presented at the Parliamentary hearings, Canadian taxpayers
are paying hundreds of millions of dollars more on drugs because of Bill C-22 and get
very little in return in terms of new jobs.  Investments in research and development
by the industry in Canada gets very favourable treatment under our tax system with 70
cents to the dollar in Quebec and 55 cents in Ontario.  We support the Ministry of
Health's effort to limit drug cost increases, ie. the limit placed on the price
increase for existing drugs (2% for the past year) and the freeze on drug prices for
all drugs to be implemented in 1994.  We also urge the Ministry to maintain this
practice until a longer term solution has been developed.
<P>
<H3>B. Cost-effectiveness should be an important criteria for drugs being listed as an
ODB benefit and selection of generic products over more expensive brand name drugs at
dispensing must be made mandatory within ODB.</H3>
<P>
We are pleased to see more expensive brand name drugs on the ODB list being replaced
by less expensive generic products.  To ensure that the consumer gets the most
appropriate drugs at best possible cost, it is necessary to remove all the incentives
for the pharmacist to choose more expensive alternatives, eg. markups on the cost of
drugs currently allowed outside of ODB.  However consumers may be given the choice for
brand name products provided they pay the difference in the price.  
<P>
<H3>C. Tremendous human and financial costs can be avoided if our doctors become  more
knowledgeable and responsible gatekeepers for ODB!</H3>
<P>
According to the Goldberg Report (1986), Canada is one of the countries in the world
with the highest medical prescription rate.  To quote the Consultation Paper "The
average physician in Canada writes 4,000-5,000 prescription per year; family
physicians write 6,000-8,000.  Studies report rates of inappropriate prescription in
Ontario of 25-40 per cent.  Each year, 17,000 people are treated for prescription drug
problems in Ontario, and it is estimated that up to 20 per cent of all
hospitalizations for seniors are related to medication misuse."  This situation can
not be tolerated and must be corrected with speed.  We suggest that this issue be
rated high on the reform agenda.  We believe that good results can be achieved with
the establishment of an effective Drug Utilization Review program.  Physicians should
be provided with drug information backed by scientific evidence prepared by sources
independent of drug companies.  Prescribing guidelines that are easy for doctors to
use should be available.  Pharmacotherapy training for physicians should become part
of the mandatory Medical Continuing Education.
<P>
However, knowledge of drugs and government guidelines alone will not prevent all the
bad prescribing practice.  Attitude and financial incentive are also important
factors.  We strongly believe that ownership in local pharmacies by a prescribing
physician is a conflict of interest, real or perceived, and should be forbidden by
law.    
<P>
<H3>D. Salaried and community-based pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are in the
best position to deliver drug counselling and education services.</H3>
<P>
We fully appreciate the importance and urgency of educating the consumers on how to
use drugs appropriately.  We strongly oppose the suggestion of a fee-for-service model
for an on-going task of this magnitude.  The Consultation Paper describes that
"Pharmaceutical care is a new, more comprehensive approach to pharmacy services. Under
this model, pharmacists are responsible for ensuring that consumers are getting the
most appropriate drug at the best price.  The pharmacist's responsibility is to the
patient and is not tied to the sale of the drug product."   It also suggests that
"'Pharmacists' work in counselling and medication management should be paid for
separately from the dispensing function."   In line with strategies for health reform
in Ontario, we must move away from the fee-for-service model of medical services and
we will strongly oppose any government concession to continue this model for
pharmaceutical care.  It is inconceivable that a for-profit pharmacy would be able to
maintain objectivity in advising the consumer when the pressure of making money is
ever present.  
<P>
Community Health Centres have been successful in recruiting medical doctors on salary,
why not pharmacists and pharmacy technicians?   They would work as equal members of
the professional team at the centre, which includes doctors, nurses, nutritionists,
health promoters, social workers, community out-reach workers, seniors' workers,
ethnic workers and cultural interpreters.  While the pharmacist devotes most of
his/her time to drug counselling and consumer education, the pharmacy technician can
be  responsible for most of the dispensing duties appropriate for his/her level of
training.  We must not overlook the fact that ODB spends about a quarter of its annual
budget on paying for drug dispensing, a cost that has been increasing at a rate of 6.6
per cent every year for the past decade.  An important reform we strongly recommend is
to substitute pharmacists with pharmacy technicians for many of the dispensing
functions. For small centres, a system of shared pharmaceutical care and dispensing
services can be arranged among themselves or with a larger centre.  The chiropody
service in Ottawa community health centres is a successful example of such
arrangement.  Group purchasing of pharmaceutical products can also be worked out among
centres and other local health care facilities. 
<P>
Incorporating pharmacists and pharmacy technicians into the community health setting
will not only save money but also address several important issues: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Multidisciplinary approach
<LI>Team work
<LI>Equity in access
<LI>Community outreach
<LI>Cost-effectiveness
<LI>Multicultural health
</UL>
<P>
The integration of pharmaceutical care and drug dispensing services into
community-based organizations will serve, among others, a range of drug program reform
objectives.  With the example of the South Riverdale Community Health Centre in
Toronto, we trust that the government will seriously explore the option of moving
pharmaceutical care and drug dispensing towards community health centres. 
<P>
<BR>
<H2>V. CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
We acknowledged that, among others,  drug reform is part of Ontario's health reform
initiatives. We generally support the reform principles as stated in the report "Drug
Programs: Framework for Reform", but strongly believe that drug reform must not occur
in isolation.  Drug reform must be undertaken in relation to other health reform
initiatives, such as the Community Health Framework and must occur in the context of
the overall picture of health reform.

<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>AOHC Position Paper on "People Centred Access: Design and Implementation
Options"</H1>
<B>July 1993</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>I. 	INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
The  Association of Ontario Health Centres is the provincial organization of all
community health centres (CHCs) and  some health service organizations (HSOs) in
Ontario.  AOHC represents the collective interests of its member centres to government
and other organizations.  Member centres provide a range of programs and services to
mostly underserviced populations, who due to a variety of barriers (geographic,
cultural, linguistic, etc.) have difficulty accessing  health services.  
Approximately half of the CHCs are multiservice centres and receive funding from a
variety of sources for these services (other ministries, other levels of government,
United Way, etc).
<P>
Our mandate is to promote good health  in Ontario.  We believe that among other
determinants, good health is determined by access to food,  sustainable income,
education, and shelter.  Accessibility to adequate, affordable housing is a basic
human right which has a fundamental impact on the health status of individuals and
communities.
<P>
The discussion paper "People Centred Access: Design and Implementation Options"
examines the barriers of Access to Not-For-Profit Housing.  Its stated goal is the
development of an efficient intake system known as the Tenant/Member Selection Process
that would assess applicant qualification for social housing. A second objective is to
devise a means of enabling the applicant to obtain placement information accessible
within their community through a "Coordinated Access System".
<P>
Reform of  the non-profit housing system should be based on a recognition that
people's good health is determined by the level of respect, empowerment as well as
fair and equitable treatment existing in their communities.   We believe that, in this
reform initiative to the social housing, government should commit to the preservation
of human dignity as an underlying principle. To this end,  AOHC supports the
development of a policy that embodies the following beliefs and principles of the
Association:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The right to social justice/ equity
<LI>The empowerment of users
<LI>The use of health centres as a vehicle for health promotion/community development.
<LI>Support for community control in addressing health issues.
</OL>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>II. RIGHT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE / EQUITY</H2>
<P>
As it currently exists, the tenant/member selection process falls short of the goal of
equity in access due to reasons which include differential treatment of clients in
identical or near identical situations.  The primary reasons for this differential
treatment has been identified as: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a) inefficiencies in placement methods 
<LI>b) discrimination
</UL>
<P>
AOHC sees the proposed modified selection system as an appropriate response to these
problems.  The new system should be a more objective method of assessing
qualification.  Equitable treatment of consumers would be ensured through the use of
the standardized process by all housing providers.  The new system will include a
"significant need" component to ensure that those who are more needy can be placed
promptly.  Along these lines, we believe that intake workers who are representative of
the communities they serve will minimize if not eliminate linguistic and/or cultural
barriers thereby enhancing access.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>III. EMPOWERMENT OF USERS</H2>
<P>
In addition to a fair and equitable tenant selection process, the Ministry of Housing
is developing a "Co-ordinated Access System."  This system is intended to be a
community based information system with its primary purpose being the provision of all
information relevant to filling housing vacancies.  Applicants will be informed of all
availabilities within the particular community and placed on one master list replacing
the present system of one waiting list per project.
<P>
Much of the bureaucracy and red-tape will be eliminated by this "one-stop shopping"
approach which should improve information access and heighten consumer awareness of
rights and options as well as the dynamics of the placement process.  The empowered
consumer can effectively participate in the decision affecting their housing.  In
addition, consumers will be provided the right of choice giving them more control on
an essential aspect of their lives.  The concept and practice of "control" is a
recognized factor in nurturing health.  AOHC strongly supports the establishment of an
uncomplicated system which can be easily administered by housing providers and
understood by the average consumer.  In addition, we support the continued development
of additional social housing units in proportion to the enormous need identified. 
This initiative will heighten the efficiency of co-ordinated access and minimize
placement time.  
<P>
The Ministry of Housing has requested input on additional information that should be
obtainable through co-ordinated access.  AOHC recommends the inclusion of a community
support services log that is accessible to each housing project.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>IV. COMMUNITY HEALTH  CENTRES:</H2>
<H3>A Vehicle for Health Promotion and Community Development</H3>
<P>
Community Health Centres provide a range of health services which address community
needs as identified and priorized by their respective communities.  As such, CHCs have
proven to be excellent vehicles for health promotion and community development.  CHCs
work closely with their partner community organizations and service providers in
developing programs and a range of community services for the same client population. 
This collaborative approach to service delivery results in improved access to services
by clients. In line with this approach, AOHC supports government initiatives in
implementing a Housing Access System at the community level.  Enhancing access to
housing services will further enable our member centres to direct consumers to the
services they need.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>V. SUPPORTING COMMUNITY CONTROL IN ADDRESSING HEALTH ISSUES</H2>
<P>
Consultation with consumers has clearly indicated a need for change in the existing
system.  The Ministry of Housing needs to establish, within a people-centred
framework, clear guidelines that will facilitate housing providers working with
customers toward the development of a community access model.  AOHC believes the
Ministry of Housing should support communities to develop their own model for access
in a way which respects the positive aspects of existing service provision while
working toward making the changes that are needed.
<P>
<H3>A. Defining "Need"</H3>
<P>
AOHC supports a combination of formal and informal measures for assessing need; formal
measures to ensure equal treatment and informal measures to address the unique nature
of each individual case. Although it is questionable whether income can be used
arbitrarily as a means of assessing affordability, it  remains an indispensable factor
in assessing need. We suggest that need be assessed based on income in addition to an
objective measure of the adequacy or suitability of the applicant's existing housing 
(an option brought forth in the discussion paper).  A formal system should be
implemented to ensure  objectivity. 
<P>
A  less formal approach to assessment might then focus on the alternatives available
to the applicant i.e. alternate housing options available to the applicant.  The fewer
the available options, the  greater would be the "need" status.  It is for this reason
that abused women (with children) must continue to be given special priority.
<P>
<H3>B. Defining "Community"</H3>
<P>
The definition of community should be based primarily on common interest.  This
applies to both communities of providers and  communities of potential tenant/members. 
Potential tenant/members would be a designated "community" for the purpose of
strategic outreach.  These individuals would have similar characteristics based on
need such as special needs housing for the physically challenged.
<P>
A "community" of housing providers could be based on housing types.  It should be
noted, however, that this may result in divisions between housing providers and a more
"closed" system of co-ordinated access.  In addition, certain types of applicants may
be directed to specific types of housing.  An option in this regard would be the
grouping of housing providers according to geographical location which extends
tenant/member recruitment beyond geographic boundaries.
<P>
AOHC supports a definition of "community"  that represents both users and providers
and is reflective of the collaborative efforts required by both in the production and
maintenance of an efficient system of access.
<P>
<BR>
<H2>VI. CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>
The design and implementation of People Centred Access should be based on the
equitable treatment, empowerment, and accessibility of information.   Freedom of
choice must be a primary emphasis.  AOHC supports the social mix of housing projects,
representative of all age/income levels, cultures, and household types.  In addition,
we support a more decentralized approach to the provision of social housing.  Clients
should be able to live anywhere in their community and not be subjected to the stigma
of a project "structure". The selection process and the newly proposed "Co-ordinated 
Access" must ensure the preservation of individual rights and freedoms.
<P>
The concept of "People-centred Access" is one of effecting a policy change within the
Ministry of Housing.  AOHC is of the view that government needs to recognize the
effect of policy changes on community health.  The distribution of "A Housing
Framework for Ontario"  discussion paper indicates that the key decisions have already
been determined with the Ministry of Housing in line with this concept.  We further
believe that any outstanding issue should be addressed within the context of health
promotion through the preservation of human dignity.

<H2>I. INTRODUCTION</H2>
<H3>Background</H3>	
<P>
The Province of Ontario's initiatives around the redirection of long term care
represents a significant change in both the planning for and delivery of services for
seniors and the disabled.  The AOHC and its member CHCs foresee that we will be
affected by this change and feel it is necessary to intervene.
<P>
<H3>Goals</H3>
<P>
The principal goal is to define a flexible role for CHCs within a network that
accommodates the different resources of the centres and the population we serve.
<P>
The secondary goal is to assist CHCs in participating in the planning process to
establish an effective method of service coordination in our individual regions. This
process is to begin this fall.
<P>
It is important to note that the concept of establishing "Service Coordination
Agencies" appears to have been discarded.  Service coordination remains an important
part of effective, accessible service delivery and will be addressed as such in this
report.
<P>
<H3>Focus of this report</H3>
<P>
Because CHCs are community-based agencies and our expertise lies in understanding the
people, services and agencies of our communities, the focus is on the examination of
neighbourhood resources necessary to make the Long Term Care (LTC) network effective.
<P>
It is clearly recognized that CHCs function in different ways depending on the
community they serve, other community resources, their location, their size and their
staffing.  Therefore, the role that each CHC plays within the LTC system may be
different.
<A NAME="cons"></A>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>II. AOHC CONSULTATION PROCESS, WITH SANDY HILL CHC AS FACILITATOR</H2>
<P>
On behalf of the AOHC, Sandy Hill CHC, an AOHC member centre circulated a
"Questionnaire" to 41 CHCs in Ontario.
<P>
28 Centres responded, providing much information, many concerns and concrete
suggestions on possible roles for their respective CHCs.
<P>
One centre notified us that these issues do not affect their present client group. In
areas of this report where numbers or averages are used, this centre has not been
counted.
<P>
Sandy Hill CHC prepared a report and draft of a role for CHCs in Ontario's LTC system,
on which CHCs were asked to comment.
<P>
The draft report, prepared by Sandy Hill CHC was forwarded to the AOHC Board for
approval.  At its October 24th meeting, the AOHC Board approved, with some minor
revision, the draft report.
<P>
An evaluation of the process will be completed and submitted to the AOHC by Sandy Hill
CHC.
<A NAME="resp"></A>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>III. RESPONSES FROM ONTARIO CHCS</H2>
<A NAME="our"></A>
<P>
<H3>A. OUR WORK WITH SENIORS AND THE DISABLED</H3>
<P>
<H4>1. TIME</H4>
<P>
Average time devoted by CHCs to serve seniors and the disabled:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>half of CHCs gave more than 20% of their time to seniors
<LI>7 CHCs offer 20% to seniors
<LI>a majority gave 10% to the disabled
<LI>1 CHC gives 20% to the disabled
<LI>6 CHCs give less than 10% to the disabled
</UL>
<P>
<H4>2. SERVICES OFFERED</H4>
<P>
The basic programs offered by most CHCs for seniors and the disabled are primary
health care, advocacy, health promotion, foot care, counselling, and access through
outreach such as home visits.  There is a wider variety of services and activities
offered to seniors, including crisis intervention, recreational activities, addictions
assessment/referral/treatment, and volunteer opportunities.
<P>
Some specific programming offered in some centres to reach particular groups are:
programs for seniors with substance abuse issues, friendly visiting, transportation
services, nutritional services, linking to social networks, support to caregivers of
seniors and mentally disabled children, and preventive dental care. Seniors are
involved in community development and health promotion activities, and through
Advisory Committees, they provide input to services.
<P>
While most Centres serve a variety of clientele, a number of urban CHCs orient their
services specifically to ethnic minorities, while two centres are dedicated to
providing services to francophones.
<P>
It is clear that CHCs involve the members of their communities in a variety of ways,
including the planning, development, delivery, and evaluation of services in their
community.
<A NAME="ser"></A>
<P>
<H3>B. CHC SERVICE ORIENTATION:</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>We are neighbourhood-based organizations working with people, some of whom have
difficulty accessing the traditional health care system.
<P>
<LI>We are responsive to community needs and issues.
<P>
<LI>We are sensitive to the needs of multicultural minorities and other specific
populations in our communities, developing appropriate services with them.
<P>
<LI>We promote health and wellness through diverse activities which have resulted, for
example, in our advocating for those who are vulnerable, establishing self-help
groups, and supporting caregivers and the disabled.
<P>
<LI>We collaborate with other agencies in our communities and throughout the various
regions.
<P>
<LI>We offer services that are accessible, in places where people congregate, such as
foot care for seniors.
<P>
<LI>We offer services such as primary health care that is holistic in approach.
<P>
<LI>We are "Front Line Workers" who listen to our communities and are continually
increasing our understanding of the people and needs of these communities.
<P>
<LI>We are pro-active in helping our communities gain the knowledge to make choices
around issues impacting on their health and that of their community eg. community
consultations around redirection of long term care.
</UL>
<A NAME="iss"></A>
<P>
<BR>
<H2>IV. ISSUES TO BRING TO THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR COORDINATION OF SERVICES</H2>
<A NAME="reac"></A>
<P>
<H3>A. REACTION TO GOVERNMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE LTC SYSTEM</H3>
<P>
The key issue identified is the government's shift from institutional care to an
emphasis on community-based services.  Included in this are strategies on the
development of community-based alternatives to institutional care, enhancement of
neighbourhood support programs, and increasing support for caregivers.
<P>
CHCs generally agree with the intent of these strategies.  They have the potential to
enhance and complement our present work in the community and are consistent with our
philosophy of care.  They could strengthen existing support services, offer more
accessible respite care for caregivers, and recognize and enhance community
development and health promotion work.
<P>
CHCs cannot envisage a LTC system without an institutional sector.  Our challenge will
be to seek new partnerships with hospitals, nursing care agencies and other facilities
in order to ease passage of clients within their communities, from home to institution
and back again when appropriate.
<P>
It is important to recognize that implementation of these strategies may strain
existing resources as more seniors and disabled people request more services from CHCs
and other community organizations.  Seniors who wish to remain at home and those
people being returned to their communities will have complex needs requiring
specialized care.  We can expect more requests for home visits by a variety of workers
such as physicians, health promoters, nurses, social workers, friendly visitors and
other community home support workers from all local agencies, including CHCs.
<A NAME="need"></A>
<P>
<H3>B. THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES</H3>
<P>
It follows, that we can foresee the need for more workers with knowledge and skills in
areas such as gerontology, volunteer coordination, cultural appropriateness, caregiver
support, and care of physically and mentally disabled children and adults.
<P>
If the shift from institutional to community care is to be effective, we see the
following community resources as necessary:
<P>
<H4>1. Community at large</H4>
<P>
a) More resources for home support services and to offer practical assistance to
seniors and the disabled:  
<P>
Examples: housing; modification of homes; financial help; social support;
transportation; safety-monitoring; increased sensitivity to cultural and linguistic
barriers; in-home and in-hospital respite and hospice care; expanded "Integrated
Homemaker Program" services for such situations as post-op. support, the person living
at risk and alone, 24-hour care for some chronically ill clients (eg. some with
Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease); augmented "Meals on Wheels"; frail elderly
Day Programs to reduce isolation and provide caregiver relief; nutritional services;
creative programming incorporating multiple services, including social/recreational,
health promotion, health service delivery, and daily living activities, such as
banking services.
<P>
b) Encouragement and support should be provided to individuals, families and
communities, so that they have options and can make choices in order to take more
control over what is happening to them and to their communities.
<P>
c) More training for professionals and other agency workers to be able to meet new
demands and more complex health problems in the community.
<P>
d) Public education and community development strategies targeting the physically &
mentally disabled, seniors, those with chronic diseases, caregivers, disabled children
and their families, volunteers.
<P>
<H4>2. Community Health Centres</H4>
<P>
Depending on several variables, the number and kinds of workers needed and the amount
of physical space necessary will vary from centre to centre.  These variables are:
<P>
a) the demand for services.<BR>
b) the resources already established in the centre and its community.<BR>
c) the desire and capacity of the centre to expand.<BR>
d) the degree of collaboration with and access to services in other agencies.
<A NAME="comm"></A>
<P>
<H3>C. CONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>If community-based services are not in place before institutional down-sizing
occurs, clients' needs will not be met.  For example, caregivers of those with
Alzheimer's Disease or other related disorders, may not be able to cope with their
loved ones at home until death, even with augmented services.  It is important to
ensure a continuity of services, from minimal home support to intensive institutional
care, and guarantee the possibility to move from more intensive to less intensive
care, as well as the other way around.
<P>
<LI>There is already an apparent decrease in acute, chronic and respite care beds
without the provision of alternative resources.
<P>
<LI>Cutbacks to some community home support services are being seen now in some
regions.
<P>
<LI>Caregivers are stressed now and are not seeing any potential for relief.
<P>
<LI>Funds may not be reallocated to the community.
<P>
<LI>The rights of seniors, the disabled, and their families must be respected - the
role of these consumers is unclear.
<P>
<LI>We don't need a huge administrative structure that cannot be sensitive and
responsive to the community.  We need a simple, responsive, easy to access service
system that is responsive to the changing needs of the community: seniors, those
disabled, and caregivers.
<P>
<LI>We would do well to remember the lessons of psychiatric deinstitutionalization in
the 1960's and 70's.  The concept was admirable, however, the "transition" was
problematic because of the lack of development and funding of community-based
services, prior to people being discharged from psychiatric hospitals back into the
community.
</OL>
<A NAME="fund"></A>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>D. FUNDING</H3>
<P>
Although the subject of funding was not addressed in the "Questionnaire", it has
become clear that all of the issues addressed above relate directly to the need for
financial support of the government strategies.
<P>
CHCs stressed the importance of planning as an effective way of managing finances. 
Collaboration between community agencies and between institutions and agencies on
areas such as training of workers, case management, safety monitoring, outreach, and
volunteer coordination, could prove cost-effective and promote a better understanding
of communities by those partnerships.  Working together to improve communication
around services offered by specific agencies can help prevent duplication of these
services.
<P>
Funding needs to reflect the changing role for institutions and the increased emphasis
on community-based care.  Careful planning for cost-effective coordination of these
services is necessary in order to respond to client and caregiver needs, for intensive
hospital care through less intensive home support, and in both directions.
<P>
Many proposals on LTC from various groups have responded to the funding issues,
recommending specific financial strategies (ie. The Senior Citizens' Consumer Alliance
For Long-Term Care Reform).  These offer a basis for discussion.

<P>
<BR>
<H3>E. COORDINATION OF SERVICES</H3>
<P>
Whatever type of system is finally determined in order to coordinate services and
planning, CHCs saw the need for:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>A system which is consumer-driven, with representation on planning & other
committees from consumers, service providers and District Health Councils.
<P>
<LI>A system which is flexible.  Some communities have in place excellent structures,
to be built on; while others are not so rich in resources yet. Each community has
different strengths and weaknesses.
<P>
<LI>One central number for each area or region to call for information about available
services or to be given a number to contact all services/agencies.
<P>
<LI>A culturally and linguistically-sensitive system.
<P>
<LI>A system sensitive to each client's individual needs and choices both from a
social and health perspective.
<P>
<LI>A system with appropriately skilled workers in all aspects of service delivery,
from entry into the system, through assessment, planning for care, service delivery
and special events or crisis.
<P>
<LI>A system that is accessible by consumers and workers, is user-friendly and based
on neighbourhood understanding.
<P>
<LI>A system that ensures that complaints can be aired and dealt with effectively.
<P>
<LI>A system that facilitates collaboration, cooperation, and communication between
community agencies and institutions.
<P>
<LI>A system that is geographically appropriate.
<P>
<LI>A system that provides for quick response in crisis.

areas as inadequate amounts or types of service, placement in an institution, or other
decisions affecting a consumer.
<P>
<LI>advocate on behalf of CHC clients and community to ensure choice, care and quality
of service that is culturally and linguistically sensitive and universally accessible.
</UL>
<A NAME="link"></A>
<P>
<H3>E. LINKAGE:</H3>
<P>
<H4>1. FOR CLIENTS:</H4>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>help in linking community members to available resources for care and support.
<P>
<LI>examine opportunities for service provision and linkages between institutions and
other community organizations, to explore possible advantages to the consumer.
<P>
<LI>rural CHCs or those CHCs focusing on specific language or cultural groups may also
be a link for members of such groups, from a much wider area, than the area for which
they provide other services.
</UL>
<A NAME="hp"></A>
<P>
<H3>F. HEALTH PROMOTION:</H3>
<P>

disabled and psychiatrically-impaired individuals and their caregivers.
<P>
<LI>collaborate with other community agencies and LTC institutions in the planning and
delivery of health promotion programming.
</UL>
<A NAME="cd"></A>
<P>
<H3>G. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>work with community members, agencies, and policy-makers to help communities to
become involved in identifying issues, problem-solving, mobilizing its members,
identifying its own leaders - to take control of issues affecting themselves and their
communities.
</UL>
<A NAME="sp"></A>
<P>
<H3>H. SERVICE PROVISION:</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>provide a wide variety of services to our individual communities, depending on
needs identified by the community.  These may include advocacy; primary health care;
social services; community development activities; addictions assessment, referral and
treatment; health promotion and education; social/recreational activities; nutritional
services; accessibility through physical set-up, home visits, transportation,
language, hours of service, cultural sensitivity; health assessment, referral and
monitoring; service coordination; crisis intervention; counselling; support groups;
footcare/chiropody; specialized seniors' services; specialized services for the
disabled; volunteer opportunities.
<P>
<LI>offer some services, activities, education as resources within the LTC system,
building on present CHC services as part of a service provision network.
<P>
<LI>work with other community agencies and institutions to identify changes in
community needs, adjusting service provision to meet these needs, promoting
collaboration and preventing duplication of services. 
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
In conclusion, the Community Health Centre philosophy of community participation and a
broad view of health allows us to look at health issues from a unique perspective and
to enter into productive partnerships with the communities we serve.  The make-up of
each Centre reflects these communities.  As the shift to more community-based services
occurs in Ontario, we see ourselves playing an integral role: continuing with present
services, expanding others and developing new expertise to meet changing demands.  We
are meeting this challenge through continued collaboration with other community
agencies and institutions, as full members of Ontario's Long Term Care System.

<BODY>
<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>Comments on the Barer-Stoddart Report Recommendations</H1>
<STRONG>November 1991</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<OL>
<H2>Undergraduate MD Education</H2>
<P>
<H3>Enrollment</H3>
<P>
<LI>Undergraduate enrollment should be adjusted so as to maintain approximately the
current population: physician ratio; further reductions in this ratio are not
warranted.  At present a domestic entry class size of 1600 students is consistent with
this objective.  This represents a reduction of less than 10% in current domestic
entry class size.  This recommendation assumes the implementation of concurrent
policies (see below) regarding graduates of foreign medical schools, funding of
Canadian medical schools, and the supply and mix of post-MD training positions.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
Further reductions in the physician ratio will simply increase health care costs
without improving health.  The AOHC supports this recommendation to reduce class entry
size.
<P>
The evidence, both in the literature and in most community health centres (CHCs) and 
some health service organizations (HSOs), is that nurse practitioners can provide much
of the care which MD's currently deliver.  We would recommend that the training and
licensing of nurse practitioners be given serious consideration as an effective and
efficient means of providing primary health care and health promotion.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Admissions Process</H3>
<P>
<LI>The criteria used for admission to medical school should place more emphasis on
broadly-based academic preparation and performance, life experiences, and
problem-solving and inter-personal skills of applicants.
<P>
<LI>'Home-province' advantage for applicants should be eliminated or reduced, so that
medical schools become a 'national' resource equally available to all Canadian
students irrespective of their province of residence.
<P>
<LI>If geographic maldistribution is a high priority problem, some entryclass places
should be reserved in medical schools for students from under-serviced areas. 
Alternatively, or perhaps in addition, some places should be reserved for applicants
willing to sign (at time of admission) contracts for pre or post-licensure service
provision in designated under-serviced areas.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
New admission criteria will prepare new medical graduates who are more suited to
working in community-based health care.  The AOHC supports this recommendation.  M.D.
under-supply has been an issue where many communities have organized and lobbied
effectively.  Guaranteeing spaces for applicants from under-serviced areas may work
more effectively if students develop and maintain stronger links with their
communities.  One way of doing this would be by establishing a process of
recommendation which would be granted by the community as a  pre-requisite for
qualification for an  underserviced space.  Existing CHCs could work with DHCs to
develop a process for this endorsation.  Additionally CHCs and community/university
sponsored HSOs could function as placements for returning undergraduate M.D. students
for electives.
</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Curricula</H3>
<P>
<LI>The existing undergraduate curriculum should be broadened to include a view of
health in its societal context.  This will mean greater emphasis on certain clinical
areas of increasing importance, exposure to discussions about the context as well as
the content of medicine, and more explicit identification of the management or
'gatekeeper' skills required by today's primary care physicians.
<P>
<LI>More training should be located outside of urban tertiary care environments.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC supports the recommendation that M.D. students receive broadened training to
include a view of health in its societal context.  Primary care providers need skills
in health education methods and health planning and policy, in order to address, more
effectively, the determinants of health.  This approach would be in keeping with the
Alma Ata Declaration on Primary Health and the Ottawa Charter on Health Promotion
which the AOHC has adopted.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Information for Students</H3>
<BR>
<LI>A national database should be established containing information on
characteristics of practice and opportunities for practitioners by , at least,
specialty and region.  Medical students should also be provided with information on
socio-demographic and health profiles of populations, by region, and on emerging
developments such as quality assurance and competency assurance activities of
hospitals and licensing authorities which affect the context of their practice.
<P>
<H3>Graduates of Foreign Medical Schools (GOFMS)</H3>
<P>
<LI>An objective should be adopted, and specific policies enacted, to reduce Canadian
reliance on GOFMS in the longer term.  This should be achieved through policy
initiatives in other areas (see recommendations above and below) which will have the
effect of encouraging Canadian graduates to fill those necessary positions presently
'staffed' by 'selected' visa physicians and trainees.
<P>
<LI>A more concerted effort should be made to monitor and strictly enforce conditions
of entry for visa trainees and visa physicians.
<P>
<LI>More creative policies need to be developed to encourage 'non-selected' GOFMS
entering Canada on grounds unrelated to their profession to fill positions presently
filled by 'selected' GOFMS. The feasibility of a national strategy on this issue
should be investigated further.
<P>
<LI>Progress on implementation of the recommendations contained in the 1986 "Report of
the Joint Working Group on Graduates of Foreign Medical Schools to the
Federal/Provincial Advisory Committee on Health Human Resources" should be reviewed,
and an action plan should be developed for the recommendations which have not received
attention to date.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
Political refugees are a small, yet significant, proportion of newcomers to Canada. 
They differ from other immigrants because they do not choose to leave their home
country, but rather, flee from war or repression to seek sanctuary here.  Canadian
data affirms that refugees suffer a greater burden of illness secondary to
displacement and separation from loved ones.  The AOHC recommends that GOFMS who enter
Canada as political refugees be given priority for admission to 2 year pre-licensure
positions, if qualified, in order to provide care to their communities here.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Post-MD Pre Licensure Training</H3>
<P>
<LI>The annual number of funded positions for graduates of Canadian medical schools
should approximate the number of Canadian medical school graduates times the length of
post-MD pre-licensure training.  
<P>
<LI>The types of clinical training settings require significant re-alignment away from
tertiary care centres and toward settings which more closely resemble trainees'
eventual practice settings.
<P>
<LI>Trainees should receive more exposure to traditionally underemphasized areas such
as chronic care mental health, rural area practice and others.  The shift from a
one-year to two-year pre-licensure requirements affords an opportunity to implement
this re-orientation.
<P>
<LI>Post-MD pre-licensure training requirements should be consistent across provinces.
<P>
<LI>Further consideration and discussion should be given to the possibility of
requiring a period of (non-fee-for-service) remunerated public service (either prior
to or upon licensure) in under-serviced geographic and/or clinical areas, particularly
if current problems and rigidities in the physician resources sector persist.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC supports a two-year pre licensure requirement which includes areas such as
mental health, women's health, cross cultural health care and care of low income
people. 
<P>
Where possible,  Family Residency Programmes should include exposure to clinical
training settings in underserviced areas (CHCs and HSOs) and to alternative modes of
delivering health care and alternative payment methods.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Residency Training and Specialty Certification</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC is not in a position to comment on this section.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>The national capacity for residency training should be determined by the
educational needs of graduates of Canadian medical schools, and not by clinical
service imperatives or other factors.  This implies the need for about a 10% reduction
in the overall numbers of post-MD training positions funded by provincial ministries
of Health in Canada (even after all provinces have adopted a standard two-year
pre-licensure training requirement, and assuming that recommendation #1 above is
adopted; see also companion recommendation #19 below).
<P>
<LI>Specialty training programmes should be examined to ascertain the time and extent
of clinical exposure required for training, excluding resident provision of purely
service needs.
<P>
<LI>Necessary clinical services currently provided by residents, but which are not
essential for their specialty training, should be provided by other configurations of
health-care personnel (including possibly non-physician personnel).  Several options
are suggested in the background document for examination and further discussion.
<P>
<LI>A forecasting model should be developed nationally which would use detailed data
on the characteristics of the existing supply of specialists to project future
specialty-specific supply.  This is seen as an important input into national
discussions of adjustments to the mix of specialty training positions.
<P>
<LI>A national and/or regional co-ordinating body(ies) should be created to oversee
and broker the rationalisation, redistribution, and ongoing adjustment of the
specialty mix and location of residency training positions.  Included in the goals of
these bodies should be the reduction of unjustified duplication of sub-specialty
training programmes and the co-ordination of all sources of residency position
funding.
<P>
<LI>Coincident with the restructuring of the funding of academic medical centres (see
recommendations below):
<UL>
<LI>(a)	fee-for-service payments to clinical supervisors for services provided under
supervision by residents should be eliminated;
<P>
<LI>(b)	clinical supervisors should receive non-fee payment explicitly for the
activity of clinical supervision.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>If 'under-subscription' by Canadians of particular residency programmes persists
after the recommended rationalization of the number, specialty mix and location of
positions, then consideration should be given to providing financial incentives (such
as residency stipend bonuses and/or practitioner income bonuses upon obtaining
certification) to encourage the choice of these less popular specialty programmes.
<P>
<LI>Consideration should be given to the establishment of accredited residency
programmes specifically designed to train 'generalist specialists' for non-urban
hospital-based practice. Ministries of Health could give impetus to this by making
available special programmatic funding for the purposes of developing, implementing,
and evaluating pilot programmes.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Specialty Maldistribution</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC is not in a position to comment on this section.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>GOFMS should continue to be used where needed to meet specialist shortages, but
should only be viewed as a short-term solution.
<P>
<LI>Aside from inherent differences among specialties in their attractiveness as
'lifestyles', overall problems of specialty maldistribution are largely the by-product
or more fundamental problems in the training, certification and remuneration of
specialists.  Several concurrent actions should be taken as part of a concerted effort
to address these problems, including:
<UL>
<LI>(a) a review by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada of its
processes of sub-specialty certification and accreditation, to identify scope for
moderating the proliferation of new recognized specialties and of new accredited
training programmes;
<P>
<LI>(b)	examination of the internal structure of fee schedules by provincial medical
associations, to identify and remove perverse incentives encouraging the choice of
less-needed specialties (also see recommendations on remuneration below);
<P>
<LI>(c)	exploration by ministries of Health of remuneration policies (such as income
bonuses) to influence career choice and specialty distribution, if identified problems
with these instruments can be overcome.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Role and Funding of Academic Medical Centres</H3>
<P>
<LI>The academic medicine establishment should show more leadership in several
important areas, including: adapting the training of physicians to changing social
needs, monitoring the supply and mix of physicians and the appropriateness of the
services they provide, maintaining a balance among different types of research, and
contributing to more effective continuing education and competency assurance
programmes.
<P>
<LI>The funding of academic medical centres needs to be restructured to link it as
explicitly as possible to academic goals and the activities and programmes required
for their achievement, and to reduce the growing reliance of the centres on clinical
earnings.
<P>
<LI>Although the design of specific models may differ across provinces and centres,
the restructuring of funding should incorporate several general principles, including
the following:
<UL>
<LI>(a)	funding should flow through a single office of responsibility at each centre;
<P>
<LI>(b)	funding should not be developed on the basis of 'per student' allotments;
<P>
<LI>(c)	'envelopes' should be used to provide funds for particular programmatic
objectives and activities;  
<P>
<LI>(d)	fee-for-service payment for clinical activity undertaken for academic purposes
should be eliminated; funding for these activities should be provided
programmatically, and should include clear identification of funds for clinical
supervision of post-MD trainees.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Within each province, all Ministries providing funds to academic medical centres
should do so through collective, co-operative, and co-ordinated negotiating mechanisms
with the centres as a group (where there is more than one). Significant improvements
in inter-ministerial co-ordination and co-operation are required in this regard in
some provinces.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC strongly supports the recommendation that academic medicine establishment
should show leadership in adapting the training of physicians to changing social
needs.  More physicians need training in community-based health care.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Geographic Maldistribution</H3>
<P>
<LI>The 'framing' of this problem should be modified, so that: (i) the policy
objective is not seen as equal geographic distribution of all types of physicians but
rather as equitable and reasonable access to necessary clinical services; and (ii)
policy option are not viewed narrowly as physician resource options but as options
involving increased scope for other health-care personnel.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC strongly supports this recommendation.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>Because 'piecemeal' approaches and/or 'trickle-down' policies of general increases
in physician supply are unlikely to be any more effective in the future than they have
been in the past, improved geographic distribution of medical services will require a
concerted effort (and resource commitment) to create a broadly-based and integrated
'policy package' of reinforcing initiatives which cut across virtually every other
policy area discussed in this report.  Therefore serious consideration and discussion
of the priority status of this issue is required.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
Serious consideration and discussion of this matter should involve not only the
representatives of the medical profession but also the representatives of other health
related professions and appropriate community representatives.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>A 'policy package' might include some combination of the following:
<UL>
<LI>increasing the availability of non-physician personnel as front-line contacts
within regional service networks involving regional physician consultants;
<P>
<LI>establishing new training programmes for these non-physician personnel;
<P>
<LI>improving science programmes and career counseling in rural area high schools;
<P>
<LI>reserving undergraduate medical school places for qualified applicants willing to
commit to rural area practice;
<P>
<LI>revising admissions criteria for medical school to favour qualified rural
applicants;
<P>
<LI>enhancing rural area exposure in both undergraduate and post-MD training;
<P>
<LI>developing new residency training programmes designed explicitly to prepare
specialists to serve as rural regional consultants;
<P>
<LI>introducing or increasing financial incentives (both at the training and practice
stages) to encourage choices of specialties in short rural supply;
<P>
<LI>introducing or increasing financial incentives to encourage the location of
practices in non-urban settings;
<P>
<LI>providing clinical decision-making support networks and regular sources of relief
for rural community physicians through academic medical centres;
<P>
<LI>providing 'amenity packages' (e.g. travel funding for continuing education,
benefits for spouses/children) as part of recruitment and retention strategies;
<P>
<LI>encouraging alternative remuneration methods, e.g. regional capitation for primary
care (see also recommendations on remuneration below).
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments
<P>
AOHC strongly supports the inclusion of the above in the 'policy package'.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Patterns of Medical Service Utilization</H3>
<P>
<LI>Medical colleges and associations and academic medical centres should take
leadership roles in the further development and dissemination of clinical practice
guidelines, and the ongoing review of their application and effectiveness.  There is
considerable scope in this area for a national collaborative effort..
<P>
<LI>Academic medical centres in particular should play a larger role than at present
in quality assurance activities, including the generation and synthesis of research
contributing to the development of practice guidelines, the identification of
situations where guidelines are needed, and the provision of training both for the
individuals performing quality assessments and for those whose performance is
identified as requiring improvement.
<P>
<LI>For areas in which clinical practice guidelines already exist, the extent of
inappropriate care which is presently occurring should be ascertained.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC strongly supports these recommendations. Quality assurance activities are vitally
important and academic medical standards should play a larger role in developing this
crucial aspect of health care delivery.  All health centres, both academic and
non-academic, could benefit from some excellent evidence-based guidelines in this
area.</STRONG>  
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Regulation and Licensure</H3>
<P>
<LI>Exclusive fields of practice should be eliminated and replaced by a more
circumscribed set of exclusive acts and reserved titles in order to address
overlapping 'scopes of capability' of physicians and other health-care personnel.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC supports this recommendation.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>The establishment of programmes to assure the public of the continuing competence
of all physicians should be given higher priority, under the leadership of provincial
licensing authorities. If effective voluntary programmes which assure the continuing
competence of all physicians cannot be designed, then mandatory continuing competence
assurance programmes should be established.
<P>
<LI>Licensing authorities in each province should ensure that there is inter-regional
portability of licences.
<P>
<H3>Remuneration</H3>
<P>
<LI>Although there is no single 'best' way to pay physicians in all circumstances, too
little use is made of alternatives to fee-for-service as a payment method in Canada. 
Fee-for-service should be replaced wherever that method of payment aligns poorly with
the nature or objective of the service being provided.  Following this principle,
specific candidates for national payment reform might be:
<UL>
<LI>(a)	elimination of fee-based payment associated with academic activity (where the
primary objectives are either education or educational supervision) (see
recommendation #29 above);
<P>
<LI>(b)	replacement of fee-for-service with global funding (contracts) for highly
specialized, relatively uncommon tertiary or quaternary services serving regional or
provincial populations;
<P>
<LI>(c)	replacement of fee-for-service by capitation payment for primary care (or a
mixture of capitation plus limited fee-for-service) to emphasize and reward the
management function of primary care physicians;
<P>
<LI>(d)	sessional payments or salaries instead of fees-for-service (where it still
exists) for emergency department physicians;
</UL>
<P>
These are examples of situations where objectives and methods of payment seem
misaligned.  There are undoubtedly others (see recommendation #41).
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC strongly supports the principle articulated in this recommendation.  The AOHC is
of the view that the 'fee for service' way for paying physicians is not an appropriate
method of payment in the delivery of primary health care services.   The 'salary” form
of remuneration for physicians employed by community health centres provides for and
promotes the type of programs and services that are delivered by CHCs which reflects
the Premier's Council on Health Strategy Health Goals. Similarly, the capitated form
of payment for primary care emphasizes and rewards the management function of primary
care physicians in health service organizations (HSOs)  In one way, it places
physicians on an equal footing with other health care providers which encourages a
change from the traditional practice.</STRONG>        
<P>
<LI>Further review of the appropriateness of method of payment for the nature and
objectives of specific types of services should be undertaken for other types of
services.
<P>
<LI>Master agreements governing remuneration negotiations between governments and
physicians should facilitate the full range of remuneration methods and include a
formal dispute resolution mechanism.
<P>
<LI>The development of inter-provincial consistency in fee relativities within fee
schedules should be encouraged.
<P>
<H3>Global Expenditure Policy</H3>
<P>
<LI>Some form of global budgetary policy will be a necessary component of a
responsible policy package.  Both quality of care and public accountability would be
best served if all provinces moved toward a system of resource allocation consisting
of 'top-down' budgetary allocation processes and 'bottom-up' evaluative and corrective
processes.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC supports this recommendation in context of appropriateness of care.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>The level of overall resource commitment to health care is ultimately a matter of
social choice.  Based on today's apparent social consensus about resource commitments,
and on existing opportunities for improving effectiveness and efficiency in service
delivery and utilization, however, a strong case can be made for limiting increases in
health-care expenditures (and especially medical care expenditures) to those necessary
to account for general inflation, population growth, and changes in the 'needs
composition' of the population.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC supports the general thrust of this recommendation.  In addition, there should be
a reasoned plan (both short and long term) on the progression of  growth in the
resource reallocation toward community health.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>In the absence of reform of fee-for-service remuneration for physicians and of
other physician income reforms, carefully developed individual income ceilings should
be considered as an alternative to assist with medical care budgetary control.
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC is of the opinion that the reform of the 'fee for service' remuneration is a must 
if the principles of Medicare are to be maintained in the health care system.  The
provision  and widespread implementation of primary health care is a fundamental
element of health care reform and the 'fee for service' is incompatible with the
alternative way of delivering health care.</STRONG>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Information Creation and Provision</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
AOHC supports the general theme and thrust  of the recommendations in this
section.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>A nationally co-ordinated information system that could guide the determination of
numbers and mix of post-MD training positions should be established with input from
stakeholders and organizations which have already developed useful data.
<P>
<LI>Increased emphasis should be placed on 'applied' health services research (i.e.
issues such as the effectiveness and efficiency of alternative services or delivery
models, and alternative services or delivery models, and alternative [to medical care]
ways of improving population health).  To make this investment worthwhile, however,
there needs to be a better interaction between research funding agencies (and
researchers) and policy makers.
<P>
<LI>Routine health status/disability surveys, similar to those now in use in Ontario
and Quebec, should be fielded in a relatively consistent format in all provinces, with
pooling of some of the developmental fixed costs and resources.  These surveys should
be designed to (among other things) support investigations into the broader
determinants of health, monitor key changes in health needs, and provide information
on the relationship between health deficits and the use of different types of
health-care resources.
<P>
<LI>The public should receive more information than at present on issues such as
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of services, current resource
allocations, and determinants of health.
<P>
<LI>It is important to realize that no amount of information is ever likely to be
sufficient to satisfy all parties in any policy development process.  Furthermore,
information itself cannot and does not 'make' fundamental allocation and distribution
decisions. Therefore, although there are deficiencies in the amount and quality of
current information, these should not be allowed to paralyze policy development in the
physician resources sector. Failure to act on the serious problems in this sector will
itself be a policy statement.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Next Steps</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>AOHC Comments:
<P>
The AOHC is not in a position to comment on this section.</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>A process should be launched to seek the reactions of stakeholders, including
government officials, from across the country to the framework, analysis, options and
recommendations of this report.  For this purpose, the report should be viewed as a
discussion document which (a) adds impetus to selected changes that are just beginning
to occur; (b) encourages other changes that are not yet apparent; and (c) demonstrates
the need for integrated policy development within the physician resources sector.
<P>
<LI>The objectives of this process might include the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(a) to confirm the assessment rendered herein, that it is both imperative and
possible to begin now a careful process of significant change in this sector;
<P>
<LI>(b) to seek and develop agreement on the principles upon which collaboration will
occur among parties in implementing and managing change;
<P>
<LI>(c) to identify the 'policy packages' for which there is the strongest support;
<P>
<LI>(d) to explore the willingness of different parties to take leading or supportive
roles in key areas;
<P>
<LI>(e) to identify further the practical obstacles to specific policy changes, and to
develop strategies and agreements to address and overcome them; and
<P>
<LI>(f) to address issues of the timing and co-ordination of specific initiatives more
explicitly.

<I>Association of Ontario Health Centres Position Paper</I>
<HR>
<H1>AOHC RESPONSE TO THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH DRAFT DISCUSSION PAPER ON THE HSO
PROGRAMME ENTITLED "NEW BEGINNINGS"</H1>
<B>February 1991</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
We have given some thought to the various items contained in this discussion paper. We
have no difficulty of course with the goals and objectives described for the HSO
programme, as these in fact, these reflect the goals and objectives outlined by the
Association of Ontario Health Centres in our June 1990 report to the Ministry of
Health. (Appendix I)*
<P>
<H2>CAPITATION</H2>
<P>
The Ministry's intention to work out a capitation rate which is sensitive to the
particular services a physician or group provide and to include a factor reflecting
health status, makes great sense and the AOHC agree that this should be the ultimate
goal.  The potential for varying the capitation rate would then be a factor in
stimulating an HSO to be involved in different aspects of care.  While the intent is
praiseworthy, the practical aspects of introducing this may be difficult for many
reasons which we will no doubt discuss.
<P>
For the moment it would seem that we are agreed that the calculation of the health
care capitation rate is to remain tied to the average cost of health care in the
province.  Thus if we are to refine specific parts of the capitation rate, then we
believe that the total cost of care in the Province should be utilized to calculate
the capitation amount.  If then the number of physicians in the Province cause the
cost of care to rise, then this factor should be included as well as issues already
discussed in the report submitted to the Ministry of Health by the Association of
Ontario Health Centres in 1988.  (Appendix II)*  In other words, we believe that the
Ministry of Health cannot sit on both sides of the fence.  On the one hand the
Ministry wants, with justification, to add or subtract to the capitation a rate for
types of care provided or not by a particular group.  On the other hand, it appears
that the Ministry does not intend to use the proper total cost of care as their
starting point to determine the capitation fee.
<P>
<H2>NEGATION</H2>
<P>	
Over the past year or so of meetings, we have wrongly accepted the statement by the
Ministry of Health that they pay twice for health care under the current negation
system.  The Ministry now suggests moving towards partial or full costs negation.
First of all, let us consider what the capitation system means.  It means that HSO's
receive a consistent fee per patient whether they deal with high users of the system
or low users.  The heavy users if they had remained in F.F.S. would have generated
very substantial health care costs.  This event is of course evened out in HSO's by
the fact that low users of the system who may not appear for several years also
generate income.  If a patient then seeks care outside of the HSO, the capitation fee
for that month is removed.  In effect, one sustains an average loss because one was
receiving an average gain.  The Ministry of Health wish to institute greater negations
which we believe is an attempt to embrace two systems - the averaging system when it
suits and the fee system, when it hurts!  The Ministry of Health are overlooking in
effect, the underfunding of the high use, capitated patient.  Furthermore, full cost
negations in a system as open-ended from the patient's point of view, as we have in
place at the present time, makes no sense, as it is mostly out of the control of the
Health Service Organization concerned.  The potential losses to the HSO depend often
on their geographical location.  Country areas with limited alternate services have
less abuses by their patients.  However, as long as a patient remains totally free to
choose any care at any time, despite registration with an HSO and despite 24 hour
accessibility, the list of potential losses is quite frightening.  Certainly in so far
as primary care services are concerned:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Hospital Emergency Departments - despite patient instruction and education, these
continue to be utilized for episodic care.
<LI>The geographical location in which the primary care service was given, extends
even to holiday areas such as Muskoka and Florida.
<LI>The use of certified specialists such as psychiatrists and podiatrists generate
negations.
<LI>So called sports medicine clinics which have glamorous connotation to the patient
athlete, combat HSO attempts to use registered physiotherapy services.
<LI>After hours clinics which dispense convenient drop in care.
<LI>The recent entrepreneurial abuse, the house call service.
<LI>Family Physicians operating varicose vein clinics and hair removal clinics.
</OL>
<P>
In summary, let us understand perhaps the Ministry's intent in their efforts to alter
this system:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The first and perhaps the most important is to encourage the requirement for 24
hour care from health service organizations.  This would appear to be the most logical
reason, as the AOHC agree that HSOs should provide comprehensive 24 hour care within
the possibilities dictated by a totally open-ended consumer system.
<LI>The argument that an HSO can still make money in the system with full negation
only makes sense because the HSO may be currently overpaid for the reasons outlined
under capitation.
</OL>
<P>
We have really dwelt on primary care services with which we are most familiar.  Larger
negations for specialty services acquired from a primary care unit which does not
possess these services in house may well be pertinent, not because of the negation
average amounts, but because of the fact that the Ministry of Health needs to deal
with inappropriate specialty arrangements.  We would however like to hear the
arguments of multi-specialty groups on this issue.
<P>
Perhaps we can approach the immediate needs of the Ministry of Health by limiting the
percentage of negation allowed.  Even this method however, would be open to variation. 
For instance charges for emergency room services covered by A.P.P., such as most of
those in Hamilton are not reflected in primary care negations, which even currently is
unfair.
<P>
<H2>ACIP</H2>
<P>
We can only agree with the Ministry's reasoning on this issue.  We would like to
underline however that  a meaningful financial incentive should stay in place for
those physicians who do have a will have an effect on hospital discharge rates. 
Whether or not HSO's are having an effect on hospital admissions and discharges
remains to be proven.  Certainly there is evidence from the Group Health Centre, Sault
Ste. Marie, that the hospital rate is approximately 25% better than their control
group.  The Caroline Medical Group also can show significant differences.  To use the
argument that lesser admissions and earlier discharges do not have any practical or
economic effect is a fatuous one.  The pressure on beds and the need for extra
hospital building would increase if these bed savings were not made.
<P>
Obviously we are interested in the use of a financial incentive system in an attempt
to correct overuse of laboratory and x-ray services and the over prescribing of drugs. 
However, the research base to justify these events and the means to bring them about
are in the future.
<P>
In summary, we understand the need of the Ministry of Health to make costs of the HSO
system justifiable.  In effect by the alteration in the capitation system and ACIP,
the Ministry would release monies which could be directed to encourage more
"exemplary" primary care.  This makes reasonable common sense, but there are some
dangers involved.  These are the dangers of bureaucracy and the potential
inconsistencies of a funding system which is ruled by the dictates of current Ministry
policy.  We will all have difficulty in accepting a system which converts from being
open-ended from a point of view of HSO's, to being open-ended from the point of view
of the Ministry of Health.
<P>
The stimulus to become an HSO we believe should remain powerful.  This is surely a
system by which we can move primary care into  a more "appropriate mode".  There are
many physicians who believe this need should be encouraged.  The most powerful
motivation is perhaps financial, both in consistent and appropriately increased
funding.  It remains for the Ministry of Health to use this funding power wisely!

Funding for Peterborough Community Wellness Centre Terminated

Preparations for the establishment of a Community Wellness Centre in
Peterborough were halted abruptly by a recent Ministry of Health
decision to terminate all previously approved funding for the new CHC. 
In a letter to Wellness Centre Chair Shelley Matthews, the Ministry
pointed both to a lack of government resources and to the current
"level of access to services offered by family physicians in
Peterborough and surrounding county" as determining factors in their
decision.
Although the Peterborough Community Wellness Centre had not yet hired
staff or secured premises, its board of directors nevertheless reacted
to the announcement with shock and disappointment.  The initial
go-ahead for the Peterborough Community Wellness Centre came after a
four year process of community development and research by the
Centre's directors and Steering Committee.  They expressed surprise at
the sudden withdrawal of that approval.  "We do not understand the
Ministry of Health's reasons for this unprecedented decision.  We have
been, in good faith, working closely with the Ministry throughout our
development and have not been given an indication that our funding was
at risk," said Ms. Matthews.

Wellness Centre organizers had originally obtained approval for the
new CHC in February of 1995, when then Health Minister Ruth Grier
announced that the Ministry would provide $557,069 in start-up funding
and support for an estimated $1,285,000 annual budget to "address the
health needs of low-income residents in Peterborough and surrounding
rural areas."  The Peterborough Centre was one of only four CHC
proposals chosen for approval by the Ministry last year.

Reaction from the Peterborough community has been mixed.  Brian
Fallis, President of the Peterborough Social Planning Council, called
the decision "a huge loss for our community."  By contrast, an article
in the Peterborough Examiner called the loss "inevitable" and pointed
to "indifferent community support" as helping to "seal its fate". 
According to the paper, the Centre's directors did not successfully
demonstrate the need for the CHC, and local physicians were "angry"
that their input was not sought before the proposal was submitted. 
The article also stated that city council did not support the CHC, and
that the district health council's endorsement was not very
enthusiastic.  DHC Chair Bill James explained their reluctance to
wholeheartedly endorse the proposal by saying they felt that the
Centre did not have a clear focus, and that it might duplicate already
existing services in the area.

Despite the withdrawal of Ministry of Health funding, the Wellness
Centre directors remain convinced that the proposed CHC addresses a
real need for health services in their community, particularly in the
rural area outside of Peterborough.  They have responded to the
announcement by requesting a meeting with Health Minister Jim Wilson
and local M.P.P. Harry Danford.  They are also examining alternate
solutions such as shifting the emphasis of the proposal more clearly
in the direction of the known rural health service needs.  Several
independent studies and reports by the CHC's  Steering Committee, the
local District Health Council and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture
have all identified health problems and needs specific to
Peterborough's rural community.  The Wellness Centre's directors
maintain that a CHC could best solve those problems and meet those
needs, and they continue to emphasize the many advantages of the
community health centre model as a cost effective, multidisciplinary
team approach to primary health care delivery.

Health Services Restructuring Commission Named

Health Minister Jim Wilson recently announced the names of the members
of the province's new Health Services Restructuring Commission. 
Joining chair Duncan Sinclair on the commission are Shelly Jamieson of
Toronto, Executive Director of the Ontario Nursing Home Association;
George Lund, president of Baton Broadcasting Systems Ontario Inc. in
Sudbury; London-based lawyer Daniel H. Ross; Hartland M. MacDougall,
deputy chairman of London Insurance Group Inc. in Calgary; J. Donald
Thornton of Oshawa, former General Motors of Canada executive; and Dr.
Maureen Law of Ottawa, former deputy minister of Health and Welfare
Canada.  In addition, Dr. David Naylor, chief executive officer of the
Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) will serve as a
special advisor, helping the commission with its research and
analysis.

The commission recently issued its own announcement, naming Mark
Rochon, president and CEO at Humber Memorial Hospital, as the chief
executive officer of the Health Services Restructuring Commission. 
Commission chair Duncan Sinclair stated "Mark has intimate knowledge
of the hospital system in Ontario and of the Ministry of Health with
which the commission will be working closely in the discharge of its
mandate.  He also brings an interest in and commitment to the reform
of the health care system as well as experience in the development of
related policy."

The commission started its work in March, and will last for four
years.  According to a news release from the commission's new location
at 56 Wellesley Street in Toronto, its role will be to make decisions
on implementation of hospital restructuring and consider, more
generally, the restructuring of the health care system in Ontario.  It
will function at arm's length from the government and keep the
Minister of Health informed.

Reviewing Ontario's Red Tape

The province's November 29 Fiscal and Economic Statement included an
announcement that the Premier has appointed a Red Tape Review
Commission with the primary intent of removing barriers to economic
growth and job creation.

The Commission has been given one year to review the appropriateness
of existing regulatory measures of the government, especially as they
affect businesses and institutions, and to make recommendations to
Cabinet on a) the elimination or amendment of any inappropriate
regulatory measures, and b) the design of an ongoing evaluation/
impact test and review process for the approval of any new regulatory
measures. As part of the Commission's consultative process, AOHC was
recently invited to participate in a round table discussion with other
representatives from the health sector.  Each participant was asked to
give a five-minute oral presentation on their priorities for
regulatory reform in Ontario, and to contribute to discussions on
proposals for reform, alternative regulatory models, and the impact of
regulation.

AOHC Executive Director  Sonny Arrojado's presentation included an
overview of administrative law and government wherein she noted that
financial constraints, the size and the ability to finance public
indebtedness and the globalization of the economy have led governments
in recent years to look at public programs in the context of
degregulation, privatization and lower taxes.  The pervasive presence
of regulatory procedures and processes have been identified as
creating a burden that affects competition and productivity.  

Among the areas Arrojado  identified as needing particular attention
is the recognition of the likelihood that, sometimes, in protecting of
the interests of one segment of the public, governments have put at
great risk the health and lives of that same public citing the recent
crisis in public confidence generated by the "mad cow disease" scare
in the U.K.  She concluded her presentation by offering some cautious
encouragement to the Commission:

"We are of the view that the Red Tape Review Commission presents an
opportunity to build a more rational framework.  The Commission
ideally offers the opportunity for making this accountability/risk
management/ quality assurance framework more rational.   We
acknowledge that, over the years, regulatory measures have been put in
place which may no longer be relevant or necessary today.

However we are somewhat concerned that the terms of reference of the
Commission appears to be based on an underlying assumption that there
are too many regulatory measures; that many regulatory measures are
unnecessary; and that regulatory measures are generally costly things
in purely financial or monetary terms, causing more work for
bureaucrats, businesses, institutions and the public.  

The number one criterion in the ‘Draft Evaluation Criteria' reads: 
‘Is the rationale for the government in this area still valid in light
of the current government's priorities and direction?'  We are
concerned that this criterion effectively pits the non-tangible
benefits of protecting public and individual safety, and promoting
healthy development, against the monetary costs of providing this
protection.  While an interest in cost-benefits is indicated a number
of times in the terms of reference, the meaning of the term appears to
focus on monetary and short-term benefits and to ignore monetary and
non-monetary longer term costs and benefits alike.

The Commission needs to consider options for monitoring those areas
which are important enough to regulate.  If the government gets out of
the business of doing the monitoring, there is still a cost to
monitoring.  The terms of reference suggest that the province is
interested in off-loading some of these responsibilities to other
levels of government and other types of bodies (maybe associations). 
Should this be the preferred approach, it is important to note that
financial support should be provided to those who will assume these
responsibilities. Finally, if there is only one thing we would urge
the Commission to consider, it is ‘Do not throw the baby out with the
bathwater'."

Building Healthier Organizations

The Building Healthier Organizations (BHO) initiative has operated as
a partnership between the AOHC and the Community Health Branch of
Ministry of Health since 1994.  The initiative is being guided by the
Quality Management Work Group.

We have described in previous articles how BHO is essentially a  "tool
kit"  which community health centres can use to review and ultimately
improve the "health" of their organizations. This article provides a
brief update on the BHO initiative.

In order to make the BHO process manageable, we have divided the
activities of CHCs into six areas called "building blocks".  The six
building blocks, as currently defined, are pictured in the chart
(above*).   The four blocks which have been shaded are those which we
expect to pilot test later this year.

While the six building blocks provide a way of describing the
activities of all CHCs, the Quality Management Work Group felt that it
was important to recognize the differences among CHCs by addressing
how health centres change over time as they grow and mature as
organizations.

As a result, we have identified three developmental levels or stages
of increasing complexity in the life of a CHC. We have described the
levels briefly and broadly as follows:
Level 1:  Accreditation
Level 2:  Integration
Level 3:  Innovation
The levels, themselves, work as building blocks as shown in the figure
(above*).  Level 2 builds on level 1 and level 3, on level 2.

General descriptions of the levels which cut across all building
blocks and components are provided below. Sometimes only one or two
levels apply to the developmental process associated with a component;
sometimes, all three.  The levels are benchmarks only.  The process of
development is, in reality, continuous and most often seamless.

Level 1: Accreditation
Level 1 is the accreditation level. The accreditation and review
process is described in a separate section of this article.
Level 1 applies to a CHC that has been operating for two or three
years.  The start-up phase is complete. At this level, the centre has
adequate structures, systems and processes in place to operate as a
community health centre.  At a minimum, this level conforms with
Ministry of Health expectations incorporated in the Ministry of Health
Resource Manual which defines the essentials which must be in place
for centres to continue to receive Ministry of Heath funding.

Accreditation is a new element in our thinking about BHO.  It
recognizes the need for CHCs to demonstrate formally to their funders
and the public at large their ability to function within basic
standards which address all aspects of their operations. 
Accreditation means the establishment of an accreditation
body—something that is still under discussion with the Ministry of
Health, but presumably a body which will be aligned with the AOHC.

However, BHO is more than accreditation process.  It is also a system
which is intended to promote best practices.  This is where levels 2
and 3 come in as described below.

Level 2:  Integration
At this level, the centre reflects the AOHC Beliefs and Principles and
its own beliefs and principles (or "values" ) across its operations. 
Systems and procedures are well established and integrated to ensure
both efficiency and effectiveness. The centre has forged partnerships
well beyond those needed to assure its funding approval.  Level 2
constitutes a mature, efficient and effective organization.

Level 3:  Innovation
At this level, a centre already operating at level 2 has established
the confidence and maturity to take risks while still conforming with
the AOHC Beliefs and Principles.  It is willing to try new ways of
doing things and enter into new partnerships. The centre is a leader
in its own community and in the health centre movement.

The Accreditation and Review Process

A BHO review may be internal, involving staff at the centre and
relying solely on the BHO manual which is being developed. 
Alternatively, a centre may opt for a more independent review which
includes people from outside the centre. A centre that opts for a more
independent review has an opportunity of incorporating fresh insight
into the organization's thinking about how it does business. A CHC
will receive a certificate indicating that it has undergone an
independent review and identifying the level at which a centre is
operating which may be different for different building blocks in the
BHO system.  Where a certificate indicates that a centre is
functioning at level 1, this constitutes accreditation. Centres
functioning a level 3 will provide examples of "best practices" which
will be incorporated in a "best practices manual" to encourage
excellence across the system.

Individual community health centres decide on when to initiate a
review although the BHO process is built on an expectation that
centres will opt for an independent review sometime during the first
three years of operation.  The accreditation body will establish the
review team for an independent review.  The team will consist of staff
from the CHC being reviewed, staff from other centres experienced in
the review process and staff from the accreditation body.

The final product of the review process, regardless of the level at
which a CHC is functioning, is an action plan. The action plan
describes how to celebrate what a centre does well and change the
things that need to be changed. The change process may involve a
variety of activities including the development of new policies or
procedures, training or other learning.  The action plan is the
centre's response to the review team's report.  The executive
director, selected board members, centre staff and volunteers, and
even centre clients may be brought into the process of developing the
action plan.  The centre may also use the review team itself.  The
team has valuable expertise and likely has considered an array of
possible solutions during the review process.

The accreditation body will support CHCs in working toward
implementing their action plans and will determine when to issue a
certificate indicating that a centre has completed its action plan.

These are just some of the more significant details of BHO as it
currently exists.  We are in the process of making final revisions to
the first edition our new BHO manual and developing plans for pilot
testing the four building blocks described above later this year. 
More information will be provided at the AOHC Annual General Meeting.

Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act

On January 29, 1996 the Ontario Legislature passed the Public Sector
Salary Disclosure Act, which requires the province's broader public
sector organizations to disclose annually the names, positions,
salaries and taxable benefits of employees who are paid $100,000 or
more per year.

The Ministry of Health recently distributed a "technical manual" to
assist organizations in determining whether the Act applies to them or
not, identifying which employees' salaries must be disclosed, and
reporting the information properly.

According to the literature provided, the purpose of the Act is to
make Ontario's broader public sector more open and accountable to
taxpayers.  It is intended to give the public the kind of information
to which they are entitled about salaries in the public sector, and to
enable taxpayers to compare an organization's performance and
priorities with the way it compensates its senior staff.

Affected organizations are required to make the information accessible
to the public and send a copy to all the Ontario government ministries
from which they receive funding, or the ministry to which they report. 
The deadline for disclosing this information is each March 31 for the
previous calendar year.

Organizations funded by the Ministry of Health who require further
information on the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act can call Lily
Weedon, Communications and Information Branch at (416) 327-8503.

West Central Launches Manual on Dental Services

"Brushing Up - Understanding and Accessing Dental Services" is the
title of a new manual produced by West Central CHC which focuses on
access to dental services in downtown Toronto and on oral self care. 
It evolved from a 1994 survey of oral health needs of homeless and
underhoused adults, disabled and unemployed populations, women in
crisis, youth and newcomers to Canada.

The "Brushing Up" manual was developed to provide much-needed
information on available dental services for low income individuals. 
It also contains other relevant dental information that staff and
members of community agencies can use to enhance their knowledge and
understanding of their own oral health, and consequently become more
informed as consumers of dental services.

We need your ideas to improve our newsletters!

AOHC is undertaking a review of AOHC's regular publications,
HealthLink and CHC News for CHC People.  The intent of the review is
to consolidate and streamline news output to ensure that, within
limited resources,  relevant information is provided at the right
time. Each newsletter had developed as a result of different specified
objectives, however, over the years had evolved into generally similar
content and format for essentially the same readers.

We would appreciate your suggestions on how we can change these two
publications to best serve the communication and information needs of
our member centres and our readers. For example, would it be helpful
if one retained the "magazine" format while the other became a more
frequent "bulletin"?  What do you like about Healthlink and CHC News
that should be retained?  What don't you like that should be changed?

We anticipate to make any changes by the 1996 Fall issues so please
let us know your opinions on or before July 17, 1996.  Please send, by
mail or FAX, your ideas to Newsletter Ideas, AOHC, 5233 Dundas St. W.,
Suite 102, Etobicoke, ON M9B 1A6  FAX: (416) 236-0431.  You can also
send your comments by e-mail to: mail@aohc.org   Thanks!

Economic Statement Affects Health Services

Affected by earlier cuts to Community and Social Services programs,
community health centres (CHCs) will likely face additional challenges
as the full effect of the government's November 29th Fiscal and Economic
Statement are felt by individuals and communities served by CHCs. 
Albeit spared from a direct mention in the wide range of budget cuts
outlined by the government on November 29, CHC programs and services
will still be significantly affected.  As part of the province's front
line for primary care delivery in the community, CHCs will be
increasingly called upon to deal with the effects of the cutbacks in
their respective communities as these affect other factors which affect
the overall health of individuals, families and communities.

Government Attacks Overspending

According to the Finance Minister, the far-reaching cuts take aim at
"overspending, high taxes and deficit financing".  Among the affected
sectors and programs are municipalities, school boards, universities and
colleges, hospitals, grants and loans to business, and a variety of
smaller agencies.  The Minister said that the actions announced in his
statement, coupled with savings from measures previously announced, will
achieve total savings of between $4.5 and $5.5 billion in 1996-97.

Health Priorities Set

In health care, the government has reiterated its commitment to
maintaining health spending at the current $17.4 billion level.  As the
Finance Minister pointed out, however, that "... this is not a
commitment to maintain the status quo.  The government has already
reinvested millions in areas where health dollars are needed most."
Hospitals will experience the greatest reduction in transfer payments,
of $365 million in 1996/97, $435 million in 1997/98, and $507 million in
1998/99.  The Minister of Health will establish a Health Services
Restructuring Commission to "facilitate the restructuring of the
hospital system".  Doctors are also affected by cuts following the
government's decision to stop contributing $40 million annually towards
doctors' malpractice insurance.  In addition, Ontario's spending on the
Ontario Drug Benefit Plan will be reduced by new regulations requiring
recipients to share the cost of drug purchases (see article, page 6).

Health money saved by these measures will be redirected "to help meet
priority health care needs, improve access for rural and northern
communities, and respond to the health care demands of an aging
population."  New priorities singled out for health care reinvestment
are cardiac services, kidney dialysis treatment, acquired brain
injuries, immunization programs and the development of integrated
information systems.   In response to a query from AOHC Executive
Director Sonny Arrojado during the "lock up" preceding the release of
the Economic Statement, Health Minister Jim Wilson indicated that he
expects the hospital restructuring process to yield some savings for
reinvestment in the community.  He further noted that the priorities
identified in the statement are just a portion of a multi-year process
and that consideration will be given to additional resources for the
community.

Notwithstanding the Health Minister's stated intent, many CHCs continue
to be concerned with the lack of identified priorities relating to the
much needed support for resource strapped community based agencies and
facilities that have to respond to the increased demand for health
services.  In the past few years, support for community services have
been recommended and promised through various reports and government
announcements but CHCs have yet to see actual dollars reinvested from
the acute care sector to the community based sector.

NAME="b26"></A>****************************************************************

BILL 26 CAUSES CONCERNS

With the release of the 1995 Fiscal and Economic Statement came Bill 26,
an unprecedented 211 page omnibus bill entitled "An Act to achieve
Fiscal Savings and to promote Economic Prosperity through Public Sector
Restructuring, Streamlining and Efficiency and to implement other
aspects of the Government's Economic Agenda." The bill, which includes
16 schedules dealing with some 47 acts and statutes, has passed first
reading.  As a result of negotiations with opposition parties, the
government has agreed to public hearings on the bill.  Tentative dates
for the public hearings are set for December 18-21/95 and the last two
(2) weeks in January 1996.  Third and final reading of the bill is
scheduled for January 29, 1996.

AOHC will participate in the public hearings and its submission will
deal primarily with proposed amendments to Acts affecting the health
system and health services. Among the common themes that are of grave
concern to AOHC are proposed amendments which would take away checks and
balances on the powers and authority of the Health Minister, lack of
built in appeal mechanisms on these powers, negation of the authority
and autonomy of duly incorporated volunteer boards,  unprecendented
government access to personal information coupled with restrictions on
public access to information, erosion of accountability to the public
and deletion of protection for Canadian non-profit organizations
combined with increased potential for preferential treatment for
specific persons or entity.

Of particular concern to AOHC is the severely limited time available to
undertake a thorough review of the full implications of the proposed
amendments.  AOHC is concerned with the unprecendented number of
amendments in a single bill which has as its primary focus fiscal
savings.  In AOHC's opinion, this opens up a strong possibility that the
amendments related to the health system and health services will be
passed into law outside of the spirit of the specific Health Acts.  AOHC
is on the list for deputations to the Standing Committee of Finances and
Economic Development on Monday, December 18, 1995.

TEACHING CHCs by Liz Feltes, Executive Director, South Riverdale CHC

The City of Toronto Department of Public Health is a "Teaching Health
Unit".  That is to say it is committed to taking on a specified number
of medical and other students each year.  For this it receives a small
remuneration per student annually, as well as funding for a staff member
to manage the teaching program. The South East Toronto project (SETO) is
made up of hospitals, university, public health, community agency and
CHC partners.  It's not surprising that some of these partners started
to consider the potential application of the Health Unit model to CHCs.

Neither of SETO's CHC partners, namely Regent Park and South Riverdale,
takes students with absolute regularity, but both anticipate doing so
when they occupy their new buildings (deo volente).  However, we knew
that several CHCs did work steadily with students, and we set up a
consultation meeting so that we and others could consider and learn from
their experience.  This meeting took place on October 11, 1995.

The objectives of the day-long meeting were: 1.	To explore the
development of a primary health care curriculum for family physicians
and other health professionals to be offered by community health
centres; 2.	To learn from and build upon the experience of three
community health centres actively involved in providing academic
instruction; and 3.	To establish one or more working groups to
develop specific action proposals for Southeast Toronto and, if
appropriate, elsewhere.

The event was well attended, with much lively participation - so much so
that we did not meet our third objective, and we never really had time
to explore issues for students who were not family physicians. Dr.
Geordie Fallis gave an overview of the experience of Flemingdon CHC,
which has taken on students since it started as an HSO with strong
connections to Sunnybrook Hospital.  Dr. Frances Kilbertus spoke for
Sandy Hill CHC, emphasizing some of the administrative and logistical
considerations.  Drs. Cathy Risdon and Gina Ogilvie, both of whom had
trained at North Hamilton CHC, presented the model used there and
explained the thinking that has gone into developing the curriculum. 
The speakers warned about the work involved in taking on student
education but were clearly enthusiastic about its value to themselves,
their centres and CHCs generally.

A panel of six people familiar with CHCs then commented on what had been
presented. Most were as supportive of "Teaching CHCs" as the preceding
speakers, but there were some warnings, about ensuring a focus on
multi-disciplinary teams by educating all sorts of health professionals,
about clarifying the role of the family physician within the
multi-disciplinary teams, and about including population health and the
determinants of health in the curriculum.  Sonny Arrojado, from the
AOHC, took a more strategic position, warning CHCs that, with cuts
threatening the CHC way of delivering service, pushing us back towards
the curative mode and forcing us to fight for an emphasis on the
determinants of health, we should beware of dissipating our energies by
working on medical education at this point in time.

Those of us who stayed for afternoon working groups continued to clarify
and discuss what we had absorbed in the morning sessions.  On the whole
we remained excited by the possibilities inherent in the Teaching CHC
concept, even when we had worked through the advantages and
disadvantages.

What follows are excerpts from the material presented in the first part
of the meeting, to give a flavour of the issues.  Full copies of the
overheads and notes were sent out to each CHC participating in the
consultation meeting.  Other CHCs who would like to receive this
material may obtain it by calling South Riverdale Community Health
Centre at (416) 463-6794 and leaving a message with Ruth Gibson or
Marian Burley.

•  Flemingdon CHC: "A Teaching Community Health Centre has a dual
mission of education and service, with a mix that overall favours the
service mission.  The Teaching Community Health Centre represents a new
model of education and training that not only provides a new site for
ambulatory health professional education and training, but adds unique
features as an educational institution:  Community Health Care as well
as Primary Health Care, Consumers in charge vs. professionals, urban and
rural sites sites, culturally sensitive care, prevention as well as
treatment, and more."

• North Hamilton CHC: "Curriculum Goals: -	Develop the requisite
skills to become a clinician grounded in the principles of population
health (Population Health and Primary Care) -	Develop a clinician
fluent in the influence and impact of broad determinants of health on a
population (Broad Determinants of Health) -	Develop a practitioner
who has an understanding of his/her own personal attitudes, assumptions
and beliefs, aware of dynamics of a clinical interaction and conscious
of the assumptions of a professional culture (Clinical Reflections)"

• Sandy Hill CHC: "Administrative Pearls' from the co-ordinator:
-	teaching is costly -	usually uses highest paid staff -	use of
reception, administration, nursing time -	orientation is costly But
... -	the longer the student placement, the less costly -	the more
clients the learner sees, the less costly -	recognition as "Teaching
CHC" increases requests for placements from all disciplines
-	participation in education viewed as desirable"

NAME="work"></A>****************************************************************

AOHC Submits Position Paper on Workfare

After a thorough review of the literature available on the subject,  the
Association of Ontario Health Centres submitted its position paper on
"Workfare" to Premier Mike Harris on December 13, 1995.  AOHC also
forwarded copies of the paper to Health Minister Jim Wilson, Minister of
Community & Social Services Minister David Tsubouchi, Liberal Health
Critic Elinor Caplan and NDP Health Critic Floyd Laughren.

In its covering letter, AOHC noted that the development of the position
paper was "one of the most difficult we have embarked upon not only
because of the complexity of the issue but also because of workfare's
impact on those who already bear a higher burden of illness.  Underlying
the AOHC submission is its belief in promoting good health in Ontario
based on the following World Health Organization definition of health:

"Health is the extent to which an individual or group is able, on one
hand, to realize aspirations and satisfy needs; and, on the other hand,
to change or cope with the environment.  Health is therefore seen as a
resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a
positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
physical capacity."

As such, AOHC believes that health is determined by factors such as
education, employment and access to sustainable income.  Clients of AOHC
member centres are people who normally bear a higher burden of risk for
ill health due to their living conditions. At the June 1995, AOHC Annual
General Meeting, health centre representatives who were concerned about
the potential effects of "workfare" on the already precarious health
status of some of their clients, passed a resolution opposing "workfare"
and called for AOHC to publicly communicate such a position.

Ontario's Progressive Conservative government was elected on a mandate
of welfare reform.  Since taking office, it has clearly indicated its
intent to implement workfare. In anticipation of significant welfare
reform in Ontario and to ensure that any formal position taken by AOHC
is well researched, AOHC undertook an extensive review of recent
literature on workfare and other measures aimed at supporting the
transition from welfare to work in Canada as well as in the United
States. The bulk of literature available suggests that initiatives
identified as "workfare" in other jurisdictions have not been 
successful in most instances.

In Ontario, the scope and components of the proposed "workfare" program
has not yet been fully defined. As such, the AOHC paper did not deal
with the merits of a defined workfare program rather it attempted to
provide a context and discuss factors which could affect the impact of
work initiatives on the health status of affected individuals, families
and communities.  Current economic realities have created undue
pressures on funding levels at both the national and provincial level. 
These financial constraints have resulted in the widespread questioning
of the merits of the welfare state in context with the increased costs
and its relative value to society.  Various levels of government in
North America have attempted to decrease welfare costs  through
initiatives such as "workfare". There appears to be four (4) main
arguments which have been presented in support of this particular
initiative:  to influence welfare beneficiaries, to address budgetary
constraints; to respond to the demands of voters and to improve the
supply of labour. In Canada, several provinces have implemented some
form of "workfare" primarily to address budgetary constraints with
inconclusive results to date.

In its submission, AOHC raised grave concerns that, in the pursuit of
changing the behaviour of welfare recipients, addressing budgetary
constraints and responding to voter demands, no apparent consideration
is given to the deterioration of the health status of those negatively
affected.  AOHC member centres have already reported a number of
instances where the health of clients is in jeopardy due to significant
reductions in benefit levels affecting adequate living conditions such
as nutrition and housing.

As such, and, in consideration of the position of the new Progressive
Conservative government on the matter of "workfare", AOHC was of the
opinion that the most productive contribution it could make to the issue
was to identify factors that could reduce risks to the health of welfare
beneficiaries involved in "workfare" as noted in the following
recommendations:

1.	The AOHC recommends that the provincial government consider the
broad determinants of  health as the context for the reform of Ontario's
welfare system.

2.  	The AOHC recommends that the provincial government acknowledge
the value of the integration of health and community/social services in 
addressing individual, family and community needs in areas of employment
training/retraining and appropriate social supports.

3.	The AOHC recommends that the provincial government assist in the
provision of support services that would address the particular needs of
 individuals facing greater barriers to returning to the work force. 
These individuals include:

- young adults - women with children who are less than 6 yrs. of age -
the disabled - the permanently unemployable.

4.   	The AOHC strongly recommends that the reform of Ontario's
welfare system be implemented on a careful incremental basis, with
provisions for adequate and appropriate resources, through the use of
pilot sites at community based agencies and organizations such as
community health centres (CHCs) .

AOHC Presents at International CHC Conference

The first International Conference of Community Health Centres held in
Montreal on December 3-6 attracted hundreds of participants from 35
countries in five (5) continents to participate in an impressive array
of workshops, presentations and plenaries.  Among the presenters were
several representatives from AOHC member centres.  AOHC staff presented
at three (3) well-received workshops, and participated in a poster
session at which AOHC posters, videos and community health information
were in great demand.

Executive Director Sonny Arrojado represented AOHC at a session entitled
"Associative Structures" a somewhat innocuous title relative to the
amount of information presented from the representatives of four (4)
organizations.  Session participants included Jim Couch, President Elect
of the National Association of Community Health Centres (U.S.A.),
Shirley Schultz, President, Australian Community Health Association, 
and Maurice Payette, Vice President, Federation des CLSCs du Quebec. 
Presentations included. the respective associations' history, mission,
activities, membership profile.  The session provided an excellent
opportunity for the various associations to compare the state of
community health services in their respective jurisdictions.

S. Arrojado, along with AOHC Community & Centre Development Program
Coordinator JoAnne Doyle and Saskatoon Community Health Services
Association Administrator Patrick Lapointe, were presenters/facilitators
at a workshop entitled "The Joys and Tribulations of Reform in Action:
CHCs in Canada".  The interactive workshop included an overview of the
Canadian health care system, an identification of the forces driving and
hindering the health reform process as well as a brief summary of health
reform activity in several provinces was provided in context with
CHC-specific issues.  In addition, highlights on how CHCs have
influenced their respective province's health reform initiatives to date
as well events leading up to the recent formation of the Canadian
Alliance of Community Health Centre Associations (CACHCA) were also
added as a contextual framework to the discussion. The workshop also
featured small discussion groups which gave workshop participants the
opportunity to add their perspectives on how CHCs can ensure a
constructive and productive role in Canada's health reform process.

S. Arrojado, J. Doyle along with AOHC Board Member Rosana Pellizzari
also presented a workshop entitled "Community Health Centres - What's in
a Name?"  The session was aimed at adding to the current debate on the
use of the term "community health centre" and its implications.  Small
group discussions centred around the use of the term CHC by 
organizations that do not espouse or adhere to the criteria used by CHC
organizations affiliated with CACHCA.   Discussions revealed a wide
variance among the over 260 Canadian CHCs in the criteria used to define
a CHC.  On the other hand, discussions also revealed some sharing of
values,beliefs and principles.

AOHC Development Officer Erin Patenaude womanned the AOHC poster booth
which was a popular site at the poster session and display area.  AOHC
posters and videos on recent public education campaign on the
determinants of health, the AOHC Green Book of health promotion
programs, and other informational items were purchased and ordered by
CHC representatives from Australia, France, the United States and
Canada.  Many remarked that the material was very valuable, and
commended the AOHC for the development of important tools for community
health.

Government Announces Ontario Drug Benefit Plan Changes

Starting on June 1, 1996, the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan for senior
citizens and social assistance recipients will change.  The Ministry of
Health has released the following rules which will take effect at that
time:

For low-income seniors:  Single senior citizens earning less than
$16,000 a year will now pay $2 for every prescription filled.  Senior
couples earning less than $24,000 per year will now pay $2 for each
prescription filled.

For social assistance recipients:  Individuals receiving General Welfare
or Family Benefits will pay $2 for every prescription filled.

For long-term care residents & Home Care recipients:  People who receive
Home Care, or who live in a nursing home or home for the aged will pay
only the $2 co-payment each time they fill a prescription.

For all other seniors:  Single seniors, with incomes over $16,000 (and
couples with incomes over $24,000) will pay the first $100 in
prescription costs each year per person.  Thereafter, they will pay up
to the maximum $6.11 dispensing fee on all other prescriptions filled in
the year.

According to the Ministry, these changes are being made to protect the
drug plan for the future and to allow the government to provide coverage
for new drugs that come on the market.  Savings to the government are
estimated at approximately $225 million annually.  Those interested in
learning more about these changes may phone the Ministry's INFOline at
1-800-268-1154 (in Toronto: 325-5518).

Subject: Operation "Downsize"

Seasons Greetings ... The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen
have elected to take the early retirement package has triggered a good
deal of concern about whether they will be replaced, and about other
restructuring decisions at the North Pole.

Streamlining was appropriate in view of the reality that the North Pole
no longer dominates the season's gift distribution business.  Home
shopping channels and mail order catalogues have diminished Santa's
market share and he could not sit idly by and permit further erosion of
the profit picture.

The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase of a late
model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip.  Improved productivity
from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at the Harvard Business School, is
anticipated and should take up the slack with no discernible loss of
service.  Reduction in reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental
emissions for which the North Pole has been cited and received
unfavourable press.

I am pleased to inform you and yours that Rudolph's role will not be
disturbed. Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole. 
Management denies, in the strongest possible language, the earlier leak
that Rudolph's nose got that way not from the cold, but from substance
abuse.  Calling Rudolph "a lush who was into the sauce and never did
pull his share of the load" was an unfortunate comment, made by one of
Santa's helpers and taken out of context at a time of year when he is
known to be under executive stress.

As a further restructuring, today's global challenges require the North
Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive steps.  Effective
immediately, the following economy  measures are to take place in the
"Twelve Days of Christmas" subsidiary:

The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned out to be
the cash crop forecasted.  It will be replaced by a plastic hanging
plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance.

The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost
effective.  In addition, their romance during working hours could not be
condoned.  The positions are therefore eliminated.

The three French hens will remain intact.  (After all, everyone loves
the French.) The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice
mail system, with a call waiting option.  An analysis is underway to
determine who the birds have been calling, how often, and how long they
talked.

The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors. 
Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative
implications for institutional investors.  Diversification into other
precious metals as well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks
appear to be in order.

The six geese a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer be
afforded.  It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per
goose per day is an example of the decline in productivity.  Three geese
will be let go, and an upgrading in the selection procedure by personnel
will assure management that from now on every goose it gets will be a
good one.

The seven swans a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times.
 The function is primarily decorative.  Mechanical swans are on order. 
The current swans will be retrained to learn new strokes and therefore
enhance their outplacement.

As you know, the eight maids a-milking concept has been under heavy
scrutiny by the EEOC.  A male/female balance in the workforce is being
sought.  The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no
upward mobility.  Automation of the process may permit the maids to try
a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching.

Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number.  This function will
be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the
steps.

Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill.  The high cost of Lords plus the
expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation Committee
to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen.  While
leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant
because we expect an oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year.

Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple case of
the band getting too big.  A substitution with a string quartet, a
cutback on new music and no uniforms will produce savings which will
drop right down to the bottom line.

We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl, animals
and other expenses.  Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching
deliveries over twelve days is inefficient.  If we can drop ship in one
day, service levels will be improved.

Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney's association seeking
expansion to include the legal profession ("thirteen lawyers a-suing")
action is pending.

Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be necessary
in the future to stay competitive.  Should that happen, the Board will
request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division to see if seven
dwarfs is the right number.

Ontario Health Providers Alliance Conducts Successful Retreat

Active participation of the key representatives of the Ontario Health
Providers Alliance (OHPA) member organizations resulted in a
successful second annual Alliance retreat held on July 18 & 19th. 
Organizations who participated were the: Association of Local
Official Health Agencies, Association of Ontario Health Centres,
Canadian Red Cross - Ontario Division, Ontario Ambulance Operators
Association, Ontario Association for Non-Profit Homes and Services
For Seniors, Ontario Association of Medical Laboratories, Ontario
Community Support Association, Ontario Federation of Community Mental
Health and Addictions Programs, Ontario Home Care Programs
Association, Ontario Home Health Care Providers Association, Ontario
Home Respiratory Services Association, Ontario Hospital Association,
Ontario Medical Association, Ontario Nursing Home Association, Saint
Elizabeth Health Care, Victorian Order of Nurses - Ontario.

Twenty five (5) representatives representing organizations which
spanned across the health sector worked for a day and a half to
identify areas wherein a common position can be developed on several
key issues.  AOHC was represented by AOHC President Dennise Albrecht
and AOHC Executive Director Sonny Arrojado.  Consensus was achieved
on seventeen (17) key points which. generally, come under these
headings: ALLOCATION/FUNDING, "RIGHT SIZING" THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH,
PLANNING/INNOVATION, CHANGE PROCESS/ROLE OF THE ALLIANCE.  AOHC
participated in the Alliance sub-group delegated with the task of
developing the points of consensus into position statements and
recommendations for government.  The draft statements and
recommendations will be dealt with at the next full meeting of the
Ontario Health Providers Alliance.

AOHC Hosts Health Reform Coalition "Think Tank"

On August 17th, the Association of Ontario Health Centres (AOHC)
hosted the Health Reform Coalition (HRC) "Think Tank".  The forum was
held to provide an opportunity for Coalition member organizations to
discuss possible opportunities for promoting the "shift to community
services" in the context of the new Ontario government.

Fourteen (14) representatives from HRC member organizations
participated in the half day forum to explore various ways of working
with the government to  ensure that health reform takes place in
Ontario.  Participants expressed concern that, to date, the shift to
community-based services has not significantly progressed beyond
rhetoric.  There was also concern that the government's stated
commitment to maintain current levels of funding may mean that the
acute care such as physician fees, hospitals, drug benefits, etc.
will continue to be allocated over 80% of 17 Billion plus budget for
health.

The Coalition had previously developed a position paper which
identified key elements that should guide the health reform process.
These elements were grouped under the headings of community,
planning, resource allocation, labour adjustment, volunteerism, and
accountability.  Think Tank" participants reviewed the HRC Paper in
light of the Progressive Conservative Party documents "Common Sense
Revolution" (CSR) and the "Bringing Common Sense to Health Care"
(BCSHC).

Participants discovered areas of commonality among the documents.  Of
particular interest among the goals identified in the BCSHC document
was one which stated: "To distribute funds within the health care
system more effectively and efficiently, funding an increased number
of community-based health care services to meet the priority needs of
consumers."  After a lively exchange of opinions and perspectives,
there was consensus that there were several areas wherein the goals
of the Health Reform Coalition were complementary to those identified
in the P.C. documents.  An HRC Work Group was delegated to work on a
draft HRC position document which will be circulated for validation
to HRC member organizations.  Once finalized, the position paper will
be submitted to the government for consideration.

Alert - CFC  Phase-Out

In Canada, consumption (production, import and export) of virgin
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) will be eliminated as of January 1, 1996. 
Canada's Ozone Depleting Substances Regulations require that the
above deadline be met. The phase-out of CFCs will affect users of air
conditioning systems, refrigeration systems, and mobile refrigeration
systems through increased refrigerant costs, and anticipated
shortages of CFC refrigerants. To assist users of CFC refrigerants to
phase out ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), Environment Canada -
Ontario Region is offering the following programmes:

•	a series of fact sheets for users of CFC refrigerants; •	a
quarterly ODS bulletin, containing case studies which demonstrate
proven methods of ODS management; and •	an ODS Alternatives Trade
Show, featuring suppliers of alternative substances, technologies and
equipment to conserve, convert or replace current equipment or
processes involving ODS.

These programmes are part of Environment Canada's ODS Pollution
Prevention Project. The project offers to users of CFCs, halons and
other ozone-depleting substances the opportunity to determine how
they can best reduce and eliminate their consumption of these
substances according to federal and provincial regulations. Users of
air conditioning, refrigeration and fire protection systems, as well
as solvent and sterilant users will find this project pertinent. 
Further information on the above programmes may be obtained by
contacting Katharine Gebhardt, c/o Environment Canada - Ontario
Region, 25 St. Clair Avenue East, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M4T

CHCs Open New Doors to the Community

Tweed & District CHC

The Grand Opening for Tweed & District Community Health Centre and
Senior Services was held August 11, 1995.  The official opening of
the 10,000-square foot complex was the realization of a community
dream that began more than 5 years ago.  After the ribbon-cutting
ceremony led by the newly elected Hastings-Peterborough MPP Harry
Danford, Board Chairperson Jack McMurray, other board members and
Executive Director Jeanne Goodhand led guests, community members and
CHC staff through the centre's doorway symbolizing the opening of the
new centre to the community.  The centre's automatic doors,
generously donated by the Kinsmen and Kinette clubs, increased the
centre's accessibility to elderly and disabled clients.

Premier Mike Harris sent greetings indicating regret that his busy
schedule did not allow him to personally attend the Centre's opening.
 MPP Harry Danforth congratulated the community on their hard work
and accomplishment noting that the facility will provide the much
needed service to the residents of Tweed and the surrounding area. 
In congratulating the community on the CHC's opening, AOHC Executive
Director Sonny Arrojado said   "The CHC program had indeed come full
circle since its inception in the early 1980's under the last
Conservative government and we look forward to their continuing
support."

The CHC has forged solid partnerships with local community agencies,
groups and businesses.  As a token of their appreciation for the
centre, ARS Vital Aire donated a flowering crab tree that will be
planted on the front lawn.  A unique and significant community
contribution to the new structure was made by 775 local school
children who participated in the painting of a  21' wall mural in the
waiting area of the CHC.  The painting of the mural which depicted
various landmarks in the Tweed area and the concept of a healthy
community was coordinated by local artist Debra Tate-Sears.  A wall
plaque commemorating the children's contribution reads:

Project Kids Paint "The Road to Well-Being" May 4 - May 19, 1995

This wall was painted by 775 very talented Tweed children from St.
Carthragh's, S.H. Connor and Tweed-Hungerford schools under the
direction of 31 local high school students and local artist Debra
Tate-Sears.

This project demonstrates the spirit of community cooperation which
is necessary for the achievement of a truly healthy community.

Women's Health In Women's Hands

After some trial and tribulation, Women's Health In Women's Hands
Community Health Centre finally succeeded in locating a permanent
site for their centre.  In celebration, a series of activities took
place at an all-day Open House on Friday June 23, 1995.  Clients,
client's families, children and guests were on hand to join in the
centre's celebration.  With balloons and refreshments, centre board
members and staff provided periodic tours of the centre's facilities
at Suite 500, 2 Carlton Street, Toronto.  The newly renovated suite
has a unique circular design which facilitates traffic flow. Of
particular interest was a mini play area for kids and a spacious
multi-purpose outdoor deck facility.

The day's events included an annual general meeting which featured
opening remarks by Sunera Thobani, President, National Action
Committee on the Status of Women.  In addition, there was
"herstory-telling" which provided a historical perspective of the
centre  and honoured the women who were key in the centre's
development.  The celebrations concluded with a buffet dinner
followed by a community dance.

"Salutogenesis": Studying Why People Stay Healthy

If everyone is exposed to illness and trauma in their lives, why
doesn't everyone become a patient?  What are the hidden factors that
seem to affect different people's reactions to the same external
misfortune?  These are the questions that were posed at the recent
AOHC conference by Aija Pavelson, Coordinator of Program Development,
Physiotherapy Services at North Hamilton CHC.  Her talk, entitled
"Salutogenic Model of Health", presented the results of a literature
search and a pilot project which she conducted on the topic at
Dofasco, Canada's largest steel plant.

Ms. Pavelson explained that in her thirty years as a physiotherapist,
she has often noticed differences between people coming in with the
same problem, and suspected a correlation between a person's attitude
to an injury and his or her rate of recovery.  The people who view
their injuries as a temporary setback and seek solutions to their
problems often tend to recover in a reasonable period of time,
without medical intervention, and carry on with their lives and their
jobs.  Others with the same injury, who regard it as a terrible
misfortune and focus on their suffering, are often the ones who end
up being off work for longer periods of time. If the injuries are
similar, why does this happen?  Why does one injured person respond
well to treatment and recover quickly, while another with the same
injury becomes disabled for a significant length of time?

Antonovsky & Salutogenesis

Ms. Pavelson's search for answers led her to the work of Aaron
Antonovsky, a professor of medical anthropology and sociology in the
U.S.A. and Israel who published many books and articles in the last
twenty years on what he coined the "salutogenic" model of health.  As
opposed to pathogenesis, which studies the causes of disease,
salutogenesis seeks to know why people stay healthy.  In Ms.
Pavelson's opinion, it is really a study of the determinants of
health.

Antonovsky was certainly not the first to underline the correlation
between mind and body in maintaining health.  Hippocrates himself
described health as a harmonious balance between mind, body and
environment, and others throughout the centuries have also
acknowledged the importance of one's inner psychological state in
ensuring wellness.  However, the more common viewpoint for many
hundreds of years has been that popularized by Rene Descartes, that
the mind and body are separate entities, containing many separate
parts, that are best treated by specialists of one or the other.

Sense of Coherence

Antonovsky's work suggests that it may in fact be possible to
measure, or at least to predict, the influence of mental or
psychological factors on health.  He proposed that health could be
viewed in the context of an "ease / disease" continuum, and further
suggested that the location of a person's status on this continuum is
largely dependent on that person's health-promoting personality
factors.  These health-promoting variables are derived from what
Antonovsky called a person's "sense of coherence".  As he put it,
"Sense of coherence refers to a unique set of personality variables
which stem from internal and external cultural, social, and personal
resources that contribute to health and the psychological well-being
of an individual.  It can be referred to as a "global orientation to
life."  It is a learned process, something that is accumulated
through an experiential process throughout life.

There are 3 main components identified by Antonovsky to be
instrumental in this orientation to life:  1) comprehension, the
perception that life makes sense;  2) manageability, the knowledge
that resources for coping with life are adequate;  and 3)
meaningfulness, the belief that there is a good reason for living. 
He hypothesizes that sense of coherence has a direct relationship to
a person's well-being.  A person with a high sense of coherence, when
confronted with tension, stress, or any kind of psychological or
physical problem, will see it more as a challenge and look for
solutions.  This approach engages the person's "general resistance
resources", drawn in part from his/her cultural and social support
and belief systems.  This person has health-enhancing behaviours
which lessen tension & stress and is thought to lead to a stronger
immunity to illness.  Another person who regards the same misfortune
as a real tragedy would have low general resistance resources,
possibly due to the lack of a good support system, and would more
likely resort to maladaptive behaviour such as substance abuse, anger
or violence.  This increases stress, making the person with a low
sense of coherence more susceptible to stress-related disease.

Lower Back Pain Study

The results of Ms. Pavelson's research at Dofasco supports this
hypothesis.  Using a group of workers with lower back pain and a
questionnaire that Antonovsky developed to measure a person's sense
of coherence, she hypothesized that those workers who are able to
cope with the injury have a higher sense of coherence than those who
don't.  She separated the workers into two groups based solely on the
amount of time lost due to the injury, and asked each group to
complete the questionnaire.  Her results show that the two groups
were very significantly different in their sense of coherence scores,
particularly with respect to the comprehension component.

While admitting that hers was a small and retrospective study, Ms.
Pavelson nevertheless regards salutogenesis as a significant new
perspective for examining health and disease, one which has the
potential to change the way injuries and illnesses are treated.  As
she explained at her presentation, "Health care as a whole seems to
reflect our cultural values of materialism and worship of technology.
 Today society by and large believes that modern-day medicine can
cure all ills, that external solutions can solve internal problems,
that health promotion will eliminate disease, that death is the enemy
to be conquered at all costs.  Medical services, whether provided by
physician, physiotherapist, nurse or other health professional are
still largely procedure-oriented."  There is a growing body of
evidence, however, that even such seemingly mechanically-oriented
disciplines as physiotherapy would benefit from a broader approach
that considers the whole person, not just the specific injury.  As
Pavelson's study and the works of Antonovsky and others seems to
indicate, a person's sense of coherence may well be a significant
determinant of health.

Health Care Implications

To Aija Pavelson, these ideas have broader implications for the
future of health care itself.  "Our present health care system is
being challenged for its very survival today.  As Albert Einstein
said, ‘The problems of today cannot be solved by the kind of thinking
that created them.'  Perhaps a different perspective, such as the
salutogenic model of health, needs further examining in its
application and modification to the existing system."  The
application of the sense of coherence concepts in health care could,
she suggests, decrease health care costs, the utilization of the
medical system, and iatrogenesis.  It could also indicate the need
for a new approach in client assessments, where those providing
health services are addressing issues of total health rather than
just attempting to "fix parts".

AOHC Opens Lines & Linkages

With the many changes in various levels of government, AOHC has been
busy this summer with opening lines of communications and linkages
with, among others, the offices of Premier Mike Harris and Health
Mnister Jim Wilson.  In a collaborative approach, AOHC and OPHA met
and agreed to request for a joint meeting with new Health Minister. 
It is expected that this meeting will take place sometime in
September. In the meantime, AOHC Executive DIrector Sonny Arrojado
and Policy Analyst Jewelle Smith had a meeting with Perry Martin,
Executive Assistant to the Health Minister to discuss areas of mutual
interest and concern.  On August 14, 1995, S. Arrojado and Sandra
Margerrison, E.D., Planned Parenthood Toronto - The House met with
Dennise Cole, Community Liaison in Premier Harris' office to discuss
various areas such as community health, AOHC, CHCs, etc. as these
relate to the "Common Sense Revolution" document.  Both meetings were
positive and productive in terms of accessibility and receptiveness
to ideas.

Community Health Week '95: Coming Right Up

Ontario's second annual Community Health Week (CHW) is just around
the corner. Scheduled to take place from Friday, September 29 to
Friday, October 6, CHW is a yearly public awareness campaign
sponsored by the Association of Ontario Health Centres.  CHW is all
about shifting the focus and promotion of health back to the
community, and making the variety of choices better known to the
health consumer.

Across the province, CHCs will hold open houses, health displays and
other events to raise the level of public awareness of community
health and  determinants of ill health.  Ottawa-area CHCs have
already obtained regional approval to have Sept. 29 — Oct. 6
proclaimed as "Community Health Week". In collaboration with a
variety of community partners which includes CRCs, DHCs and the
Health Department, the CHCs will identify and present certificates to
special volunteers who have contributed significantly to the
community in the context of health determinants, such as employment,
housing, environment and education.  Peter Clark, Regional Chair,
will make the presentations at a special lunch time event launching
CHW in the Ottawa region.

From a provincial perspective, AOHC will sponsor a Community Health
Fair on the lawn at Queen's Park in Toronto.  The fair will take
place on Monday, October 2 from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (pending
final approval to use the grounds), and will once again offer a
wealth of community health information to the lunch time crowd of
passers-by, politicians and members of the media.

This year's theme, "Taking Back Our Health", was adopted to be
consistent with the theme of the 2nd National Conference of Community
Health Centres "Taking Back Our Health: CHCs in Canada".  The
conference will start on Thursday, October 5 and end on Saturday,
October 7, 1995.  All AOHC member centres are encouraged to  have the
week proclaimed officially in their own city or county and organize
local CHW events.  AOHC will compile a list of all CHW events across
the province and have the list available on request.  All community
groups in the Toronto area interested in reserving a table at the
October 2nd Community Health Fair at Queen's Park, please call Frank
Herr at the AOHC office, (416) 236-2539.

Radcliffe Receives Award

This spring, Shanthi Radcliffe, Executive Director of the London

Biggest Ever AOHC Conference Gets Rave Reviews

Health Minister Announces New CHC Funding

Over 600 enthusiastic registrants converged on Ottawa's Citadel Inn
from June 2nd to the 4th to participate in the AOHC's biggest ever
Annual Conference, "Challenging the Rhetoric - from Words to Action". 
This was the 12th year of the conference, and once again the event
brought together a wide range of participants from the health and
social services fields.

Hats Off!

If the evaluation forms returned at the end of the conference are any
indication, the many workshops were very well received.  A wide range
of issues and topics were presented by experts from the community, and
several workshops featured panels and participatory formats. 
Evaluations were full of such phrases as "Excellent!" "Hats off to the
presenters" "Very dynamic" "Do it again!" "Should have been longer" and
"Gave me new information" (as well as the usual critical remarks about
room size or air quality).

In addition to providing numerous opportunities to obtain and share
information at workshops and networking sessions, the conference also
featured several keynote speakers, including federal Minister of Health
Diane Marleau, Ontario Health Minister Ruth Grier, Ontario Treasurer
Floyd Laughren, and author and political activist Maude Barlow.

New CHC Funding Announced

The guest speakers added provincial, national and global perspectives
to the proceedings.  All had words of support and encouragement for the
work that Community Health Centres do in the community.  They also
acknowledged that CHCs are leading the way in the reform towards a
community-based health system.  Provincial Health Minister Ruth Grier
brought some good news in her speech.  She announced that, despite
major cutbacks in most other areas, four new CHCs are planned in the
1994/95 fiscal year and an additional $5 million has been allocated for
one-time funding for CHCs.  Further support for the CHC program will be
given in the form of special funds - $3.3 million this year and $6
million next year - to add new programmes and expand some existing
ones.  As the Minister put it, "Our spending shows that we are
committed to a health care system that relies not just on doctors and
hospitals - but on the full range of health services, including
midwives, nutritionists, nurse practitioners and many others."

Other Highlights

The three-day conference also featured visits to several Ottawa-area
CHCs (including the Grand Opening of the new home of the Sandy Hill
CHC), and a dinner and dance at the Tudor Inn, at which Health Minister
Ruth Grier presented the Second Annual AOHC Award to the 1994
recipient, Omer Deslauriers.  Once again volunteers played a key role
in ensuring that the conference portion involving registration,
information and sales of AOHC material was carried off without a hitch.
 A new and  exciting addition to the annual conference was the AOHC
MediaLink Booth.  As a component of AOHC's Media Liaison Project,
conference participants had a chance to hone their interview skills at
a special "Media Sweatshop", where practice interviews were videotaped
and handed to the interviewees along with helpful tips on how to work
with the media in getting their information to the public.

New AOHC Board

Elections for open Board positions were held at the AOHC's June 3
Annual General Meeting.  Following the AGM, the newly constituted board
held its first meeting during which the 1994/1995 AOHC Executive
Committee was elected.  The new Executive Committee memebrs are: 
President - Dennise Albrecht (Sandy Hill CHC, Ottawa); Vice President -
Charlotte Rosenbaum (North Kingston CHC); Past President - Rosana
Pellizzari  (Davenport Perth CHC, Toronto); Treasurer - Neil Evans
(Parkdale CHC, Toronto); Secretary- Hélène Gagné (CMSC, Toronto).  The
other AOHC board memebrs are: Fred Griffith (Group Health Centre, Sault
Ste. Marie); Sherryl Smith ( Somerset West CHC, Ottawa); Joel
Rosenbloom  West Central CHC, Toronto); Keith Bytheway (Longlac CHC);
and Linda Jones (South East Ottawa CHC).  The new Board will hold an
all-day retreat in September to review strategic directions, evaluate
board procedures and provide an orientation for new board members.

A Cause for Concern

A global view was brought to the AOHC Conference in a very
well-received, however sobering, end-of-conference speech by renowned
author and speaker Maude Barlow, National Chairperson of the Council of
Canadians.  Using a unique mixture of humour, fact, insight and
passion, Ms. Barlow painted a disturbing picture of the future of
health care in Canada and around the world if current trends are
allowed to continue.  Citing examples from other countries and
industries, she urged vigilance and action to prevent the destruction
of our health and social services by such threats as privatization,
free trade and the agenda of transnational corporations.

Ms. Barlow urged the audience to look behind the progress and growth of
the major companies in the world - many with economies larger than
those of entire countries - to see the loss of jobs, the exploitation
of cheap labour in developing countries, the growing competitiveness
and loss of security in workplace, and the erosion of universality in
our own country's social services.

She focused in particular on Canada's health care system, whose
principles are made vulnerable by the North American Free Trade
Agreement, paving the way for increased privatization and competition
from for-profit American businesses.  Stating, "We have an enormous
fight ahead of us if we wish to save our health care system in Canada,"
Ms. Barlow advocated "5 steps" to reversing the trends she spoke of:
identify the nature of the problem, create resistance and find
alternatives at the community level, join or create a common front,
create a strong vision of desired alternatives, and become politically
engaged.

CHC Physicians To Do Immigration Physicals

Department of Citizenship and Immigration Responds to AOHC Concerns

Prior to September 1993, newcomers to Canada requiring an immigration
medical examination could be seen at not extra cost at community health
centres (CHCs) where the physicians are salaried.  A 1993 change in the
federal government's immigration policy required that 'immigration
physicals' must now be done by a "Designated Medical Practitioner"
(DMP).  At the time of change only fee-for-service physicians were
included in the DMP list and they charges they levied patients ranged
from $85 - $95 per physical.

The Department of Citizenship and Immigration representatives indicated
several reasons for the change in policy. They cited evidence that DMPs
are more familiar with Canadian immigration medical requirements and
noted that, with the exception of Canada and the U.S.A., the use of
DMPs has been mandatory worldwide for many years.   With regards to the
charging of fees, the Citizenship & Immigration representatives noted
that service is now considered by the Ministry to be a "third party"
examination and as such is not chargeable to OHIP.

CHCs OVERLOOKED

When the new policy was first introduced, the list of DMPs was limited
and the criteria for being designated a DMP was unclear. In her letter
to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Sergio Marchi, AOHC
President Dennise Albrecht objected to the arbitrary and "secret"
selection criteria for DMPs, pointing out that several qualified CHC
physicians had applied and been rejected.  She also protested the new
policy's disregard for the fact that CHCs are ideally suited to address
the needs of priority populations such as potential new Canadians.

In the past, these medical examinations often served as a new
immigrant's first introduction to the health and community services
which, through the CHCs, acknowledged and addressed particular access
barriers experienced by the newcomer.

Meeting with C & I representatives

Since December 1993, AOHC advocated for a change in government policy
to accommodate the needs of those whose needs are best served by CHCs.
As a result of AOHC's representations to the Minister of Citizenship
and Immigration as well as various department representatives, Dr. Neil
Heywood, Medical Officer, Medical Standards, Citizenship and
Immigration met with AOHC Executive Director Sonny Arrojado to discuss
various options for addressing AOHC concerns. These discussions led to
an initial agreement to add three CHC physicians to the DMP list, one
each in Ottawa, Metro Toronto, and London. As a mutual learning
exercise, a workshop on the Interim Health Care program of the federal
government was conducted by Citizenship and Immigration representatives
at the 1994 AOHC conference.

The experience was helpful in providing government representatives a
better understanding of the quality of health services provided by
CHCs. Subsequent to the conference, AOHC was informed by the Department
of Citizenship and Immigration that other CHC physicians can now apply
for DMP consideration.

AOHC Urges Wider Scope in Mental Health Reform

In response to the Ministry of Health's request for input, the AOHC 
submitted a position paper on the Ministry document entitled "The
Implementation Vision" which outlines government plans for Mental
Health Reform.  While endorsing the general thrust of the vision, AOHC
had several concerns and recommendations for MHR Project Manager Lynne
Livingstone.

Noting that community mental health issues are a growing concern within
community health centres, where 10% to 50 % of clients have mental
health problems, the AOHC position paper called for a wider scope to
the reform that extends beyond its current focus on the psychiatric
care system.  "In order for the mental health system to be truly
reformed, there must be a greater emphasis on health promotion within
the context of people's lives in the community."

Among the recommendations put forth by the AOHC are the following:

Define the "priority population" by degree of function:  At present the
priority population is defined as "the severely mentally ill", which
relies on a medical diagnosis.  This impedes access to those who are in
high and continuous need of service but who are unwilling or unable to
obtain such a diagnosis.  Basing the definition on degree of function
creates a generic system that is less 'labeling' or threatening to
individuals in need.

Ensure that defined "community services" are those that espouse true
community values:  A reformed system is not merely a replication of
institutional programs relocated in the community, but also community
owned and driven.  It is a system that emphasizes health promotion and
illness prevention.  Services must be accessible, individualized and
needs-based, with a minimum of intervention in the least restrictive
environment.  They must promote wellness and improve quality of life,
and there must be meaningful involvement of consumers in governance,
planning, delivery, and evaluation of all aspects of the service.

Establish inter-ministerial collaboration:  The reform requires the
establishment of a functional and effective relationship between the
various provincial ministries to ensure that factors affecting mental
health are duly considered in policy setting and resource allocation.

Reflect consumer service needs in the human resource strategy:  Reform
must provide for appropriately trained mental health providers. 
Appropriate training programs must therefore be in place to ensure an
adequate supply of trained and qualified mental health providers.

Have a fiscal strategy in place:  The government has to develop a
defined fiscal strategy for mental health reform.  To ensure that the
"shift to community" in mental health services is made a reality,
specific transitional funds must be dedicated.

Link accountability to outcome:  Consumers must be key players in the
reform's planning and accountability structure.  Furthermore, the
accountability structure must be clearly linked to outcome measures and
ensure program monitoring of the shift from hospital to the community.

Acknowledge the role of community-based organizations:  The AOHC
position paper urged the Ministry of Health to formally acknowledge the
serious impact of the current mental health reform strategy on
community-based organizations' ability to provide appropriate services
to their communities.  It further urged the Ministry to actively
consult community-based organizations such as CHCs in subsequent stages
of the multi-year plan.

"Building Healthier Organizations" Project Gears Up

Excellence and quality are concepts that are usually easier to grasp
when applied to a specific job or product than to an entire company or
organization.  In the corporate world, much effort goes into bridging
the gap between the ideal and the actual performance of individual
workers and the organization as a whole.

In recent years, the market has been flooded with books, tapes, and
lectures by management gurus explaining the concepts and techniques of
"total quality management", "continuous improvement", "learning
organizations", "principle centred leadership", and other related
methods of bringing true quality to the workplace. But how do these
trends apply to community health centres?

During the past two years, AOHC's Quality Management Work Group has
been attempting to answer that very question.  A joint venture of the
AOHC and the Ministry of Health's Community Health Branch, this work
group has examined standards for CHCs and HSOs, total quality
management, and learning organization theory.  The work group concluded
that all three approaches to quality had merit, but that each had
significant limitations when applied to the needs of CHCs.

Based on the findings of the QM work group, the Community Health Branch
recently invited AOHC to participate in the development of a quality
program specifically for CHCs.  At the June 2nd AOHC board meeting, the
board accepted the Ministry's invitation to be a partner to the
Building Healthier Organizations Initiative.

This initiative will provide CHCs with "a basket of tools and
resources" that will assist them in achieving excellence.  Initial work
needs to be undertaken to provide the foundation for the full
initiative. The initial project will have three phases:

Research:

The first task will be to answer questions that help define the goals
of the project. The research phase will produce a report with answers
to these and other questions, as well as options for the design of the
CHC quality program.

Design:

During the design phase, the process and content of this
multi-component initiative will be developed.  An operational plan for
a pilot project will be developed, appropriate literature, tools and
strategies will be identified, and a short list of potential pilot
sites will be developed.

Pilot Projects:

Two CHCs will be selected to test the project initially. This phase
will include the development of a team within each of the the sites to
guide the pilot project. The AOHC QM Work Group will provide ongoing
consultation and support to each team. This will be followed by an
evaluation to determine the factors that contribute to and detract from
the success of the project and an identification of the next steps in
the initiative.

The initial project is a year long project expected to be completed in
September 1995.  At the end of this process, the work group plans to
give a presentation on the project at the national conference for the
CHC Network of Canada in October of 1995.  It is hoped that by raising
the profile of the initiative both provincially and nationally, the
work group will obtain a wider commitment from CHCs to the concept of
the healthy organization.

CHC National Network Submits Recommendations on National Health Forum

The CHC Network of Canada (CNOC), a national network of provincial CHC
organizations and groups recently wrote to federal Health Minister
Diane Marleau to provide recommendations on the dederal government's
plans to initiate a national forum on health.  CNOC's Steering
Committee has representation from eight provinces and one territory,
bringing together over 300 CHCs that provide health and social services
to an estimated 4 million Canadians.

With such a broad and growing base in various Canadian communities CNOC
is of the view that it is well positioned to provide recommedations on
the process developed for the 'national health forum'. The Steering
Committee wrote to Diane Marleau with the expectation that its
recommendations will help shape the upcoming forum in ways consistent
with the principles of health reform.  The Network recommends:

* That the fundamental principles of universality, portability,
reasonable accessibility, comprehensiveness and public administration,
as embodied in the Canada Health Act of 1984, provide the context for
the forum.

* That the health forum be used as a vehicle for educating the public
on the benefits and cost of the health system.  This would pave the way
for demystifying the issue of health reform in Canada.

* That the national forum be used as a tool for evaluating the role of
the federal government in Canada's health system and, in particular,
the role federal transfer payments play in provincial health and social
services.

* That the national health forum include a broad and inclusive
consultation process that would allow for consultation from members of
the general public as well as health professionals.

* That community based organizations such as CHCs be used as a resource
in identifying credible community leaders who could actively
participate in the consultation process related to the government's
national health forum.

CHC Nurse Practitioner and Doctor Featured in Medical Journal

From the photograph on the cover to the lengthy articles inside, the
South-East Ottawa Community Services CHC certainly enjoyed a high
profile in the July 1, 1994 issue of the Canadian Medical Association
Journal (Vol. 151, No. 1).  The attention focused specifically on the
partnership between the centre's physician, Daniel O. Way and nurse
practitioner, Linda M. Jones.

In an article exploring the relationship between the two professions,
the Journal describes the South-East Ottawa CHC as "a preview of what
may be in store as a result of health care reform: salaried physicians,
40-hour work weeks, on-call support 24 hours a day, a board of
directors from the community, fund-raising and, perhaps most notably,
nurse practitioners involved in primary care."

In another article, Way and Jones offer a model for collaboration
between a nurse practitioner and a family physician delivering primary
care services.  A third article offers editorial comments on the
collaboration as "the way of the future".

AOHC MediaLink Forges Ahead with Phase 2

Building on the successes of its first six months, the AOHC MediaLink
Project is continuing into the second phase which has two objectives:
a) publicly focusing AOHC role in the health reform/funding policy
debate b) provide a mechanism for AOHC member centres in gaining
appropriate knowledge and tools for their own use at the local level.
To accomplish its goals, MediaLink will, among other things:

* develop a list of AOHC/member centre spokespeople as designated media
contacts * conduct several "Media Camps" to provide training to member
centres in gaining media attention * provide immediate response to
issues that arise in the news, giving AOHC's position via letters to
the editor, op-ed pieces, etc. * develop and undertake a media strategy
to promote AOHC's first annual Community Health Week.

ADVISORY COUNCIL RECOMMENDS AGAINST INCORPORATION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS

The Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Council is recommending
against incorporation of physicians and other health professionals. 
The Advisory Council studied the issue at the request of the Minister
of Health.

Christie Jefferson, Chair of the Advisory Council, stated, "We have
concluded that the government should not proceed with permitting the
privilege of incorporation by any regulated health profession as this
would potentially be contrary to the public interest."

The Council noted that physician incorporation alone could cost the
public as much as $75 million per year.  The cost could be even greater
since fairness would require that all regulated health professions be
allowed to incorporate.

"There is a fundamental ethical question of permitting tax advantages
to some of the most advantaged members of society at a time of
constraint in spending, particularly in the area of health care, and
hardship for many in Ontario," Jefferson said.  The Advisory Council
found that health care professionals provide a public service and
should not be maximizing profit.

The government of Ontario had agreed in principle to allow physicians
to incorporate as part of the social contract agreement with the
Ontario Medical Association.  The agreement referred the proposed
legislative changes concerning incorporation of physicians, as well as
whether other regulated health professions should be permitted to
incorporate, to the Advisory Council, an arm's length body created by
the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, to advise the Minister of
Health in the public interest on the regulation of health professions
in Ontario.

The Advisory Council determined that, if incorporation were permitted,
the complexity of corporate structures and their regulation may make it
more difficult for the public to understand and to use health care
services, and to hold the professional and his/her corporation
accountable.  Some consumers who already feel vulnerable and experience
barriers to health care could be intimidated and further alienated.

The report raises concerns about the impact of incorporation on the
reform of the health care system itself.  Incorporation could entrench
the fee-for-service model, increase privatization, and create barriers
to multidisciplinary approaches and new health care delivery
strategies.

"Permitting incorporation of any health professional would be contrary
to the spirit of the new Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, which
requires the Minister of Health to ensure health professions are
regulated in the public interest," Jefferson concluded.

More Than Words

Communitarianism:

Communitarianism promotes the rights of both communities and
individuals through a process whereby the needs of both groups are
enhanced through mutual agreement that all decisions will seek to
ensure that what is beneficial for the individual will also be
beneficial for the community, and vice-versa.

Population Health:

Population can be defined as a group of people living in a defined
geographic area. Population Health refers to the health of the
population at large.  The health of the population is a consequence of
all that we do as a society - and thus a responsibility of society as a
whole, and of communities at the local level.  It is important to
consider the broad determinants of health when defining population
health.  (Source:  Toward a Population Health Promotion System, report
by the Population Health Promotion Working Group, May 1994)

NAME="dev"></A>****************************************************************

AOHC Expands CHC Development Program

In addition to the programs and services AOHC provides for its member
centres, a large portion of the Association's work is related to
helping communities develop community health centres (CHCs).

Developing a community health centre is both a simple and complex
process  It is simple because there is a defined process for soliciting
Ministry of Health funding approval.  However, it is complex because
the process is largely dependent upon the nature of each respective
community group wishing to have a community health centre in their
community.  The process usually starts with an expressed interest and
commitment from a group of individuals within the community. 
Subsequent to a process which includes, among others, a community needs
assessment, program development, proposal writing and submission.

In the past few years, AOHC's role in assisting community groups in the
development of new CHCs has increased significantly. The 1993 CHC
Program Strategic Planning and Evaluation Project findings and
recommendations further emphasized the need for AOHC to have an
expanded role in the CHC development process.  With additional funding
from the Ministry of Health, AOHC is now able to take on a key
strategic role in CHC development.

The program objectives are as follows:

1. To further develop the role of AOHC in assisting communities with
the identification of needs, the community development process, and the
development of proposals.

2. To establish a mechanism for a coordinated approach to raising
community awareness of the determinants of health by helping
communities develop CHCs.

3. To ensure an effective development process in the provision of
advice and support to newly developing CHCs with respect to governance
issues and community participation.

4. To provide a mechanism, through the development of a critical mass
of CHCs, that will help facilitate the development and implementation
of the provincial Community Health Strategy . The AOHC Community and
Centre Development Program is under the general guidance and direction
of the AOHC Centre Development and Education Committee. Under the
committee, an AOHC Profile Review Group assists in the development
process through an assessment of the "readiness" of the community and
community group. The front line work with communities is primarily done
by AOHC staff team which includes the Coordinator, Community and Centre
Development, and the Development Officers.

Front line work with the community groups includes telephone
assistance, meetings and site visits, etc.  The AOHC community
development team also provides important written, audio and video
resource material to inform and guide community members through the
initial planning stages.  As the community group progresses, the AOHC
community development team also works with the community in developing
the needs assessment plan, survey tools, data collection and analysis,
formulation of goals, proposal writing, and ongoing community
development.

While the Ministry's Community Health Centre Program initially called
for an increase in the number of CHCs in Ontario from 49 to 100 by
1997, it is not likely that this goal will be achieved in the current
climate of financial restraints and cutbacks.  Last year only three new
CHCs were approved, and only four have been promised for the current
year.  Nevertheless, Minister of Health Ruth Grier recently reiterated
her government's commitment to expanding the CHC Program, albeit at a
slower rate than previously forecast (see article on page 1).  At the
present time AOHC's community development team is working with
approximately 25 different community groups in Ontario that are at
various stages in the development process.

HEALTH MINISTER TABLES LONG-TERM CARE LEGISLATION

Bill 173 provides framework for multi-service agencies

Long-awaited legislation on long-term care reform was tabled on June 6
by Minister of Health Ruth Grier.  The Long-Term Care Act, Bill 173,
provides for the approval and regulation of agencies for the delivery
of a wide range of community services, to people in their homes and in
other community settings, as an alternative to institutional care.

The Bill also provides for the designation of approved agencies as
"multi-service agencies" for a specified geographic area, and gives
them the responsibility for ensuring the equitable provision of
specified community services to those who need them.  It is seen by the
government as a way to create a coordinated and integrated system or
care and support from "the current patchwork of community services
spread unevenly across the province."

The Act is intended to remove bureaucratic obstacles to care by
establishing equitable and uniform eligibility criteria across Ontario.
 It also creates a bill of rights, safeguards and appeals for users of
community services.

Under the Act, a person receiving community services will have the
right, among other things, to give or refuse consent to being provided
with any community service, to be treated with courtesy and respect, to
be free from mental and physical abuse, to have access to personal
records and to have those records kept confidential in accordance with
the law.

The legislation supports the four basic principles of an expanded
system that were developed during extensive public consultations:

* easier access to services; * integration of case management and
service delivery; * increased non-profit provision of services; and *
more consumer control.

According to Minister Grier, "Expanding long-term care services in the
community means more comfort and choice for consumers.  At the end of
the planning process a person will be able to call one number in their
community to access the entire long-term care system.  Ontarians will
finally get the care they need, when they need it, where they need it."

In related news, the Ontario government has expanded long-term care
placement coordination services (PCSs) to all parts of the province. 
According to the Health Minister this will make it easier for people to
find the nursing home or home for the aged of their choice anywhere in
the province.

The government provided more than $5 million to establish 13 new PCSs,
bringing the number to 36.  In total, the government is investing $12.6
million this year in the PCS network, which helps consumers and their
families find suitable accommodation when care is needed in nursing
homes or homes for the aged.

Under the Long-Term Care Statute Law Amendment Act, all such homes must
arrange their admissions through a PCS.  Once a PCS determines that a
person is eligible, it provides information about nursing homes and
homes for the aged in the area. The person can visit the homes before
deciding.  The PCS then sends the consumer's applications to the
facilities selected.  PCSs will eventually become part of multi-service
agencies.

Consent to Treatment

Earlier this year the Ontario government gave third reading to the
Consent to Treatment Act, legislation that stipulates the requirements
for obtaining proper consent for any treatment proposed by a health
practitioner.

According to the Act, four elements must be present for a person's
expressed or implied consent to be taken as valid:

1) the consent must relate to the treatment; 2) the consent must be
informed; 3) the consent must be given voluntarily; and 4) the consent
must not have been obtained through misrepresentation or fraud.

Consent is defined as "informed" if, before it is given, the health
practitioner responded to the person's requests and the person received
the information about the treatment, alternative courses of action, the
material effects, risks and side effects in each case and the
consequences of not having the treatment, "that a reasonable person in
the same circumstances would require in order to make a decision."

The Act also contains rules for cases where the person in question is
deemed to be incapable of making an informed decision about a proposed
treatment.  Such a person has the right to speak to a "rights advisor",
someone whose function is to explain the consequences and options of
having been deemed incapable of giving consent. The Act specifies which
persons can give or refuse consent on behalf of the individual deemed
incapable, and how to take into account any wishes with respect to
treatment that were made by the person while still capable.  The Act
also addresses concerns related to the necessity of emergency treatment
for someone deemed incapable when no substitute decision-maker is
present.

In comments submitted recently as part of the Ministry of Health's
consultation process regarding the Act, AOHC expressed its general
support for the intent of the Consent to Treatment Act.

AOHC Opposes Incorporation of Physicians

The Association of Ontario Health Centres has expressed its concerns
to the Ministry of Health about recent plans to allow Ontario doctors
to incorporate. According to provisions contained in the 1993 Interim
Agreement on Economic Arrangements between the Ontario Medical
Association and the Government of Ontario, the province "agrees in
principle to incorporation for physicians."  Advice on the amendments
necessary to provide physicians with the right to incorporate, and on
the rights of other health professions to incorporate, is to be
provided by the Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Council.  The
Council has invited input from interested parties on whether
incorporation of health professionals is in the public interest.

In a letter to Health Minister Ruth Grier, President Dennise Albrecht
expressed AOHC's serious concerns about the move to physician
incorporation, calling it "antithetical to the very principles
underlying the goals and initiatives on health reform."  Providing no
discernible advantage or benefit to the public, the plan does little
more than provide physicians with a variety of ways to reduce their
own taxes.

Noting that families and individuals living on low and limited income
are already at a disadvantage under the current tax system, AOHC's
position is that poverty is a fundamental determinant of health, and
that those who are able to should contribute their fair share of taxes
towards society's maintenance and well-being. Allowing doctors to
incorporate simply increases the gap between those who can benefit
from various tax breaks and those with lower incomes who already bear
a disproportionate tax burden.  In addition, it opens the door to
lobbying from other groups within the health field who will seek the
same economic advantages of incorporation. (See <A
HREF="#inc">below</A> for more information on incorporation)

NAME="new"></A>****************************************************************

3 New CHCs Announced

On April 15th and 21st, 3 new CHCs were announced by their respective
MPPs on behalf of Health Minister Ruth Grier.  The three areas to
benefit are North Lambton, Ajax-Pickering, and
Hamilton-Wentworth/Niagara.

The North Lambton CHC was the first to obtain approval.  It will
deliver combined health services to 15,000 permanent and seasonal
residents of the Town of Forest and surrounding area, as well to the
First Nations People of Kettle Point and Stony Point.  The priority
populations are seniors, aboriginal peoples and young families.

The second proposal approved was from the Barbara Black Centre for
Youth Resources. This new CHC will primarily serve the youth
population of Ajax-Pickering, providing them with increased access to
health services as well as health promotion programs focusing on
issues faced by young people and their families.

The third CHC will serve the francophone population in the
Hamilton-Wentworth and Niagara regions, areas designated under the
French Language Services Act.  This centre will operate out of two
locations -- Welland and Hamilton -- to improve access to health
services for Franco-Ontarians.

Approval for all three CHCs was for initial start-up costs.  In
addition to removing barriers to health services for specific groups,
the new CHCs are expected to create employment opportunities.

Ministry of Health Launches Substance Abuse Strategy

The statistics are certainly disturbing:

* Abuse of alcohol and other drugs costs an estimated 9.2 billion
dollars a year in terms of health care and law enforcement costs and
lost labour productivity;

* In 1988/89 nearly half a million Ontario residents were drinking at
a level that placed them at high risk for health problems;

* Close to 9,000 Ontario junior and high school students report using
crack;

* In 1989, 1.9 per cent of Ontario students inhaled glue and 3.3 per
cent inhaled some other solvent.

The cost in human suffering that lies behind these numbers is harder
to measure, but for most of us, apparently not that hard to imagine:
it is estimated that substance abuse directly affects the lives of 74
per cent of all people in Ontario.

Addressing the  problems

The Ministry of Health is attempting to do something about the growing
problem of alcohol and other drug abuse.  In a recent report entitled
"Partners in Action", the Ministry announced Ontario's Substance Abuse
Strategy, a comprehensive plan to address the problem through
increased action in three main areas: health promotion, treatment, and
law enforcement.

Calling for the formation of partnerships and coalitions at the
community level, the strategy's goal is to help communities throughout
the province reduce substance abuse and deal with the associated
problems.  Special emphasis is being placed on prevention through
health promotion, and particular attention is being paid to alcohol,
the substance that presents the greatest problem to the most people in
Ontario.

To shape the process, a new Provincial Advisory Council on Substance
Abuse will be appointed in 1994 to advise the Minister of Health. 
Coordination and leadership of the overall provincial strategy will be
provided by the newly formed Ontario Substance Abuse Bureau.

The role of CHCs

Considering the strategy's strong emphasis on communities and on
health promotion, it is easy to envision a central role for community
health centres in Ontario's latest efforts to reduce the problems
caused by substance abuse.  CHC health providers enjoy direct contact
with community members, and are among the most likely players to
effect real change in the province's ability to detect, treat, and
prevent substance abuse at the community level.

Several CHCs are now providing relevant information and substance
abuse-related health promotion programs, such as "Making Choices:
Substance Abuse Prevention" at Ogden East End CHC, "Finally
Understanding Narcotics" at Parkdale CHC, and Sandwich CHC's "Alcohol
Management Program".  Ontario's substance abuse strategy calls for the
creation of many more initiatives such as these.

Addiction Research Foundation

One of the key players named in the substance abuse strategy is the
Addiction Research Foundation (ARF),which will act as the resource for
research, development and publishing of information on substance
abuse.  ARF provides valuable information to interested groups and
health professionals, and has numerous projects with products,
programs and services that could be of considerable interest to CHC
staff.

In fact, a number of CHCs are already working with local ARF offices. 
A recent ARF survey found only seven CHCs that presently have no
working relationship with an ARF office, and at least 12 CHCs that are
now collaborating with ARF branches to provide some form of substance
abuse programming.

With ARF offices located in many of the same communities where CHCs
are located, a greater degree of collaboration between CHCs and ARF
would certainly benefit both groups and the communities they serve.

For More Information

As the provincial substance abuse strategy takes shape in the coming
months, hopefully more information will become available on the
details of this ambitious plan.  In the meantime, interested CHCs can
contact their local ARF office to explore new possibilities for
collaboration.  To obtain the number of their nearest office, contact
ARF's head office at 416-595-6929.  For more information on the
strategy, or to obtain a copy of the publication entitled "Partners in
Action - Ontario's Substance Abuse Strategy", contact the Ontario
Substance Abuse Bureau at 416-327-8856.

There's incorporation and, then again, there's incorporation ..

A brief look at some of the differences between business and
non-profit corporate status

For those unfamiliar with the process, the whole concept of
incorporation can be a bit of a mystery.  What does it mean to
incorporate?  What are the advantages?  Are there different ways to do
it?  Is a private business incorporated differently than a non-profit
organization?  Can an individual incorporate?

Legislation

A corporation can be defined as "a body or society entitled to act as
a single person,...an artificial person created by charter etc."
(Webster's Dictionary). Creating a legally recognized corporation is
known as incorporation.  In Canada, the creation of a corporation is
governed by statute (i.e., by law).  Both the federal government and
the ten provinces have passed legislation regulating the creation and
operation of corporations.  A corporation that will be carrying on
activities throughout Canada will choose to incorporate pursuant to
the Federal legislation.  On the other hand, if the activities of a
corporation will be confined for the most part to a particular
province, it will normally incorporate pursuant to the legislation of
that province.

Types

In Ontario there are two primary pieces of legislation that regulate
the creation of corporations.  A corporation that will be engaging in
profit-making or business activities will be incorporated under the
Business Corporations Act.  One that will be engaged in non-profit or
charitable activities will be incorporated under the Corporations Act.

There are important distinctions between incorporating a business
corporation under the Business Corporations Act and a non-profit
corporation under the Corporations Act.  The most important difference
is that a business corporation has share capital and shareholders. 
The shareholders may benefit monetarily from their participation in
the corporation: they can earn dividends on their shares and they can
also sell their shares to others.  On the other hand, a non-profit
corporation has no share capital or shareholders.  Instead of
shareholders, a non-profit corporation has members, who do not receive
any dividends or monetary gain from their membership in the
corporation.

Advantages

The ability to create "a body or society entitled to act as a single
person" gives certain advantages to the group that incorporates.  The
main advantage is that it gives shareholders or members of the group
limited liability with respect to the debts of the corporation.  As a
legal entity with an independent existence, a corporation can own
property in its own name, acquire rights, obligations and liabilities,
enter into contracts and agreements, and can also sue or be sued.
Under the Business Corporations Act, an individual shareholder of a
corporation is not answerable or responsible for any act, default,
obligation or liability of the corporation.  Similarly, individual
members of a non-profit organization incorporated under the
Corporations Act are normally not personally liable for the
corporation's debts and obligations.

An additional advantage is that as a separate legal entity, a
corporation is not affected by changes among its shareholders or
members.  In a business, for example, shares are easily transferable,
and the existence of the company is not affected by the death or
withdrawal of any shareholders.  Similarly, the existence of a
non-profit organization continues in perpetuity unless its members or
the Government takes steps to dissolve it.

There are other advantages of incorporation as well, depending upon
the situation. Examples include certain tax advantages for businesses,
and eligibility for charitable status for non-profits.

Incorporation of Professionals

If incorporation is the process of allowing a group to act as a single
person in the eyes of the law, why then would an individual
incorporate?  The Business Corporations Act does allow members of
certain professions to incorporate their practices, as long as the
legislation which regulates that particular profession also allows it.
 In such cases, the professional becomes a shareholder in the
corporation he/she creates.

As previously noted, the Government is currently contemplating changes
to the Medicine Act to allow physicians to incorporate their
practices.  If approved, this would give physicians the same benefits
as those afforded to corporations, including limited personal
liability and various tax advantages.  Recent promotional material
from a prominent consulting company estimates the average income tax
savings for incorporated physicians at $20,000, and points out that
under the amended Act, doctors will also be able to do such things as
create a family trust and/or holding company, refinance existing debt
to increase tax deductions, and utilize capital gains exemptions
related to property owned for use as a medical office.

Many Voices Heard at Public Hearings of Royal Commission on Learning

Ontario's Royal Commission on Learning has a formidable task ahead of
it.  After 12 full weeks of public hearings, at which over 2,000
submissions were heard in 27 different cities, the Commission must now
attempt to sort through and analyze all the opinions received in order
to make its recommendations to the provincial government by the end of
the year.

The hearings were designed to obtain extensive input on the topic of
the reform of Ontario's 14 billion dollar education system.  It heard
from all imaginable participants in the province's education system,
including students, teachers, parents, administrators, trustees,
activists, taxpayers and neighbours.  As might be expected when so
many are consulted on such an important topic, opinions often varied
on the best ways to change the current educational system.

Nevertheless, certain areas of agreement did emerge.  Many who spoke
to the Commission emphasized the importance of education, the benefits
of parental involvement, the need for high standards, and the need for
greater accountability and better methods of evaluation of our
educational system.

On the topic of parental involvement, for example, the Commission
states that "the overwhelming sentiment of teachers, principals,
students, and parents was that meaningful parental involvement
improves the quality of education."  Parents who help their children
at home and volunteer and visit at the school provide the type of
support that results in higher marks, better school attendance, lower
drop-out rates and higher college and university entrance rates.

As for the need for high standards, the Commission heard from many who
believe that the educational system must strive for both excellence
and equity - encouraging the highest possible achievement while
removing the barriers that limit the opportunities for students from
racial and ethnic minority groups, students with histories of poverty,
abuse or neglect, students with learning disabilities, as well as for
gifted students and young women.  Considerable evidence indicates that
with adequate support, higher teacher expectations benefit all
students.

In addition to the areas of general agreement, many other
education-related issues were also brought to the Commission's
attention by individuals or groups with special concerns, on topics as
diverse as students' emotional problems, safety and violence,
different spiritual traditions, diversity of languages and cultures
and French language and First Nations concerns, to name but a few. 
The topics were numerous, and opinions often varied on the best
solutions to the problems brought forth.

At present, the Commission is analyzing the submissions received to
date, in part to identify groups that were not represented at the
public hearings so that their views can be sought.  In the next phase
of its work, the Commission will seek out information about specific
education issues, and continue to sort through all the information and
opinions received in order to present the best possible
recommendations to the provincial government by December 1994.

Parts of this article were taken from the Winter 1994 issue of the
Royal Commission on Learning's newsletter entitled "Spotlight on
Learning". To obtain a copy, or more information on related topics,

More Than Words

This time we offer definitions of three of the most commonly used
terms in the field of health reform.  Remember, if you would like to
contribute to our efforts to demystify the current health jargon, send
your definitions (or requests for definitions) to the AOHC office,
attn.: newsletter.

Health:

1) Premier's Council Definition (based on the World Health
Organization definition):

"Health is the extent to which an individual or group is able, on one
hand, to realize aspirations and satisfy needs; and, on the other
hand, to change or cope with the environment.  Health is therefore
seen as a resource for everyday life, not the object of living; it is
a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well
as physical capacity."

2) Medical Definition (Critchly, M, 1978, Butterworths Medical
Dictionary. London: Butterworths, p. 784):

"The state of being whole and free from physical and mental disease or
pain, so that the parts of the body carry on their proper function."

(N.B.  Both the OMA and the OHA were contacted by AOHC for a medical
definition of health.  In both cases, the library staff reported that
they did not have a definition of health.)

Determinants of Health:

"The fundamental conditions and resources for good health; the social
and economic factors that play a role in determining health.  These
include peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem,
sustainable resources, social justice and equity."

Healthy Communities:

"Looks at the role of the total environment in promoting health,
emphasizing the importance of health issues being recognized in
political, social and economic decision making.  Healthy communities
is an approach based on wide community participation, broad
intersectoral involvement, local government commitment and healthy
public policy."

AOHC, CHCs Among Presenters on Bill 26

- Despite Short Notice, Association and Several CHCs Make Submissions
to Standing Committee -

The month of December was busier than usual for the AOHC and several
of its member centres, who scrambled to analyse the government's
proposed Bill 26 (the "Omnibus Bill") and prepare submissions and
presentations to the Standing Committee on General Government. 
Despite the extremely short time frame that was given to groups who
wished to comment on the bill, at least twenty CHCs were able to
contribute their views and concerns on the bill as it relates to
health, communities and CHCs in particular.

AOHC submitted a thoughtful and well-researched 25-page analysis on
the aspects of the bill that touched on health matters.  Executive
Director Sonny Arrojado also made an oral presentation on the morning
of December 18, the first day of the Standing Committee's hearings. 
The presentation and written submission were the result of a thorough
analysis of the bill conducted by AOHC staff in the days immediately
preceding the hearings. The AOHC office only received notification on
afternoon of Friday, December 15 that its presentation was scheduled
for the morning of Monday the 18th.

While Bill 26 affects approximately 50 pieces of legislation, AOHC
restricted its analysis and comments to the 12 parts of the
legislation that relate directly to health.  As a result of its
review, AOHC concluded: "We have found provisions (in Bill 26) that
we believe are necessary to effect the reform of the health care
system in Ontario.  However, we are deeply concerned with specific
provisions that grant unqualified extraordinary powers to government,
erode and nullify the authority and autonomy of local incorporated
boards of directors, undermine community capacities and ownership,
open up the potential for unfair treatment and grant unprecedented
access to and use of personal records."

The submission deals in turn with each of these concerns, explaining
dangers and consequences of the Bill to individuals, communities and
health care in general.  It concludes with the following eight
recommendations:

"1) We strongly recommend that the provisions of Bill 26 respecting
health care services be amended to ensure that the health care goals
articulated in the document "Mike Harris Forum on Bringing Common
Sense to Health Care - December 2, 1994" are not nullified.

2) We strongly recommend that public input and consultation be
incorporated into Bill 26 provisions as criteria for the Health
Minister's consideration of what is "in the public interest". 
Furthermore, we urge that, in considering what is "in the public
interest", the Health Minister (or Lieutenant Governor in Council)
give regard to the diversity of Ontario's population as it relates to
the varying levels of health status as influenced by gender, age,
disability, socio-economic level, geography, culture, ethnicity and
language.

3) We strongly recommend that a "sunset clause" on the extraordinary
powers of the Health Minister or his designate be incorporated into
the relevant provisions of Bill 26.

4) We strongly recommend that the government's stated intent to
"facilitate the restructuring of the hospital system" in establishing
the Health Services Restructuring Commission be incorporated into the
provisions of Schedule F of Bill 26.

5) We strongly recommend the government to use regulations only in
defining, in greater detail, powers that are already broadly referred
to in the legislation.  In this respect, we urge the government to
delete Section 8. (8) of Part I of Schedule F of Bill 26.

6) We strongly recommend government to incorporate appeal mechanisms
into Bill 26 to ensure that the public is a key player in determining
local community health care priorities.

7) We recommend that some form of public or quasi public
disclosure/review be incorporated in Bill 26 provisions specific to
the Ontario Drug Benefit Act to ensure transparency in the
negotiations between the Health Minister and drug manufacturers.

8) We strongly recommend the deletion of Section 42(1) 31 of Schedule
F - Part IV which allows the Minister of Health to pass regulations
"prescribing conditions under which the Minister may collect, use or
disclose personal information under subsection 37.1(1) and conditions
under which the Minister may enter into agreements under subsection
37.1(2)."

In addition to preparing its own submission, AOHC also provided
relevant information on the bill and the public hearings process
through periodic information updates.  Available research material
and individualized asistance were provided to centres preparing their
own submissions. AOHC also provided a clearinghouse function on
member centres' submissions.

In all, ten CHC presentations were made to the Standing Committee on
General Government, one of which was a joint submission from nine
Ottawa area CHCs.  Two additional centres contributed written
submissions but no verbal presentation. Many centres shared AOHC's
concerns; additional points were made by individual CHCs regarding:
higher drug costs, decreased accessibility to health services, the
possible erosion of the non-profit health sector, physician payment
methods and accountability, the possible stratification of society if
user fees are introduced for municipal services, the changes to the
Pay Equity Act, the erosion of democracy and loss of public
confidence in government, the possibility of soaring drug prices
resulting from deregulation of the drug industry, the implications
for District Health Councils, the lack of government accountability,
the unmanageable size of Bill 26 and the lack of sufficient time for
public hearings.

TVOntario Forms Partnerships in the Community

- "Get Ready to Learn" Project Aimed at Children, Parents and
Caregivers -

For the past three years, TVOntario has been building a unique
multi-faceted project entitled "Get Ready to Learn", a broad
initiative intended to benefit young children and the adults who take
care of them. AOHC recently met with Get Ready to Learn project
leader Cheryl Hassen to explore areas of mutual interest and future
collaboration.

Get Ready to Learn began in 1993 as a block of specialized TVO
programming for preschoolers, specifically aimed at giving two- to
six-year-olds a head start on learning.  The block, still on-air
today, consists of four and a half hours of commercial-free,
all-Canadian programming each weekday morning from 8:00 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. (shows include Polka Dot Shorts, Bookmice, Join In! and Chicken
Minute).  The shows are designed to encourage language and
comprehension skills, teach thinking and problem-solving, and develop
social skills and values such as self-esteem, friendship and
non-violent attitudes.

The initiative did not stop at the creation of specialized television
programming, however.  Research taught TVO that the most successful
programs were the ones that addressed the child in the context of
his/her environment, strengthened the family and built on a
community's capacity to create opportunities and mobilize natural
support systems.  TVO commissioned a research study, "Possible Roles
for Public Television in Getting Ontario's Children Ready to Learn",
which recommended, in part, that "a broader outreach than has been in
evidence in the past is needed. This means bringing on board a
variety of partners ... Community members, non-governmental
organizations, business and industry, government agencies, health and
social services need to be involved."  This practice was consistent
with the recent approach of TVO to establish partnerships and go
beyond television alone in the development and delivery of
interactive learning.

Acting on the recommendations of this study, TVO brought together 37
community-based organizations in 1995 to form the Get Ready to Learn
Advisory Council, and then began a series of discussions and
consultations to develop the conceptual design for the project.  This
led to a framework and a detailed set of strategies for bringing the
project beyond the realm of television broadcasting alone.  In
addition to airing shows on its network, TVO can also make use of
satellite delivery (for tele- or video-conferencing), video
production and certain "on-line" capabilities to extend the reach of
the project to parents/caregivers, service providers, professionals
and communities throughout Ontario.

Get Ready to Learn's focus is in the following areas: Resources:  To
develop resources that inform, assist and involve parents /
caregivers and communities in fostering early learning and in
creating healthy learning environments for young children.

Support:  To build support systems for all parents and caregivers by
strengthening community networks, parent networks and caregiver
networks, and facilitating a cohesive relationship among them.

Value:  To increase public recognition and acceptance of the value of
parenting and caregiving in our society, and of the crucial
importance of society responding to the early learning needs of all
young children.

To achieve these goals, Get Ready to Learn has made progress in
several project areas, including research and evaluation, training
and development, community outreach, and public recognition.  In each
area, specific aims and directions have been defined and embarked
upon.

One early result is TVO's "You're Important" campaign, a series of
public service announcements that stress the value of parenting and
caregiving and the vital importance of being responsive to young
children as they learn.  Each announcement shows a parent or
caregiver providing encouragement and support as a child masters a
new skill, such as tying shoelaces, and gains a sense of
accomplishment and self-confidence.

Get Ready top Learn also publishes Cribnotes, a newsletter containing
broadcast scheduling information, upcoming conferences on parenting
and education, recommended reading and more.  There is also a
colourful brochure with tips and ideas on how parents and caregivers
can help children benefit from TVO's programming.  Further resource
materials, such as print packages and videos, are currently in the
works. Also to come are prime-time television specials which will
feature parents discussing how they develop independence and
self-confidence in their young children, and help them learn to read
and gain language skills, handle discipline, get along with others,
and maintain their own cultural identity and family values.  In
addition, community outreach will be enhanced through a series of
"Jam Sessions", meetings with selected parent / caregiver groups to
share learning experiences and to introduce the Get Ready to Learn
resources to others in their communities.

During her meeting with AOHC E.D. Sonny Arrojado, project leader
Cheryl Hassen invited the participation of CHCs in the various Get
Ready to Learn initiatives.  Relevant TVO resources are available to
CHC parents, caregivers and child education workers, and CHCs can
also have the opportunity for input into the further development of
the project.  There is also a chance that local successes will be
featured on TVO, as evidenced by Get Ready to Learn's recent work
featuring Etobicoke's LAMP community health centre.

Those interested in more information on TVO's Get Ready to Learn
shows and resources can contact Cheryl Hassen, Project Officer,
Distance Learning Division at (416) 484-2600, EXT. 2067 or by
Internet e-mail at hassen@tvo.org.

NAME="cuts"></A>****************************************************************

CHCs Affected by MCSS Budget Cuts

Several Community Health Centres are struggling to recover from the
effects of recent cuts to programs funded by the Ministry of
Community and Social Services (MCSS).  While most CHCs receive most
of their funding from the Ministry of Health (which has so far
maintained its funding levels to CHCs), to help provide a wider range
of services to individuals and families in their communities, many
centres have come to rely on additional funds from other sources.

Ironically, several centres that have demonstrated the
resourcefulness in expanding their funding base are now among the
first to be hurt by the new policies of a government that
philosophically ascribes to initiative, self-reliance and
collaboration.

L.A.M.P. "In the early days, our centre showed initiative in finding
multiple sources of funding, in ways that were quite ingenious," said
Joe Leonard, Executive Director of LAMP in Etobicoke.  Now it seems
that their centre is being penalized for that ingenuity.  In the
fall, MCSS cut their $185,000 Multiservice Program, as well as
$20,000 from their Opportunity Planning Program and $3,000 from their
Parent Resource Centre, with further cuts planned in 96/97.  As
Leonard pointed out, "They eliminated a whole program without
recognizing that it contained a significant share of our core
funding.  It weakens the entire organization."  The money which
supported a vital volunteer program paid a portion of six staff
salaries, two of which had to be eliminated altogether.  This has
resulted in additional pressure on remaining staff, necessitated a
difficult process of restructuring, and reduced the CHC's services to
the community in a number of ways.

There were other ironies in the LAMP cuts as well.  The reduced
Opportunity Planning Program is a service that helps community
members on social assistance get back into the workforce, which is
the stated objective of the new government's intent in introducing
"workfare". However, LAMP's efforts to help the most marginalized in
society become active members of the community were seen as
high-cost, the program was cut back, and there are fears that it may
be eliminated in 96/97.

Davenport Perth At the nearby Davenport Perth CHC, MCSS axed a
$70,000 Youth Program that taught leadership skills and employment
readiness to teenagers.  The program's focus was to keep young people
in school or help them find positive alternatives.  A smaller amount
was also cut from funding for a Citizenship Program for seniors. 
According to Executive Director Ruth Crammond, part of the stress
caused by such cuts is not knowing what will be affected next.  "We
receive MCSS and municipal funding for non-clinical activities such
as our Drop-In program and our Parent-Child Centre.  It's very
difficult to plan when you don't know where the cuts will come from."
She expressed concern and frustration at the government's apparent
strategy to remain vague on details and to delay the impact of its
financial decisions.

The resulting anxiety can be felt in the community.  "People are very
nervous.  We recently held a neighbourhood meeting about the impact
of the cuts that attracted 75 people, which is a very large turnout
for such an event."  The centre is also seeing an increasing number
of families who have lost their housing, and is referring more people
to food banks, both the result of recent cuts to welfare.

So while its resources are being cut, demand for the centre's
programs and services is increasing significantly.  Davenport-Perth
is trying to prepare for further pressures as well.  "We're now
looking at community food programs, housing and access issues, and
informal child care for working parents - people are concerned about
the possibility that Day Care centres will be closed."

Somerset West MCSS cuts are also forcing Ottawa's Somerset West CHC
to operate "tight and to the line," according to Executive Director
Jack McCarthy.  An anticipated loss of $30,000 in funding has them
scrambling to reconfigure and restructure in order to retain existing
staff and services.  "Our ability to manoeuvre is really limited
right now.  The Social Contract brought us to the edge, and now we're
having to squeeze our administration even further."  They are also
trying to prepare for further cuts, in part because provincial
measures put pressure on municipal governments to make additional
funding restrictions, all of which "further exacerbates the climate
of uncertainty", as McCarthy sees it.

C.M.S.C. The Community and Social Services cuts were perhaps most
devastating to the francophone CHCs, who experienced
disproportionally large funding reductions in comparison with most
other CHCs.  In Toronto, the Centre médico-social communautaire
(CMSC) is now trying to recover from the loss of almost half a
million dollars to their "Purchased Services Counselling" service for
francophone adults.

Executive Director Wesley Romulus said that the figure represents 32%
of their entire operating budget, the loss of which shifts a large
administrative burden for rent, photocopy, telephone and other
expenses to the remaining Ministry of Health funds.  Six staff
positions disappeared completely with the cuts, and another four
administrative positions are directly affected and must continue to
be supported in some manner by the remaining 68% of the budget.

The problem for the community, as Romulus points out, is that CMSC
provided the only francophone counselling of its type in Metro
Toronto. "If clients are English-speaking you may be able to send
them to other services in the city, but francophones can't be
referred.  Some of our former employees have now formed their own
company, but 95% of our clients can't afford to pay a fee for such
services."  Among the services lost to this community are family,
group and individual therapy, assessment, mediation, referrals,
welfare counselling, child protection and support groups (e.g., for
single mothers).  Prior to the cuts, CMSC provided these services to
approximately 1,200 francophone clients.

Hamilton-Niagara The Centre de santé communautaire de
Hamilton-Niagara is another Francophone CHC that lost a huge portion
of its CMSC budget, approximately $375,000.  Executive Director
Robert Bisson said that only $138,000 in MCSS money remains, for
their Family Violence and Assault Prevention programs.  They lost six
social workers, though as Ministry of Health funding recently began
for this new CHC, they have been able to re-hire two staff members,
and hopefully more by the spring as they explore alternate funding
sources.  "For the moment, the Ministry is allowing us some
short-term flexibility in the use of our approved budget, which will
buy time until April," said Bisson.

Bisson said that community members are definitely affected, and
predicts that the centre will see more fallout from the recent cuts. 
As at CMSC, the Hamilton-Niagara CHC provides the only
French-speaking services in the area, and when funding was cut, they
were faced with having to terminate counselling sessions, group
workshops and support groups abruptly, without being able to refer
Francophone clients elsewhere.

Looking Ahead As these and other CHCs try to cope with the
government's cuts to date, they also fear that future programs may be
affected as well.  For example, Joe Leonard reports, "We've heard
that our Literacy Program is under review, and we don't yet know the
implications (of the government's November Financial Statement) for
our Children's Program."

The climate of uncertainty does little for staff and morale, and some
feel the worst is yet to come.  The effects of the current
government's policy "will be devastating after Christmas," says Jack
McCarthy.  "Right now, the people who are really hurting are those
who are already poor, but pretty soon these policies will start to
put new people into poverty. February and March will be grim." For
Ruth Crammond, the first round of cuts has been "a real eye opener." 
As she puts it, "They really are dismantling our social services."

The HealthNet Community Access Pilot- Communication & Information for
CHCs by  Rebekah Jamieson

A powerful tool is available to assist health professionals and
community workers in enhancing services provided by Community Health
Centres. Although most people have heard about the Internet ad
infinitum, many still do not understand how it can possibly benefit
their professional and personal lives.  This is the goal of the
HealthNet Community Access Pilot - to demystify and simplify the
Internet in order for health and community workers to understand how
to apply it in practical ways.

Simply put, the Internet provides access to communication and
information. Regular people across Canada and around the world are
using the Internet to discuss shared interests and to gain a better
understanding of issues affecting their everyday lives. 
Health-related information and discussion groups are growing rapidly,
both for practitioners and clients.  Some of the more immediate uses
of the Internet for health and community workers include peer-to-peer
communication (with long-time peers, as well as with new ones),
gathering pertinent information quickly, and the ability to provide
information to your community, whether it be your geographic
community or a specific community of interest.  Support groups and
discussion forums are also available on a wide variety of topics,
from Alzheimer's to diabetes to domestic abuse.

The main goal of the HealthNet Community Access Pilot is to expand
and evaluate the use of the Internet in both rural and urban
Community Health Centres.  The CAP Coordinator works closely with
participating CHCs to facilitate the implementation and use of
Internet tools in each Centre at as low a cost as possible.  This
includes developing appropriate solutions to technical and
organizational problems, providing training programs and materials,
and offering access to the HealthNet CAP World Wide Web resource
which has useful Internet starting points and search tools relevant
to CHC workers.

Current participants of the HealthNet Community Access Pilot include
Carlington Community and Health Services (Ottawa, ON), Merrickville
District Community Health Centre (Merrickville, ON), Somerset West
CHC (Ottawa), Sandy Hill CHC (Ottawa), and the Guelph-Wellington
Community Mental Health Clinic (Guelph, ON).  The Saskatoon Community
Health Centre and the St. John Community Health Centre in New
Brunswick have also indicated interest in participating.  Although
the HealthNet CAP project has only limited resources, it is hoped
that as many CHCs as possible can become involved.  The pilot will be
completed by March 31, 1996.  At that time, a final report will be
issued which will help provide a model for the development of future
Internet services within Community Health Centres across Canada.

Those CHCs interested in participating in the project must contact
the HealthNet CAP Coordinator (below).  Community Health Centres are
responsible for equipment and telephone line costs, as well as
providing feedback in informal monthly sessions.  Assistance may be
provided for interested CHCs with limited resources.  For more
information or to indicate your interest, please contact:

AOHC Annual Conference Goes North

Fresh air, sunshine, northern hospitality and an abundance of
information on community health were the highlights of this year's AOHC
Annual Conference.  Over 400 people from across the province attended
the conference which took place from June 1 to 3 in Sault-Ste-Marie. 
The theme of the conference "WHERE DOES HEALTH GO FROM HERE?"  was
explored by presenters and participants alike during the 3-day event of
workshops, keynote speeches, networking sessions and special meetings.
Workshops on a wide range of topics provided up to date information and
views on some of the most relevant and topical issues in community
health.

Michael Rachlis and Carol Kushner, recipients of the 1995 AOHC AWARD,
were on hand to accept this year's award and both authors expressed
their appreciation for the contributions of community health centres to
health reform in Canada.

The conference also featured several guest speakers.  Dr. Fraser
Mustard, Companion of the Order of Canada and founder of the Canadian
Institute for Advanced Research, spoke to conference participants about
national and global trends in health, technology and socioeconomic
change.  As part of his election campaign stop-over in the "Soo",
former Premier Bob Rae also addressed the conference, bringing words of
support for the CHC movement.  Motivational speaker Maggie Milne, with
a healthy dose of humour, wrapped up the three-day event with a
presentation that challenged participants to retain and assimilate all
things learned at the conference.

Elections for open positions on the AOHC Board of Directors took place
during the AOHC Annual General Meeting.  Dennise Albrecht, Helene
Gagne, Rosana Pellizzari, and Charlotte Rosenbaum were re-elected and
Nasir Noormohamed was elected to the AOHC Board.  They join continuing
Board members Sherryl Smith, Joel Rosenbloom, Keith Bytheway, Neil
Evans, and Linda Jones.  Several resolutions were also passed at the
AGM (see inset, page 2), indicating some of the areas AOHC resources
will be devoted to during this fiscal year.

As the home of Group Health Centre, Ontario's first community health
centre, Sault Ste. Marie proved an appropriate setting for this year's
conference. Group Health Centre staff and volunteers worked hard to
make all conference participants feel welcome and at home.  One of the
conference highlights was a well-organized guided tour of Group Health
Centre which provides health services to approximately one half of the
city's residents.

Jim Wilson Appointed Minister of Health

CHC News extends its congratulations to Jim Wilson (Simcoe West) who
was appointed Minister of Health by Premier Mike Harris after the new
government was sworn into office on June 26, 1995.  In his previous
capacity as Health Critic for the Progressive Conservatives when the
party was in opposition, Mr. Wilson  expressed support for the CHC
Program which was started during the tenure of  the last P.C.
government.  AOHC looks forward to working with Mr. Wilson in the
continuing implementation of Ontario's Health Goals.

Health Promotion Summer School Enjoys Success in Second Year

From June 5-9, approximately 180 participants joined together to learn
more about health promotion at the second annual "Health Promotion
Summer School" sponsored by the Centre for Health Promotion at the
University of Toronto.  The site of the week long summer school was
Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto.   Building upon the
experience of the first summer school held in 1994, this year's event
was viewed as a great success.

The majority of participants in this year's summer school came from a
public health setting however several health promotion workers from
community health centres as well as a range of other community-based
organizations and agencies also took the opportunity to increase their
understanding of key health promotion concepts.  Participants worked on
increasing their knowledge and skills in the planning and implementing
of effective health promotion approaches.  The summer school program
achieved a good balance between presentation/lecture, and practise and
reflection.  Students had many opportunities to address challenges and
successes encountered as health promotion practitioners.  This year's
summer school faculty brought with them a wide range of talents and
experiences in areas of health promotion, policy development, community
development and community action.  Especially valuable for students was
the detail to which faculty members were able to share their respective
practical experiences and insight.

One of the highlights of this year's summer school were student options
on selecting one (1) out of three (3) intensive learning options
according to individual interests and learning needs.  Students could
choose between an intensive presentation on health promotion concepts
and principles,  a "policy development" session or a "community
mobilization" session.

Those enrolled in the summer school also participated as a whole in the
learning and application of "story-telling" techniques.  Students
experimented with the use of the "Story Dialogue Loop," a technique
which has been piloted by Ron Labonté and Heather Maclean in a case
story health promotion research method across Canada in the fall of
1994.  The history of story-telling and current application of this
technique in terms of health promotion planning and evaluation was also
discussed.

Although dates are not yet confirmed for next year, the "Health
Promotion Summer School" sponsored by the Centre for Health Promotion
is expected to become an annual event, and planning for next year's
session will be underway shortly.  Like this year's program, next
year's session will provide an invaluable opportunity for people
interested or working in health promotion to continue to develop their
theory and skills as health promotion practitioners.

Details about the 1996 Health Promotion Summer School will be available
from the Centre for Health Promotion in the Fall/95.

Volunteers and CHCs: Community Participation in Action

For Coordinators of Volunteer Services Deborah Cain-Moroz and Kathryn
Andrews, volunteerism in CHCs is definitely a win-win situation.  At
the AOHC's recent Annual Conference, Deborah and Kathryn presented a
"how-to" workshop on volunteer management which outlined some of the
ways that both CHCs and volunteers benefit from a formal, ongoing
volunteer program.  They pointed out that the CHC Program's strategic
directions call for CHCs to strengthen meaningful community
participation at all levels, including decision making, through a range
of innovative approaches.  As they put it, "We really believe that
volunteerism is one opportunity for people to contribute to their
community."

Both presenters speak from their experience.  Both have been
extensively involved in organizing volunteers in their own centres, and
have also formed a volunteer network for all CHCs and CRCs in the
Ottawa area.  Following her completion of a volunteer needs assessment
study some years ago, Deborah Cain-Moroz was seconded from her work in
the Sandy Hill CHC's alcohol and drug addiction program to develop an
integrated volunteer program at the centre. Kathryn Andrews has been a
manager of volunteers for the last 9 years.  She had initially worked
in this capacity at a Home for the Aged in St. Catharines and, more
recently, at the South East Ottawa CHC where she is Coordinator of
Volunteer Services.  Both spoke very positively about the value of
volunteer programs in CHCs, and shared the benefit of their experiences
with workshop participants.

Today more and more CHCs are showing interest in organizing volunteer
programs, and many administrators are seeking advice on how to
introduce a consistent volunteer component to their centres'
activities.  The creation of the volunteer program at Sandy Hill can
serve as a "how-to" example for other centres to follow. The program
followed some basic stages:

Needs Assessment:  A needs assessment can be formal or informal.  Seek
staff support by asking them whether they are interested in having an
integrated volunteer program.  Determine what jobs and roles would be
available for volunteers at the centre.

Commitment:  It is important to seek and obtain commitment from all
levels: board, staff and management.  According to Ms. Cain-Moroz,
"Without it you won't go anywhere."  This commitment, obtained through
consultations at the board and meetings with staff and management,
forms the basis to look for financial resources to build the program.

Coordinator of Volunteer Services:  The first funds obtained will go
towards hiring a manager or coordinator of volunteers.  Without such a
person it is difficult to take the program very far, as there is much
work to be done to organize both the program and the volunteers to
ensure a positive experience for all. Community consultation:  At Sandy
Hill CHC, community consultation took the form of a meeting.  Community
members were invited to come and share their ideas of what a volunteer
program should look like in their community.  To accommodate different
people's schedules, two separate meetings were held at different times
of the day.

Policies and procedures:  Feedback from the community consultations can
be used as the groundwork for building the program and developing
relevant policies and procedures.  This includes the development of a
manual for volunteers.

Volunteer positions:  Working with the staff, the next stage is to
develop actual volunteer positions that are both appropriate for the
centre and rewarding for the volunteer.  At Sandy Hill there are now 6
new volunteer positions that are integrated into the centre's
operations.

Recruitment:  There are many ways to recruit volunteers, including the
use of Public Service Announcements on the free community television
channels and in community newspapers.  Many volunteers hear of the
program by word of mouth, and having a healthy volunteer program and
happy volunteers attracts many others to come in.

Screening & interviewing:  It is important to do proper screening to
ensure that both the centre's and the volunteer's needs are considered.
 When doing individual interviews, try to be as accommodating as
possible; respond quickly to someone who expresses interest, conduct
the interview in the volunteer's language of choice whenever possible,
and consider interviewing at the volunteers' homes if they are unable
to come to the centre.

Orientation:  Once volunteers have been identified and screened, orient
them to the mission and values of the organization.  One option for
busy administrators is to arrange for other volunteers to do this part.
 Issues of confidentiality can also be communicated to the new
volunteer at this time.

Training & supervision:  To ensure good results, clear volunteer job
descriptions are important, so that everyone has very clear
expectations.  Training is usually done by the centre staff. 
Admittedly, it is a challenge to get staff members to commit the time
to integrate and train volunteers, but if the staff have committed to
the program at the outset, they should be able to see that this initial
investment of time will pay off in the long run.

Evaluation:  Evaluating the volunteer's activities is done in much the
same way as a staff member's performance review.  This is an important
stage in the process, to ensure that both volunteer and the centre are
still benefiting, and that the volunteer is still getting the training
and supervision that's needed.

Recognition:  An important way to keep volunteers is to recognize their
efforts and let them know that they're appreciated.  "Little things
mean a lot, like smiling, calling the volunteers by name, calling them
back quickly so they know they're important, noticing if they're not
there, and saying thank you."  Other suggested means of recognition are
an annual luncheon, certificates for volunteers, and thank you notes to
the volunteers' families and/or employers.

The workshop also touched upon some of the recent trends in
volunteerism. According to the presenters, the volunteer sector is
changing in ways that reflect the current social, economic, political
and technical climate.  Though some still retain the old notion of
volunteer work as unskilled, repetitious, and gender-linked (e.g., "the
ladies from the church"), today, more and more volunteers have a wide
variety of skills and experience and come from a whole range of
different backgrounds.  Some may be available as a result of forced
retirement or layoffs, and seek ways to utilize well-developed skills. 
Others wish to learn and add new skills to their résumés, or acquire
Canadian experience to enhance their training from another country. 
CHCs can respond to the needs of these community members by designing
appropriate jobs that help these new types of volunteers fit in and
contribute.

Embarking on the Process of Policy Change

Policy change is the active process of creating or modifying
procedures, rules, regulations, or laws.  Within the context of health
promotion and the determinants of health, policy change empowers
individuals to take responsibility for, not only their own health, but
the health of their communities.  While education/awareness and
environmental support are important and, in some cases, necessary
precursors to policy change, it is policies themselves which profoundly
effect the choices we make and the ways we behave.  "... policy affects
our jobs, our careers, our schools, where we live, our freedom or lack
of freedom, our very lives."(1)

The Ontario Public Health Association has recently released its
publication Making a Difference in Your Community: A Guide for Policy
Change.  This document is intended to provide individuals in
communities with the fundamentals of local level policy change.  The
public has come to appreciate the value of healthy policies and, in
fact, expect policies which will support health.(2) Further, it has
been suggested that the most far-reaching changes can take place at the
local level.2 As Wallack so cogently stated, "It is the policies that
define the environment in which people make choices about health that
appear to have the greatest potential to improve health."(3)

In creating the OPHA policy change guide, community stories were sought
from across Ontario.  Although the stories focus on the four
"traditional" lifestyle areas (i.e., alcohol, nutrition, physical
activity, and tobacco), they have implications for other issues and
serve to illuminate the practicalities involved in advancing a policy
agenda.

The stories, in conjunction with the literature, sparked the creation
of a "road map", a conceptual model which is used throughout the guide
to identify major decision points, critical activities, and options
involved in the policy change process.  The journey starts with
identifying and analyzing the problem to assessing community support
and resources to selecting strategies and, finally, implementing
action.  The road map serves as a visual summary of the process, from
start to finish.

The guide's other function is to assist as a planning tool.  Effecting
policy change is often a matter of honing and shaping the strategies we
currently use within the framework of our policy objectives.  As Joseph
reminds us: "We need to perfect our techniques of persuasion, crafty
bartering, and badgering, all skills which come in handy again and
again in the essentially political process that is public health."(4) 
Thus, the guide provides information on things like accessing
resources, approaching and meeting with decision-makers, preparing
briefs and deputations, building community support, etc.  As well, a
series of key questions and "step back" reminders are used to encourage
users to reflect upon the process, expand their vision of what is
possible, and evaluate their progress.

Power does not simply lie in the hands of a few decision-makers - it
lies with those who live and work in a community and who have a strong
commitment to making it better.  Making a Difference in Your Community,
by providing practical guidance on the fundamentals of the policy
change process, will help people to realize their power and understand
what is needed to exercise it effectively.  "The development of
organized advocacy for the public's health ... seems essential to
effective policy-influencing action.  Its ultimate strategic purpose is
to make health-promoting policy decisions easier for policy-makers to
choose."(5)

policy change process, please contact Kimberly Badovinac at the Ontario
Public Health Association office at 1-800-267-6817 (in Toronto,

Keeping an Eye on Prescription Drug Prices (submitted by Centretown
Community Health Centre)

The federal Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) was
established in 1987. It regulates the introductory prices of new
patented medicines, price increases of existing patented medicines, and
reports to parliament on drug price trends and levels of R&D by
pharmaceutical patentees.

Although many prescription drug products are patented and within the
PMPRB's jurisdiction, many brand name prescription and over-the-counter
products are not patented.

Non-patented medicine, including generic medicine, prices are not
currently reviewed by the PMPRB.  The PMPRB only reviews manufacturers'
prices and does not regulate retail prices of pharmacy dispensing fees.

Through its enforcement activities, the PMPRB has imposed over $10
million in excess pricing fines on Canadian pharmaceutical patentees. 
Some products which have been identified as excessively priced in the
PMPRB's 1993 annual report include:

Habitrol nicotine patches (Ciba-Geigy Canada Ltd.) Megace 40 mg and 160
mg tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb) Hytrin 10 mg tablets (Abbott
Laboratories Ltd.) Imovane 7.5 mg tablets (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Canada
Inc.) Metrogel 30 gm tube (Cyanamid Canada Inc.)

The PMPRB investigates consumer complaints and relies on input from
stakeholders to develop its pricing guidelines.  Price complaints
should specify product brand nam, strength, manufacturer and Drug
Identification Number (DIN).

Complaints and inquiries should be addressed to:

Dr. Robert Elgie, Chair Patented Medicine Prices Review Board Box L40
Standard Life Centre 333 Laurier Avenue West Suite 1400 Ottawa, Ontario
K1P 1C1

Copies of the PMPRB annual reports are available free of charge.  The
reports list the patented medicines which are under its jurisdiction.

COMMUNITY HEALTH FAIR AT QUEEN'S PARK KICKS OFF PROVINCE-WIDE WEEK

The weather was wonderful, information was plentiful and the lunchtime
crowd got into the "swing of things" at the AOHC's recent Community
Health Fair, held on October 17 on the grounds in front of the Queen's
Park legislative building in Toronto.  Over 30 community health centres
(CHCs) and other community service organizations had booths at the AOHC
sponsored outdoor fair which was the provincial kickoff event  marking
the province's first annual Community Health Week.

Sharing information on health was the order of the day, and 
representatives of participating agencies and organizations did not
disappoint, handing out literature and answering questions on a wide
range of topics.  Booth displays showed activities and services at
various community health centres and other service organizations, and
helped inform fair participants about the many factors that contribute to
good health, including nutrition, housing, environment, employment,
safety, family, and illness prevention.

Fair highlights included free shoulder massages courtesy of East End
Health Services, an apple cart set up by the Field To Table organization,
and AOHC's nutrition table, where over 200 visitors tried their hand at a
roulette-style nutrition wheel quiz and had their lunches judged by
volunteer dietitians from Flemingdon and Bernard Betel CHCs.  Quiz
winners received prizes such as frisbees, yogurt and T-shirts donated by
Astro Dairies, East York Public Health and the AOHC.

Health Minister Ruth Grier visited the fair, touring the booths and
expressing her greetings and encouragement to those involved and those
interested in the community health centre movement.  Representatives from
the media were also in attendance, including CFTO-TV, CITY-TV, CBC's
Health Show, CISS-FM, CBLFT, CBOFT (Ottawa) and CKCO (Kitchener). 
Pre-event publicity was also carried by CFTR and CJEZ-FM, as well as in
the weekly magazines Now and Eye.

In addition to CHCs, other community service organizations with displays
included Africans United to Control AIDS, Assaulted Women's Help Line,
Canada Post's Letter Carrier Alert Program, Chai-Tikvah Foundation, Field
To Table, Head Injury Association of Toronto, Metro Addiction Assessment
Referral Service, Metro Toronto Housing Authority, Mid-Toronto Community
Services, Migraine Foundation, St. Elizabeth Visiting Nurses' Association
and Wellspring.

Community Health Week is a new public awareness of health campaign
sponsored by the AOHC and the positive feedback from this year's
experience will be a great building block for the what will be an annual
opportunity to form closer links with the community and other related
service organizations. Member centres across the province held various
special events to encourage greater community participation and to
attract media attention.  In all, more than 35 of the AOHC's member
centres had special programs for the week.  Some examples of these events
can be found on the following pages.

NAME="wl"></A>****************************************************************

WEST LORNE: A NEW CENTRE REACHES OUT TO ALL AGES

The West Elgin CHC offered a full week of activities for people of all
ages. Donna Lunn, the centre's Health Promotion Co-ordinator, reports
that the week was "a huge success".  Though the first day's evening Open
House was not that well attended, the rest of the week brought many new
faces to the centre.  Seniors enjoyed the flu zone and foot care clinics,
and the Open House for service providers from other agencies also went
very well.  "A lot of people came from other organizations, and it was
nice to have them out and to discuss our linkages with them," said Donna.

At another program, 25 women attended the breast health awareness
information session.  In addition to providing valuable information, the
session also helped to reduce barriers to health services by signing up
enough women to fill a bus that the centre reserved to take them to a
nearby mammogram clinic the following week.

High school students also attended Community Health Week programs at
lunch time sessions on sports and fitness for teens, and self esteem and
body image for teens.  As the high school is within walking distance of
the CHC, these events were well attended by students and faculty alike.

One of the most successful aspects of the week was a farm safety day camp
for children between the ages of 7 and 11.  In all, 72 children came out,
and another 20 had to be turned away due to lack of space.  As Donna put
it, "It was an extremely successful day - wonderful fun."  Every child
received a special T-shirt, and the program focused on raising awareness
of farm safety issues.  The need for caution was clearly demonstrated by
putting straw dummies too close to moving farm machinery, to illustrate
how easily one can get caught up in a machine if one is not careful.  The
day camp also attracted the attention of the local press.

As the West Elgin CHC just opened in August, Community Health Week was
seen as an excellent opportunity to establish and strengthen ties between
the centre and the members of community.

NAME="tor"></A>****************************************************************

TORONTO: COMMUNITY ACTION ON SAFETY

A unique approach to Community Health Week was taken by the
Davenport-Perth Neighbourhood Centre, who decided to use the week for
advocacy purposes regarding a local health and safety issue.  In addition
to health displays at the CHC and a local mall, a public meeting was held
at the centre "to inform community residents about what is happening, if
anything, at the Canadian General Electric site located in our
neighbourhood and its storage of PCBs in a densely populated area."

According to Chilsa Neves, Community Organizer for Health Promotion, the
meeting went very well.  Approximately fifty people came, many of whom
were new to the centre, and many who were parents with small children. 
The centre had publicized the meeting through flyers distibuted
throughout the area.

Although the press did not show up, their local councillor did, as well
as the CGE Task Force that had been formed by the city ten years ago. 
Despite Task Force assurances that the site is completely safe, community
members voiced their apprehensions about storage and transportation
issues that continue to concern them.  The evening included a talk by
centre physician Jim Sugiyama on the effects of PCBs on health.

While current legislation prohibits removal of the PCBs, alternatives are
being looked at, such as Alberta's practice of burning PCBs.  As a result
of discussions at the gathering, all future meetings of the Task Force
will take place at the Davenport-Perth CHC, to better involve and inform
the members of the community. In addition, the centre's newsletter will
begin to include a regular column with updates on the situation and dates
of upcoming meetings.

NAME="ham"></A>****************************************************************

HAMILTON: A MURAL, A BREAKFAST AND A PROCLAMATION

At the North Hamilton Community Health Centre, local school children,
community agencies and the Mayor all participated in Community Health
Week events. According to Executive Director Beth Beader, the week was
very successful.  Over 150 children from schools in the area came down to
the centre to "colour in" several large mural paintings, depicting
aspects of a healthy lifestyle, that an artist had outlined on the
centre's outside walls.  The result, in Beth's words, "looks great!"  Not
only did the added colour increase the visibility of the centre, but the
event also attracted the attention of the Hamilton Spectator, which ran a
photo the following day.

North Hamilton also hosted a special Heart Healthy breakfast for
community agency representatives.  Over 50 people participated, many
getting to know the community health centre for the first time.  Hamilton
Mayor Robert Morrow also visited the centre that week to officially
declare "Community Health Week" in the city.

The centre also got the message out into the community by setting up
various displays, at three malls, two banks and one school.  Among other
things, the displays featured the centre's newest brochure, which was
handed out to over 400 people during the week.

Overall, Beth says that it was a lot of work, but the results were
excellent. Centre visibility was increased, many new faces were seen at
the CHC, and they received several new requests for volunteer positions. 
Looking ahead, she hopes to involve other organizations as partners in
next year's community health week program.

<A
NAME="lon"></A>****************************************************************

LONDON: TAKING IT TO THE STREETS

The London InterCommunity Health Centre took their Community Health Week
out onto the streets, with three consecutive days of outdoor events aimed
at bringing health information directly to the community.  The centre's
Health Promotion Co-ordinator Anthoula Doumkou reports that the week was
"absolutely wonderful", bringing new people in to see the centre and
reaffirming the CHC's presence in the community.

Street events attracted hundreds of people throughout the week, and
included a safe sex and anonymous HIV testing clinic, a blood pressure
clinic, line dancing and exercises (which were moved indoors due to
rain), and a nutrition day featuring cooking on the street and a bake
sale.  The nutrition display included a popular "Meal of Fortune" game
(featured in a photograph that ran in the London Free Press), with prizes
of apples, apple cider and healthy muffins.

As a way to get people thinking about health, passers-by during the week
were encouraged to stop and draw a picture of what health meant to them,
and then stick their photo up on the centre's walls.  "Our walls were
completely covered," said Anthoula.  "Lots of pictures included images of
families, friends, clean air, hearts — and the pictures stayed up for
days.  Our centre has just a red brick wall on the outside, and many
people don't know what's inside.  But with the drawings on the wall, many
people who would normally pass right by stopped to have a look."

Other events at the London centre included tours of the centre and a
public launch of their new "Culture, Health and You" video and workbook
for medical and university students.  All in all the week gave the centre
much more visibility in the community, and they look forward to doing
even more next year.

OTHER COMMUNITY HEALTH WEEK HIGHLIGHTS

* York Community Services' most successful event was the opening at York
City Hall of "Art for Survival", an art show by people with developmental
and psychiatric disabilities sponsored by YCS.  Over 100 people came to
the show, and 31 of the 69 pieces of art were purchased, according to
Special Events Co-ordinator Francie Kendal.  York Mayor Fergy Brown was
on hand to meet the artists, who presented him with an ink print that all
artists had worked on for the invitations for the show.

* An interesting mix of events and cultures was well received at Access
Alliance (Toronto), where over 110 people from the community turned out
to watch and participate in tai chi demonstrations, an acupressure and
relaxation clinic, Vietnamese videos on AIDS and breast cancer, a health
talk on AIDS in Spanish, a workshop on pain management and relaxation
through Shiatsu, and a Spanish community kitchen cooking and nutrition
class.

* Exercise was the focus at Community Health Week in Merrickville, where
the CHC invited the community to join their staff and a local seniors
exercise group in a one hour walk through the community.  Other events
included a CPR course and a "Lunch and Learn" information sharing session
with area Public Health nurses.

* Toronto Mayor June Rowlands was on hand at a special gathering at The
House to proclaim Planned Parenthood Week, whose dates coincided with
those of Community Health Week.

* Group Health Centre (Sault Ste. Marie) held a blood pressure clinic in
a mall, which "was very well received and received photo coverage in the
local newspaper," according to Elizabeth Bodnar, Department Head of
Communications Services.  The centre recently won an Apex '94 Award for
publication excellence in the field of community relations campaigns for
their 30th annual "Spirit of Caring" publication.

* Black Creek CHC (Toronto) reports great participation at their 3-on-3
soccer matches - they had 16 teams of children, youth and adults.

Community Health Week Begins to Take Shape

At the 1993 Annual General Meeting, a resolution was passed
directing AOHC to initiate and coordinate an annual Community
Health Week in Ontario.  As stated in the resolution, the goals of
this project are to encourage members "a) to work with their
elected representatives to proclaim the week locally and
provincially; b) to mount events to increase public awareness of
the determinants of health, health centres and their vision of
community health; and c) to take the lead in their particular
communities in getting participants from other organizations to
focus on community health and contribute to the week's events."

AOHC members voted to begin this initiative no later than 1994. 
Now that spring is well under way, it's time to start putting
details to our vision of a successful province-wide Community
Health Week, and begin to make that vision a reality.

Choosing the Dates

What activities will make up AOHC's Community Health Week?  To
begin with, we will designate a specific week as "Community Health
Week" in Ontario.  Once we have chosen the dates, we can work
together to get the week officially proclaimed by both the
provincial government and local municipalities.  In addition, a
special theme for this year's Week will be chosen as a way of
focusing the message we wish to send, and a special Community
Health Week logo can be designed.  Ideally, the theme or slogan
should be one concept that is easily communicated in a phrase or
sentence (e.g., "There's more to health than treating illness" or
"Healthy Choices for Healthy Communities").

Local Events

Apart from the proclamations, the main part of the Week will be the
local events held at each individual CHC and HSO.  Some examples of
events that can attract attention and participation from the
community:

* Hold an Open House at each centre with tours, sample health
promotion classes, refreshments, games, contests, etc.

* Organize free lectures or classes on community health promotion
topics with special guest speakers.

* Set up information booths or tables outside the CHC/HSO or at
malls, to give out health promotion literature, especially on
topics relating to the determinants of health.

* Organize daytime and/or evening social events (e.g., barbecue,
pot-luck dinner, dance, afternoon tea, etc.) to attract community
members to come and see the centre.

* Invite elected officials, dignitaries, and key members of the
community to participate in the publicity and events of Community
Health Week.

* Encourage other health reform groups to organize their own events
as part of the Week, and include a mention of their events in all
Community Health Week publicity.

The Community Health Week will likely be more effective on the
provincial level if there is some consistency to the events held at
each member centre.

Centralized Activities

To enhance the effect of this project, AOHC will coordinate the
centralized publicity of the Week, and hold a central "kick off"
event to attract the attention of provincial and national press. 
This will be an opportunity to invite elected officials to support
the event, and help to make the Week a more "official" provincial
event in the minds of the public.

The other area in which the AOHC can help centrally is in providing
Community Health Week assistance to individual CHCs and HSOs. 
Special Community Health Week paraphernalia (e.g., posters, flyers,
postcards, buttons, etc.) can be produced centrally and supplied to
individual centres.  Promotion Kits can also be prepared,
containing guidelines for media relations in general, and Community
Health Week organization in particular.  Individual centres will
also be able to obtain assistance and advice on organizing and
publicizing events.

Advantages

There are many advantages to having such a week, for the general
public, the health  centres and other organizations and groups of
health providers.  For the public, any increase in the level of
awareness provides health consumers with a better understanding
factors affecting health.  This would allow individuals to make
informed decisions on the type and quality of services they need to
stay healthy and have healthy communities.  Many people have an
intuitive understanding of the numerous factors that contribute to
health but few among the general public - or in the media, for that
matter - have heard the term "determinants of health" or know what
it means.

For AOHC members, the Week is all about increasing public awareness
of who we are, what we do, and what we believe in.  Many members of
the public are still not aware of the existence of CHCs and HSOs or
confuse them with such things as walk-in medical clinics. 
Similarly, outside our own sector, not many people know how AOHC
member centres can play an important role in the reform of 
Ontario's health system.

The Week can also be an excellent opportunity to create linkages
with other providers in the health and social services sector who
also provide services to health centres' clients.  It can be a good
starting point to build collaboration at the provincial, regional
and local levels.

This Week can also serve as a way for health centres to develop
their community and media relations skills.  While some centres
have been quite successful at attracting community and media
attention to their activities and services, many others have not.
Using the support material that AOHC will make available, health
centres can use Community Health Week to get their staff familiar
on ways to set up open houses, prepare press releases, conduct
interviews, and just generally blow their centre's horn!

We also intend to evaluate the week's events and the activities
undertaken at various levels to find out how we met the objectives
of this project and so that we can build on the experience for
future years.

Multi Service Agencies: the saga continues ...

The MSA, or Multi-service agency, is the most recent of government
initiatives in Long-term care reform. It represents the single
point of access and delivery for a full range of  long-term care
health and social services - facility and community-based.  Policy
documents were developed by the Ontario government under the
"Partnerships in Long Term Care" title.

In December of 1992, the Minister of Health identified local
District Health Councils (DHCs) across Ontario to be the leaders in
the planning  and implementation of MSAs.   DHC Long term care
steering committees were formed to work with the community to begin
the process. The Metropolitan Toronto DHC committee enlisted the
help of additional volunteers through the formation of an MSA
design work group.

Community Workshops

A number of community workshops on MSAs were held this past April
in each Toronto municipality.  These included: North York,
Scarborough, York, Rexdale, and downtown Toronto.  The workshops
were set up to look at the guiding principles of the shrimp
coloured "Partnerships" document  (also referred to as the salmon,
fuchsia, or rainbow coloured document) as well as to get feedback
from all stakeholders on a draft report that was prepared by the
MSA workgroup.

This report outlined three draft framework options.  The first
option outlines a Metro-wide association of 15 MSAs to serve a
designated geographical community. Each MSA would have the option
of developing smaller satellites.  The second framework is
comprised of geographical MSAs and ethno-cultural MSAs to serve a
specific ethno-cultural community.  The third option outlines one
centralized MSA with a number of satellites throughout Metro
Toronto.

CHC Concerns

The Fall 1993 edition of the CHC News identified a number of
concerns within the CHC community.  In the article entitled 
"Long-Term Care Reform - MSAs and CHCs" one concern noted was the
extent to which CHCs currently providing long-term care services
will be affected by MSA planning processes. Related concerns
include the potential for smaller agencies to be taken over by a
larger model and the possibility of a more centralized system
resulting in the erosion of neighborhood autonomy.

The community workshops were not the forum for addressing these
issues.  It was noted in the introduction that the specifics of
service delivery and displacement issues would not be covered.  As
the workshop progressed it became apparent that many related issues
had yet to be explored.  For example, there was some ambiguity as
to the role of an MSA vs. a satellite MSA.

Feedback Sought

At this stage, feedback was sought on very basic issues such as
those related to infrastructure.  What would be an appropriate mix
of geographic and/or ethno-cultural MSAs? What numbers would be
required to service Toronto's target population? What would be the
benefits of a centralized vs. a more decentralized system?

There was also discussion around acceptable methods for providing
specialized professional health services, placement coordination
service, services for children and French-Language services.  The
draft document provided the example of establishing two francophone
MSAs in Metro - one to serve francophones in the east and the other
to serve francophones in the west.  The participants of the
breakout group with which AOHC was involved did not feel they could
comment on this issues because they were not francophone.

Peering into the Future of Mental Health Reform

Steering Committee Seeks Feedback on 10 Year Vision

In June of 1993, Health Minister Ruth Grier announced Ministry
plans to reform the manner in which mental health services are
provided in Ontario.  In a document entitled "Putting People First:
The Reform of Mental Health Services in Ontario", the Minister
called for changes that would shift the emphasis from institutional
care to a system of community supports and services.  In setting
the direction for Mental Health Reform, the Minister identified as
a first priority the needs of the severely mentally ill, and set
out the reform's strategic directions with four priority areas:
case management, 24-hour crisis intervention, housing and
consumer/survivor and family initiatives.  These changes are
intended to tailor services to needs, enable people with mental
health problems to remain in the community whenever possible, and
encourage the development of community-based alternatives to formal
mental health services.

The Implementation Vision

Since then, the Ministry's Mental Health Reform Steering Committee
has been hard at work, formulating policy guidelines and working
out the details of how these reformed services will look and
operate.  Ontarians got their first look at some of the details
with the recent release of the draft document entitled
"Implementation Vision - Mental Health Reform".

Building on the "Putting People First" document, the Implementation
Vision provides a description of where the Ministry wants to be ten
years from now in relation to the system of community supports and
services for those with mental health problems.  As the first part
of a multi-year implementation plan, the Vision sets out the values
and broad directions of mental health reform, including policy
guidelines for priority areas.  The second part of the plan,
describing the specific action steps and tools required to achieve
that vision, will be completed over the next few months.

A Mix of Inpatient & Community Services

So how will the mental health system look in ten years?  "Our
proposed mental health reform strategy will result in the
development of a community supports and services system focused on
the consumer/survivor.  Ideally, this system will seamlessly
integrate and co-ordinate inpatient and community services."  The
Vision describes a scenario where in each region and district in
the province, an appropriate mix of inpatient and community
services will be available for those with mental health problems. 
Inpatient services will include assessment, treatment and
rehabilitation, as well as the provision of safety and security for
individuals who are a danger to themselves or others.  Community
services and supports will include case management, 24-hour crisis
response, supports for people living in integrated housing,
consumer/survivor and family initiatives, and psychiatric
assessment and treatment.  The Vision document sets out detailed
characteristics and guidelines for each of these community services
and supports.

Year Four a Benchmark

In addition to its ten-year vision, the paper also includes a
four-year vision as part of the reform evaluation process.  In
moving towards the changes proposed in this initiative, year four
has been selected as a benchmark year to assess the progress toward
the ten-year vision.  According to the paper, the mental health
system in year four will be a hybrid of services that currently
exist and the community supports and services system that is
proposed.

One of the key first elements that has been identified in
successfully moving towards the new system is the establishment of
a crisis response system.  The crisis response system "should serve
to intervene early in a crisis, provide a range of options to
resolve the crisis, and result in the reduction of inappropriate
use of hospitalization, thus decreasing reliance on inpatient
beds." As case management is likely to be one of the important
responses to a crisis, fully developed versions of both case
management and crisis response systems are seen as integral parts
of the four-year scenario.

Feedback Sought

In devising its Implementation Vision, the Mental Health Reform
Steering Committee consulted with many community members and
stakeholders, including consumers/survivors, families,
representatives from the ethno/racial community, those representing
the interests of women, underserviced/non-urban areas, and service
providers.  In addition, ongoing advice has been provided to the
Steering Committee by the Provincial Advisory Committee on Mental
Health Reform, composed of 38 external stakeholders.

With the release of its Implementation Vision, the Steering
Committee is again seeking comments from the public.  Accompanying
the position paper is a cover letter and questionnaire asking
interested individuals to identify the strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and barriers of the Implementation Vision.  While
the deadline for response to that particular survey was set at May
31, 1994, those who wish to obtain more information or offer
additional comments on the reform plan are encouraged to contact
Lynne Livingstone, Project Manager at (416) 327-8830.

Ministry Promotes Community Health Framework

... but can it make real changes?

Over the past few years AOHC has vigorously advocated the
development of a framework that would put into an overall context
the various government initiatives on health reform that were
announced by the Health Minister in January of 1992.  Last year,
the Ministry of Health announced the development of a "community
health framework" to respond to the recognized need for an overall
context.  As more information on this framework emerges, there are
hopeful signs that the government is attempting to move towards a
truly community-based health system.  Nevertheless, AOHC has
ongoing concerns about the eventual effectiveness of the framework.

Certainly the messages contained in the framework project's
newsletter ("Steps to Community Health") are encouraging.  The
first issue asks, "How does Ontario move from the system it has now
to one that promotes community health?  How can we persuade people
accustomed to seeking treatment that health is not something
dispensed by health professionals - it is something they themselves
can help build and maintain?  What steps should the province take
to build healthy communities?"

In its search for answers to these questions, the Ministry predicts
that the community health framework will help Ontario to:

* develop a clear picture of its health status and needs;

* move from an illness-based system to one that promotes health;

* involve people in taking charge of their own health and in
building healthy communities;

* address the broader determinants of health; and

* coordinate the wide range of primary and community health
services into an integrated system.

To guide the framework, the Minister of Health has appointed an
External Advisory Committee, to "advise the Minister on community
health reform issues, and support and facilitate implementation of
overall health reform."  Among the members of this committee are
several individuals active in the community health movement.  In
addition, five working groups have been formed to examine the
following topics: community health profile, population health
promotion, alternative primary health care models, funding
methodologies, and system integration.

While the initiative and stated intentions of the community health
framework appear to going in the right direction, AOHC has ongoing
concerns about the process and the likely outcome of this
initiative.  To begin with, the development of the framework seems
to have arisen largely from a need to keep a political promise, and
as such may lack the real will to lead to significant changes.  To
sustain the  initiative over the long haul, not only must it have
the support of all political parties, it critically needs the
support of the top level of the bureaucracy in the Ministry of
Health.  On a daily basis, decisions on key health matters continue
to be made "the old way" which jeopardizes any real
conceptual/philosophical shift to a different way of health service
delivery and any practical reallocation of resources to the
community.

AOHC also questioned the effectiveness of the process established
for the framework and met with Ministry representatives to voice
these concerns.  AOHC is concerned that the External Advisory
Committee (EAC) appears to have a reactive rather than a proactive
role, and the rationale for the committee's composition is not
clearly understood. The EAC's role with regards to overall reform,
its relation to the working groups as well as the committee members
level of accountability are also ambiguous.   AOHC expressed
similar concerns about roles and accountability for the working
groups, and questioned the advisability of the discreet packaging
of health reform topics, and the limitations that have been imposed
on some working groups' scope of discussion.

Although there has been some improvement to the process, AOHC
remains convinced that, in order to truly effect change, steps must
be taken to ensure that all stakeholders in the Ontario health
system have a clear understanding of the goals of the community
health framework.

WORKING GROUP MAKES PROGRESS ON PAY EQUITY

Despite recent information that the current PE legislation requires
amendments to include centres established after Jan. 1/88, the AOHC
Pay Equity (PE) project is moving closer to its goals.  After a fax
survey to determine each CHC's level of participation, AOHC
gathered and submitted the remaining notice forms to the Pay Equity
Commission to obtain orders to proceed by the proxy method.

The PE Working Group met in Toronto in early May to clarify goals,
determine deadlines, and decide on the best way to proceed with the
group approach.  Thanks to extensive work done by the South East
Region's PE Committee, the best job evaluation tool for CHCs has
been identified, modified, and translated, and will be made
available to all member centres at the AOHC Annual Conference in
Ottawa. In addition, the Working Group is preparing material and
doing research to determine the most suitable proxy organization to
use.  Barring unforeseen delays, it is hoped that the request can
be sent to the chosen proxy organization by the end of June.

GOALS REAFFIRMED AT ONTARIO HEALTH PROVIDERS ALLIANCE RETREAT

AOHC continues to actively participate in the activities of the
Ontario Health Providers Alliance (OHPA), a collaboration of
eighteen (18) employer and other associations who receive direct
provincial funding to deliver health services in Ontario.  On May
17th, the Alliance held an all-day retreat in Toronto to reaffirm
its terms of reference and underlying principles, and to develop a
process for working together and making decisions.

The retreat proved to be a valuable and positive exercise. All
participants acknowledged a need for collaboration on issues common
to all. In attendance were either the chief elected or chief staff
officer of each participating organization. The participants
developed a list of shared motivations for their organization's
participation as well as common issues for further exploration.
Much of the time was spent on discussing ways of working together
effectively, establishing consensus on a decision making process
and an identification of the criteria for determining appropriate
issues for OHPA's consideration.  After these various processes
were agreed upon, the group used a test issue to evaluate the
decision-making process.

Sonny Arrojado, AOHC Executive Director has been named OHPA
chairperson for the remainder of 1994.  During that time AOHC will
also provide the staff support for Alliance meetings and
correspondence.

AOHC MEDIALINK CONTINUES TO SPREAD THE WORD

In its first six months, the AOHC MediaLink project has made
significant progress on a number of fronts.  Among other things,
AOHC MediaLink has:

* Completed surveys of all Ontario media re: health
knowledge/interest, and of all AOHC member centres re: their
knowledge and current use of the media.

* Done a daily scan of all Ontario radio, TV and press activity re:
health issues, and distributed relevant articles to member centres.

* Established a 24-hour "Phone Quote" line to inform media of AOHC
responses and opinions on current health issues.

* Developed a targeted Ontario media list of over 450 contacts.

* Sent monthly mailings to targeted media.

* Assisted several CHCs with press releases and media event
orchestration.

* Organized the media strategy for the AOHC Annual Conference.

* Created several opportunities for interviews and articles on
AOHC/CHC activities.

At its last meeting, the AOHC Board voted to continue the MediaLink
Project for an additional six months, subject to availability of
funding.  In addition to working with AOHC's Communications Officer
to continue current initiatives, several new projects have also
been proposed, including the production of regular Public Service
Announcements, and increased opportunities to train member centres
in media relations, perhaps in the form of two-day training
seminars.

IN MEMORY OF JOHANNA OOSTERVELD

AOHC was saddened to learn that Johanna Oosterveld, Executive
Director of the North End Community Health Centre in Halifax,
passed away on May 16, 1994. Johanna played a lead role in the
development of community health clinics across Nova Scotia, gaining
a national reputation for her work both on the provincial level and
as a key player on the national community health centre network. 
She was a participant in the restructuring process for Nova
Scotia's health care system, serving on various committees and task
forces.  Her accomplishments outside the health field were equally
impressive, and included extensive work with a wide variety of
community and charitable organizations.  Her many contributions
speak of an energy and a generosity that will be missed by many.

More Than Words

"Prevention":  Prevention is health protecting behaviour. The
primary goal of health-protecting behaviours is the removal or
avoidance of encumbrances to growth, maturation, fulfillment, and
self-actualization. The three levels of prevention as traditionally
defined in health are as follows:

"Primary Prevention":  reduces the likelihood of a disease or
disorder developing in a person. Primary prevention is generalized
health promotion as well as specific protection against disease. 
Primary prevention is the most desired preventative effort as it
spares the client the cost, discomfort, and threat to the quality
of life that illness poses.

"Secondary Prevention":  interrupts, prevents or minimizes the
progression of a disease, or irreversible damage from a disease, at
an early stage.  It comprises the early detection and treatment of
disease before irreversible damage has occurred.  Secondary
prevention consists of organized, direct screening efforts or
education of public to promote early case finding of individuals
with disease so that prompt prevention can be instituted to halt
the progress of the illness.

"Tertiary prevention":  focuses on the progression or damage in a
disease where such damage has already occurred irreversibly. 
Rehabilitation, the goal of tertiary prevention, is more than
halting the disease process itself; it is the restoring of the
individual to an optimum level of functioning within the
constraints of the disability.  Tertiary prevention begins early in
the period of recovery from illness and consists of such activities
as consistent and appropriate administration of medications to
optimize health.

Keiner wei&szlig;, was er kann und wozu er gut ist

<H2>GEHEIMNISVOLLER GEOGRAPH</H2>

Angenommen, bei einem Sektempfang gibt sich einer der G&auml;ste als
Quantenphysiker zu erkennen: Wer w&uuml;rde da nicht vor Ehrfurcht erstarren
und sofort das Thema wechseln, um sich keine Bl&ouml;&szlig;e zu geben?
Was aber, wenn die Partybekanntschaft kein Quantenphysiker ist, sondern
Geograph? Das w&auml;re weniger problematisch, schlie&szlig;lich hatte jeder mal
Erdkunde in der Schule, mu&szlig;te drei Nebenfl&uuml;sse der Weser aufsagen und
den h&ouml;chsten Berg von Frankreich und hatte zu lernen, wo die Apfelsinen
wachsen. Das einzige, was einem jetzt noch schleierhaft sein kann, w&auml;re,
wie jemand mit solchem Wissen Geld verdient.
Wollte er das erkl&auml;ren, m&uuml;&szlig;te der neue Bekannte die Geographie
beschreiben, m&uuml;&szlig;te von Biotoppflege, Erosionsforschung und
Bodenverdichtung berichten, m&uuml;&szlig;te von Satellitenbildern erz&auml;hlen und
von Umweltgutachten, von Raumplanung und Dorferneuerung. Da er das schon
so oft hat herbeten m&uuml;ssen, k&ouml;nnte er unwirsch behaupten, Geographen
seien so etwas &auml;hnliches wie Geologen.
Zwar wissen l&auml;ngst nicht alle Menschen, da&szlig; Geologen Spezialisten f&uuml;r
den Aufbau der Erde sind, f&uuml;r die Bildung von Gesteinen und die Lage von
Bodensch&auml;tzen. Gerade deswegen st&ouml;&szlig;t ihr Beruf in der Gesellschaft auf
&auml;hnlichen Respekt wie der des Quantenphysikers. Indem er sich als Geologe
ausgibt, w&uuml;rde der Bekannte zudem eine Menge Zeit sparen, weil man ihn am
Tag nach dem Sektempfang ohnedies daf&uuml;r halten w&uuml;rde - ganz so, wie sein
Fris&ouml;r das tut oder seine alte Tante, auch wenn sie den Unterschied schon
f&uuml;nfmal erkl&auml;rt bekam.
Das Ansehen der Geographen leidet darunter, da&szlig; so viele Menschen fr&uuml;her
Erdkundeunterricht genossen oder erlitten haben und meinen, die moderne
Geographie sei dasselbe. Dummerweise gingen auch Personalchefs fr&uuml;her mal
zur Schule. Wer ihnen als Stellenbewerber den Job etwas erleichtern
m&ouml;chte, gibt sich am Besten gleich als Geologe aus. Als solcher wird er
zwar auch abgelehnt, aber der Personalchef h&auml;tte wenigstens das gute
Gef&uuml;hl zu wissen, wen er da wieder nach Hause geschickt hat.
Schuld am verschwommenen Berufsprofil ist, da&szlig; Geographen sich f&uuml;r alles
zust&auml;ndig f&uuml;hlen, womit sie so falsch nicht liegen. Denn ihre Ausbildung
streift au&szlig;er Mikroelektronik und indoiranischer Linguistik so ziemlich
alles, was Universit&auml;ten an F&auml;chern zu bieten haben. B&ouml;se Zungen
behaupten, Geographie studiere nur, wer seit einem mi&szlig;lungenen
Knallgas-Versuch am Gymnasium ein gebrochenes Verh&auml;ltnis zur
Naturwissenschaft habe. Oder f&uuml;r die Betriebswirtschaft nicht in Frage
kommt, weil vom Vater kein Gesch&auml;ft zu &uuml;bernehmen ist.
Wenn sie unter sich sind, bezeichnen sich Geographen selber als
Universaldilettanten. Das h&auml;lt sie nicht davon ab, &uuml;ber andere
Disziplinen zu spotten, wo man &uuml;ber unendlich dimensionale Hilbert-R&auml;ume
promovieren kann, ohne zu wissen, wie man einen Dreisatz rechnet. Zu
Fachidioten k&ouml;nnen aber selbst Geographen werden, die letzten
Spezialisten f&uuml;rs Ganze: Einer schrieb bestimmt eine Diplomarbeit &uuml;ber
die Verteilung der Imbissbuden in einer Grossstadt. Man sagt das nicht gerne.
Aber auch das ist Geographie.<P>

<A NAME="ein">
<H2>Gr&uuml;nde, jetzt im Web aktiv zu werden</H2>

Das World Wide Web (W3) ist der Teil des nach wie vor exponentiell wachsenden
Internet, der die gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Steigerungsraten aufweist. An der Uni
Trier werden heute (November 95) 4-6 Webserver betrieben. Unterstellt man
eine Ankopplung an die externe Entwicklung, so k&ouml;nnen es zwei Jahren
durchaus 50 sein.

F&uuml;r die Annahme, da&szlig; sich die Entwicklung weiter beschleunigen
wird, sprechen verschiedene Fakten:

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>Ein weltweites Informationssystem erf&uuml;llt wichtige Funktionen
in der heutigen globalen Informationsgesellschaft. Die
flexible und erweiterungsf&auml;hige W3-Technologie scheint sich als
Tr&auml;ger der globalen Vernetzung durchzusetzen. Mit der Zunahme der
Vernetzung steigt also auch die Bedeutung des World Wide Web.<P>

<LI>Die Medien haben Gefallen an Begriffen wie &quot;Internet&quot;,
&quot;Datenautobahn&quot; oder &quot;World Wide Web&quot; gefunden.
Gesch&auml;ftsleute und Gesch&auml;ftemacher
wittern ihre Chancen und immer gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Teile der Bev&ouml;lkerung
werden auf das Internet losgelassen. Unseri&ouml;se Werbung schildert das
Internet als eine Art M&auml;rchenland, in dem alle Tr&auml;ume wahr werden.
In dieser Modewelle mitsurfend, werden viele passive Web-Teilnehmer
das Bed&uuml;rfnis haben, sich selbst zeitgem&auml;&szlig; zu 
pr&auml;sentieren. Dazu bietet die eigene &quot;Homepage&quot; die besten
M&ouml;glichkeiten.<P>

<LI>Software, die zum Erstellen von W3-Dokumenten ben&ouml;tigt wird, steht
kurz vor einem Sprung in der Bedienungsfreundlichkeit. Dies gilt vor allem
im Hinblick auf den meistbenutzten Web-Browser Netscape, der demn&auml;chst
Editierf&auml;higkeiten erhalten soll.<P>

<LI>Das Monopol der deutschen Telekom, die ma&szlig;geblich f&uuml;r die
innovationshemmenden, unverh&auml;ltnism&auml;&szlig;ig hohen 
Telekommunikationskosten hierzulande verantwortlich ist, f&auml;llt.<P>

<LI>Im Science-Bereich steigt die Anzahl von Publikationen im Internet,
womit oft lange Vorlaufzeiten wegfallen. Zeitschriften und viele andere
aktuelle Ressourcen sind online erreichbar. Schon werden Diplomarbeiten
als W3-Hypertext ver&ouml;ffentlicht und enthalten Quellenangaben in Form
von E-Mail-Adressen, W3-Referenzen oder NetNews-Artikeln.<P>
Nachdem seit einigen Jahren schon fast jeder Student seinen Word-Processor
bedienen kann, ist mittlerweile auch der allgemeine studentische
Kenntnisstand im Bereich der elektronischen Kommunikation betr&auml;chtlich
gestiegen. Dies wird zun&auml;chst zu einem verst&auml;rkten studentischen
Engagement im Web f&uuml;hren, womit ein Anschub f&uuml;r diesbez&uuml;gliche
Aktivit&auml;ten universit&auml;rer Institutionen (Lehrst&uuml;hle,
F&auml;cher, Fachbereiche) verbunden ist.
</UL>

Langer Rede kurzer Sinn: Das Web wird k&uuml;nfig eine wichtige Rolle im
Wissenschaftsbetrieb spielen. Die aktive Besch&auml;ftigung damit, d.h. die
Einrichtung pers&ouml;nlicher oder institutioneller Dokumenthierarchien ist
hier zur Zeit besonders lohnend: Einerseits gibt es noch relativ wenige
&quot;hausgemachte&quot; wissenschaftliche oder fachbereichsspezifische
Informationen auf diesem Server, andererseits ist Technik und know how
heute sehr bequem verf&uuml;gbar.<P>
Dieser Text soll dabei als Starthilfe dienen.
<P><HR><P>


<A NAME="browser">
<H2>Grundfunktionen der Web-Browser</H2>

Der Browser (&quot;Bl&auml;tterer&quot;) ist das Programm, mit dem man
sich virtuell im Web &quot;bewegt&quot;. Tats‰chlich werden dabei wechselnde
Verbindungen zu verschiedenen Servermaschinen hergestellt und Daten 
herangezogen.
<P>
Das <B>Abbrechen eines laufenden Datentransfers</B> - etwa weil er zu lange
dauern w&uuml;rde - ist eine wichtige Funktionalit&auml;t des Browsers. Die
Stop-Schaltfl&auml;che oder rotierende Weltkugel (Mosaic) dient zu diesem Zweck.
<P>
Oft sollen <B>W3-Adressen direkt angesteuert</B> werden, also ohne sich erst
von der voreingestellten Startseite aus dorthin durchzuhangeln. Die
&quot;Open&quot;-Funktion (bzw. Open Location, -URL) &ouml;ffnet daf&uuml;r ein
Eingabefenster. Alternativ kann die Location- bzw. URL-Statuszeile editiert
werden. URL, d.h. Universal Resource Locator, ist die W3-Adressenkonvention.
<P>
St&auml;ndig ben&ouml;tigt werden die Funktionen zum <B>erneuten Laden der
letzten und der aktuellen Seite</B> - &quot;Back&quot; und &quot;Reload&quot;.
<P>
Um <B>h&auml;ufig besuchte Adressen</B> leicht verf&uuml;gbar zu haben,
k&ouml;nnen mit Netscape Bookmarks (&quot;Lesezeichen&quot;) gesetzt werden.
Diese bilden eine Adressenliste, die bei Mosaic &quot;Hotlist&quot; hei&szlig;t
und dort &uuml;ber die entsprechenden Men&uuml;punkte verwaltet wird.
<P>
F&uuml;r Web-Autoren interessant sind die Funktionen zum <B>Betrachten und
Speichern von HTML-Dokumenten</B>, also den in der HyperText Markup Language
verfassten Texten, die den angezeigten Seiten zugrunde liegen. Dies kann mit
View/Edit-Source erreicht werden.
<P>
Schlie&szlig;lich kann der Browser auch in gewissen Grenzen <B>konfiguriert</B>
werden, z.B. mit den &quot;Options|Preferences&quot;-Men&uuml;s von Netscape.
Eventuell sind auch Einstellarbeiten au&szlig;erhalb des Browsers
notwendig - etwa um Hilfsprogramme zu integrieren oder um Mosaic den
Namen des Vermittlungsrechners mitzuteilen.
<P>
<I>Dieser Abschnitt ber&uuml;cksichtigt vor allem die beiden meistverbreiteten
Web-Browser: den Netscape Navigator, den angeblich 70-90% der W3-Teilnehmer
benutzen und Mosaic vom amerikanischen National Center for Supercomputing
Applications, der &quot;Urvater&quot; aller grafischen Web-Clients. Die
beschriebenen Funktionalit&auml;ten m&uuml;&szlig;ten aber bei allen Browsern
vorhanden sein.</I>
<P><HR><P>


<A NAME="html">
<H2>HTML-Dokumente erstellen...</H2>

ist ziemlich einfach und erfordert lediglich gewisse HTML-Kenntnisse und
einen Texteditor. HTML-Seiten bestehen aus Text und sog. Tags. Das sind in
spitzen Klammern eingeschlossene Kodes, die meist paarweise als Start- und
Ende-Tag erscheinen. Hier ein <A HREF="/easy.html">Beispiel</A>
f&uuml;r eine einfache HTML-Seite:
<PRE>
&lt;HTML>
&lt;HEAD&gt;
     &lt;TITLE&gt;Dies ist der Titel der Seite&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;

&lt;BODY&gt;
     &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/media/scrap.gif&quot;&gt;

     &lt;H1&gt;Eine gro&amp;szlig;e &amp;Uuml;berschrift!&lt;/H1&gt;

     Hier etwas normaler Text,
     gefolgt von einem Absatz.&lt;P&gt;

     &lt;A HREF="/luser.html#html"&gt;HIER&lt;/A&gt; geht's zur&amp;uuml;ck.
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>

Erkennbar sind Start- und zugeh&ouml;rige Ende-Tags mit vorangestelltem
Schr&auml;gstrich. Das HTLM-Tag umschlie&szlig;t das gesamte Dokument, das in
HEAD und BODY zweigeteilt ist. Leerzeichen und Zeilenende sind
&auml;quivalent - man kann f&uuml;r jedes Wort eine eigene Zeile
nehmen oder viele Leerzeichen dazwischensetzen und bekommt doch immer nur
ein Leerzeichen vom Browser dargestellt.<P>
Mit dem un&auml;ren &lt;P&gt;-Tag kann ein Absatz gesetzt werden. Das
Anker-Tag &lt;A&gt; enth&auml;lt die URL des referenzierten Dokuments und
umschlie&szlig;t den hervorgehobenen Text.
Oben erscheint die Grafik, die &uuml;ber das IMG-Tag eingebunden wird.<P>
Umlaute und Sonderzeichen d&uuml;rfen nicht direkt im Text vorkommen,
sondern m&uuml;ssen kodiert werden (siehe oben). Nur so ist sichergestellt,
da&szlig; sie von allen Web-Browser plattformunabh&auml;ngig korrekt 
dargestellt werden.<P>

Es gibt Programme, die das Erstellen von HTML-Texten erlauben, ohne
Kenntnisse dieser Sprache vorauszusetzen. Solche
<A HREF="http://www.ix.de/ix/raven/Web/9508/HTML-Editoren.Art.html">
HTML-Editoren</A> sind m&ouml;glicherweise eine Hilfe f&uuml;r
Anf&auml;nger, aber eigentlich nicht zu empfehlen. Ausnahmen sind z.B. der
Netscape Navigator Gold und v.a.
<A HREF="http://www.sausage.com">Hotdog</A>, der optimale HTML-Editor
(leider nur f&uuml;r Windows-Nutzer).

Mit HTML-Editoren und speziellen Tools ist es auch m&ouml;glich, formatierte
Texte, z.B. TeX oder M$-Word in m.o.w. &auml;hnlich dargestellte HTML-Seiten
zu konvertieren. 
<P><HR><P>


<A NAME="weiter">
<H2>Weiterf&uuml;hrende Verweise</H2>

Es gibt mittlerweile eine Vielzahl ausgezeichneter deutscher Anleitungen zum
Web-Authoring, wie 
<A HREF="http://www.jura.uni-sb.de/Hilfe/HTML.html">diese</A>
oder
<A HREF="http://www.boku.ac.at/htmleinf/">jene</A>.
Am besten gef&auml;llt das exzellente und umfassende Kompendium von
Stefan M&uuml;nz, das hier in einer zum Einstieg gut geeigneten
<A HREF="/primer.old/selfhtml.htm">&auml;lteren Version</A> liegt.<BR>
Umfassender ist die neuere Version als

<A NAME="local">
<H2>In medias res - eigene Webseiten auf diesem Server</H2>

Jeder Trierer Geo (==Kurzform f&uuml;r m&auml;nnliche und weibliche
Studierende sowie Vertreter und Vertreterinnen des akademisches Personals
im Fachbereich Geographie / Geowissenschaften an der Uni Trier) kann einen
Account auf dem diesem Webserver erhalten und dort eine Dokumenthierarchie
unterhalten.<P>

Dies k&ouml;nnen pers&ouml;nliche &quot;Homepages&quot; oder offizielle
Seiten sein.
Engagierte Studenten, die offizielle Seiten betreuen, m&uuml;ssen das
Einverst&auml;ndnis der entsprechenden Fachvertreter nachweisen.<P>

Nachdem man zun&auml;chst &uuml;ber Inhalt, Struktur, Gestaltung und
Features der beabsichtigten Seiten nachgedacht haben sollte, wird man
als n&auml;chstes die daf&uuml;r ben&ouml;tigten Komponenten (z.B. Texte
und Grafiken) EDV-verf&uuml;gbar machen (eingeben, scannen, kopieren)
und sich mit den zur gew&uuml;nschten Formatierung notwendigen
HTML-Elementen vertraut machen (z.B. Listen und &Uuml;berschriften).<P>

Nach einer E-Mail an den <A HREF="/account.html">Administrator</A>, die
Informationen zu Autor und Kontext der geplanten Dokumente enthalten
mu&szlig;, wird ein Account auf der Workstation <B>pgsun01.uni-trier.de</B>
eingerichtet. Der gew&uuml;nschte Username (8 Kleinbuchstaben) sollte
ebenfalls in der Email aufgef&uuml;hrt sein.<P>

Der Antragsteller wird &uuml;ber seinen neuen Account und das
Initialpa&szlig;wort ebenfalls per E-Mail informiert. Es sollte umgehend
ge&auml;ndert werden. Nun kann per telnet auf der PGsun01
gearbeit werden. Als ziemlich benutzerfreundlicher Editor empfiehlt sich
&quot;joe&quot; zum bearbeiten der HTML-Dateien. Die Tastenkombination
&lt;STRG-K&gt;H &ouml;ffnet das Hilfefenster in joe, das alles weitere
erkl&auml;rt.<P>

Die URL eines Benutzeraccounts auf dem Geo-Webserver lautet:
<PRE><B>
 http://www.geographie.uni-trier.de:8080/~username/
</B></PRE>
(username ist zu ersetzen)<P>

Die Dokumenthierarchie mu&szlig; im Verzeichnis WWW unter dem
Homeverzeichnis des Benutzers liegen, also bspw:
<PRE>
/home/username/WWW/index.html
/home/username/WWW/icons/hintergrund.gif
</PRE>
Alle Dateien m&uuml;ssen, damit sie vom Webserver gelesen werden
k&ouml;nnen, group readable, Verzeichnisse einschlie&szlig;lich
/home/username und WWW au&szlig;erdem group executable sein.<P>
Die HTML-Dateien sollten die Endung .html haben. Die Datei WWW/index.html
hat eine Sonderbedeutung: wer die URL wie oben genannt ausw&auml;hlt, bekommt
index.html angezeigt. Ohne index.html mu&szlig; die URL einschlie&szlig;lich
Dateiname angegeben werden. index.html ist die <B>Startseite</B> einer
Dokumenthierarchie.<P>

Beim Transfer von PC auf die Sun ist die unterschiedliche Realisation des
Zeilenendes unter M$-DOS/Windows und UNIX zu beachten. Textfiles sollten
deshalb mit ftp im ASCII-Modus transferiert werden, Grafiken und andere
Bin&auml;rfiles im BINARY-Modus. Ein ASCII-Transfer wandelt die Zeilenenden
entsprechend um.<P>

Hier ein <B>beispielhafter Bearbeitungszyklus</B>: Jemand hat einen Web-Account
auf der PGsun01 zugeteilt bekommen und m&ouml;chte seine unter Windows
erstellten Texte und Grafiken einbringen. Dazu werden Texte als ANSI-Text
(z.B. WinWord: &quot;nur Text&quot;) und Grafiken als .GIF oder .JPG
bereitgestellt. Das GIF-Format empfiehlt sich f&uuml;r kleine Grafiken, z.B.
Icons, JPEG f&uuml;r naturnahe, gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Bilder.<P>

Die Dateien werden per ftp auf die PGsun01 geschafft:
<PRE>
ftp pgsun01
login: <I>username</I>
password: <I>my_password</I>
ftp>cd WWW
ftp>ha
ftp>asci
ftp>mput *.htm
ftp>mput *.txt
ftp>bi
ftp>mput *.gif
ftp>mput *.jpg
ftp>by
</PRE>
Die weitere Bearbeitung erfolgt unter Solaris:
<PRE>
telnet pgsun01
login: <I>username</I>
password: <I>my_password</I>
[~] $ 
     (beim ersten login ein neues Passwort setzen!)
[~] $ passwd
Old password: <I>my_password</I>
New password: <I>my_new_password</I>
Re-enter new password: <I>my_new_password</I>
[~] $ cd WWW
[~/WWW] $ mv index.htm index.html
[~/WWW] $ joe index.html
     (editieren der Startseite)
[~/WWW] $ logout
</PRE>

Der Betrieb eines W3-Servers ben&ouml;tigt normalerweise wenig Ressourcen,
so da&szlig; es kaum jemals zu beschr&auml;nkenden Auflagen f&uuml;r die 
Web-Accounts kommen d&uuml;rfte. Voraussetzung ist allerdings, da&szlig;
diese nicht f&uuml;r andere Zwecke genutzt werden, z.B. als Datenablage.
Weitere Probleme k&ouml;nnte es mit Copyrightverletzungen und
anst&ouml;&szlig;igen Dokumenten geben, deshalb sollte der
<A HREF="netz-faltblatt.html">Leitfaden zur Nutzung von Datennetzen</A>
beachtet werden.<P>

Mit der Information auf diesen Seiten m&#246;chten wir Sie &#252;ber die Konzeption des 

Studiums der Fernerkundung im Rahmen der geographisch-geowissenschaftlichen 

Ausbildung in Trier informieren. Besonders verweisen m&#246;chten wir dabei auf den 

neuen Studiengang "<A HREF="/~rs/studium/umwelt/kurse.html">Angewandte 

Umweltwissenschaften</A>", in dessen Rahmen wir einen Schwerpunkt im Bereich des 

Umweltmonitoring durch integrierte Nutzung von Fernerkundungsdaten und Geographischen 

Informationssystemen setzen.<BR>Unsere derzeitige Forschungsaufgaben 

besch&#228;ftigen sich im Rahmen mehrerer

<A HREF="/~rs/research/demon.html">Drittmittelprojekte</A> mit der Nutzung von 

Satellitensystemen zu Langzeitstudien &#252;ber die Degradation mediterraner und arider 

&#214;kosysteme (Desertifikation), sowie der Inwertsetzung von Fernerkundungsdaten und 

Geographischen Informationssystemen f&#252;r Belange des Waldschutzes und des 

Forstmanagements.

Methodische Schwerpunkte liegen dabei in Entwicklungen zum Konzept der spektralen 

Entmischung, der Nutzung analytischer Reflexionsmodelle zur Beurteilung von 

Pflanzenvitalit&#228;t und -produktivit&#228;t und dem Einsatz neuronaler Netze zur 

Analyse hochaufgel&#246;ster Spektralmessungen<BR>

<HR size=5>
This page is an introduction to the World Wide Web for Earth Scientists.
It is not intended to be a resource listing, but to illustrate
the potential of the Web as an information retrieval system.
A second part of this document is <A HREF=
"http://atlas.es.mq.edu.au/users/pingram/s_earth.htm">The Soft Earth</A>,
which is more of a resource listing of software available on the Net.
<P>

You can peel The Virtual Earth off your browser and modify it to your
own requirements. This is to enable people to modify and maintain their
own versions of the Virtual Earth.  This will result in many variants of the
Virtual Earth, but you can click <A HREF=
"http://atlas.es.mq.edu.au/users/pingram/v_earth.htm">here</A> to obtain
the latest version of the original page.<P>

The <b>Virtual Earth</b> is <a href=
"http://www.df.lth.se/~micke/v_earth.html>mirrored</a> weekly at Mikael
Niklasson's page in Sweden.<p>

Some of the features used in this document are the mailto: and news: URL's.
The onus is on the user to ensure their browser is capable of a mailto:
procedure and is configured for the news: procedure.<P>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide
Web</A> is an initiative by the CERN organisation for a global
information retrieval system. If you know very little about the Internet,
then <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/bdgtti/">The Big Dummies
Guide to the Internet</A> is a good start, although there is a lot to read.
<P>
If you know nothing about the Web, then the on-line article by Hughes,
<A HREF="http://www.eit.com/web/www.guide/"> Entering
the World Wide Web</A> or the article by Torkington,
<A HREF="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gnat/www-primer.html">
The WWW Primer</A>, are good starting points. The USGS has <A HREF=
"http://info.er.usgs.gov:4444/train">Training Material</A> on the WWW
and Mosaic, plus an <A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/network/resources.html">
Internet Resources Page</A>. Telstra Corporation in Australia provides
some on-line documents on <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/guide.html">
Internet Guides and Papers</A> on the Internet and the Web. Another good
site for Internet Information is the <A HREF=
"http://www.geosc.uh.edu/anon.internet">Self Guided Tour of the Internet</A>
 at the University of Houston.
<P>
For more specific information on the Web you should read the
<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/faq/">FAQ for WWW</A>.
As Web connections are based on Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and URLs
are becoming a standard way of refering to connections on the Internet, then
browsing Tim Berners-Lee's article
 <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/Overview.html">
Uniform Resource Locators</A> may be a good idea.

General and time-wasting information abound on the Web. Included are
<a href="http://www.callamer.com/~rocks/home.html">Geology and the Magic
Eight Ball</a> where you can put a question to the Magic 8, <a href=
"http://www.helix.net/polar7/cc/default.html">CrossRoad CrossWords</a>, none
of which are geologically orientated, <a href=

<A NAME="part3.2"><H3>Web Searches</H3></A><P>

Early Web searches were based on Web Crawlers and other beasties.
<A HREF="http://web.nexor.co.uk/mak/doc/robots/active.html">Koster's List
of Beasties</A> lists 35 (at last count) different web searches. The modern
search engines are very sophisticated, and the data bases contain a large
ammount of searchable information.
The better ones are <a href="http://altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</a>
from Digital, <A HREF="http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/">Harvest</A>
from Colorado, and <A HREF="http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu">Lycos</A> from Carnegie
Mellon, <a href="http://metacrawler.cs.washington.edu:8080">MetaCrawler</a>,
<a href="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan</a> and <a href=

"http://agent6.lycos.cs.cmu.edu/lycos-form.html">Small Catalog Search</A>
with only 434K web pages.<P>

Other robots, worms, spiders and crawler sites include <A HREF=

gateway to the Web. It can help locate files on anonymous ftp sites around
the world. This site is the link to all the ArchiePlex servers.<P>

Nick Kew, who maintains the Satellite Imagery FAQ, has developed a new
service. He has integrated a threaded bulletin board with a searchable

the FAQ is at the <a href="http://clever.net/webthing/RS">InterFAQ</a>.<p>

Various sites are combining these various search engines into one web page.
NEXOR's <A HREF="http://pubweb.nexor.co.uk/public/cusi/doc/list.html">CUSI</A>
is a unified interface for several search engines, as is the <A HREF=
"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/meta-index.html">CUI/W3</A> page from University of
Geneva. Some all in one pages
give the ability to submit searches to a variety of engines divided
into a variety of categories like Software, People, News, Web. The
<A HREF="http://www.albany.net/allinone/">All In One Search
Engine Page</A> by William Cross and Albany Net is one such site, and another
is <A HREF="http://www.oimage.com/tools/search.html">SearchPlex</A>
from Oimage.
<p>

Many of the search sites listed above permit people to access their
search servers directly from their own site. It is possible to create
a web page which will present a forms based page to the requesting client,
and then submit the search request to the appropriate server for processing.
One such page is the <a href=

accessability of Geoscience resources on the internet. This is the
<A HREF="http://www.agso.gov.au/ngis/">Australian National
Geoscientific Information System</A> or @ngis.
It will be a new national geoscience information system. It
will not duplicate the current information, but will make geoscience
information and data more readily locatable and accessible by building
linkages between people and organisations who can provide the information
and those seeking it. The <A HREF=

<A HREF= "http://clunix.cl.msu.edu:80/weather/interactive.html">
US Weather Stations</A>, a clickable map of the U.S. with weather
stations, click on the desired station and get the current weather
conditions. Along similar lines is the <A HREF=

Summary: I haven't posted this in a while

    Frequently Answered Queries

                       GIS FAQ List (95-10-20)

    This is the list of frequently asked queries (FAQ) about Geographically
    Ignorant Systems (GIS) along with answers to these questions.  This
    FAQ is posted as a resource to the `comp.infosystems.gis' newsgroup
    which is connected to the GISL LISTSERVER mailing list.

    Netiquette
    ----------

    If someone asks a FAQ, please post the answer instead of emailing it.
    We all want to see your personal replies.

    If you have information that you think should be included in the FAQ,
    please e-mail the information to Lisa Nyman <lnyman@census.gov>
    and she  will decide if it is worthy of inclusion in the FAQ.

    If you believe that some information in the FAQ is wrong, keep it
    to yourself and seek professional help.  We are always right. 
    ______________________________________________________________________

 1.1: How do I get the FAQ list?

    The most current version is available over the WWW and
    via anonymous FTP in too many places to name here.  Go
    ask someone who already has a copy or take the time to learn
    Archie or WWW search tools.
    ______________________________________________________________________

 1.2: What is the difference between the newsgroup and listserv?

    The newsgroup comp.infosystems.gis is a Usenet special intrest news
    distribution scheme that allows individuals with access to Usenet to
    read and post articles and personal mail.  

    The listserv system is a mailing list of e-mail addresses which allows
    members to send messages and personal mail to the GIS-L mailing list.  
    GIS-L has members who really have nothing to contribute besides requests
    for some obscure boundary file format and who can't be bothered with
    learning  how to use a news reader.  The GIS-L mailing list is maintained
    by the listserv software at URISA for people like that.

    Articles and personal mail sent to either of the above will be sent to 
    the other so there is no need to post to both groups.

    Just ignore the following, it is false and useless information
    [PLEASE NOTE:  IF YOU READ GIS-L AND REPLY USING 'R', YOUR MESSAGE IS
                   SENT TO THE ENTIRE LIST, NOT JUST THE ORIGINAL SENDER OF
                   THE LETTER.  KNOW THY MAILER!]

    Please use abstract subject headings.  For example, 'Duh!' 
    is preferable to 'Need help doing overlay with ARC v6.1.1 on an SGI'. 

    When posting a job ad, some general subject heading is just fine.
    Since GIS-L is international, we can all waste our time reading
    about positions in Katmandu.  We have nothing better to do anyway.
    So, "Job" is preferable to "Digitizing Specialist- Buffalo-USA".
    ______________________________________________________________________

2.1: What in the world is a 'GIS'?

                What Is A Geographically Ignorant System (GIS)?

    An information system that is designed to barely work with data 
    referenced by obscure geographic coordinates.  It consists of extremely
    complicated algorithms and procedures which always result in
    a core dump.    
    Or: 
    A system for capturing, mutating, cooking, forging, destroying and 
    displaying data which are spatially referenced to something.

    ______________________________________________________________________

2.2: What colleges and universities offer coursework in GIS?

    Call some to find out.  Let us know.
    ______________________________________________________________________

2.3: What are the NCGIA anon ftp sites and what can be found there?

    The sites are always down, can you beleive they aren't earthquake proof?,
    so we don't bother to list them here.

    ______________________________________________________________________

 3.1: What are the United States map accuracy standards?

    There are far too many standards to name here.

    ______________________________________________________________________


Go figure the rest out yourself and leave us alone.
We're sick of answering all these questions anyway.

<HEAD><TITLE>Datennetze</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Ein Leitfaden zur verantwortungsvollen Nutzung von Datennetzen</H2>
<H3>f&uuml;r Mitglieder von Institutionen in Bildung und Wissenschaft</H3>  
<P>Datennetze sind ein Teil der Infrastruktur in Hochschulen und
Forschungseinrichtungen und dienen der digitalen Kommunikation mit Hilfe
von Rechnern. Sie stehen heute dem Forschungsbereich zur weltweit
offenen Verst&auml;ndigung zur Verf&uuml;gung. Ihre Nutzung unterliegt bestimmten
rechtlichen und ethischen Grunds&auml;tzen. Dieser Leitfaden soll diese
Regelungen einem gro&szlig;en Nutzerkreis bewu&szlig;t machen, um dadurch den
zweckgem&auml;&szlig;en und wirtschaftlichen Gebrauch dieses wertvollen Guts zu
f&ouml;rdern.</P> 
<H3>Grunds&auml;tze zur Nutzung der Datennetze</H3>
<P>Die Netze sollen der Gemeinschaft dienen. Der Mi&szlig;brauch selbst
durch eine kleine Gruppe von Netznutzern k&ouml;nnte das Ansehen der Netze in
ihrer Gesamtheit sch&auml;digen. </P>
<P>Nicht immer ist die pers&ouml;nlich optimale Nutzung auch global
optimal. Eine sorgf&auml;ltige Beobachtung des Netzverhaltens ist
erforderlich, damit Nachteile f&uuml;r die Gemeinschaft abgewendet werden
k&ouml;nnen und die Netzbelastung in vertretbaren Grenzen bleibt.</P>
<HR>
<H3>Leichtfertiger Gebrauch</H3>
<P>Die Netze sind relativ einfach zu nutzen: Mit nur wenigen Kommandos
kann ein Datentransfer rund um den Globus oder ein Nachrichtenaustausch
mit einer gro&szlig;en Zahl von Partnern ausgel&ouml;st werden.</P>
<P>Leicht verkennt der Nutzer die Komplexit&auml;t der von ihm ausgel&ouml;sten
Netzaktivit&auml;ten. Er sollte daher vorsichtig mit Netzaufrufen umgehen.
Auch wenn der Nutzer glaubt, die Netzwerkzeuge zu beherrschen, sollte er
bedenken, da&szlig; eine umsichtige Nutzung eine sorgf&auml;ltige und
kontinuierliche Anleitung voraussetzt.</P>
<P>Ein Beispiel f&uuml;r leichtfertigen Gebrauch stellt die Vergeudung von
Ressourcen durch einen zwar autorisierten, aber unbedachten Umgang mit
den Netzdiensten dar; diese gilt insbesondere f&uuml;r den Abruf von Daten
aus den USA, wenn diese in Deutschland bereits verf&uuml;gbar sind.</P>
<HR>
<H3>Es versteht sich von selbst, da&szlig; Dokumente zweifelhaften Charakters
in Netzen weder anzubieten noch nachzufragen sind.</H3>
<HR> 
<H3>Angemessene Nutzung </H3>
<P>Durch die Nutzung der Netze k&ouml;nnen</P>
<UL><LI>weltweite kooperative Projekte erm&ouml;glicht und durchgef&uuml;hrt,
</LI>
<LI>Herausgabe und Weitergabe von Forschungsberichten erheblich
beschleunigt,</LI>
<LI>die Aufwendungen f&uuml;r Reisekosten sowie Telefon- und Postgeb&uuml;hren
gemindert,</LI>
<LI>gemeinschaftliche Ressourcen (z.B. H&ouml;chstleistungsrechner)
&uuml;berregional genutzt,</LI>
<LI>an einer Stelle verf&uuml;gbare Daten weltweit abgefragt  sowie</LI>
<LI>die internationale Zusammenarbeit (z.B. auch bei der Bew&auml;ltigung
von Krisensituationen) schnell und unb&uuml;rokratisch organisiert </LI></UL>
<P>werden.</P> 
<H3>Unakzeptable Nutzung</H3>
<P>Insbesondere k&ouml;nnen nicht hingenommen werden:</P>
<UL><LI>fahrl&auml;ssige oder gar vors&auml;tzliche Unterbrechungen des
laufenden Betriebes;</LI>
<LI>die Verbreitung von f&uuml;r die Wissenschaft irrelevanten
Informationen;</LI>
<LI>die Belastung der Netze durch ungezielte und &uuml;berm&auml;&szlig;ige Verbreitung
von Informationen (Informationsverschmutzung);</LI>
<LI>der Versuch, ohne ausdr&uuml;ckliche Autorisierung Zugang zu
Netzdiensten -- welcher Art auch immer -- zu erhalten;</LI>
<LI>die Verletzung der Integrit&auml;t von Informationen, die &uuml;ber die Netze
verf&uuml;gbar sind;</LI>
<LI>der Eingriff in die individuelle Arbeitsumgebung eines Netznutzers;</LI>
<LI>jede Art des Mith&ouml;rens von Daten&uuml;bermittlungen, des St&ouml;berns in
fremden Datenbest&auml;nden oder der Weitergabe von unabsichtlich erhaltenen
Angaben &uuml;ber Rechner und Personen.</LI></UL>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>Wenn Mi&szlig;br&auml;uche sich h&auml;ufen sollten wird der Zugang zu den
Netzen zuk&uuml;nftig nicht mehr so freiz&uuml;gig wie heute m&ouml;glich sein, sondern
mit formalen H&uuml;rden (z.B. Zweck- oder Bef&auml;higungsnachweisen) verbunden
sein; au&szlig;erdem ist ein Verlust von allgemein zug&auml;nglichen Diensten zu
bef&uuml;rchten.</STRONG></P>
<HR> 
<P>Obwohl keine Nutzungs&uuml;berwachung oder gar Zensur erfolgt, sind die
Netzbetreiber gehalten, mi&szlig;br&auml;uchliche Nutzung zu unterbinden und bei
Bekanntwerden zu verfolgen.</P>     
<H3>Solidarit&auml;t</H3>
<P>Die Teilnahme an einem offenen, weltweiten wissenschaftlichen
Datennetz und der freiz&uuml;gige Zugang zu vielen damit verbundenen
Dienstangeboten ist ein Privileg f&uuml;r die Wissenschaft. Jeder Nutzer
sollte sich darum solidarisch verhalten, damit dieses Prinzip erhalten
bleibt.</P>
<P>Solidarisches Verhalten bedeutet insbesondere, sich bewu&szlig;t zu
machen, wo die Inanspruchnahme des Netzes durch den Einzelnen die
Interessen anderer Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft ber&uuml;hrt. Je h&ouml;her
entwickelt dieses Bewu&szlig;tsein ist, desto weniger wird der Netzbetreiber
gezwungen, formale Reglementierungen und Einschr&auml;nkungen einzuf&uuml;hren.
Wegen der hohen Komplexit&auml;t des Netzes mu&szlig; der Benutzer in seinem
Verhalten durch Betriebsregelungen unterst&uuml;tzt werden.</P>
<P>Dar&uuml;ber hinaus gelten selbstverst&auml;ndlich gesetzliche Regelungen
(z.B. die Fernmelde- und Datenschutzgesetze), die im Falle eines
Versto&szlig;es greifen. Unabh&auml;ngig von rechtlichen Folgen mu&szlig; der Nutzer sich
dessen bewu&szlig;t sein, da&szlig; ein Mi&szlig;brauch des Netzes einen ernsten
Sachverhalt darstellt, der mit weitreichenden Schadensfolgen auch f&uuml;r
andere verbunden sein kann.</P>           
<H2>Betrieb und Weiterentwicklung der Netze</H2> 
<H3>Professioneller Betrieb</H3>
<P>Nutzer und Betreiber von Datennetzen m&uuml;ssen sich kooperativ und
professionell, d.h. sachgerecht, verantwortlich und wirtschaftlich
verhalten. Das schlie&szlig;t f&uuml;r die Betreiber die Pflicht ein, die Benutzer
&uuml;ber die M&ouml;glichkeiten und Grenzen zu informieren, und f&uuml;r die Benutzer,
diese Informationen zur Kenntnis zu nehmen und zu beachten.</P> 
<H3>Weiterentwicklung</H3>
<P>Datennetze sind auf absehbare Zeit aber auch Gegenstand von
Forschung und Entwicklung; die Weiterentwicklung der Netze und
Netzdienste erfordern Erprobungen in Weitverkehrsnetzen. Unbeherrschte
Experimentierlust w&uuml;rde die "normale" Benutzung beeintr&auml;chtigen und
dadurch  nicht nur einzelnen Nutzern schaden, sondern auch das Ansehen
einzelner Netzbetreiber oder der Netze insgesamt gef&auml;hrden. Daher ist
gr&ouml;&szlig;te Sorgfalt und Vorsicht angezeigt, wenn neue Dienste erprobt
werden. Nachl&auml;ssigkeit auf diesem Gebiet ist unverantwortlich und wird
nicht hingenommen. </P>
<P>Die Nutzer m&uuml;ssen aber wissen, da&szlig; trotz allen Bem&uuml;hens St&ouml;rungen
aus diesem Grund nicht ganz auszuschlie&szlig;en sind; sie werden daher um die
n&ouml;tige Toleranz gebeten.</P> 
<H2>Nutzen und Kosten von Datennetzen f&uuml;r Bildung und Wissenschaft</H2>
<H3>Synergie</H3>
<P>Institutionen in Bildung und Wissenschaft setzen Datennetze als
selbstverst&auml;ndlichen Bestandteil der Informationstechnik ein. Datennetze
erm&ouml;glichen es, schnell, flexibel und freiz&uuml;gig durch ‹bermittlung von
Dokumenten, Daten und Programmen weltweit miteinander zu kommunizieren.
Dadurch wird die Synergie in der internationalen wissenschaftlichen
Arbeit in bisher kaum vorstellbarer Form verbessert.</P> 
<H3>Aufwand</H3>
<P>Datennetze in Bildung und Wissenschaft sind ein wertvolles
allgemeines Gut, das mit erheblichem Aufwand eingerichtet wurde. Hierzu
z&auml;hlen nicht nur die gro&szlig;en finanziellen Anstrengungen der &ouml;ffentlichen
Hand, sondern auch die unsch&auml;tzbaren Investitionen an Arbeitsaufwand und
Kreativit&auml;t von Fachleuten sowohl im &ouml;ffentlichen Bereich als auch in
der Wirtschaft. So dauern beispielsweise die Abstimmungsprozesse in der
internationalen Standardisierung seit &uuml;ber zwei Jahrzehnten an. Wie auch
bei anderen Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen erfordert das Angebot eines
sicheren und effizienten Betriebs tagt&auml;glich sorgf&auml;ltige Pflegearbeit im
weltweiten Verbund.</P> 
<HR> 
<H2>Sieben Verhaltensregeln</H2>
<OL><LI><STRONG>Informieren Sie sich &uuml;ber Netzanschl&uuml;sse, Dienste,
Regelungen und Zust&auml;ndigkeiten und halten Sie sich auf dem laufenden.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Beachten Sie die lokalen Betriebs- und Verhaltensregeln;
respektieren Sie die in anderen Teilen der Datennetze abweichenden
Regelungen.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Bedenken Sie, da&szlig; Sie Teil einer Solidargemeinschaft sind
und Ihr Tun der Gemeinschaft nicht schaden darf.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Melden Sie Defizite wie z.B. technische M&auml;ngel,
unabsichtlich erhaltene Informationen oder erkannte Sicherheitsl&uuml;cken
unverz&uuml;glich.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Sprechen Sie mit einem f&uuml;r das Netz Verantwortlichen,
bevor Sie neue Netzdienste nutzen.  Einerseits gilt: Fehlverhalten
ist kein Kavaliersdelikt! Andererseits k&ouml;nnen innovationsfreudige
Nutzer zur Weiterentwicklung der Netze beitragen.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Sch&uuml;tzen Sie sich und Ihre Ressourcen durch ‹berwachung
des Zugangs zu Ihrem Rechner, Verschl&uuml;sselung von vertraulichen Daten,
sorgf&auml;ltige Verwahrung Ihrer Authentifizierungsschl&uuml;ssel sowie Kontrolle
Ihrer Eintragungen in Directory- und Name-Servern.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Beachten Sie die Verh&auml;ltnism&auml;ssigkeit Ihres Tuns in
Hinblick auf den zu erreichenden Zweck.</STRONG></LI></OL>
<HR> 
<H2>Interessengemeinschaft</H2>
<P><B>Bildung und Wissenschaft k&ouml;nnen und wollen auf die nunmehr
verf&uuml;gbaren und noch weiter expandierenden weltweiten Netze nicht mehr
verzichten. Diese Tatsache vereint alle an den Netzen Beteiligte -
Nutzer, Betreiber und Geldgeber - in einer Gemeinschaft, in der
gegenseitiges Verst&auml;ndnis und R&uuml;cksichtnahme geboten sind. Es w&auml;re
unverantwortlich, durch leichtfertiges Handeln und un&ouml;tige
Konfrontationen untereinander das f&uuml;r alle wertvolle Gut der Datennetze
zu gef&auml;hrden.</B></P> 
<H3>Weitergehende Informationen</H3>
<P>Die Netzbetreiber, insbesondere die Rechenzentren, halten
weitergehende Informationen (Betriebsregelungen, Dienstekataloge,
Nutzeranleitungen) f&uuml;r ihre Nutzer bereit.</P>
<P>‹ber einschl&auml;gige Literatur und international erreichbare Netze und
Netzdienste informiert Sie auch der DFN e.V., Gesch&auml;ftsstelle Berlin,

<LI>10. Juli 95: Der <EM>GeoServer</EM> wird freigegeben. Ein NCSA-httpd und
verschiedene Seiten existieren zwar schon seit Herbst '94, aber ich
hatte keine Zeit, mich darum zu k&uuml;mmern. Die Idee einer B&uuml;ndelung

Willkommen auf der ersten hessischen Startseite an der rheinland-pf&auml;lzischen  Westgrenze. Also, alle 
Hessen sollten sich angesprochen f&uuml;hlen und wenn sie interessante hessenrelevante Adressen haben, sie 
mir per E-Mail (Briefkasten siehe unten) zuschicken. Die Links habe ich in zwei Kategorien eingeteilt: erstens
"What&#180;s hot" (des sinn die schee lings) und zweitens "What&#180;s not?" (des sinn die annern, die wo net so schee sinn).
<p>
Also viel Spa&szlig; auf MEINER Seite!

So, das wichtigste ist nat&uuml;rlich, wie komme ich nach Hessen? Nat&uuml;rlich 
durch das <a href="http://www.frankfurt-airport.de">Gateway to Europe</a>
</p>
Das zweitwichtigste ist nat&uuml;rlich, was stelle ich in Hessen an? Jedes Kind wei&szlig; 
doch, nicht erst seit bravotv, da&szlig; Frankfurt die Techno-Metropole ist.
Also ganz schnell auf die <a href="http://www.techno.de/camelsilverpage/index.html">Silverpage</a> 
klicken und sich die deutschen Partydates runterziehen!

Hier geht es zur <a href="http://www.aol.com/missgermany/">Miss Germany</a> 
eine hessische Sozialp&auml;dagogikstudentin! Das Problem ist aber, da&szlig; wir

    The Cavanaugh Parent Connection meets weekly on Wednesday afternoons from
    1-3 p.m. We discuss various topics pertaining to children, such as school
    work , conferences, parenting issues and learning styles. We also discuss
    ways to be supportive and involved in our children's education. We seek to
    have a warm supportive atmosphere where parents can feel comfortable. Group
    meetings often include guest speakers. So come and join us for a relaxing
    informal afternoon.

Elizabeth M. Jones and I am currently employed as a K-5
Mathematics Specialist for Walnut School, Lansing, MI.  My
hobbies include tap dancing and exploring computers (inside and

don't have the time or energy to keep up.  I danced in my first
recital in May, 1995 at the young age of 40-something.

In 1973 we fell in love and later married in 1984.  Together we

<BODY>
During the 1992-93 school year Otto began a restructuring effort to create smaller groupings of students and teachers.  At that time we changed over to the "teaming" concept. The sixth grade had always been arranged in teams with common students and common planning times. With the desire to create a school within a school the seventh and eight grade students and teaches were also placed on teams. There are presently 3 sixth grade teams, 2 seventh grade teams, and 3 eighth grade teams. The teams consist of the four core subjects: Math, Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies, plus Special Education and Elective teachers. This format has allowed us to follow more closely the needs of our students and begin to plan cooperatively on intergrated curricular units.

We have also changed our school day by eliminating a fifteen minute homeroom and creating a lunch/transition period. This allowed us not to have lunch fall in the middle of a class period and it also provided for a 20 minute time period for team projects, study time, or remediation.

We are exploring block scheduling and a further restructured day to allow for team planning and collegial time.

<BODY>
<P>Otto is a P.D.S.  Pretty Darn Super?  Probably Doing Something? How about Providing Discipline Standards?  Bingo! All of the above, and more. Otto is a Professional Development School, affiliated with Michigan State University in a partnership venture aimed at exploring and enhancing the way we teach and the way students learn. 

<P>We began this partnership back in 1989, optimistic about the opportunities which an influx of money and resources would bring us. The rewards have been slow, but steady.  Some of our projects worked well; some were painful learning lessons.  Growth in education is often hard to measure, but we can point to activities going on at Otto that would not be happening if our partnership did not exist.

<P>Our technology team, which is producing and maintaining this web site, is a prime example. At least a dozen teachers have been pushing the limits to learn how to take advantage of technology in the classroom and to train our students to use it effectively. The financial resources from MSU, while never enough, have still helped to provide some of the hardware, and phone connections that are allowing us onto the entrance ramp of the internet highway. 

<P>Ottoís science department has been greatly strengthened by its ties with MSU.  Thanks to grant money brought in by MSU professor Jim Gallegher, our science curriculum is lively and interactive.  The entire science faculty has been involved in making the study of science relevant and fascinating to our youngsters. 

<P>It took several years of false starts, and lots of planning, but the Peer Mediation program is finally up and running. You can read all about it in the section of this web page dedicated to that program. Otto is proud of the staff and kids who are making this daydream a reality. Conflict exists everywhere, and we think that learning to handle conflict in constructive ways is as important a skill for our students to learn as any of the academic disciplines. 

<P>Teacher education is a large part of any Professional Development School program.  In particular the education of new teachers is not complete without the guidance and mentorship of experienced teachers.  Otto currently has 9 full time interns from Michigan State, and we are like proud mama hens watching our chicks develop into fine teachers, ready to take their places in classrooms anywhere and everywhere.  

<P>The Otto faculty is full of ideas, hopes, and dreams for our school and our students. Our PDS affiliation has helped to bring many of those ideas and hopes out in the open for discussion, dissection, and sometimes strong debate. The ever-changing political climate in Michigan may bring our partnership to a halt in the sooner rather than later future.  But as with any lifelong learning experience, many of us are better teachers as a result of our collaboration efforts. We also think MSU is a better institution as a result of its work with Otto.

<BODY>
Otto's Library Media Center is committed to preparing our students to be life-long learners by providing them with the tools to access information in a thorough and efficient manner. This has been the LMC's mission statement for the past four years.<BR>
<P>
Our society has moved squarely into the information age. Otto students need to have the skills to cope in such a society. The LMC exposes our students to the latest technology to access the information, but our job cannot stop there. Teaching the skills necessary to process the many bits of data confronting our students is our larger mission. The LMC staff work in tandem with the teaching staff to integrate our resources  into the curricular needs of the classroom.<BR>
<P>
Among the services and resources provided are an automated card catalog and circulation system, interlibrary loan, technology inservices and trouble shooting, electronic magazine indexes and encyclopedias and Internet access. The LMC has a collection of approximately 13,000 print and non-print resources. We service 1,000 students and 75 staff members. There is one full time and one quarter time Library Media Specialist.<BR>
<P>

I.<A NAME="INTRODUCTION"> INTRODUCTION</A>
<P>
The Lansing School District plan for instructional technology (IT) will define
and describe a course of action to maximize the applications of technology
for the support and enhancement of instruction. It is understood that technology
will improve the delivery of instruction. This plan will propose directions
that will make the best possible use of available technologies. Instructional
technology should be capable of improving individual productivity for all
students and teachers. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">

III.<A NAME="HISTORY"> HISTORY</A>
<P>
In April 1993, the IT Study Committee was formed to identify Lansing School
District Instructional Technology problem areas as a means to organize the
search for solutions. This involved the review of personal interview transcripts,
survey results and insights gained from the members' experiences. Analysis
of the information available to the Committee led to the conclusion that
several areas of need existed and should be addressed.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<A HREF="#TABLE">Back to top</A>
<P align="center">
IV. <A NAME="VISION">VISION</A>
<P align="center">
<STRONG>Mission Statement</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>The primary mission of the Lansing School District is to nurture,
educate, and graduate students who are competent communicators, skillful
problem-solvers, and critical thinkers; who are civic-minded and prepared
to make ethical decisions; and who have a career motivation, a knowledge
of our global and technological society, an appreciation for the arts and
humanities, and a desire for lifelong learning.</STRONG>
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P align="center">
<STRONG>Vision for Technology</STRONG> <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
<STRONG>In pursuit of the mission of the Lansing School District, it is our
vision to acquire and support the use of technology as a means of giving
students and staff access to information, increasing organizational productivity
and effectiveness, and preparing students for success in adult roles.</STRONG>
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
<STRONG>It is further our vision to use technology to gain access to resources
for learning and management and support functions in a flexible, timely,
and cost-effective manner.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
Envision an educational setting rich with Instructional Technology resources
which give the students of the Lansing School District access to unlimited
information. Students have access to classroom and library media center resources
and reference materials from locations around the world. Within classrooms,
individual students use computers to work on assignments, receive remediation
and enrichment, or pursue independent studies. Groups of students working
on several computers work together to create multimedia documents to be shared
worldwide based on what they learn both on-line and off-line
<P>
.
<P>
While working, our students receive "total-group" instruction when necessary.
Technology labs provide a setting for staff to receive necessary
technology-related training. These labs and the library media centers are
available at "non-instructional" times ( before school, lunch, after-school,
evenings and Saturday mornings) for students, staff and the community. Students
of the Lansing School District are encouraged to become not only "lifelong,"
but "full-time" learners as well. Instructional technologies remove the
restrictions of the 7:30am - 3:00pm instructional day for our students and
community, as educational data and resources are available 24 hours-a-day.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
Using satellite transmissions, our students are not restricted to course
offerings within their buildings, but are active participants in discussions
and learning from classrooms around the city, nation, and world. Cable
transmissions deliver current news stories, teacher lesson plans, and student
worksheets directly to the classrooms. Ongoing information updates are readily
accessible in virtually every content and subject area. Our students no longer
rely on dated and outmoded manuals, but have access to "<EM>living
textbooks</EM>." <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
The students of the Lansing School District are provided with the vehicles
by which they can travel the "information superhighway." When we tell our
students "The world is at your fingertips," we mean it literally! The
technologically savvy "Nintendo Generation" of students sitting before us
in our classrooms eagerly embrace new worlds of information and adventures.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
Educators provide assistance to our students in gathering the desired
information. They teach and provide our students with the necessary and
appropriate skills for processing and synthesizing vast amounts of available
information once it is accessed. A fully trained, technologically competent
professional staff enables our students to be successful, productive members
of society, with employable skills to usher them into the 21st Century.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<P>
Teachers assist students by having records and information for planning in
their classrooms. Having that data easily accessible to teachers facilitates
communication with families. Equipment in the classroom (e.g., projection
panels or display devices) helps students see teacher demonstrations of
experiments and permits teachers to be sure that students recognize and learn
important concepts. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<A HREF="#TABLE">Back to top</A>
<P>
V. <A NAME="STAFF">STAFF DEVELOPMENT</A>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the Lansing School District to provide adequate
technology training to all staff members. It is also imperative that sufficient
time be provided to assure that the necessary training can occur.
<UL>
  <LI>
    Technology training will be an integral component and required as a part
    of the mandatory training sessions for newly hired teachers.
  <LI>
    Technology workshops and in-services will be provided on a regular basis
    throughout the school year.
  <LI>

    in-services and visit other technology sites to increase their awareness
    of technology trends and opportunities.
  <LI>
    A portion of the staff development budget will be made available to individual
    staff members to assist with registration and/or other related expenses.
  <LI>
    The district will continually review and evaluate the IT staff development
    program to ensure that the training needs of the staff are<STRIKE>
    </STRIKE>adequately served.
  <LI>
    All in-service and workshop offerings will be conscientiously evaluated to
    determine if the stated objectives of the offerings are being met.
  <LI>

<P>
VI. <A NAME="CURRICULAR">CURRICULAR STEERING COMMITTEE STRUCTURE</A>
<P>
Technology is an invaluable tool which can be integrated into all curriculum
areas to help them attain their goals and objectives. It is necessary for
the Lansing School District to integrate available technology into each of
our curriculum areas. Curriculum area steering committees will give technology
concerns specific attention when existing curriculum statements and objectives
are revised. To assist with and facilitate the technology/curriculum integration
process, the following will occur:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Curriculum steering committees will include technology needs/training as
    a continued agenda item for all meetings.
  <LI>
    Each curriculum area steering committee will designate one member to serve
    as a liaison to the district Instructional Technology Committee (ITC) meetings.
    The liaisons will ensure that each curriculum area has a voice in the
    determination of district technology training and purchase plans. The liaisons
    will then provide technology updates and standards to their steering committees.
  <LI>
    Instructional technology will be reviewed continually. Each curriculum area
    should perform a yearly technology evaluation of their current and future
    technology needs.
  <LI>
    Proposed recommendations for upgrading existing technology or the need for
    additional IT purchases, will be made to the ITC.
  <LI>
    <EM></EM>Fund dispersal, implementation, and performance of planned technology
    upgrades will be reviewed and reported annually.
  <LI>
    Revision of curriculum statements or grade-level expectations, will occur
    based on yearly evaluation.
  <LI>
    Creation of new course offerings, or the elimination of existing courses,
    may occur as the result of the yearly technology evaluation, or the changing
    state of our instructional technology needs.
  <LI>
    Courses, such as computer programming, word-processing, desk-top publishing
    (to name a few) will be available at the secondary level, as elective offerings.
</UL>
<P>
<A HREF="#TABLE">Back to top</A><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
VII. <A NAME="SUPPORT">SUPPORT PERSONNEL</A>
<P>
As instructional technology usage and purchases continue to increase annually,
it is necessary to increase the number of available support/training personnel
proportionately. It is important that support/training personnel are available
in numbers that will enable the staff to make maximum use of available
instructional technology. The following personnel will be available to the
staff of the Lansing School District to assist with technology support and

VIII. <A NAME="TECHNOLOGY">TECHNOLOGY CONFIGURATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS</A>
<P>
Instructional technologies will be used to support teaching and learning
the Lansing School District curriculum in all grades and content areas. Because
learning takes place in whole groups, small/cooperative groups and independently
by individuals, school building technology configurations will reflect those

Documents to be published on district servers may be composed on Mac or Windows
platforms using a standard editor (e.g., Front Page, PageMill, HotDog), text
processor, or word processor that saves files as HTML files or as standard
ASCII (text) files. The use of an editor such as PageMill(Mac) or Front
Page(Windows) is strongly recommended for individuals who are learning to
compose HTML documents.
<P>
Graphics may be composed in any program but must be submitted already converted

Material submitted for publication on the district's WWW server must adhere
to the following directory structure.
<P>
<IMG SRC="starbz.gif" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="47">
<P>
1. The "slash," or root directory of the WWW server. All files on the server
reside in this directory.
<P>
2. All school home pages are in a directory called "schools."
<P>
3. All files and subdirectories for a specific school should reside in a
directory (folder) named for the school. This directory should include at
the root level only the school's home page and the necessary GIF files along
with subdirectories (folders) for subjects, classes, projects, activities,
or other appropriate areas.
<P>
4. At the root level of each subdirectory, place the home page for that directory
and its GIF files, along with any necessary subdirectories as illustrated.
<P>
5, 6. Add as many subdirectories as needed to contain the information you
are publishing.
<P>
7. At the final level, place all .html and .GIF documents relevant to the
subject being presented.
<P>
The pathname for the file "jones.html" in the above illustration would be:
<P>
<SAMP> /schools/walnut/math/faculty/jones/jones.html </SAMP>
<P>
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) written to reference that same file would
look like this:

</SAMP> 
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="content">Content Standards</A>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[Return to Index]</A>
<P>
All documents to be published on district servers must be edited and approved
by a referring teacher and school principal before publication. (See
<A HREF="responsibilities.htm">Responsibilities of Students, Teachers, and
Principals</A>.)
<P>
Individual schools are encouraged to develop and make public their own standards
for content.
<P>
Schools should concentrate on submitting material that reflects school
activities, student work, special projects, or aspects of the community which
they serve. Be careful to provide meaningful content. School sites that say
essentially "Here's our school, here's a picture of our principal" are common
and do not contribute to the information available on the World Wide Web.
<P>
<B>All work</B> published on the district's WWW server must be free of any
spelling or grammatical errors consistent with maintaining the "voice" of
the author appropriate to age and grade level. The following district guidelines
also apply to all student work published on the World Wide Web:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Published documents may not include a child's phone number, street address
    or box number, or names of other family members;
  <LI>
    Documents may not include any information which indicates the physical location
    of a student at a given time other than attendance at a particular school
    or participation in school activities;
  <LI>
    Documents may not contain objectionable material or point directly or indirectly
    to objectionable material;
  <LI>
    Documents must conform to school board policies and established school
    guidelines.
</OL>
<P>
<STRONG>Regarding #3, above: </STRONG>A link that logically leads to an
objectionable site must be removed. For example, a link to a pop music page
that links to a page that publishes rap lyrics should be removed, since it's
logical to assume that a person looking at the music page would follow links
to related pages. By contrast, a link to the Lion King page, which links
to the Disney page, which links to the MCA page, which links to a music page
which links to rap lyrics is not a logical progression of thought. Teachers
will have to use their judgment in deciding what links are appropriate. 
  <HR>
<A NAME="student"></A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="student">Student Home Pages</A>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[Return to Index] </A>
<P>
Students may compose and submit their own home pages. Students can showcase
examples of their work, list awards they have received, publish stories or
artwork, and collect and point to resources elsewhere on the web. This would
be especially appropriate for college-bound juniors and seniors or for other
job applicants.
<P>
It is the intent of the district to publish exemplary work. Schools are
encouraged to set standards for published work and not to simply publish
anything that a student submits. Schools should set standards for overall
acceptable content. We suggest that student home pages:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Contain some original content; stories, artwork, photography, etc.;
  <LI>
    Avoid a preponderance of links to game and entertainment sites; and
  <LI>
    Reflect a student's academic interests by pointing to academic or cultural
    resources.
</UL>
<P>
A guide for evaluating student web pages may be found
<A HREF="http://scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us/~bmorrow/rubric.htm">here</A>.
<P>
Student publications <STRONG>may not contain copyrighted material.</STRONG>
This means that clip art taken from commercial or entertainment sites such
as a movie site or an NBA site may not be included on a student's page unless
they have obtained specific permission to do so from the copyright holder
and if they include this permission on their home page.
<P>
<STRONG>Student work may not be published on the World Wide Web without written
permission from parents or guardians.</STRONG> The district form for securing
permission for publication may be found <A HREF="permission.htm">here</A>.
<P>
Student pages must be screened by a faculty member before they can be published.
Student home pages should be free of spelling and grammatical errors and
should adhere to accepted content standards. These standards have been
established by the district for student publications.
<P>
<STRONG>PLEASE NOTE: It is the responsibility of the supervising teacher
submitting material for publication to check students' work for content,
spelling, grammatical, and usage errors.</STRONG> Material published by students
reflects directly on the submitting school. Please screen all work to be
submitted.
<P>
<STRONG>PLEASE NOTE: It is the responsibility of the Principal to insure
that the content of a school's home page is appropriate and within the guidelines
for student publications.</STRONG>
<P>
For more information regarding responsibilities of various parties in the
development and publication of World Wide Web documents, see
"<A HREF="responsibilities.htm">Responsibilities of Students, Teachers, and
Principals</A>." 
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="size">Size Constraints</A>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[Return to Index]</A> The LSDNet WWW server houses many
home pages. Schools are encouraged to be creative with their pages and include
graphics and other information that presents a good picture of "life" at
their school.
<P>
However, students are discouraged from adding multiple large graphic files
to their home pages. These files can take many minutes to download and block
use of the server by anyone else during the time it takes to download the
files. If a page takes longer than about 30 seconds to download over a 28.8
modem connection, then the page is too long and should be broken up into
separate pages or some of the graphics should be eliminated.
<P>
Specific guidelines for form, content, and publication can be found by clicking
<A HREF="webmaster.htm">here.</A>
<P>
Again, it is the responsibility of the supervising teacher to insure that
student pages fit the guidelines set forth in this document.

<P>
<A HREF="#index">[Return to Index]</A>
<P>
A designated Webmaster (sometimes more than one person) at each school can
post material directly to the district's servers. All school postings must
go through this person. The Webmaster has ftp access to the school's directory.
The Webmaster is responsible for making sure that submitted material conforms
to all guidelines, above.

  Guidelines for LSDNet WebMasters 
</H1>
<P>
  <HR>
The content and suitability of LSDNet school home pages is left ultimately
to the <A HREF="responsibilities.htm">discretion of the principal</A>. However,
there are some guidelines that must be taken into consideration in order
to insure that the server operates effectively and provides adequate access
to everyone.
<P>
The school Webmaster is responsible for maintaining and updating the school's
web site. Please make sure that information posted is timely and up to date.
Remove staff or student e-mail addresses that no longer work or have been
changed. Add new content as often as possible.
<P>
If a school's home page is found to be in substantial non-alignment with
these guidelines, then it will be removed until appropriate changes have
been made.
<P>
Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

<H3>
  Using a Default Home Page
</H3>
<P>
The pages published on district servers <STRONG>are not</STRONG> intended
to be used as default home pages from your school. Do not set your web browser
to default to the pages published on district servers. (This can cause problems
for you in a lab situation where many computers try to access the same resources
at the same time.)
<P>
It is recommended that you devise a local home page to run on a server in
your building. Instructions for setting up a server can be found at the
<A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/">Web66</A> site. Your local home page
may be a duplicate of the scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us page, or it may be a list of
resources for your students. See <A HREF="directions.htm">"Setting Up a Local
Home Page"</A> and <A HREF="local.htm">"An Example of a Local Home Page"</A>
for more information. You can download the already-formatted page as a start
for your own page if you like. 
  <HR>
<H3>
  Graphics
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Avoid overuse of extraneous, decorative graphic elements.
  <LI>
    Avoid very large graphics with many colors.
  <LI>
    Avoid putting multiple large graphics on one page.
  <LI>
    Repeating a graphic element (such as a divider) rather than using different
    ones each time saves download time.
  <LI>
    Make ABSOLUTELY SURE that graphics copied from other sites are free from
    copyright restrictions.
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  Publication on Other Lists
</H3>
<P>
In publishing on the World Wide Web, we are trying to provide a service to
the education community. We need to insure that members of the education
community, locally and internationally, have adequate access to our resources.
<P>
<STRONG>We encourage</STRONG> webmasters to publish their home page URLs
on the following lists which serve the education community:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/schools.html">Registry of K12 Schools
    on the Web</A> (a.k.a. The "Hillside List")
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/new/new.html">Web66 What's New Page</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.yahooligans.com/">Yahooligans</A>
  <LI>
    Any other school web site
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  Adding your URL to Search Engines (Indexing your Site)
</H3>
<P>
Webmasters are encouraged to add their home page URL's to various search
engines. Doing so means that WWW users doing keyword searches will be able
to search your site for content information.
<P>
A variety of sites (both <EM>indexes</EM>, such as Yahoo, and<EM> robots</EM>,
such as WebCrawler) can be indexed all at once by using the
<A HREF="http://submit-it.permalink.com/submit-it/">Submit It! service</A>.
If you are not sure what a specific site offers, DON'T REGISTER. Check it
out first. Alta Vista, Lycos, Excite, and Webcrawler are all recommended.

  <A HREF="#index">[Return to Index]</A>
</H5>
<P>
World Wide Web browsers such as Netscape prefer to start up by going to a
specified home page. In the case of Netscape, the default home page is Netscape
Communication Corporation's server in California. Getting to this location
requires going out over the Internet. In a lab situation, when many computers
may be doing this at the same time, the performance of your local area network
can degrade significantly. Also, you run the risk of not being able to access
a busy server. Finally, Netscape's home page does not point directly to resources
that are useful to most K-12 students.
<P>
To avoid these problems, and to provide users with immediate access to resources
they can use, most schools use some version of a local home page. This page
can be placed on a computer's hard drive or on a local WWW server and be
made the default startup page for that computer.
<P>
You can create your own local home page, use a copy of the page posted on
the district's server, or use an already-created page. LSDNet provides a
frequently-updated resource list for use as a local home page by schools
or individuals. As a frames-based document set, Netscape 2.x or greater is
required to use it. To view the document set, click
<A HREF="local.htm">here</A>. (Use Netscape's Back button to return here.)
If you have a browser that does not support frames, click
<A HREF="localm~1.htm">here</A>.
<P>
To download the document set:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Start Netscape.
  <LI>
    Go to the File menu and select Open Location...
  <LI>
    Enter
    <P>
    <SAMP></SAMP>
    <CENTER>
      http://scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us/~bmorrow/local.zip
    </CENTER>
    <P>
    and hit Return/Enter.
</UL>
<P>
You may also download the document set by going to the district's home page,
selecting WWW Resources, and selecting Download Local Home Page.
<P>
The file will be transferred to your computer. You must then "unzip" the
file by using a utility like WinZip or PKUnZip. Six files will be unstuffed:
<UL>
  <LI>
    local.htm
  <LI>
    localbanner.html
  <LI>
    localcontents.html
  <LI>
    localheader1.html
  <LI>
    localheader2.html
  <LI>
    localmain.html
</UL>
<P>
Local.htm is the frames based document and should be used as the default
home page.
<P>
You can customize the page to fit your school by editing the localbanner.html
file and changing the phrase "Example Local Home Page" to reflect the name
of your school. 
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="drive">Putting the Page on a Local Hard Drive</A>
</H3>
<H5>
  <A HREF="#index">[Return to Index]</A>
</H5>
<P>
Move the home page (or in the case of the LSDNet document set, the
folder/directory) to a location on the hard drive of the machine you are
setting up. Placing it in the same folder/directory as your other Internet
applications is recommended.
<P>
Then:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Open Netscape and let it go to the currently defined home page.
  <LI>
    Go to the <B>File</B> menu and select <B>Open File...</B>
  <LI>
    Locate and open the <B>local.htm</B> file.
  <LI>
    If the Location window is not visible just under the tool buttons under the
    menu bar, go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select <B>Show Location</B>.
  <LI>
    Select and copy the location from the Location window. (It will begin with
    "file:///")
  <LI>
    Go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select <B>General Preferences</B>.
  <LI>
    Look for a text box that is labeled "Home Page Location." Delete the information
    in that box and paste the location you just copied.
</OL>
<P>
Netscape will now use this file as the default home page. Be careful not
to change the name or location of the local.html file or of any folders or
directories in which it resides, as Netscape will not be able to find it
unless you change the Preferences settings to reflect the new name or location.
<P>
Copy this page to the hard drive of every computer that uses Netscape and
perform steps 1-6.
<P>
Advantages of placing the default page on a local hard drive:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Faster loading, especially in a lab situation or on a slow network, since
    no network access is involved.
  <LI>
    No need for a local WWW server.
</UL>
<P>
Disadvantages of placing the default page on a local hard drive.
<UL>
  <LI>
    To update the page with new links, you must update it on every computer.
  <LI>
    Inadvertantly changing the name of the hard drive or the names of any files
    or folders will cause Netscape to lose track of the page.
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="network">Putting the Page on a Local Area Network</A>
</H3>
<H5>
  <A HREF="#index">[Return to Index]</A>
</H5>
<P>
If you want to create a World Wide Web server for your local area network,
you will need a machine to act as a server and a program that can act as
an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) server for your HTML documents.
<P>
Generally, you need not dedicate a machine for a building level web server.
A machine already in use as a mail server, file server, or administrative
machine will suffice. For Macintosh users, a PowerPC-based Mac is strongly
recommended.
<P>
There is a variety of commercial/shareware/freeware web servers available
for Macs, Novell servers, and Windows NT. There are several available for
Windows 95 and almost none for Windows 3.1. Many of these are posted on LSDNet.
<P>
Once you have your HTTP server up and running, either create a local home
page or download a prewritten one as described <A HREF="#above">above</A>.
Place this document in the same folder/directory as your HTTP server program.
<P>
To make this the default document for all of the Netscape-using computers
on your network. do the following:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Open Netscape on a local computer and allow it to go to the default home
    page.
  <LI>
    Go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select <B>Preferences</B>.
  <LI>
    Look for a text box that is labeled "Home Page Location." Delete the information
    in that box and enter the URL to your server and home page. It will look
    something like this:
    <P>
    <CENTER>
      <SAMP>http://scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us/home.html</SAMP>
    </CENTER>
    <P>
    where scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us is the domain name address of your web server and
    home.html is the name of your default home page.
  <LI>
    Close the window and restart Netscape. Netscape will now use the default
    page on your server as its local home page.
</OL>

<p><em><strong>Proposed Acceptable Use of Technology Regulation </strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Lansing School District acquires and makes available certain materials, in the category of technology
hardware and software, to aid in the effective conduct of teaching, learning and non-instructional operations.
These technologies are acquired with the understanding that they contribute access to information, methods of
presentation, and communication. Staff and students as well as interested persons outside of the district recognize
that these technologies are a productive means of carrying out the mission and instructional goals of the district.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The uses of technologies carry with them certain responsibilities. Technology uses should be consistent with the
tasks to which they are assigned. They should also be commensurate with privileges conferred upon the user by the
school district. Technology is defined as including, but not limited to, electronic media, hardware and software or
equipment owned or leased by the Lansing School District. For purposes of this regulation, "user of technology" is
defined as any person who accesses technology, as defined above. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Listed below are specific responsibilities and limitations which must be observed by any person using technology
which the Lansing School District possesses or accessing technology upon Lansing School District premises or
through remote access communications. These apply to any use of technology, whether owned by the Lansing
School District or the personal property of the user.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	It is the users' responsibility to provide for the reasonable care and protection of technology. 

<p>	The users are to adhere to all safety requirements when using technology.

<p>	Any and all uses of technology are for the conduct of Lansing School District operations.

<p>	Users are responsible for reporting the misuse of technology.

<p>	Users are responsible for compliance with existing laws while using technology.

<p>	The Student Code of Conduct and regulations described in Lansing Board of Education Policies and
Administrative Regulations apply to the use of technology.

<p>	Students utilizing district-provided technology must have the permission of and be supervised by Lansing
School Districts professional staff.

<p>	It is the user's responsibility to ensure that transmission and/or reception of information by means of
technology is appropriate. Electronic mail is not guaranteed to be private. People who operate the system
do have access to all mail. Inappropriate or illegal use of e-mail may subject the individual to
consequences stated elsewhere.  

<p>	Users have full responsibility for the confidentiality of any accounts or passwords related to the use of
technology. Circumventing passwords and/or security is not allowed. All violations of this regulation that
can be traced to an individual's account name will be treated as the responsibility of the owner of that
account. 

<p>	Users of technology should act to prevent the disclosure of student records without permission, as defined
in Administrative Regulation No. 5125.

<p>	Users are responsible for obtaining permission prior to installing, removing or relocating software. This
software must be virus-free. 

<p>	Users should use proper network etiquette. 

<p><em><strong>	Examples of Network Etiquette:</em></strong>

<p>	Personal attacks are an unacceptable use of technology. Persuade with facts only. 

<p>	Avoid posting personal information about yourself or anyone else.

<p>	Be careful about copyrights and licenses. Cite appropriate references.

<p>	In e-mail messages, brevity is desirable. Messages with all capitals are considered SCREAMING; don't
scream. Don't overdo signatures.

<p>	Do minimize spelling errors and make sure your message is easy to understand and read. Remember that
all network users are human beings, and forgive the spelling and grammar errors of others.

<p>	Users should use language appropriate for school situations as indicated by the school's code of conduct,
and avoid offensive or inflammatory speech. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Failure to comply with this regulation may result in loss of privileges, disciplinary action, or civil or criminal
action against the user.

<BODY>
<H2>Setting Up Eudora for More Than One User</H2>
<HR>
These directions explain how to set up Eudora for multiple users on the same Macintosh. You might want to do this at home if more than one person in your home has an account, or in a lab that is used by many different people during the day. Setting up Eudora in this way keeps you from having to reconfigure Eudora each time a new person uses it.
<HR>
<ol>
<LI>Install Eudora and run it once.
<LI>Quit Eudora and open the System Folder.
<LI>Locate and open the Eudora Folder (in the System Folder).
<LI>Locate, then duplicate the "Eudora Setting"s file by clicking once on it and typing Command-D. You'll get a file called "Eudora Settings copy"
<LI>Create a new folder on your desktop. Call it "Personal Mail" (or name it after a specific individual).
<LI>Drag the "Eudora Settings copy" file into the "Personal Mail" folder.
<LI>Rename the "Eudora Settings copy" file to "Eudora"
<LI>Drag the folder "Personal Mail" to the desired location. This could be:
<ul>
<li>on the desktop
<LI>into the Apple Menu Items in the System Folder (it will appear on the Apple Menu)
<LI>onto a student's floppy disk
<LI>into a student's folder on the file server
</ul>
<LI>Open "Personal Mail" and double-click the "Eudora" file. This will launch Eudora.
<LI>Go to the Special menu and select "Settings..."
<LI>Configure Eudora for the target individual.
<LI>Quit Eudora.
<LI>Repeat as often as necessary. You can also duplicate the "Personal Eudora" folder, distribute it, and let the individual set it up for him/herself.
</ol>
From this point on, launch Eudora by opening the "Personal Mail" folder and double clicking the "Eudora" file.
<P>
NOTE: The Eudora program must be installed on the computer's hard drive for this to work. It will work with all versions of Eudora, even if the version that created it is different than the one you are using.

<FONT SIZE=2>The Lansing School District is very pleased to provide this

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With access to computers and people all over the world also
comes the availability of material that may not be considered to be of
educational value in the context of the school setting. On a global network
it is impossible to control all materials. The Lansing School District firmly
believes that the value of the information and interaction available on this
worldwide network far outweighs the possibility that users may procure material
that is not consistent with the educational goals of the District. <BR>

Otto Middle School</A> in the capital city of Michigan, <A HREF="http://www.lansing.org">Lansing</A>.      My main teaching duties are four sections of math, but I also have a section of reading.     I have a lot of fun exploring the Web, and I'm finding a lot of useful and entertaining material.     It is my pleasure to be able to share some of my favorite sites with you.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hile my professional life revolves around Otto Middle School, my private life is centered around my wife Nancy and our three children, Jason, Sarah, and Nathan.     Jason is a 20 year old college man, Sarah is a beautiful 17 year old high school junior, and Nate is a hulk of a 13 year old.     Anchoring us all with a wealth of emotional and spiritual support is Nancy, my wife of twenty-five years.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>s you travel through the following sites, keep foremost in your mind a sense of wonder.     I do find wonder and excitement in the wealth of information and entertainment found within these pages.</STRONG>

<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4><strong>Mission Statement: </strong></font></font><font color="#000080">The staff of Dwight Rich Middle School believes that teaching and 
learning are our primary missions and that all students are capable of learning. Our goal is for 
all students to master the essential curriculum. We accept responsibility to provide instruciton

<p>Dwight Rich Middle School has been involved in the Lansing School District's school 
improvement program since 1987. This formal decision-making and planning process is part of 
an agreement between the district and the Lansing Schools Education Association (LSEA) 
which is aimed at involving all elements of the school community in the decision- making for 
each building. The agreement spells out specific areas of responsibility and authority for 
School Improvement Teams in each building. The annual building budget, school restructuring, 
and program decisions are some of the important areas in which the School Improvement team 
is involved. </p>
<p>Last year, the Rich School Improvement Team was composed of Acting Principal, Diane Roth; 
Co-chairpersons Leon Scott and Patti Seidl; Secretary, Deanna Alwin; Parliamentarians, Sherry 
Kamm and Ethlene Noonon; staff members Victor Celentino, Whitney Chase, Ann Nutt, Sue 
Price, Betty Springer, Meredee Vaughan, Mary Villegas, and Wendi Waters; and parents Debra 
Hollis and Judy West. </p>
<p>Meeting dates were determined at the beginning of the school year with some held just prior to 
PTSA meetings and were open to all persons who wished to attend. The School Improvement 
Restructuring Team, an ad hoc committee, met throughout the year to determine the direction 
and agenda items for building planning and inservices. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Progress Toward Our Established Goals</strong></font></font></p>
<p>Through the Restructuring Subcommittee, School Improvement Team, and staff feedback to 
building inservices, our 1995-1996 goals were: </p>
<ul>
<li>teaming at all grade levels;</li>
<li>block scheduling for academics;</li>
<li>providing 2 electives for sixth graders;</li>
<li>individual and team planning; and</li>
<li>continuing staff development. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above goals were met. As a result, communication with our school community was 
enhanced, students had a consistent learning environment, and the master schedule provided for 
greater flexibility within the teams. </p>
<p>During the 1996-1997 academic year, we will continue to work toward the following goals: </p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000080">continued improvement in communications with the school community;</font></li>
<li><font color="#000080">offering of effective academic provisions for talented students and those with special 
needs; and</font></li>
<li><font color="#000080">efforts to improve the flow of students to and from the cafeteria. </font></li>
</ul>

<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></font></font></p>
<p align=left>The Lansing School District's curriculum is closely aligned with the Michigan Department of 
Education's recommended model core curriculum. That latter curriculum consists of math, 
reading, science, economics, geography, history, American government, and writing, and is 
available to all Lansing students. </p>
<p>The improvement and upgrading of curriculum in the Lansing School District is an ongoing 
process geared to meeting emerging national and state standards in what and how subjects 
should be taught. Such information is communicated to teachers on a regular basis via the 
district's subject matter consultants and professional development workshops. </p>
<p>The school system adopted a curricular review process in 1980 which calls for a 
comprehensive study and updating of subject matter offerings on a 5-year cycle. That process 
involves a review of all instructional materials, textbooks, continuity of content from grade to 
grade, and development of curriculum statements which specify what a student should know in a 
given subject. </p>
<p>Recommendations for curricular changes and innovations are presented annually to the 
Superintendent by the Instructional Council. That group meets monthly during the school year 
and is comprised of 6 administrators, 6 teachers, 6 parents, and 6 secondary school students. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Accreditation Status Report</strong></font></font></p>
<p>The Michigan Department of Education is continuing to evolve standards by which public 
schools are assessed. Based on the state accreditation system implemented during the 
1994-1995 academic year, Dwight Rich Middle School has been awarded &quot;interim 
accreditation&quot; status for the past 2 years. That means at least 51% of our students have passed 
the math, reading, and science sections of the Michigan Educational Assessment Program 
(MEAP) tests. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Student Achievement At Rich</strong></font></font></p>
<p>The academic performance of Dwight Rich students is monitored in a variety of ways 
throughout the school year. Classwork, homework, and staff-developed tests help teachers, 
parents, and students check progress on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Frequent reports, staff contacts, and teacher conferences encourage parents to become involved 
in the evaluation of their students' education. </p>
<p>In addition, the Lansing School District sponsors a testing program designed to provide an 
annual picture of the academic progress of all students. One part of that program is 
norm-referenced testing each spring for students in grades 1-11. These results allow us to see 
how Dwight Rich students perform in comparison to their counterparts in other urban areas 
across the nation. </p>
<p>Following is a summary of the Metropolitan math and reading scores achieved by our students 
in 1993, 1994, and 1995. </p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4><strong>Math:</strong></font></font> Students in grades 6 and 7 showed slight increases in their math scores from 1994 to 
1995, but those for grade 8 declined. </p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4><strong>Reading:</strong></font></font> Students in grade 8 maintained the same average score, the 41st percentile, and 
exceeded the district-wide average for two years in a row. Grade 7 scores demonstrated slight 
improvement in 1995, while scores for students in grade 6 have declined. </p>
<p>We are pleased with the progress Dwight Rich students are making in their math and reading 
scores on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) exams. </p>
<p>On the 1995 MEAP math test, 33.2% of our students scored in the satisfactory range compared 
to 22.4% who did so in 1993 and 26.5% who had satisfactory scores in 1994. </p>
<p>A total of 31.7% of our students had satisfactory scores on the 1995 MEAP reading exam as 
compared to the 23.7 % who had done so in 1994; 63% achieved scores of 300 and above on 
the story selection last year compared to 50.3% who had done so in 1994; 37.6% passed the 
informational selection on the 1995 state reading test whereas 30.7 had placed in that category 
in 1994. </p>
<p>The goal is for all Dwight Rich students to score in the satisfactory range on both the MEAP 
math and reading tests. We know that research strongly supports the use of parent/business 
partner tutors as one aspect of moving students toward academic success. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Enrichment Opportunities At Rich</strong></font></font></p>
<p>Enrichment at Dwight Rich highlights the multiple intelligences of our student population. Each 
teacher &quot;bears&quot; the responsibility for providing levels of instruction appropriate to needs 
within his/her classroom. In addition, through daily enrichment periods, each team designs and 
implements courses which enhance student learning in the sciences, language arts, fine arts, and 
social sciences. </p>
<p>Examples of the multitude of activities available to students last year included in dependent 
study in the media center designing multimedia science presentations, Drama Day at Rich with 
200 students working with drama specialists from Western Michigan University and Boarshead 
Theater, toothpick structure building to simulate a new colony on Mars, and desktop publishing. 
Students also benefited from Wharton Center partnerships, Odyssey of the Mind, conflict 
management training, Geography Night, independent study contracts, Galileo trial, Accelerated 
Reading Program, and several motivational speakers. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Classroom and School-Wide Projects At Rich</strong> </font></font></p>
<p>Capital Area School Employees Credit Union: Dr. Pam Cotton-Roberts introduced several 
lessons on the money system, paychecks, the importance of earnings for individuals and 
companies, and the collection and cost of new materials for manufacturers. These lessons were 
centered around math skills which focused on decimals, addition and subtraction of decimals, 
and writing in standard notation. </p>
<p>The students went on two field trips; one to the main office of the Capital Area School 
Employees Credit Union where they learned how the main branch operated, and the other to 
Sexton High School where they observed a credit union branch in operation. </p>
<p>Each student was interviewed for a credit union position of his/her choice--teller, security, 
public relations, advertising, facility committee, technical support, supervisory committee, or 
credit committee. </p>
<p>Dwight Rich Middle School celebrated the opening day of its credit union branch office March 
12. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Business Education Partnership </strong></font></font></p>
<p>This program recognizes the importance of business involvement in the education of our 
students. The basic premise of the Business Education Partnership program involves actively 
encouraging businesses to contribute to and participate in the educational success of Dwight 
Rich Middle school students and to enhance their knowledge, values, and attitudes regarding the 
connection between &quot;education&quot; and &quot;real life.&quot; </p>
<p>Staff member Bernita Benson contacted more than 90 area businesses in the summer of 1995. 
Her efforts resulted in the formation of partnerships with the Edgewood Target Store, Capital 
Area School Employees Credit Union, Meijer, EDS, Lansing State Journal, WhereHouse 
Records, City Bank, Wendy's, L &amp; L Shop Rite, McDonalds, First of America Bank, Kroger, 
Radio Shack, Quality Dairy, and Coscarelli's. The businesses agreed to contribute time and 
resources to help enhance our educational mission. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Reading Incentive Programs</strong></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4><strong>The Accelerated Reader</strong></font></font> is a reading incentive program involving all seventh grade 
English classes at Rich. Each class acts as a team and adopts a name. The students in each class 
work individually and together to earn as many points as possible by reading books. There are 
more than a thousand different titles on the Accelerated Reader book list from which to choose. 
Each book is worth a specified number of points based on its length and difficulty. </p>
<p>After completing a book, the student takes a computerized test which consists of multiple choice 
questions about the book. </p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4>Other reading incentive programs include:</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4>RIF:</font></font> The Reading is Fundamental Program allows us to give every child at Rich a free book 
three times during the year. Students may choose any books they like from a large selection. The 
funds for this program come from the Reading is Fundamental foundation, our PTSA, Student 
Council, Honor Society, English Department budget, and other miscellaneous donations. </p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4>Battle of the Books:</font></font> During this 6-week event, classes are divided into teams and each team 
must read all of the books from a list of 15 titles. The teams compete in periodic mini-battles to 
determine which one can answer the most questions about the books. The winning team from 
each class competes in the final championship battle. Team members must answer two 
questions about each book and also must know who the author is. Classes also compete against 
each other to see which can earn most points by doing various projects about the books. </p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size=4>MS Read-A-Thon:</font></font> Students get pledges to raise money for each book they read. The money 
generated is sent to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>The Bear Zone Project</strong> </font></font></p>
<p>A cooperative effort between sixth grade teachers, students, counselors, and Assistant 
Principal, Sam Davis, the Bear Zone project seeks to create a climate of success for all sixth 
graders. </p>
<p>Monthly themes which include respect, choices, listening, promptness, preparation, 
participation, and responsibility are introduced at assemblies, used by counselors and 
classroom teachers, and are topics for student presentations. </p>
<p>Each team chooses a bear name. The Grizzlies, Kodiaks, Pandas, and Polar Bears design and 
silk-screen T-shirts with their logos. By participating in monthly theme activities, earning 
&quot;Random Act of Kindness&quot; certificates, and assisting in Bear Zone activities, students earn bear 
paws for their team. The teams &quot;climb&quot; a large tree, reaching branches corresponding to each 
theme. The teams have been very successful, and are all expected to pay their way to the top. 
Team members are rewarded for reaching their goal with a trip to Fun Tyme. </p>
<p align=center><font color="#800080"><font size=5><strong>Odyssey Of The Mind Team Goes To State Finals </strong></font></font></p>
<p>Dwight Rich became the first Lansing middle school to become involved in the Odyssey of the 
Mind competition last year. We fielded 3 teams, each of which was given a problem to solve 
that had to be documented in writing and then displayed in a humorous skit. One of the teams 
placed second in the regional competition last spring and qualified for the state finals held in 
April on the Central Michigan University campus. Members of the award-winning squad were: 
David Aldrich, Brian Moore, Brianne McDaniels, Alexandra Andrejczuk, Mike Taylor, and 
Anna West. Teacher Elaine Flore and parent Alice Brinkman coached the 3 teams.<br>

relentless spirit and demand for excellence compel students to work beyond

the wit and insight to break the monotony often traditional in social science





classrooms. Mrs. Ghorai teaches her students skills applicable for every
day. Her structure forces organization that carries through into other classes





and social life. One leaves her classroom knowing, 'only teachers and God
write in red and everyone else in blue or black ink, children dot their i's
with hearts and circles, failure to capitalize God and the Bible will result
in punishment by lightning,' and most importantly, 'all of your choices involve





an opportunity cost.' She wants you to do the best that you can, and she
doesn't accept less than that.</FONT>

I was lucky enough to stumble upon a sport called cross country where I met
Brian Murley, the person who has made one of the most positive differences
in my life. When I started cross country, I was a lazy, undisciplined, average





student who didn't know what hard work was. Mr. Murley changed all of that.
He taught me what it was to be a leader and a team player. Most of all, Mr.





Murley has taught me about sportsmanship and respecting people, not only
as fellow athletes, but as fellow human beings. There is probably nothing
I can do or say to thank him for all that he has taught me. I hope to someday

continued efforts to accomplish the school improvement goals set forth in
that legislation.</FONT>

communicators, skillful problem-solvers, and critical thinkers; who are





civic-minded and prepared to make ethical decisions; and who have a career

Lansing student should possess upon graduation.</FONT>


<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">The district-wide school improvement plan developed





by the Instructional Division includes specific goals and strategies aimed
at helping Lansing students attain the academic and employability skills
they will need to function as successful members of society in the 21st





century.</FONT>


<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">In accordance with the district plan, individual





schools are encouraged to become involved in restructuring efforts that will





better meet the needs of the students of the 1990s. Such restructuring has





included the following examples.</FONT>


<UL><LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">In the fall of 1993, the Pattengill Middle





School staff restructured its instructional program by implementing a flexible





block schedule and assigning students to small groups who met on a daily
basis with an interdisciplinary team of teachers.</FONT>

throughout the district were encouraged to develop "focus" school proposals





featuring innovative teaching and curricular methods to better address student





needs. The Board of Education approved 7 such proposals and allocated $345,000
in the 1994-95 budget to fund them. The designated "focus" schools were Averill,





Beekman Center, Grand River, Gunnisonville, Mt. Hope, Riddle, and the new

<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">In conjunction with the "focus" school project,
the Board of Education implemented a "schools of choice" plan for the 1994-95





academic year which gave parents a chance to send their students to schools





outside of the assigned attendance area. More than 1,500 such transfer requests





were granted last year.</FONT>


<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">In response to a growing national movement,
special education students are gradually being placed in general education





classrooms instead of being enrolled in separate, pull-out programs. Special





education personnel can then provide the needed support to those students
and the general education classroom teachers.</FONT>

opportunity for high school students to receive state endorsement of their
local diplomas. The Class of 1994 was the first to come under this regulation.





Students can earn separate endorsements in math, reading, and science by





achieving qualifying scores on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program
(MEAP) tests.</FONT>


<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">Of the seniors who graduated from the 3 Lansing
high schools in June of 1995, 92.3% earned state endorsements in at least
one of the 3 subject areas, while 73.6% qualified for endorsements in all
3 (math, reading, and science). That latter figure represents a 7% increase

The South Central Network Consortium of Michigan (SCNC) is a group of
Universities, Community Colleges, Intermediate School Districts, and School
Districts working together to provide Internet access to all of the school
districts in southeastern Michigan before December 1996. The SCNC effort
was partially funded by a grant from the Michigan Public Service Commission.
The original SCNC grants expired on November 15, 1996. The majority of the
SCNC Project has been completed in terms of installation of SCNC servers
in the participating schools. The remaining part of the project is mainly
in the form of updates and support which are funded partly through a SCNC
Support Contract which covers continuing support for an SCNC server.

Part of the SCNC Project included the specification of a computer to be used
as the actual SCNC servers, the operating system which would run on those
servers, and custom software, written by Michigan State University to facilitate
the use of the servers. Information concerning those various pieces of equipment
and software are listed
<A HREF="http://www.scnc.k12.mi.us/scnc_server/">here</A>. For more in-depth
information concerning the custom written SCNC software, try looking at the
SCNC documentation.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Server:Compaq ProLinea 5XXX Series computer</FONT>
<DL>
  <DD>
    Compaq Prolinea 5XXX Series The Compaq Prolinea was selected as the foundation
    of the SCNC server. The original test model was a Prolinea 575, a 75MHz Pentium
    based machine, was eventually installed into one of the SCNC members. The
    actual first production SCNC servers were Prolinea 590s, a 90MHz version
    instead of the 75MHz test machine. Both of these models were desktop style
    cases, the 590 being used at production because of the general cost reduction
    trends of the computer industry, which caused the price of the 590 to be
    within the budget alloted for each server by the time production was reached.
    Each machine was equipped with a 4 gigabyte hard drive(see below) and 40
    megabytes of system RAM. These compose the majority of the machines, however,
    a few of the last machines were upgraded, again because of market economics.
    Those machines are equipped with an addition 8 MB of RAM, taking the total
    to 48 MB of RAM, and are also 133MHz Pentiums. The later machines were also
    in tower cases because Compaq changed the production of the Prolinea.

    <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hard Disk:Connor CFP4207S</FONT>
  <DD>
    Connor CFP4207S Hard Disk The Conner CFP4207S is a SCSI based 4 Gigabyte
    hard disk. It was chosen based on it's cost, performance, and storage capacity.
    The Conner is used in virtually all of the SCNC machines.

    <FONT COLOR="Red">Sony SDT-5000 DAT Tape Drive</FONT>
  <DD>
    The Sony SDT-5000 DAT tape drive was chosen for a number of reasons as the
    primary backup device for the SCNC servers. DAT has an amazing capacity and
    speed advantage when compared with regular tape backup devices. With the
    large 4 gigabyte hard drives installed in the servers, it was felt that backup
    capability had to be made as simple as possible, to that end a backup option
    which could handle an entire SCNC hard disk was needed. The Sony SDT-5000
    DAT filled that need perfectly. In addition to backup duty, the DAT makes
    installing a new SCNC server, or starting one over from scratch a simple
    matter of putting in a floppy disk and the SCNC tape.

    <FONT COLOR="Red">BusLogics BT-946C PCI Fast SCSI Adapter </FONT>
  <DD>
    The BusLogics SCSI adapter was also chosen for several reasons, the prime
    ones being compatibility. FreeBSD, the operating system used on the SCNC
    servers currently supports the PCI based BusLogics better then the Adaptec
    equivilents. In addition, it has been our experiance that the BusLogics cards
    seem to be more reliable then the Adaptec's.

    <FONT COLOR="Red">SMC EtherCard Elite16 Ultra </FONT>
  <DD>
    Although the SMC Elite16 is an older 16 bit based network card, it is also
    a VERY reliable one. It has been around for a very long time, and is a proven
    workhorse. The Elite16 was chosen for this reason, and a 16 bit card is used
    because the SCNC setup was not assumed to be running on any type of connection
    where the potential data traffic could ever exceed the 10Mbit capacity of
    the Elite16.

  SCNC Server Site Preparation
</title>

<h1>
  <img src="/images/sitelogo.gif"> 
  SCNC Server Site Preparation
  <hr> 
</h1>

<hr>

This document describes the site preparations required before installing
an SCNC server.  It is also important if you are installing network 
connectivity that you also do site preparation for the network stuff.
<p>
<h2>
Location and Power
</h2>
<p>
The SCNC server is a Compaq desktop with a 14" monitor.  The console will 
need to be accessed only for backup.  The system comes with a 450VA 
Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS).  Only a single outlet is needed as the UPS
will be plugged into the outlet and the remaining equipment will
be plugged into the UPS.
<p>
<h2>
Installation facts required:
</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>  Server domain name (e.g. eaton.k12.mi.us)
  <li>  Server host name (e.g. scnc.eaton.k12.mi.us)
  <li>  Server IP address
  <li>  Netmask Netmask
  <li>  Gateway IP address
  <li>  Organization name
</ol>
<p>
Note if you do not have a domain registered, that is not necessary 
to install the server.  You should pick the domain before installing
the server and then you can register your domain with Merit
after the server is installed.
<p>
<h2>
Network Arrangement
</h2>
<p>
You should have a functional Internet connection before installing the SCNC
server.  The server supports either twisted pair or thin Ethernet.  Make
sure to have a cable run to the location where the server will be installed.
<p>
<h2>
Other Details
</h2>
<p>
In addition to the above, you will need a system (Mac or PC) capable of 
running TCP/IP and Netscape (dial-up is OK) to complete the system 
installation and to administer and test the system.
<p>
The installation kit consists of:
<ol>
  <li>  Install tape or Backup tape
  <li>  Install floppy
  <li> Installation Documentation
</ol>
<p>
Also note that the most up to date server installation documentation
(including this document) is available on-line at
<a href=http://www.scnc.k12.mi.us/scnc_docs>
http://www.scnc.k12.mi.us/scnc_docs
</a>
You may want to download and print the latest version of the documentation
before proceeding.

<h1> <img src="/images/sitelogo.gif"> Web Administration Setup <hr> </h1>

<p>
To enable the web server you will need to follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Set a password for the user id <b>web</b> via the <b>Change a users
password</b> function on the <b>Account Administration</b> page.
<p>
<li>Log in to your server using the <b>web</b> ID, and the password just
    selected.
<p>
<li>Use the editor of your choice to create/change the html files.
</ol>

Key Directories:
<ol>
<li> <b>documents</b> contains 
     scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us's public html documents.  The URL 
     <b>http://scnc.lsd.k12.mi.us/</b> points to the
     file ~web/documents/index.html .
<p>
<li> <b>internal-documents</b> contains the local user login menu.
     The URL <b>file://localhost/usr/local/web/internal-documents/index.html</b>
     points to the file ~web/internal-documents/index.html .  This is the html
     document shown when a user logs into the server.

<title> Proxy Server Administration </title>

<h1> 
  <img alt="" src="/images/sitelogo.gif">
  Proxy Server Setup
  <hr>
</h1>

<p>

The proxy server on each SCNC server is enabled at startup.  
The proxy server will initially allow all hosts ending in your domain
(i.e. scnc.k12.mi.us) and all hosts within your class C network (i.e. 35.8.2.*)
to access the proxy server.  You can administer the proxy server using
the <b>Domain Name Service Administration</b> functions on the 
<b>Server Software Administration</b> page.

<p>

To use the proxy server, point your client software at your SCNC server
using port <B>8080</B> (i.e. train1.scnc.k12.mi.us 8080).

  Anonymous FTP Administration
</title>

<h1>
  <img src="/images/sitelogo.gif"> Anonymous FTP Administration Setup <hr>
</h1>

<p>
To enable anonymous ftp on this server you will need to follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li>Set a password for the user id <b>ftpadmin</b> via the <b>Change a
  users password</b> function on the <b>Account Administration</b> page.
  <p>
  <li>Log in to your server using the <b>ftpadmin</b> ID, and the password just
      selected.
  <p>
  <li>Add/remove any files you wish to supply for anonymous ftp. 
</ol>

Key Directories and Files:
<ol>
  <li> <b>~/pub</b> is the directory to put files in to make them accessible
       by anonymous ftp.
  <p>
  <li> <b>~/msgs/welcome.msg</b> contains the initial message 
  <p>
  <li> <b>README*</b> files in any directory will cause a message
       (example message shown below) to be displayed the first time an
       anonymous user enters the directory containing that file.
<pre>
Please read the file README
 it was last modified on Wed Nov 29 17:23:54 1995 - 0 days ago
</pre>

  <p>

  <li> <b>.message</b> files are displayed the first time an anonymous user
       enters the directory containing a <b>.message</b> file. (note: the
       file name starts with a <b>.</b>)

  Account Administration
</title>

<h1> <img src="/images/sitelogo.gif"> Account Administration Tips <hr> </h1>

<h2> Groups </h2>

<ol>
  <li> Creating meaningful groups can be very useful.  For instance, a group
       called <b>stdnt96</b> could be used to designate users who are students
       in the class of 96.
  <p>
  <li> All users in a group can be listed using the <b>List users</b> function
       on the <b>Account Administration</b> page.
  <p>
  <li> All users in a group can be removed using the <b>Delete all users in a
       group</b> function on the <b>Account Administration</b> page.
</ol>

<h2> User Accounts </h2>
<ol>
  <li> The <b>List users</b> function on the <b>Account Administration</b>
       page is very useful.  You can create a list using any combination of
       the following criteria:
       <ul>
         <li> Users logged in
         <li> Users over a percentage of their quota
         <li> Users who match a certain phrase
         <li> Users who belong to a certain group
       </ul>

       Once the table of users has been compiled you can click on any user
       name to show account information.
  <p>
  <li> Users accounts can be reset using the <b>Reset user account</b> function
       on the <b>Account Administration</b> page.  This is needed if the user
       has accidentally changed or deleted one or more of the necessary
       account configuration files in their home directory, rendering their
       account unusable.
  <p>
  <li> One word, 
       <b><a href="/cgi-bin/scncweb_showmanpage?type=view&word=batch_adduser"> 
         batch_adduser 
       </a></b>.  
       This utility allows you to take a spreadsheet file and create many 
       accounts at once using it.

BATCH_ADDUSER(8)	 UNIX System Manager's Manual	      BATCH_ADDUSER(8)


</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> - add users specified within a file


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> [<STRONG>-help</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>delimeter</EM>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> utility is used to add users specified within a file.

     The options are as follows:

     <STRONG>-help</STRONG>
	   Show usage information.

     <STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>delimeter</EM>
	   Specify the delimeter to use.  Valid types are "tab", "comma" or
	   "semicolon".

     The Format of the input file is as follows:

     L. Name, F. Name, Location, Off. Ph., Home Ph., Grp, Passwd, Quota, Uname

	or

     # some comment starting with a "#"

     <STRONG>User</STRONG> <STRONG>Item</STRONG>	  <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
     <STRONG>---------</STRONG>	  <STRONG>-----------</STRONG>
     Last Name	  User's last name.
     First Name   User's first name.
     Location	  Office location.
     Off. Ph.	  Office Phone.
     Home Ph.	  Home Phone.
     Group	  User's main group.
     Passwd	  User's password.
     Quota	  User's quota limit in Bytes (1048576 Bytes = 1 Megabyte).
     Uname	  Optional user login name

     To force <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> to create a user name from the input first and
     last name, leave the <STRONG>Uname</STRONG> entry blank.

     The <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> utility exits 0 if all users are added.	If an error
     occurs, <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> exits with a value &gt;0.  Specifically with a value
     of 1 if an error occurs during the setup state, a value of 2 if an error
     occurs during the verification state, and a value of 3 if an error occurs
     during the users actually being added.


</PRE>
<H2>REQUIREMENTS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>User</STRONG> <STRONG>Item</STRONG>	  <STRONG>Requirement</STRONG>
     <STRONG>---------</STRONG>	  <STRONG>-----------</STRONG>
     Last Name	  consists of [a-z] or [A-Z]
     First Name   consists of [a-z] or [A-Z]
     Location	  consists of [a-z] or [A-Z] or [ ()_.-]
     Off. Ph.	  consists of [a-z] or [A-Z] or [ ()_.-]
     Home Ph.	  consists of [a-z] or [A-Z] or [ ()_.-]
     Group	  currently existing group
     Passwd	  max 8 characters
     Quota	  positive integer
     Uname	  consists of [a-z] or [A-Z], max 8 characters


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     If another utility locks the password file while <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> is run-
     ning, <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> pauses and retries a set number of times.  If
     <STRONG>batch_adduser</STRONG> fails to add the user successfully it is noted in the user
     account information file (with an extra field containing "#&lt;--- ERROR")
     and an error is displayed.

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="basics"><H3>Mutual fund basics</H3></A></FONT>

<A NAME="what"><B>What is a mutual fund?</B></A><BR>
A mutual fund is a large pool of money coming from many different
people which is used to buy a wide range of investments.
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="how"><B>How do mutual funds work?</B></A><BR>
When you buy a mutual fund, you purchase what are known as units.
Each unit of a fund represents a portion of the fund's assets.
The value of each unit is determined by dividing the total value
of the investments in the fund by the total number of units issued
by that fund. This value is known as the Net Asset Value (NAV),
which is the price at which you can buy or sell units of the fund.
Most funds calculate their NAV daily, although some funds do it
monthly or even quarterly.
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="owns"><B>Who owns the fund's assets?</B></A><BR>
You own the assets of the fund. Most mutual funds are set up so
that the investments are held in a trust company on your behalf.
Some are set up as corporations in which you become a &quot;shareholder&quot;
of the fund. Neither the fund manager nor the fund company own
the fund's assets, unless of course they buy units of the fund.
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="different"><B>Are there different types of funds?</B></A><BR>
There are two different types of mutual funds - open&#173;end
and closed&#173;end. Open&#173;end funds allow people to buy or
sell fund units at any time. With a closed&#173;end fund, the
only way to buy or sell your units is to find another person willing
to buy or sell them. When people talk about mutual funds, they
are generally referring to open&#173;end funds.
<BR>
<BR>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="benefits"><H3>The benefits of mutual funds</A></H3></FONT>

<B>Diversification</B><BR>
Mutual funds provide instant diversification of investments. Studies
have shown that you must buy at least 15 individual investments
to provide an adequate level of diversification. Most mutual funds
hold at least 30 individual investments, with some holding well
into the hundreds.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Professional management</B><BR>
Mutual funds are managed by full&#173;time investment professionals.
Most people are not familiar with investments and are not willing
to spend the time necessary to become experts. &quot;Hiring&quot;
a professional to do your investing for you makes good sense.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Access to other markets</B><BR>
Mutual funds allow you to have easy access to many of the markets
around the world. Fund managers are located around the globe,
thus giving you access to their expertise regarding far away markets.
Ask yourself whether you would want someone in Toronto telling
you which stock to buy in Thailand, or a fund manager out there
buying it for you?
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Ease of investing</B><BR>
Mutual funds make investing easy. You can get started for as little
as $50 per month. The fund companies also keep track of all your
investments for you, making tax time a breeze compared to looking
after all your records yourself. Should you ever decide to sell
your mutual fund, the fund companies will buy back your units
at the current Net Asset Value. 
<BR>
<BR>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="types"><H3>The types of mutual funds</H3></A></FONT>

<B>Equity mutual funds</B><BR>
Equity funds primarily invest in the shares of companies, although
some of these funds do invest in other &quot;hard&quot; assets
such as real estate and gold. Someone investing in an equity fund
will likely get most of their returns as capital gains and dividends.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Bond &amp; mortgage mutual funds</B><BR>
Bond &amp; Mortgage funds, as the name implies, invest in bonds
and mortgages. A bond is debt issued by a government or corporation,
while a mortgage is debt with a piece of real estate used as security.
Returns will generally come in the form of interest and capital
gains.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Money market mutual funds</B><BR>
Money market funds invest in short&#173;term debt obligations
of governments and corporations. This is the safest type of mutual
fund and all returns come in the form of interest. The rate of
return you receive will closely follow the prevailing short&#173;term
interest rates.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Balanced mutual funds</B><BR>
Balanced funds are a combination of the three previous fund types.
The amount invested in each asset type depends upon the restrictions
placed upon the fund by its prospectus and the manager's own judgement.
Returns may include capital gains, dividends, and interest, with
the proportions depending upon the investments in the fund.

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="WHAT"><H3>What is an equity fund?</H3></A></FONT>
An equity fund is one that invests in the ownership of something.  Ownership can be buying a share in a company, or it could involve buying a piece of real estate, gold, or other financial instrument that provides some type of ownership.  While there are different types of equity investments, this brochure will be devoted to investment in stocks.  Other types of equity funds will be discussed in the <B><I>Specialty Mutual Funds</I></B> section.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="TYPES"><H3>Types of equity funds</H3></A></FONT>
There are many types of equity funds, but they can be characterized by examining how they are invested:

<DL>
<LI>Area of Investment:
	<UL>
	<LI>Global funds
	<LI>Regional funds
	<LI>Single-country funds
	</UL>
<LI>Sector of Investment:
	<UL>
	<LI>Any sector of economy
	<LI>Multiple sectors of the economy
	<LI>Single sector of the economy

<LI>Size of company:
	<UL>
	<LI>Any size of company
	<LI>Large companies
	<LI>Small companies
	</UL>
</DL>

Because of the various areas in which equity funds invest, you should take care not to make unwise comparisons between funds.  For example, it would not be good to compare a fund investing solely in small Korean companies to one that invests all over Europe.  These are two different funds. 

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="LONGTERM"><H3>Long-Term Growth Potential. . .</H3></A></FONT>
Over the long-term, stocks have produced better returns than either bonds or money market investments.  Because of this, it should come as no surprise that equity funds have generally provided the best growth potential over the long-term.  Some of this growth comes from the fund managers selecting good stocks, but much of the returns can be attributed to the fact that you are buying into the good growth prospects of companies.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="SHORTTERM"><H3>Short-Term safety. . .</H3></A></FONT>
Short-term safety is not a strength of equity funds.  Stock prices can fluctuate a fair bit over a short period of time.  If you are not prepared for this volatility, you may not feel comfortable as the value of your investments change.  If you are concerned about short-term price fluctuations, or you will need your money back in the near future, equity funds are probably not the right choice for you.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="TAXAD"><H3>Tax advantages. . .</H3></A></FONT>
Equity funds derive most of their growth from capital gains and dividends.  Since dividends and capital gains have a lower tax rate than interest income, equity funds should produce a lower tax bill than other types of funds.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="EQUITYFUNDS"><H3>Equity funds suitable for. . . </H3></A></FONT>
Since equity funds generally have superior long-term growth potential and receive preferential tax treatment, they are ideal for situations where you will not need the money for a long time or where you want less tax on your investments.  As such, equity funds would be well suited to saving for your retirement or saving for your children's education.

A bond fund invests in the debt issued by governments and corporations.
By definition, a bond is a debt security that matures in more
than one year. A mortgage fund invests in the mortgages used to
finance the purchase of individuals' homes. Most mortgage funds
invest in Mortgage&#173;Backed Securities (MBS), which are pools
of hundreds or thousands of individual mortgages, although some
mutual funds will provide mortgages directly to individuals.
<HR>

There are many types of bond and mortgage funds, but they can
be characterized in the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Type of Investment:
<UL>
<LI>Bonds
<LI>Mortgages 
</UL>

Changing circumstances and different management styles will cause
bond and mortgage funds to perform differently. Make sure you
have an idea of how the fund you choose will react to changes
in interest rates and inflation.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="LONGTERM">Long&#173;term growth potential&#133;</A></FONT>
</H3>

<P>
Bond and mortgage funds will have a somewhat limited long&#173;term
growth potential. Bonds and mortgages generally return just a
few percent more than inflation over the long term. There will
be times when bond and mortgage funds will be the best performers,
but on average they will lag equity funds over the long&#173;term.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="SHORTTERM">Short&#173;term safety...</A> </H3></FONT>

<P>
Bond and mortgage funds are about the middle of the road for short&#173;term
safety. Since the price of bonds and mortgages is generally based
upon prevailing and expected interest rates, their price movements
can be forecast more accurately than for stocks. As such, bond
and mortgage funds will generally be more stable than equity or
balanced funds.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="TAXADV">Tax advantages...</A></H3></FONT>

<P>
Bond and mortgage funds do not provide many tax benefits. Bonds
and mortgages are interest&#173;bearing investments, so the majority
of their returns will be in the form of interest income. Some
capital gains may be realized as changing interest rates cause
the price of the bonds and mortgages to fluctuate. As such, there
may be a small component of lower&#173;taxed capital gains.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="SUITABLE">Bond &amp; mortgage funds suitable for...</A></FONT>
</H3>


<P>
As previously stated, bond and mortgage funds generally do not
provide much long&#173;term growth. They do, however, provide
reasonable short&#173;term safety and would be better suited for
a medium term investment horizon. Bond and mortgage funds would
also be good for those people who would like more growth than
cash but do not want to take too many risks.

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="balance">What is a balanced fund?</A></H3></FONT>
A balanced fund invests in a variety of asset classes to produce
a well diversified portfolio. Balanced funds generally invest
in stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. In addition to
these investment types, some funds also add real estate, mortgage&#173;backed
securities, precious metals, and derivative products to round
out their portfolios and provide that extra degree of diversification.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="types">Types of balanced funds</A></H3></FONT>

There is a wide variety of balanced funds, but they can be characterized
by examining how they are invested, such as by:
<UL>
<LI>Area of investment:
<UL>
<LI>Global funds
<LI>Regional funds
<LI>Single&#173;country funds 
</UL>

<LI>Eligible asset classes:
<UL>
<LI>All asset classes eligible
<LI>Restricted to two or three classes 
</UL>

<LI>Asset class holding limits:
<UL>
<LI>No holding limits
<LI>Asset class holding limits in place 
</UL>

</UL>

<BR>
Because balanced funds invest in a number of different asset classes,
a wide variety of investment styles exist. Some funds limit themselves
to two asset classes (e.g. cash &amp; bonds) while others will
invest in any asset that makes sense by adding to the expected
return or by decreasing risk. As well, some funds have restrictions
in place to limit the amount of money that can be invested in
each asset class; for example, a fund may be required to have
between 30% and 60% in bonds at all times. 

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="longterm">Long&#173;term growth potential. . .</A></H3></FONT>
Balanced funds have shown that they offer good growth potential
over the long&#173;term. Although equity funds have been the best
long&#173;term performers, balanced funds have generally been
the second best choice and will actually have an edge during those
times when equities perform poorly since they can move money into
other asset classes.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="shortterm">Short&#173;term safety...</A></H3></FONT>
Balanced funds provide average short&#173;term safety. The money
market component of a balanced fund is very safe, but the equity
and bond portions are made up of investments whose prices can often
vary significantly over the short&#173;term. In spite of these
concerns, balanced funds are generally safer than equity funds
in the short&#173;term. 

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="taxadv">Tax advantages. . .</A></H3></FONT>
Balanced funds attain their growth from all sources - interest,
dividends, and capital gains. Because of this, balanced funds
do receive some of the tax benefits that come from capital gains
and dividends. But with a portion in interest&#173;bearing investments
as well, some of the returns will be in the form of highly&#173;taxed
interest income. 

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="suitable">Balanced funds suitable for. . .</A></H3></FONT>
Balanced funds are good all&#173;around investments that tend
not to excel in any given year, but are rarely poor performers either.
Balanced funds would be an excellent choice for those who want
some long&#173;term growth with greater safety than equity funds
and better tax treatment than bond or mortgage funds. They would
also be a good choice for those with a mid&#173;range investment
horizon.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="WHY"><H3>Why compare mutual funds?</H3></A></FONT>

When you buy any product, you want to make sure you are getting
all the features you want at the best possible price.  You would
make comparisons to determine which product would best suit your
needs.  Choosing a mutual fund is no different.  Since you cannot
see or touch a mutual fund, making comparisons becomes even more
important.  Because mutual funds are &quot;intangible&quot;, there
is a greater chance that you could end up with a product that
is somewhat different than you had intended.  Taking the time
before you invest to research and compare mutual funds will save
aggravation, and possibly even money, over the long&#173;term.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="HOW"><H3>How do I compare mutual funds?</H3></FONT>

There are two basic ways you can compare mutual funds: how they
compare with each other and how they match up with your financial
goals.  When comparing funds, you must look beyond the returns
that funds have delivered in the past.  Performance is obviously
the most crucial aspect, but other important factors must be taken
into consideration before deciding upon a mutual fund.  When comparing
funds with your financial goals, you must be clear about the level
of short&#173;term volatility you are willing to live with.  Your
feelings about this risk forms a key part of the foundation of
your portfolio strategy and determines the kinds of mutual funds
that would be appropriate for your portfolio. This immediately
limits the funds you should be considering.   But no matter how
you compare mutual funds, keep in mind that all the information
looks at the past, not to the future.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="ONE"><H3>Comparing one fund to another</H3></A></FONT>

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="LOOK"><H3>Look at long&#173;term performance</H3></A></FONT>

By their nature, mutual funds are long term investments.  Short&#173;term
gains get all the attention in the press, but it is the long term
performance of the fund that is important.  Another indicator
is to see how well the fund performed during bad years, as the
good years will usually take care of themselves.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="MAKE"><H3>Make realistic comparisons</H3></A></FONT>

Not all funds are the same.  Therefore, you should only compare
those funds that are similar to one another.  For example, you
should not compare money market funds to equity funds and you
should not compare a Canadian fund to a global fund.  It would
be like comparing apples to oranges.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="VOLATILITY"><H3>Look at the volatility</H3></A></FONT>

Volatility measures how much the unit value of a fund varies from
month to month.  The lower the volatility, the more consistent
the returns of the fund.  Therefore assuming that everything else
is the same between two funds, you would want to take the fund
with the lower volatility.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="SIZE"><H3>The size of the fund matters</H3></A></FONT>

The size of the fund can have a great effect on its potential
returns and its volatility.  Smaller funds can invest in smaller
companies that may have a higher growth potential.  Conversely,
larger funds will generally invest in larger and more established
companies which may experience less volatility because they are
more heavily researched.
<P>
Comparing funds with your financial objectives

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="RISK"><H3>What is my risk tolerance?</H3></A></FONT>

Your personal risk tolerance is one of the foundations of your
investment philosophy.  If your risk level is very conservative,
you should not expect to see exceptional returns.  For example,
if you are only willing to invest in money market funds, you should
not reasonably expect the same 25% an equity fund might return.
 Therefore, only compare your investments with those funds that
fall within your level of risk tolerance.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="WHAT"><H3>What are my financial goals?</H3></A></FONT>

Your financial goals also play a major role in determining the
types of funds in which you will invest, and those which you should
compare.  A goal with a short investment horizon will greatly
restrict your investment choices, whereas a longer horizon will
allow you to broaden your choices.  Remember that while your goals
look toward the future, the comparisons of mutual funds use data
from the past.  If your financial goals are on track, do not change
the funds you are using because another one did better over a
short period of time.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="HINDSIGHT"><H3>Hindsight is 20/20</H3></A></FONT>

Hindsight may be 20/20, but foresight will not come so clearly.
 Your goals and your risk level will determine the appropriate
funds for your portfolio.  So unless your financial goals or the
economic environment changes, do not not be too hasty to second&#173;guess
yourself at a future date.

<P>
When you purchase a mutual fund, you are buying much more than
just an investment.  You are buying the services of an untold
number of people who are paid to operate the mutual fund.  From
the financial advisor and fund manager to the accountants and
the lawyers, you are buying the specialized skills of people.
 This is what makes mutual funds so different from other types
of investments.  It is also what makes mutual funds so confusing
to so many investors.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="how">How does it all work?</A></H3></FONT>

<P>
 The diagram to the right shows a simplified version of what happens
to your money once you decide to invest in a mutual fund.  As
you can see, it passes through a number of hands before reaching
the mutual fund you purchased.  After your money has been invested
in the fund, various fees and expenses are deducted at regular
intervals (usually monthly) in order to pay the people involved
in managing and administering the fund.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="whatadd">What does all this add up to?</A></H3></FONT>

<P>
While it appears that all your money may be eaten up in fees,
the actual amount is quite low.  Some Canadian money market funds
have expenses of less than <TT><FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">&#189;</FONT></TT>%
per annum while some exotic foreign equity funds have expenses
up to 3<TT><FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">&#189;</FONT></TT>% per year.
<H4>Fees paid to the financial advisor...</H4>

<P>
Commissions and service fees are paid to the financial advisor
to compensate this person for the advice they give you, the investor.
<H4>Commissions</H4>

<P>
This is the fee your investment advisor is paid at the time when
the mutual fund is purchased.  This fee can be paid up&#173;front
(initial sales charge) or if you redeem the fund within a certain
period of time (deferred sales charge).  This fee is usually based
on a percentage of the amount invested.
<H4>Service Fees</H4>

<P>
Trailer or service fees are paid to the advisor by the fund company
to encourage ongoing service to the client.  These fees are paid
monthly or quarterly and are based on a percentage of the fund
assets that the investment advisor has under administration.
<H4>Fees paid to operate the fund...</H4>

<P>
Administration fees, management fees, and operational expenses
are paid from the fund to pay those involved in running it.
<H4>Administration Fees</H4>

<P>
A mutual fund cannot operate unless some organization is there
to collect and distribute the money moving in and out of the fund.
 This is where the fund company comes in.  They are paid a fee
to handle the day&#173;to&#173;day administration of the fund.
 The fund company may use this money to pay for commissions, service
fees, recordkeeping, and other necessary functions.  This fee
is based on a percentage of the assets in the fund.
<H4>Management Fees</H4>

<P>
Someone has to make the investment decisions for the fund.  These
fees pay for the services of a manager who chooses the investments
for the fund.  The management fee depends on the type of fund
&ugrave; the fee tends to increase in line with the difficulty
in selecting the investments.  For example, more costs are involved
in selecting stocks for an emerging market fund than for a Canadian
money market fund.  This fee is based on a percentage of the assets
in the fund.
<H4>Operational Expenses</H4>

<P>
Most mutual funds charge their other operational expenses directly
to the people who own the fund.  These expenses often include:
director's fees, legal fees, audit fees, reports to shareholders,
taxes, transfer agent fees, and salaries.  These costs are incurred
to protect you, the investor.

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="WHAT"><H3>What is life insurance?</H3></A></FONT>

Life insurance is a contract between the person insured and the insurance company to pay a certain sum upon death.  

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="WHY"><H3>Why do I need life insurance?</H3></A></FONT>

<H4>Traditional uses for life insurance</H4>
Our earning potential is usually our greatest asset, and we make all sorts of financial commitments for the future based upon our ability to generate an income to pay for them.  Suppose you died.  How would your survivors pay for all these financial commitments?  This is where life insurance plays its role.  Life insurance can be used to eliminate debts, pay estate taxes, fund your children's education, and pay for your funeral.  It can also be used to set up an investment pool which your survivors can 
draw upon for a stream of income.

<H4>The new era of life insurance</H4>
With opportunities for tax deferral decreasing and income & estate taxes increasing, life insurance is now being used as a tax haven for those who have additional cash to invest and as a tax liberator for those with large tax liabilities because of accumulations in RRSPs, RRIFs and businesses.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="TYPES"><H3>Types of life insurance</H3></A></FONT>

<H4>Term insurance</H4>
Term insurance provides a death benefit only.  Renewable term insurance is for limited periods of time and has a level death benefit with increasing cost.  Term to age 100 (T100) has a level death benefit as well as a level cost.

<H4>Permanent insurance</H4>
Permanent insurance, as the name would suggest, lasts for as long as you continue to pay the premiums and has no fixed time frame.  In the early years of the policy, the premiums are higher than for term insurance so as to create a policy reserve which effectively spreads the cost over the life of the policy.   There are two main forms of permanent insurance:  whole life which has a savings component and universal life which has a savings component with tax advantages.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="TERM"><H3>Term or permanent?</H3></A></FONT>
The choice between term or permanent insurance depends upon your circumstances.  The graph below shows the basic cost differences over time that you should be aware of when making your decision.  Generally, term insurance would probably be the best option if you need coverage for a specific time or for a specific expense that must be paid.  Universal life would be the choice if tax-advantaged asset growth or a shortened deposit period is desired.

Disability insurance is a product that protects you and your family
from undue financial burden if you should get sick or hurt and
cannot work. 

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="why">Why do I need disability insurance?</A></H3></FONT>
For most of us, our earning potential is our greatest asset. We
make all sorts of financial commitments for the future based upon
our ability to generate an income to pay for them. But suppose
you were no longer able to work. How would you go about paying
for all these financial commitments? This is where disability
insurance plays its role. Disability insurance, in conjunction
with other government programs, will provide a replacement for
most of your lost income.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="likely">How likely am I to become disabled?</A></H3></FONT>
The chances of you becoming disabled are greater than you think.
In fact, nearly one third of all people now aged thirty&#173;five
will be unable to work for at least six months before reaching
the age of 65. The chance that you'll suffer a disability before
retirement is five times greater than the chance you will die
before retirement. Given these statistics, it is amazing that
people are usually more concerned about life insurance than about
disability insurance.

<HR>

Each individual chooses the level of benefit they need, with the
insurance company basing the maximum amount upon your income level.
Usually the maximum available is close to the income you would
have after income taxes are taken into account. The level of benefits
can be increased by purchasing additional coverages, such as Business
Overhead Expenses or Retirement Income Protection.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="taxed">How are the benefits taxed?</A></H3></FONT>
Disability insurance benefits are not taxed if you pay your own
premiums. However, if your employer pays any portion of your premium,
or other related costs, the benefits you receive will be taxed.
For many shareholders of private corporations, this offers a distinct
advantage; their corporation can pay the premium, which results
in a tax deduction for the company, while the taxable benefits
received will allow for continued tax and retirement planning.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="other">Other sources of disability income</A></H3></FONT>
As employees, Canadians are eligible to receive benefits from
U.I.C, Workers' Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, and in
some provinces auto insurance and victims of crime programs. Most
employers today also have group benefit plans covering their employees.
Self&#173;employed individuals and major shareholders in corporations
are also covered by some of these programs, but the insurance
companies usually discount access to them when calculating coverage
available on private plans. You should make sure you understand
how these programs interact with your disability insurance coverage
so you will be fully aware of what your income would be should
you be hurt or sick and need to make a claim.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="options">Disability insurance options</A></H3></FONT>

<H4>Own occupation / Any occupation </H4>
Some policies will pay benefits if you are unable to do your &quot;own&quot;
or regular job while some will only pay if you cannot to &quot;any&quot;
job.

<H4>Residual policies </H4>
These policies will top&#173;up your income if you have a medical
problem and lose income.

<H4>Elimination period </H4>
The elimination period is the time you have to wait before benefits
will start. The longer the period, the lower your premiums will
be.

<H4>Duration of benefits </H4>
Disability benefits are usually paid anywhere from two years up
to your entire lifetime.

<H4>Inflation protection </H4>
You can have a cost of living allowance (COLA) rider on your policy
so that your disability income will not be eroded by inflation.

<H4>Other Coverages </H4>
Private coverages can be tailored to provide income or benefits
to meet various needs, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Reimbursement for small business &quot;Overhead Costs.&quot;
<LI>Replacement of the cost of losing a &quot;Key Employee.&quot;
<LI>Providing cash to complete a &quot;Buy&#173;Sell&quot; triggered
by a serious disability.
<LI>Paying an &quot;Income Tax Debt&quot; owed to Revenue Canada.
<LI>Continuing &quot;Retirement Planning&quot; asset accumulation.

Many people are aware of the basic concepts of life and disability insurance.  Unfortunately, most are not familiar with some of the more subtle benefits that can be derived from insurance.  As well, the benefits you would like from insurance will change as you progress through life.  Below are a number of scenarios that you may encounter.  If one or more of these scenarios describes you, an insurance product could probably be of use.

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="personal"><H3>Personal situations that impact insurance needs</H3></A></FONT>
I still need some life insurance protection but I am not happy paying premiums for the rest of my life.  <br><br>

I am over 45 and maximize my registered plan deposits each year.  I would like to continue tax sheltering additional fund for retirement. <br><br>

I have all the money I want in equity savings but would still like to save in a tax-sheltered area. <br><br>

I have no spouse or childern to leave my estate to and would like to make a charitable donation of it when I die, but I want to generate tax-preferred Income from it when I'm alive. <br><br>

I would like to make a regular donation to a charity today and a lump sum when I die, but I'm not healthy enough to purchase life Insurance. <br><br>

My RRIF acount is paying only the minimum annually, so my tax liability upon death is actually growing.  I don't want this to happen. <br><br>

I don't spend all my pension income now, so my savings are creating an ever-increasing income tax bill.  I want to avoid the taxes but I don't want to invest in equities. <br><br>

I have a significant amount of money in Interest bearing account and am paying too much Income tax each year.  I don't spend all the Income I have now, and don't want to pay this extra tax. <br><br>

I am within five years of retirement and want to maximize my pension income while both my spouse and I are alive, but still provide continuing Income to whomever survives the other. <br><br>

I am retried and seem to be forever increasing the quarterly tax installment to Revenue Canada.  Changing interest rates also make it hard to plan for the level of income.  I want some tax relief along with high income. <br><br>

We have a large capital gains liability in the estate but do not want the childeren to sell the assets to pay the tax bill when we die. <br><br>

We would like to leave the grandchildren a gift from our estate but don't feel comfortable gifting ownership of the ownership of the cash today.<br><br>


<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><A NAME="business"><H3>Business situations that impact insurance needs</H3></A></FONT>
We are aware that our Buy-Sell agreement should be funded by life insurance but are concerned about what would happen if one of us became seriously disabled. <br><br>

We have a Buy-Sell agreement funded by term Insurance and were wondering if there is any way we could pay the premiums with pre-tax dollars. <br><br>

I am a shareholder in a private corporation that uses term insurance for collateral protection on the business loans.  I am aware that the net cost of insurance is tax deductible but was wondering if I could pay the premiums with pre-tax dollars. <br><br>

My spouse and I own a private company and would like to have the corporation pay our disability coverage without making the premiums a taxable benefit. <br><br>

I have my own company and would like to use it to set aside additional funds for my retirement. <br><br>

Our company has a key employee who needs additional life insurance.  We want the company to pay a large portion of the premium but not make it a taxable benefit to the employee. <br><br>

Our company has a key employee who is vital to the continued sucess of the organization.  If that person dies or becomes disabled, we would need cash fast to offset the cost of replacing him. <br><br>

My company has a significant amount of retained earnings on which I would like to avoid as much tax as possible.  I know I can purchase an insured annuity for tax positioning but was wondering how I could make the cost tax deductible. <br><br>

I am over 60 and have a significant amount of retained earnings in my company, so the refundable tax account is growing rapidly.  I want to maximize my income from these funds while paying as little tax as possible. <br><br>

<P>
Diversification is the process of selecting various investments
so as to reduce the overall risk of a portfolio. But how could
a number of individual investments actually reduce the risk of
a portfolio? Wouldn't the portfolio's risk level just be the average
risk level of each of the investments? This would be the case
if it were not for the little understood concept of correlation.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="correlation">Correlation: the hidden component of
diversification</A></H3></FONT>

<P>
What is correlation? Well, it is a statistic that measures how
one series of numbers interacts with another series of numbers.
In the investment world, the rates of return for two investments
would be used. In layman's terms, correlation measures how much
one investment &quot;zigs&quot; when the other one &quot;zags&quot;.
Correlation can range from positive (two investments &quot;zig&#173;zag&quot;
together) to negative (one investment &quot;zigs&quot; when the
other &quot;zags&quot;).
<H4>Positive correlation</H4>

<P>
Positive correlation is absolutely no good for investing. The
graph below shows how two positively correlated investments
interact when mixed together. As you can see, no benefits are
gained as the mix goes up and down just as much as each of the
individual investments.
<P>
<IMG SRC="diver1.gif">

<H4>Negative correlation</H4>
<P>
The graph below shows how negative correlation is extremely beneficial
for investing. Each of the investments goes up and down at exactly
the opposite time. When the two investments are combined, the
&quot;Mix&quot; line is created - a no&#173;risk portfolio.
This is the theoretically perfect portfolio.
<P>
<IMG SRC="diver2.gif">

<H4>No correlation</H4>
<P>
The graph below shows the benefits you are likely
to get from diversification in the real world. Here, the two investments
do not always move in the same direction at the same time. There
is no correlation between them. The risk level of the mix is less
than the two individual investments but has not been completely
eliminated.
<P>
<IMG SRC="diver3.gif">

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3><A NAME="practice">Putting diversification into practice</A></FONT>
</H3>

<H4>Understand how investments move</H4>

<P>
Knowing how different investments react to different circumstances
is the foundation of diversification and the basis for determining
the correlation between investments. You cannot diversify properly
if you do not know how investments move in relation to one another.
<H4>Look for low or negative correlation</H4>

<P>
Low or negative correlation investments will reduce overall risk
the most. For example, stocks and T&#173;bills have a low correlation
and combining them would reduce your portfolio's overall risk.
<H4>Look at the whole portfolio</H4>

<P>
As shown in the graph below, individual investments will move
up and down quite a bit, while the &quot;mix&quot; isn't as volatile
as either of them. Remember, diversification reduces the risk
of the portfolio as a whole and not the risk of the individual
investments. Do not panic if just one component of your portfolio
is doing poorly.

</UL>

<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3>What is estate planning?</H3></FONT>

<P>
Estate planning is the process of positioning your assets so that
they will retain as much value as possible and will go where you
want them to after you pass away. Estate planning is more than
just writing a will. It is the use of many strategies that will
protect the value of your assets, while you are alive as well
as after you pass away.
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000080><H3>Why develop an estate plan?</H3></FONT>

<P>
Many people, organizations, and governments have an interest in
your estate. The diagram at the bottom of the page shows some
of these important stakeholders. Who ends up with your estate
depends highly upon your estate plan. You may want your spouse
and your children to receive the benefits of your estate, but
poor planning may enable the government and creditors to greatly
reduce the amount you leave to your heirs. The three major areas
of concern are described in more detail below.
<P>
Wills
<P>
The essential document for achieving your estate planning goals
is a will. While it is not mandatory that your will be drawn up
by a lawyer, it is normally a prudent idea given the sometimes
complex nature of one's estate. A will can avoid those hasty decisions
and misunderstandings which lead to permanent strife after your
death, if there is doubt about your exact intentions. When you
have been meticulous and decisive in building up assets during
your lifetime, it seems tragic to allow the provincial government
to determine how these assets will be partitioned amongst your
family.
<P>
Tax reduction
<P>
Taxes are the main avenue through which governments can claim
a large portion of your estate. Proper planning, even starting
early in your life, will enable you to make arrangements so that
your assets can be passed on to your heirs with minimum disruption
due to taxes. Tax reduction can take many forms, from RRSP planning
and estate freezes to income splitting and life insurance strategies.
<P>
Asset protection
<P>
Asset protection is the last major endeavour of estate planning.
Sometimes your own success can set you up to be a victim of other
people who want a piece of that success. Disgruntled employees,
business partners, and even ex&#173;spouses can sometimes start
actions against you, which may leave your assets somewhat depleted.
Appropriate asset protection strategies should be implemented
so as to limit any potential losses.
<P>
Priorities for different types of people
<P>
Other than will planning, which everyone should do, people in
different financial situations will have different estate planning
needs. Here are the basic priorities for different people:
<P>
Successful entrepreneur
<P>
The successful entrepreneur has a valuable business to be passed
on and a high income. The main estate planning goals are estate
freezing, asset protection, income splitting, and life insurance
funding of taxes.
<P>
Large&#173;scale investor
<P>
The large&#173;scale investor has accumulated a sizable pool of
investments that generates a substantial amount of income. Estate
planning goals include income splitting and insurance funding
of capital gains taxes.
<P>
Executive
<P>
The executive has a high income with most assets being pension
plans, RRSPs, and personal residences. Income splitting, structuring
pension plans &amp; RRSPs to minimize taxes, and insurance funding
of taxes are the priority.
<P>
Unincorporated professional
<P>
The unincorporated professional has a high income with much wealth
coming from his/her ongoing business. Estate planning priorities
include asset protection, income splitting and RRSPs.
<P>
Salaried employee
<P>
Much of the salaried employee's wealth is tied up in pensions
and RRSPs. Structuring these assets to his/her benefit is of vital
importance.
<P>
Retiree
<P>
The retiree is mainly concerned about maximizing income for the
final years. Pensions, RRSPs, and income splitting become priorities.
