This report describes the results produced from a computer model that was used for assessing the different ways that the infrastructure for alternative transportation fuels could develop. The model includes demand, production, transportation, local distri
bution, retailing, economic returns and environmental impacts. A business module within the model analyses the cost and revenue components of fuel supply and presents them in the form of cash flow formats.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A 20th century historical study of the interactions of petroleum supply and demand patterns and subsequent macroeconomic events suggests that the often-erratic behavior of the oil markets consistently contributes to economic instability.  The obvious depl
etion of U.S. oil reserves and the increasing importance of oil consumption in U.S. transportation are argued to be causes for greater attention to the development of alternative (non-oil based) transportation fuels.  Absent such development, the historic
al lessons in this paper suggest that another period of rising oil prices, erratic oil market behavior, and subsequent economic difficulty is probable within the next two decades.  Methanol is argued to be the most likely and most desirable sustitute tran
sportation fuel, because it can be produced more economically and used more efficiently than gasoline when derived from the rapidly expanding worldwide supplies of natural gas (author abstract 11 figs., 28 refs

Natural gas vehicle (NGV) markets in Italy, New Zealand, the United States and Canada are compared.  The purpose of the study is to identify reasons why natural gas is an attractive fuel for vehicles in Italy and New Zealand, while Canada and the U.S. app
ear to resist a changeover.  The research indicates a number of quite serious obstacles preventing natural gas becoming the fuel of choice for potential vehicle converters and recommendations which aim to overcome these obstacles are suggested

The problems associated with the high temperature oxidation of methane when natural gas is used as an engine fuel are discussed.  A reaction scheme consisting of 24 reaction steps and involving 15 species is used to predict methane combustion in a flow sy
stem.  Comparisons with experimental work reported in the literature indicate similar trends both in the calculated values of the induction period and in the calculated concentrations profiles

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

An experimental study is presented in which the use of neat dimethyl ether (DME) in a small non-turbo-charged diesel engine is demonstrated. It was found that with only minor fuel system modifications, DME gave very satisfactory combustion, performance an
d emissions. Engine operation with thermal efficiency equivalent to diesel fuel was achieved with much lower NOx emissions and with extremely low smoke and less engine noise. Additional NOx reductions were obtained by the use of EGR, without visible smoke
and without deterioration in thermal efficiency. A limited durability study showed that the diesel fuel injection pump operate on DME for more than 500 hours. A comparison of pure and technical grade DME was conducted.

This is a detailed report on a project aimed at validating Acoustic Emission Testing as a means of detecting active cracking in compressed natural gas vehicle storage cylinders.  The report includes the procedure followed, the results obtained, and the fi
nal conclusions drawn from th testing.  Results indicated that acoustic emission testing was able t detect stress corrosion cracking, with activity levels very sensitive to cylinder pressure.  However, AET may not be able to predict an impending burst.  (

This paper presents thermodynamic properties of selected fuel-air mixtures, in this case methane and propane, in a form suitable for utilization in engine performance calculations.  Comparisons are made between the performance to be expected with these ga
seous fuels compared to octane, as representative of gasoline.  As expected from the predictions engine power is reduced when converting from fuel of the gasoline range to LPG and further loss between LPG and natural gas

The NGV Development Plan sets out the strategies and programs which the Canadian NGV industry plans to adopt in order to reach its projected goals. Although the rate of conversions dropped in 1987, when gasoline prices declined, the total number was only
slightly less than in 1985.  It is necessary that industry and government continue their support of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and that strong marketing programs continue.  Research and development is an integral part of the NGV Development Plan

A comparative evaluation of six transit bus engines (three diesel, one propane (LPG), one natural gas for vehicles (NGV), and one methanol) has been performed.  The purpose of the program was to assess the exhaust emission and fuel consumption of current
state-of-the-art alternative fuel engines Engine dynamometer test work was performed at the Ontario Research Foundation (ORF) which allowed a detailed comparison of several alternative-fuelled engines versus their diesel counterparts.  Test data includes
steady-state brake-specific fuel consumption maps, torque and horsepower curves.  Transient performance, fuel consumption and emissions information came from computer-controlled engine dynamometer runs of th Advanced Design Bus (ADB) test cycle as defined
by US DOT/Booz, Allen & Hamilton The results of the test program indicate that alternative fuels have a useful role to play in reducing transit bus engine exhaust emissions (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Recently significant supplies of gas have been discovered in Brazil, generating optimistic expectations of its future use especially in urban mass transportation.  These discoveries have prompted government agencies and oil companies to start test program
mes with compressed natural gas (CNG) in bus fleets in 7 Brazilian cities.  The purpose is to develop CNG technology, and provide a technico-economic evaluation of: performance of Otto Cycle and diesel engines; processes for gas storage and supply; operat
ion and maintenance of supply centers; costs and fares.  The test vehicles have been used in regular service, covering an average distance of 250 km/day.  They use an average of 0.4 SCM/km for Otto cycle bus engines and have a diesel substitution rate of
70% in dual-fuel applications.  The gas is being stored at 20 MPa in steel cylinders.  The results obtained during the testing period, and a technico-economic evaluation will be used for planning an Ipiranga Gas-Programme for the future.  (From author abs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Before 1979 the use of Auto-Propane was limited to propane marketers and selective high mileage fleets and individuals.  In that year the Federal and some Provincial governments recognized the potential for propane to reduce gasoline consumption and hence
resolve the concern about the potential oil shortage in the eighties.  Accordingly, both governments offered incentive programs to encourage propane conversions.  Thus government created the stimulus for an auto-propane market and provided a challenge to
the private sector to build the necessary distribution network.  The paper describes the process followed by the Propane industry in building up a fueling system in Ontario that began with virtually no outlets to today's total of over 1100 locations.  Th
e industry has taken five years to create what has taken the other automotive fuels over 75 years.  First the changes to the various channels of distribution are discussed starting with what was in place in 1979.  This is followed by a description of the
factors involved in choosing appropriate outlets.  A brief discussion of variables in station design are discussed as well as the important role equipment development has played.  Finally a look into the future of the auto-propane distribution network is
made to describe trends and potential changes.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Chemists at the University of Cambridge found a way to look inside the microscopic pores of a zeolite catalyst.  As zeolites have been used to turn chemicals into fuels, i.e. natural gas into liquid petroleum fuel, scientists are most interested in determ
ining why and how zeolites behave the way they do

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper discusses safety aspects involved in the testing program of Burlington Northern Railroad's dual fuel (diesel/natural gas) locomotive, as well as concerns for future CNG or dual fuel locomotive research.  Burlington Northern's in-service testing
program requires exemption from tw U.S. Dept. of Transport regulations concerning transportation of hazardous substances before it can continue.  Railroad personnel have already been given guidelines for making safety checks of potential hazards however.
Concerns to be considered in the future include safe design plans for tender cars, and the possibility of natural gas being released and accumulating in railway tunnels

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The burning characteristics of CNG in a single-cylinder spark ignition engine using two ignition sources (conventional capacitive ignition and plasma jet ignition) are examined.  The test engine was operated with a constant fuel flow rate so that measurem
ent of engine output power or the combustion chamber pressure recorded how each ignition source caused the fixed fuel-air charge to burn.  It was noted that for optimal engine efficiency considerably less timing advance is required with plasma jet ignitio
n, and that ignition delay time is considerably reduced

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Environmental, economic and national energy security issues have resulted in a rapidly growing interest worldwide in natural gas for vehicles (NGV). British Columbia can capitalize on this interest by supporting a focused technological development strateg
y specifically targeted at marketable products and processes which can be developed and manufactured in B.C.  This report describes general areas of required support, but focuses on these specific products for Science Council support: the non-metallic, on
-board NGV storage cylinder; the direct injection natural gas fuel storage cylinder injection system for heavy-duty engines; the dual fuel diesel/natural gas retrofit system; and the small, on-site residential or small commercial NGV refueling compressor.

Disposition of electric vehicle (EV) batteries after they have reached the end of their useful life is an issue that could impede the widespread acceptance of EVs in the commercial market.  This is especially true for advanced battery systems where workin
g recycling processes have not as yet been established.  The U.S. Department of Energy sponsors an Ad Hoc Electric Vehicle Battery Readiness Working Group to identify barriers to the introduction of commercial EVs and to advise them of specific issues rel
ated to battery reclamation / recycling, in-vehicle battery safety, and battery shipping.A Sub-Working Group on the reclamation/recycle  topic has been reviewing the status of recycling process development for the principal battery technologies that a
re candidates for EV use from the near-term to the long-term.  Recycling of near-term battery technologies, such as Lead-Acid and Nickel/Cadmium, is occuring today and it is believed that sufficient processing capacity can be maintained to keep up with th
e large number of units that could result from extensive EV use.  Reclamation/recycle processes for mid-term batteries are partially developed.  Good progress has been made in identifying processes to recycle Sodium/Sulphur batteries at a reasonable cost
and pilot scale facilities are being tested or planned.  A pre-feasibility cost study on the Nickel/Metal Hydride battery also indicates favorable economics for some of the proposed reclamation processes.  More work on defining the process details is need
ed in this case.  Long-term battery technologies, including Lithium-Polymer and Lithium/Iron Disulfide, are still being designed and developed for EVs, so descriptions of prototype recycling processes are rather general at this point.  However, some issue
s related to the recycling of Lithium have already become apparent.  Due to the long time required to set up new, full-scale recycling facilities, it is important to develop a reclamation/recycling process in parallel with the battery technologies themsel
ves.

A single cylinder four stroke engine (CLR) was used to investigate the feasibility of using mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide as an alternate fuel.  Effects of fuel quality on engine power output and brake specific fuel consumption were investigated
at 800, 1600, 2400, 2800 and 3200 rpm using full throttle setting with various spark timing, equivalence ratio and maximum load.  Results indicated that using fuel mixtures having quality of 65/35 or better in methane and carbon dioxide ratio along with o
ptimum spark timing and operating equivalence ratio corresponding to maximum fuel economy, engine power losses and brake specific fuel consumption increases could be kept below 10% compared to the maximum power produced with pure methane fuel

A dual-fuel conversion of a two-stroke Detroit Diesel Allison bus engine developed by Pro-Staff Fuels was tested at B.C. Research.  A converted engine was mounted on the dynamometer and tested over its operating range.  Performance and fuel consumption we
re measured on both fuels.  Cylinder pressures were monitored in two cylinders and exhaust temperatures were measured for all cylinders.  It was found that on average the torque developed on dual-fuel was lower by 7% at high speeds and higher by 9% at 100
0 rpm.  The peak pressures on dual-fuel were typically between 70 and 80% of those on diesel.  The thermal efficiency of the converted engine was on average lower by 18%.  The diesel substitution varied from 0% at idle to 87% at 1000 rpm and full load.  T
here was no sign of detonation at any operating conditions on dual-fuel.  (Author abstract

The Pacific Gas and Electric Company of California is moving into its second stage of involvement with the NGV industry -- a program for conversion of customer fleets.  They have examined market influences such as safety, economics, and equipment required
, and taken into consideration concerns of the customers in the development of their marketing strategy.  PG&E also undertook an extensive in-house marketing program to educate their own employees on the advantages of natural gas vehicles.  They believe t
hat developing a successful in-house NGV program is crucial to marketing CNG to fleet owners in their area

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A propane tank anti-BLEVE (boiling liquid evaporating vapour explosion) safety system is presented.  BLEVE occurs when a propane tank is engulfed in a fire.  The top of the tank becomes hot and weakened causing the tank to rupture due to the explosive nat
ure of the high pressure fuel in the tank.  The system is designed for rail and road propane tankers and storage tanks, but can also be used on automotive propane tanks.  The system has a simple turbo-charger inside the tank and uses the vapour escaping t
hrough the pressure safety relief valve to spin the turbo-charger that takes in liquid propane just below the surface near the shell of the tank, and sprays it vertically upwards to cool the top part of the tank.  For mobile tanks, the design uses gravity
valve assemblies to ensure that the liquid is sprayed upwards inside the tank and vapour is released upwards outside the tank.  The system is also suitable for use with other fuels, and for low pressure tanks.  (From author abstract

This paper presents the results of a one year demonstration project in which a Class 8 tractor based in Vancouver, British Columbia was converted to dual fuel natural gas/diesel operation.  The objective of this project was to demonstrate the viability of
fuelling and operating Class 8 trucks on natural gas/diesel under commercial operating conditions.  In assessing the viability of the natural gas/diesel system, data were collected and analyzed concerning comparative fuel efficiency, natural gas/diesel p
roportions of fuel use, operating range, refuelling times, and relative fuel costs, along with assessments of its performance by drivers and fleet management.  The truck has now been in commercial service for more than two years and has logged in excess o
f 100,000 km.  Paper no. 911666 in "Alternative Fuels in the Nineties".  (author abstract

Smog chamber tests were conducted using automobile exhaust gas generated during emissions tests with a group of alternatively fueled vehicles.  The tests were designed to evaluate the photochemical characteristics of organic emissions from vehicles operat
ing on compressed natural gas, methanol, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, and reformulated gasolines.  A description of the emissions characterization portion of the study is presented in this paper to assist in better understanding the chamber experimen
ts described in the companion paper (SAE # 941906, Article # 5057).  The study is part of a larger program in which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in cooperation with the U.S. Enviromental Protection Agency is examining the effects of alternative fu
el usage on emissions and fuel economy.  In this study methanol, ethanol, CNG, LPG and four blends of gasoline emissions were measured for NMOG, CO, NOx and MIR (maximum incremental reactivity) emission rates. (from Author's abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The LNG/LIN transport system for offshore natural gas is discussed. Liquid nitrogen is produced in an onshore plant and loaded onboard the LNG/LIN shuttle tanker.  At the offshore field natural gas is transferred from a loading buoy and liquefied onboard
the vessel by heat exchange with vaporizing nitrogen.  The vessel then returns with LNG to the onshore terminal and unloads the LNG simultaneously loading liquefied nitrogen.  This system has a number of serous drawbacks which this paper identifies and th
en suggests ways of eliminating

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper discusses in detail the role of natural gas as a cleaner vehicle fuel. It gives the advantages of using natural gas as a fuel. The NGV is the lowest emitting production vehicle and that the NGV conversion technology has improved dramatically to
allow converted vehicles to meet present gasoline vehicle emission standards. Natural gas has essentially the same potential for renewable supply as ethanol or methanol and emits fewer fine particulates, the single major cause of health effects from vehi
cle emissions. (summary)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A remote gas analyser for motor vehicle exhaust emissions surveillance in which a planar array fo gas analyser beams intersects substatially an entire cross-sectional segment of an exhaust gas plume in order to determine the volume concentration of gas po
llutants in the exhaust.  In a further variation using more readily availiable equipment ot detect teh less prevalent pollutants, the planar array determines the change in amount per unit volume of a first pollutant emitted by a motor vehicle passing the
array.  The first pollutant having a relatively high more easily detectable concentration.  A second, multi-spectral gas analyser beam intersects the exhaust to determine the change in concentrationof the less prevalent pollutants with respect to ambient,
and also determines the change in concentration of the first pollutant.  The ratio of the change in the first pollutant;s weight per unit volume to its change in concentration as determined by the second analyser is used ot determine the change in amount
per volume of the remaining pollutants.

Since november 10, 1993, an interchange car park is in operation in the city of Livomo with five electric vehicles to be used by the customers on a SELF-SERVICE basis, through a prepaid MICROCHIP CARD.  The parking lots are equipped with electronic column
s for battery charging and for "dialogue" with the customer.  The initiative has the aims of spreading knowledge of electirc vehicles making them available to any private individual without entailing the problems of ownership, to analyse the type of missi
ons accomplished via free use of EVs, to verify the acceptance/appreciation of EVs and of this type of service and to encourage use of EVs in the urban context.The results are positive, with good response of the systems in terms of reliability and sui
tability for the needs of a fair number of users.  Plans are in progress for installing interchange car parks of the same type in other italian cities.

In this paper, the Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) batteries are used for the study of thermal management for the improvement of long term reliability and the performance in a battery used in the electric (EV) or the hybrid-electric (HEV) vehicles.  The
cause of the critical problem of heat produced in a EV or HEV is the actual construction of the batteries used.  The individual cells or the multi-celled monoblocs are very closely packed due to the physical limitation of the EVs and HEVs.  The system com
ponents are also outlined and described.  HEV Duty Cycle and  Free Air tests were done to simulate the batteries in working condition.  Areas for development and long term improvements of the project were outlined for future activities.

This paper covers in brief format the energy situation in Britain, the government's energy policy and current work on alternative fuels.  The main alternative fuels considered in Britain are alcohols, either for use as blending components or as 'neat' fue
l, liquefied natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, hydrogen, oil from coal and other petrol 'extenders'.  This paper does not attempt to cover all the work being done in Britain, or provide comprehensive technical and commercial information, it is merely an
overview of the industry

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Internal combustion engines used in natural gas pipelines are discussed. For best fuel economy, dual fuel engines should be so arranged that when the engine is operated as a gas diesel, combustion air quantity is reduced to about 75 percent of that requir
ed for the engine when operating as an oil diesel.  Fuel economy/efficiency is affected by changes in ambient temperature, as well as changes in pilot fuel timing and quantity as a result of speed changes.  If these variables are controlled it is possible
to have as high as 20 percent savings in fuel

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In this paper the basic aspects of spark ignition and the potential problems associated with its use in appliances run on natural gas are presented.  As natural gas has a lower diffusity in air, a lower burning velocity and narrower flammability limits co
mpared to gasoline, problems arise with flame stability and ignition in certain areas of domestic and commercial use.  Research was conducted to determine the minimum energy requirements needed to ensure reliable ignition.  Results indicate the relative i
mportance in spark ignition, of gas/air mixtures of factors such as gas composition, vitiation level, electrode geometry, and material, circuit characteristics, etc.  It is thought that spark ignition should prove attractive in domestic use, providing car
eful consideration is given to the design and integration of the appliance and spark ignition's source

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A 20th century historical study of the interacting patterns of petroleum demand and supply and subsequent macroeconomic events suggests that the often-erratic behavior of the oil markets consistently contributes to economic instability.  The obvious deple
tion of U.S. oil reserves and the increasing importance of oil to the nation's transportation system are argued to be causes for greater attention to the development of alternative transportation fuels not derived from oil.  Without such development, the
historical lessons in the report suggest that another period of rising oil prices, erratic oil market behavior, and subsequent economic difficulty is probable within the next two decades.  Methanol is argued to be the most likely and most desirable substi
tute transportation fuel because it can be produced more economically and used more efficiently than gasoline when derived from the rapidly expanding worldwide reserves of natural gas.  (Author abstract

Running cars on natural gas should offer a cost advantage--without one, it's difficult to justify coping with all of the disadvantages and complexities of the system.  If one builds vehicles to suit the system, however, it's possible to achieve satisfacto
ry performance with a reasonable range.  Because public refueling stations are nonexistant, these vehicles currently are limited to fleet operation with central refueling.  But preliminary studies show that the home refueling system offers an alternative
superior to the electric vehicle

Based on the understanding that performance compatible with gasoline-powered vehicles is vital for the prevalence of electric vehicles, we have developed a two-seater MX-5 EV intended for commuting and short distance routine business activities that may n
ot be affected by its short driving range and other weaknesses.  Equipped with a high-power AC (Alternate Current) motor and high-power and high-energy Ni-Cd batteries, the MX-5 EV has proved having an accelerating performance equivalent to that of gasoli
ne-powered vehicles as a result of performance tests.Furthermore, it has been judged through practicability tests that the vehicle can be used without any problem with the driving performance for routine business activities, and no other problems have
been identified for future improvement .

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Vapor delivered lubrication was designed to meet two special needs. First, vapor delivery of a lubricant in a carrier gas provides a method of delivering small, but precise amounts of lubricant to a bearing system.  Second, the lubricant delivered in a ca
rrier gas can be designed to provide good lubrication without undesireable buildup over the temperature range of 200 degrees C to 1600 degrees C.  Various modes of vapor lubrication are discussed.  The methods of delivering vapor phase lubricants in an en
gine are not yet well developed.  Improved methods for the application of lubrication technology to engines need to be developed and evaluated.  Presentation is in outline format.  (from author abstract

Municipality of Ankara due to the economical and environmental reasons decided to use natural gas as the fuel in its buses. In 1993 the system developed in the Middle East Technical University was decided to be adopted to 60 M.A.N. buses. Fifty of these b
uses are already in service for more than six months. In this study, the operation of the dual fuel buses in public transportation was investigated. The technical, environmental, social, and economic aspects of these applications are discussed. In two yea
rs trial period they did not observe any extraordinary increase in the maintenance cost for the converted buses, compared to the original diesel buses.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

At the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Motor Corporation presented the EV-50.  This electric vehicle was designed for practical use in both city and highway traffice with low energy consumption and high reliability.  This paper outlines the design concepts
of the vehicle systems, these systems were designed to minimize energy consumption and maximize battery life.  To achieve adequate vehicle range and battery life, it is important that sealed lead-acid batteries have high power density and high energy dens
ity characteristics.  The light and efficient power train was developed by employing coaxial type configuration.  The system was enhanced further by replacing the induction motor with a permanent magnet motor.  The regenerative brake system used on the EV
-50 increases the vehicle's city driving range by more than 20%.  As a result of these improvements, we have succeeded in achieving a good driving range for the EV-50.  Ni-MH batteries of EV-50 which are under testing and just began to be evaluated on boa
rd have shown the ability to extend the vehicle range by about 1.7 times.  The latest results of road tests on the battery, energy consumption, regeration effect and the practical vehicle range are also discussed.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This article reviews the art of supplementary-fueling diesel engines by feeding certain fuel vapors into the intake air (fumigation).  The use of propane (LPG) as a supplementary transportation fuel is compared with other candidate fuels in terms of oppor
tunities for improving truck-engine performance, durability, economy, fuel tolerance, emissions and driveability.  Results indicate propane fumigation should, in some transport applications, be both economically and energy-conservation efficient

The author briefly examines the costs and benefits associated with converting heavy duty vehicles to CNG fuel.  As conversion costs will be higher for these vehicles, and the operator may be faced with higher road user charges related to an increase in pa
yload depending on the number of CNG cylinders carried, it is necessary associated benefits make the exercise profitable.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The fundamental ignition and combustion processes in methane-air mixtures, appropriate for use in internal combustion engines, is reviewed.  Internal combustion engine converted to run on natural gas (methane) experience a considerable power loss.  Part o
f this is due to the difficulty of igniting methane, (its long ignition delay and induction period), and its slow burning velocity relative to gasoline.  Four different methods to reduce ignition delay and enhance the initial burning rate are presented.
These include:  fuel additives, alternative ignition sources, energy redistribution in the spark discharge, and increased flame kernel volume.  The effect of mixture motion and turbulence on engine combustion processes has also been reviewed.  Combustion
duration can be reduced and power improved by increasing the turbulent intensity in the engine.  This is due to an increase of the flame speed due to the turbulent eddies.  Turbulent intensity can be increased by either changes in the combustion chamber o
r inlet flow geometry

A national standard is needed for compressed Natural Gas Cylinders used as On-board Vehicle Fuel Containers.  The need for this standard is accelerated by the recent passage of the Clean Air Act which mandates the use of alternative fueled vehicles in non
-containment areas and promotes their use throughout the country.The existing national standard for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicular Fuel Systems, ANSI/NFPA 52, recognizes DOT Cylinders for fuel containers, but state and locla jurisdictions are ap
plying supplementary or contradictory standards.  The proposed AGA NGV2 voluntary standard fills this need that provides a basis for acceptance of Compressed Natural Gas Cylinders as vehicle containers. (from Author's opening statement)

The University of North Carolina (UNC) has been conducting outdoor smog chamber experiments since 1971.  All chemical reaction mechanisms in use in EPA air quality models have been tested with data from the UNC Outdoor Smog Chamber.  In recent years, sign
ificant chamber time has been devoted to studies of the effects of alternative fuels on ozone (O3) production.  Under the sponsorship of the Coordinating Research Council, two years of experiments were devoted to studying industry average gasoline, variou
s reformulated gasolines, and blended methanol fuels in combination with complex urban volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  This project builds upon the large UNC smog chamber data base and extends the work to include the natural gas fuels (compressed natu
ral gas, CNG and liquefied propane gas, LPG), and ethanol blended fuels.  The results of these experiments are reported in this paper.  These experiments will utilize advanced analytical methods to identify and quantify previously undetected chemical inte
rmediates.  The remainder of this project is to use these experiments to test and improve our current chemical mechanisms and, with Urban Air Shed model simulations, help answer questions concerning the effect on urban ozone from the use of alternative fu
els.

The marketing environment for NGV is characterized by unpredictable and dynamic international forces which have impeded its development.  This environmental instability has created great uncertainty and when coupled with a depressed international oil mark
et and a general trend toward fisca restraint by many of the more developed nations, has resulted in the prevalence of a "wait and see" attitude among government and industry officials alike.  Yet, there are some success stories and there is an internatio
nal awareness of NGV.  It is reported that more than 40 countries have active NGV programs (From author's paper Includes brief author biography.  9 refs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

While hybrid-electric drivesystems  have the potential to substantially improve fuel economy without sacrificing performance, the extent of the fuel savings is highly dependent on component optimization within the system.  Effectively optimized components
require the drivesystem designer to understand component trade-offs and to supply the component developers with sufficient information to optimize their designs.  Without a systems approach to all levels of drivesystem design - and, clearly, of vehicle d
esign as well - components will tend to either be substantially oversized and inefficient or provide compromised vehicle performance.Component specifications typically include power requirements,such as would be needed to provide adequate starting torqu
e, gradability, acceleration,and braking.  Fundamental specifications should also include time-sensitive power and energy requirements based on anticipated duration of maximum starting torque and peak continuous power for gradability, and of transient pea
ks for acceleration and braking.Component designers must also have a means of optimizing distribution of highest efficiency to match anticipated use patterns.  Designers of powerplants, load-leveling devices, and power electronics need to know the typic
al distribution of cumulative energy throughput at various power levels over a realistic driving cycle.  Motor designers need to know the distribution of cumulative energy throughput on a map of torque and speed so that motor efficiency can be optimized t
o correspond.  The design of reduction gears and choice of fixed-ratio or multi-speed transmission must also be an integral part of this optimization.Following fundamentals of drivesystem design and component selection, time-sensitive power and energy r
equirements and their derivation are discussed.  Cumulative energy throughput or work for an illustrative driving cycle is then presented in forms directly applicable to component design optimization - first as a function of tractive power alone, then on
a map of motor speed and torque.  A brief discussion of drivesystem control strategies addresses drivability issues as required by component choices.  Conclusions are drawn throughout the paper as to the application methodology, design implications, and u
sefulness of the presented tools and strategies for hybrid-electric drivesystem optimization.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This 1986 status report on the marketing of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in the United States summarizes activities of the natural gas utility industry and of the manufacturers of NGV equipment and installers.  The number of gas utilites marketing NGVs is
growing.  However while some utilities are developing marketing strategies and aggressively promoting NGVs, other companies are yet-to-be-convinced of the economic and technical viability of NGVs.  U.S. NGV equipment manufacturers and installers continue
to struggle in a marketplace dominated by reduced oil prices and approximately 10% growth in the number of conversions nationally.  Barriers such as expensive liability insurance, government regulations, and a general lack of a federal government alternat
ive fuels policy continue to thwart the NGV industry.  However, industry and government funding of research, coupled with tough environmental vehicle emission standards are benefitting the NGV commercialization efforts.  Manufacturers of original equipmen
t generally remain unconvinced of the market viability of NGVs however some NGV research and marketing is being conducted.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A production, direct injection diesel engine was modified to incorporate BP Oil's novel variable compression ratio (VCR) engine concept. The operation of the VCR mechanism was demonstrated and the performance and emissions potential of the concept evaluat
ed. The VCR prototype achieved twice the specific power output of the baseline turbocharged, aftercooled engine. Its exhaust smoke emissions at high load were consistent with conventional direct injection (DI) diesel engines using equivalent fuel injectio
n equipment. Light load particulate emissions and high load fuel consumption indicated a need for further development of the combustion system. Unexpectedly low HC emissions were achieved considering the large crevice volumes in the combustion chamber pro
totype engine. Likewise, expectionally low NOx emissions were demonstrated. It is believed that the low HC and NOx emissions could be inherent features of the unique combustion system configuration. Further development of this novel engine concept is reco
mmended using a prototype engine incorporating recent advances in diesel engine technology.

) the safety problems associated with the use of alternative fuels, as well as changes in the safety of the transportation system brought about by other energy use changes; and, 4) conservation of energy, in particular oil-based fuels.  The author suggest
s that as we can not predict future economic trends it is not possible to set out a detailed activity plan but rather a strategic plan.  Some of the potential options available to Canada are discussed, and the need to engage in consistent long-term planni
ng for energy research and development identified

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In non-reticulated areas, road transport can be used to supply bulk gas to CNG (NGV) vehicle refuelling facilities.  This concept is generally described as a mother/daughter distribution system and essentially consists of three major elements: the mother
station, a gas transportation method, and one or more daughter stations The fundamental principle of operation is that transporters are filled with compressed gas at the mother station and then distribute the gas to the various satellite stations.  Gas is
typically transported at pressures ranging from 20 to 25 MPa which maximises the quantity of gas transported and maintains an economic transporter volume to weight ratio The mother/daughter station system has been widely used in Italy, where it is also k
nown as the Travasi system, and to a lesser extent in New Zealand. Other countries (Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia) either have or propose using transporter systems for NGV refuelling (Author introduction 3 refs., 5 figs., 4 plate

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Propane is becoming increasingly popular as a vehicle fuel.  Comparable to gasoline and diesel in performance and efficiency, propane offers the additional advantages of low maintenance costs, reduced emissions and longer engine life.  It is also signific
antly cheaper than gasoline in most parts of Canada, and this price advantage is expected to continue and increase as the price of gasoline rises.  Propane supply is, of course, limited in comparison to gasoline, but Canada's production of propane now exc
eeds domestic requirements by over 50% and this surplus is more than adequate to meet foreseeable transportation needs Propane differs physically from its competitors in several important ways, however.  Understanding these differences and what they mean
for vehicle operation is an important part of the decision to switch Propane Carburetion:  Some Technical Considerations will provide basic information on propane, on fuel system conversions and on vehicle operation with propane.  For information on how t
o convert a vehicle and for specific information on equipment requirements, however, it is essential to deal with a reliable parts supplier or conversion centre

Gasoline and methanol fuels were tested in a multicylinder passenger car engine to compare their effects on performance, exhaust emissions and mixture distribution.  As well, effects of water addition to methanol on exhaust emissions and engine performanc
e are presented.  Some of the conclusions reached during this study included:  1) an improvement over the air/fuel ratio distribution typical of current conventional gasoline engines is essential to realize fuel benefit of methanol fuel, 2) at steady-stat
e road load conditions on a multicylinder engine, NO emissions are considerably reduced with methanol as fuel compared to those with gasoline; and, 3) presence of 10% water in methanol fuel causes a decrease in engine efficiency up to 10% at 70 km/hr road
load conditions.  NO emission levels decrease by up to 40%, although unburned hydrocarbon emissions increase by about 20%

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Vacuum insulation and phase-change thermal storage have been used to enhance the heat retention of a prototype catalytic converter. Storing heat in the converter between trips allows exhaust gases to be converted more quickly, significantly reducing cold-
start emissions. Using a small metal hydride, the thermal conductance of the vacuum insulation can be varied continuously between 0.49 and 0.27 W/m2K ( R-12 to R-0.2 insulation) to prevent overheating of the catalyst. A prototype was installed in a Dodge
Neon with a 2.0 -liter engine. Following a standard preconditioning and a 23 hour cold soak, an FTP (Federal Test Procedure ) emissions test was performed. Although exhaust temperatures during the preconditioning were not hot enough to melt the phase-chan
ge material, the vacuum insulation performed well, resulting in a converter temperature of 146 *C after the 23-hour cold soak at 27*C. Compared to the same converter at ambient conditions, overall emissions of CO and HC were reduced by  52% and 29%, to 0.
27 and 0.037 g/mile, respectively. The maximum converter temperature during the FTP cycle was 720*C. This limited testing was performed with a nearly-fresh palladium-only  catalyst, but demonstrates the potential of this vacuum insulation approach for emi
ssions reduction and thermal control. Further testing is on going. An initial assessment of several production issues is made, including high- volume fabrication challenges, durability, and cost. (author abstrasct)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A survey of diesel car and light truck owners was conducted in California to determine the importance of limited fuel availability in a household's vehicle purchase decision.  Behavioral, attitudinal, and perceptual differences toward limited fuel availab
ility are reported.  In particular, the importance of fuel availability is examined as a function of the number of diesel fuel stations.  Results are generalized to other non-gasoline vehicles

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Predominatly, the market prospects for NGV will be determined by fuel price relativities, the competitive margin between the delivered cost of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) / Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and the established gasoline or diesel options. This pap
er presents a discussion of the issues and influences which determine these relativities, reflecting the macro-economic analysis which is involved in setting national energy policy. The context for this discussion is the Asian region, for which the energy
situation is particularly dynamic, with gas being of increasing prominence.Following is a review of the gas supply and value characteristics and influence prevailing in the region, and its consequent opportunity as a fuel for vehicle use.

Reduction of air pollution in densely popluated areas is a driving factor in the development of alternative propulsion systems for urban transit vehciles.  the concept of a hybrid transit bus offers a potential for significant fuel consumption and exhaust
emission reductions as a result of the elimination of the transient operation of the engine and partial recuperation of braking energy.  This study assess the technical and economic viability of hybrid propulsion for a full-sized trnasit bus, with partic
ular emphasis on near-term diesel-electric systems.  The simulation results for fuel consumption and emissions are presented for selected Montreal adn Toronto bus routes, including morning and evening ruch hour and off-peak hours.  An analysis of costs, a
s compared to those of a conventionsl bus, is presented.  Finally, a hybrid electric drive development plan is proposed.(from Authors abstract)

Propane information collected from hardware manufacturers, fleet managers, technical papers and reports was compiled and analyzed.  Results indicate that propane technology is significantly inferior to that of gasoline and that specific areas need improve
ment.  The foremost problem is engine valve recession, others include fuel efficiency, refueling techniques and hardware and cold weather operating characteristics.  This study recommends a R & D program to address these subjects and includes an outline o
f suggested testing procedures and recommended priorities

The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will be of significant economic benefit to Canada.  It establishes a new trading relationship based on more secure and more open access to each others markets.  This will bring benefits to many sectors of the Canadian
economy For the energy sector, free trade is almost a reality today.  The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement largely formalizes a situation which has been created since 1984 by a series of policy and regulatory changes Artifically low or high energy prices
distort decision making by consumers and investors possible to the detriment of overall economic growth.  Under the current market-based energy pricing system, domestic prices will tend to equal export prices.  The Agreement is therefore consistent with t
he manner in which Canadian energy-pricing policy has been evolving.  (From author abstract)

The effects of carbon black/diesel fuel slurries on fuel injection systems and performance of an EMD 567B two-cylinder locomotive research engine when operated on slurry fuel are presented in this paper Without extensive modification to the diesel engine
fuel transfer system, carbon black slurries cannot be run.  Laboratory bench tests revealed clogged fuel filters, worn transfer pump components and frozen injector needle assemblies Engine performance while running slurries resulted in reduced thermal eff
iciency and increased BSFC at rated power output Upon engine disassembly, inspection revealed severe ring and liner wear.  Severe wear resulted during only 40 hours of engine operation

Henry's Law constants for methane in water have been checked for pressures in the region where hydrate-clathrate formation should begin.  Laser interferometry has been used to check for density gradients and natural convection.  Methane solubilities in se
veral structured organic liquids have also been measured and the effects of structure assessed both in increased solubility and decreased rate of evolution on pressure release.  Results suggest higher solubilities and slower pressure release.  (From autho

Dual fuel engines compress the air/gas fuel mixture to just below autoignition conditions and then ignite it by the injection of a small amount of liquid fuel.  The use and performance of these engines, however, have been limited by knock.  Single cylinde
r engine experiments show that this limitation is a readily defined autoignition phenomenon, and can be analyzed by a mathematical model that indicates the effects on performance imposed by fuel changes and operating conditions.  Experimental findings con
firm that these performance data correlate broadly with those obtained conventionally in standard spark ignited or motored engines

<IMG SRC="robinal.gif" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=307><P>
The scene called for Williams's character to leap into the water and jump onto the crocodile's back to divert it from attacking the others. The actor did several takes, each funnier than the last...
<P>
The whole cast spent entire shooting days in the water, which was heated to 90 degrees when it was circulated to keep the actors and technicians as warm as possible. "I got used to coming to work every day and putting on my wetsuit," says Bonnie Hunt. "It was quite glamorous and I got my aerobic workout during our many water ballets. Half the crew was in with us, so it was a family affair."

These types of limit gauges have now been supplanted by solid-state devices, by programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and by microprocessor controllers. Each jump in controller technology facilitates a new level of sophistication in control strategy, so that compressor strategy can now be designed to minimize frequent cycling, reduce variations in compressor temperature, reduce startup power loads, and program electricity usage for off-peak times to minimize costs.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
High pressure storage is typically regulated by solenoid-operated valves. The classic control device to determine delivery routes and pressures was the dome load valve, which routed high pressure gas depending on pressure differentials between storage tanks. In the past few years, this device has been supplanted by systems of pressure sensors, with the system logic contained within PLCs or micro-computers. Priority and sequential valves may now be actuated pneumatically, with electronic control. These are easier and more precise to set and adjust, and permit more sophisticated control strategies, to provide a faster, denser fill and to ensure more efficient compressor use. In some cases, improved control strategies can facilitate savings in storage tank costs, or increase their effective capacity.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Over the past few years, CNG dispensers have assumed all the trappings of gasoline dispensers, including Cardlock systems, Pay at the pump, and LED or LCD displays. The basic measurement of the gas delivered, however, is by mass flow meter. Safety is served by automatic hose-venting systems, fail-safe valving, and control of maximum fill pressure and automatic overfill protection, along with various safety shutdown interlocks.<BR>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Dispensers are built with full communications capabilities in order to transmit information to various point of sale recording systems, cash registers, etc. Once again, control electronics are required to be housed in an explosion-proof case.<BR>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
High pressure gas engineers have understandably opted for the tried and true for safety and reliability. However, the advantages of programmable electronic control have not been ignored by the industry, and the micro-computer, which can manage sophisticated and easily adjustable control strategies, monitor many sensors simultaneously, maintain long term logs, and facilitate both automatic and remote operation, is now a serious option for the fuelling station control system. It may offer the best chance of making a CNG refuelling facility as simple to operate as a gasoline pump.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Design of the installation</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
An effective control and monitoring system for a CNG fuelling installation starts with the design of the system. This is done with a computer simulation program, with gas supply (pressure, temperature, and flow capacity) and gas delivery demand (including provision for daily demand peaks) as essential parameters. The resultant flows, temperatures, and pressures can then be calculated, and potential problems such as insufficient flow capacity, inadequate storage, or not enough compressor power can be identified. In addition, the behavioural stability of the overall system can be monitored, so that control strategies vital to performance and safety can be identified. A system designed with inherent stability will be much easier to control.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Control strategy</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The basic control strategy is that the dispenser draws fuel from the high pressure storage, with pressures and flow rates selected so as to fuel the vehicle in as short a time as possible while not allowing on-board gas temperatures to rise so high that the vehicle does not receive a full charge. The high pressure storage is then replenished from the compressors.<BR>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Compressors are powered by high horsepower electric motors, and early control systems emphasized the switching of these motors with electrical equipment in explosion-proof housings. Typically, motor switches were activated by pressure gauges with pre-set limits (the Frank W. Murphy SWICHGAGE was an early, and still used, example).<BR>

Because most OEMs are extremely reluctant to divulge the specifications and operational logic of their PCMs, much time-consuming reverse engineering must usually be carried out by the conversion equipment manufacturer. Suzukis co-operation in this project has resulted in no requirement for reverse engineering, resulting in significant savings both in the research costs and the manufacturing costs of this conversion.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
In fact, virtually no wiring cuts or modifications are necessary, and the original PCM is used to control both fuel and ignition, as well as operate the now mandatory emission control systems checking required by OBDII regulations.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
In 1996, virtually all gasoline vehicles utilize electronically controlled fuel injection to achieve reliability and low emissions. However, this technology is still not widely used in gaseous fuel conversions. The natural gas conversion system, developed by Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), has gas injectors directly substituted for the gasoline injectors.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The result is an economical, simple engine conversion with the expected reliability of the gasoline version. The original catalytic converter is used, and SRC expect that emissions will be in the ULEV range. Testing is scheduled at BC Research Inc. (BCRI) in October.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
As a light car, the Geo Metro cannot be weighed down by heavy NGV cylinders, yet good capacity is essential in order to achieve adequate range for city delivery service. At the same time, the cylinders used cannot be too expensive. Two Luxfer aluminum cylinders, with a total capacity of 70 litres, are used, and are mounted lengthwise in the passenger seat position, to be covered by the cargo floor.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A special mounting system, designed by BCRI, was prototyped and tested with equipment simulating a 30g impact. The floor of the Geo Metros unit body showed little distortion.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
At press time, the first prototype Geo Metro NGV has been in service with Lordco for some time and has clocked 40,000 km so far. Records indicate that fuel savings will be in the range of $800$1200 per year, with payout of the conversion cost within the first year and a half.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The funding sponsors of the development projectNatural Resources Canada, the Saskatchewan Research Council, Gas Technology Canada, and Dan Ellis of the Customer Technologies Division of BC Gas Utility Ltd., feel that their objectives for the project have been met. The participantsSuzuki Motor Corporation, Luxfer, BC Gas, Lordco AutoParts, BCRI, and SaskEnergy have developed a low-cost, economical, reliable, durable and practical light delivery vehicle.<BR>

The bus has a 240 horsepower Cummins L10G engine running on natural gas only, with spark ignition. The engine has analogue electronics.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The vehicle is equipped with two 100 U.S. gallon Cryenco cryogenic tanks with 20% ullage and a pumpless fuel conditioning system. The bus is fuelled once a day; it has a total effective capacity of about 150 U.S. gallons of LNG, which gives the bus a range of about 500km (say 300 miles) The storage tanks are located underneath the bus; the frame rails had to be widened slightly to accommodatethe two 18&quot; tanks. The installation was carried out to the
Canadian Standards Association's Z-276 standard, and it has five gas detectors and a fire suppression system.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The fuelling station was designed by Liquid Carbonic. Gas is not liquefied on site, but is trucked in, currently from Laporte, Indiana. The station is pumpless, with all gas pressure resulting
from the vapour pressure of the LNG. It has 6000 gallons of main cryogenic storage, and is capable of a 30-50 gallons/minute dispensing rate. With a 500 gallon conditioning unit, it could refuel up
to 40 buses per day, and it is expandable beyond that.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Usually, the bus can be fuelled with 150 gallons of LNG in four to five minutes. Excess vapourized fuel from storage boil-off is compressed and stored in a tube trailer at 2250 psi for CNG use.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
When the bus is parked, boil-off results in a pressure rise of about 1 psi/hr at 20 degrees Celsius when the tanks are 3/4 full. The bus is fully instrumented, with pressures and temperatures being recorded constantly.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The bus was first filled on April 6th, 1995, and entered revenue service towards the end of May. No problems have been reported in the operation of either the bus or the fuelling station so
far.<BR>

<font size=3><b>The need for a strategy</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Pilot projects for the use of hydrogen-powered vehicles have clearly been hampered by the lack of a convenient supply of hydrogen. This applies particularly when the pilot project grows to the over-the-road trial stage. The capital cost threshold, and resultant per unit cost of the fuel, could well be sufficient to discourage development if electrolysis at market rates of electricity is used.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Clearly, cheaper and more easily accessible hydrogen will be essential if the possibilities of this fuel are to be pursued. A possible strategy for market/supply growth might be:<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">first, to process a small quantity of hydrogen from a refinery, while returning any surplus hydrogen back to the refinery.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">when the refinery hydrogen is completely utilized, initiate a plant to process and compress hydrogen from a chlor-alkali bleach plant.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">to supplement the hydrogen supply, initiate storage of hydrogen electrolysed using intermittent electricity.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">when these three sources are being employed with some degree of efficiency, study the relative economics of other electricity sources, given the guaranteed electrolysis load that has been identified.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The presence of other hydrogen users with access to local supplies would change the economics of this, and probably affect the strategy.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Summary</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This strategy focuses on moving from cheap, easily accessible sources to more expensive sources with larger threshold capital costs. It does, however, provide a way to grow a local supply of compressed hydrogen to support an expanding fleet of hydrogen powered vehicles. The chicken and egg problem characteristic of many alternative fuelsno fuel supply because there are no vehicles; no vehicles because there is no fuel supplycan be avoided through planning for incremental growth using multiple sources of supply.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Cheaper hydrogen</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
There are several common industrial processes that produce large amounts of hydrogen as a byproduct. Sometimes it is recycled for use as fuel for the plant, sometimes it is flared off, and sometimes it escapes to the atmosphere. As a waste product, it has no cost; its value is set by its market as an industrial feedstock, less the cost of recapture and transportation. It may be very pure and require little processing.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
In centres with a large amount of petroleum processing, pipeline distribution systems have been built to serve a local market for industrial hydrogen, sometimes as fuel. In these locations, the price of hydrogen is well established, and may range from $2.50 to $10 per thousand scf. In these cases, the cost of compressing hydrogen and transferring it to a vehicle may, in the final analysis, make it more expensive than other fuels.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>A petroleum refinery source</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
However, in centres where there is no other market for hydrogen it may prove to be an economical alternative transportation fuel. For example, three tonnes per day of high purity hydrogen is available from a local refinery at a 350psi feed pressure. If it is not used for anything else, it can be recycled into the refinery as fuel, so it has some value to the refinery.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
It could be purified and compressed to sell at $2.50 per thousand scf, or about $1.25 per gasoline gallon equivalent, including the amortization of the total capital cost of the processing plant of C$2.5 million.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Chemical industry byproducts</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Hydrogen can be recovered from high pressure but impure purge streams from processes such as ammonia synthesis or ethylene production.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Another example would be hydrogen from a chlor-alkali bleach plant. In this case, the hydrogen is usually flared at atmospheric pressure, and thus has no residual value to the plant operator. To capture, purify, and compress this gas would probably cost more than the petroleum refinery case because of the necessity to compress a large amount of gas fed at atmospheric pressure.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The rapid growth of on-site industrial hydrogen uses is driving both the development of new and improved on-site generation technologies, and the recovery of hydrogen from refinery or chemical industry waste streams. This improved infrastructure will eventually increase the availability of hydrogen for transportation use.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Highquest Engineering in Vancouver is developing a compact, high efficiency pressure swing adsorption process for purifying hydrogen. It will be able to handle hydrogen generated by Hydrogen Burners partial oxidation process, by steam reforming of natural gas, or by recovery of hydrogen from refinery off-gases.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Warranty and deficiencies</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Both groups of buses are covered by the same warranty package, 24 months for engines and transmissions, structural components for five years, and bus components for 12 months. The natural gas buses currently have warranty costs at $0.15 per kilometre, while the diesel buses are at $0.04 per kilometre. The major difference is accounted for by the high cost of natural gas components. Failures of fill valves have also been experienced. BC Transit is anticipating increased reliability of the natural gas components in the future.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Diesel buses have experienced injector solenoid failures, and both types of buses have required rear brake relines.

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This group of natural gas buses was the first run that New Flyer Industries had undertaken, and BC Transit says that considerable engineering was completed on the buses while they were on-line.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Fuel</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The current cost per litre of diesel to BC Transit is $0.4010 (Cdn) and of compressed natural gas $0.268. So fuel costs are significantly lower with the natural gas buses. Natural gas in BC carries no provincial or federal fuel tax, but the federal GST at 7% is payable.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>The refuelling station</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A companion report from BC Gas Utility Ltd., operators of the CNG refuelling station, indicates that the station has reliably refuelled the buses during the regular evening refuelling times. The average fill is 150kg of natural gas, and takes 5.5 minutes. A completely empty bus takes 242 kg of natural gas in 9.5 minutes.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
If buses are refuelled immediately one after another the refuelling station storage may be depleted and refuelling is straight from the compressors. In the worst case, the 150 kg fill can take 10 minutes.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The most serious problem with the installation occurred one evening in January 1996, when a relief valve in the pressure regulating system before the compressor station opened and froze in the open position, allowing some gas to be released before BC Gas personnel arrived. The system has been modified to prevent a reoccurrence and the Port Coquitlam Fire Department has been trained in how to shut off the gas.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Other problems have been minor. They included: An additional emergency shut down button installed close to the rear of the bus where refuellers are conducting other checks while the bus is being refuelled. The original refuelling nozzles and receptacles were changed on all buses to eliminate a small persistent gas leak. High summer temperatures lengthened fuelling times, and additional storage vessels will be added to the refuelling station to overcome this.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>What did the riders think?</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Of those passengers who voluntarily completed a ridership questionnaire, 70% said that the buses were superior to diesel buses for smoothness of ride, and 93% said they were better in terms of outside smoke and odour. About two-thirds of riders found them less noisy than the diesel bus. The majority (85%) had no safety concerns.<br>

<font size=6><b>Arizona gives its government fleets a choice</b></font><BR>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The State of Arizona, having legislated rapid adoption of alternate fuels for vehicles owned by both the state and local governments, has signed overall contracts that give agency fleet managers a choice of natural gas or propane.<br>

<IMG align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This is the background to the almost simultaneous announcement of statewide contracts by North American Fleet Services, Inc. of Phoenix (a GFI distributor) for conversions to CNG, and Metropane Inc. of Columbus, Ohio for conversions to propane. And IMPCO Technologies say that at least 100 of their ADP natural gas and propane systems will be installed.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Cummins describes the combination of control systems used on the B 5.9G as second generation technology. The six cylinder, two valve per cylinder engine operates on a closely controlled lean-burn strategy, which uses a higher air-to-fuel ratio than stoichiometric. This reduces NOx levels and gives lower fuel consumption. Cummins says that the electronic closed loop system is essential to maintain the lean burn strategy through a wide variety of operating conditions and variations in fuel quality.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The Arizona legislation requires that 40% of the states own vehicles be operating on alternate fuels by December, 1995. Vehicles belonging to cities, towns, school districts, etc. must be 18% on alternate fuels by December, 1995, and 75% by the year 2000. Phoenix is currently a non-attainment area for CO, particulates, and ozone.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The State of Arizona procurement office has contracted with suppliers to provide conversion work, service facilities, and training. The state has also initiated a system of grants to local governments for conversions, and for fuelling stations that will be available to the public. <BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Arizona is particularly targeting non-diesel school buses. Of 21 school districts that have so far applied for grants, 19 have opted for natural gas and two for propane.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
To encourage conversions to alternate fuels by the public and business, Arizona offers a 60% reduction in the vehicle licence tax, and a $1,000 state income tax credit.

<font size=3><b>Plastic cylinder liners</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The liners in the Type 4 all-composite cylinders are typically thermoplastics. The report advises that long-term experience is needed with such plastics in a high-pressure gas environment, and that they be monitored for premature aging, deterioration from extreme temperatures, and gas permeation.<br>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Fatigue life</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Powertech says that the fatigue life is well understood and is a key cylinder design factor; the cylinders are marked to be removed from service before a fatigue crack could grow to failure over too many filling cycles. The number of cycles tested well exceeds possible usage on a vehicle. All metal and hoop-wrapped designs are also required to show that when a fatigue crack grows through the cylinder wall, the result is a leak and not a rupture, a leak-before-burst.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Fully wrapped designs are considered to provide leak-before-burst performance because of their construction, in which the majority of the strength is in the wrap.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>All composite design</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report expresses concern that all-composite designs require excellent manufacturing quality control, particularly in the joint between the plastic liner and the metal end boss. Carbon fibre wrapped cylinders are also noted to be more susceptible to impact damage, particularly when not pressurized.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Glass fibre wrapped designs need careful coating because of the increased susceptibility of the glass fibre to environmental damage.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Summing up safety</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
All cylinders meeting the new cylinder standards are considered to be safe for use within the defined service conditions. That said, the report then goes on to summarize expected performance under exceptional conditions of collision, fire, and impact. The risk assessments are based on failure history, the observed degradation of materials in service, and the perceived likelihood that NGV cylinder manufacturing standards might not be as strictly applied as they were intended.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Recommendations for NGV cylinder standards</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Having carried out the risk analysis, Powertech then goes on to make a number of important recommendations for changes to the US NGV292 standard to deal with the possible risks to the various types of cylinders. These include a number of new test methods to detect design and material weaknesses in specific types.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Pressure Relief Devices</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report points out that Pressure Relief Devices (PRD) have worked reliably in the case of fire. On-board cylinders have traditionally been protected from non-fire induced overpressurization by the inability of filling station compressors to generate excessive pressures... says the report. Approvals in British Columbia already take into account the fact that Powertech testing work has identified that some devices leak and that those devices (CG5 type) which utilized a burst disk supported by a fusible metal backing could not protect a partially filled cylinder under fire conditions, since the pressure rise in a fire would not be sufficient to burst the burst disk before the cylinder ruptured due to a fire-induced loss in its strength.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report recommends that devices be limited to thermally-activated designs, developing more realistic tests, and improving manufacturing quality.<br>

<font size=3><b>Few cylinder failures</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Cylinder failures in natural gas vehicles are relatively rare, with only fifteen ruptures and some twenty cases of leaks recorded worldwide over the last twenty years. Each of these failures was investigated, so far as possible, by Powertech. Eleven of the ruptures occurred in steel cylinders, of which there have been about one and a half million in use worldwide. There were small numbers of ruptures reported in the wrapped cylinders, while all of the leaks were reported in all-composite Type 4 cylinders.<BR>

Specific comments from the report follow.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Steel cylinders</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Used in NGV service since the 1940s, steel cylinders have an excellent safety record. An examination of cylinders that have been in use up to fifteen years has shown that internal corrosion is not a concern. The risk of premature failure in steel cylinders, says the report, has been virtually eliminated by the quality control system and non-destructive examination requirements in current NGV cylinder standards.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report also notes that steel cylinders have recorded no damage in numerous vehicle accidents, and also offer the best resistance to the effects of fire.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Aluminum cylinders</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Materials tests are recommended to ensure adequate resistance to general surface corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and sustained load cracking. Again, examples of failures are rare. AA6351 alloy, which was prone to sustained load cracking, is pictured in the report although not produced in North America. To minimize external corrosion, Powertech considers the use of coating systems essential.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Composites</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Aramid and carbon fibres used for wrapping cylinders have higher strength, better fire resistance, relative immunity to stress corrosion cracking, and superior fatigue resistance to glass fibres. Carbon fibres have superior resistance to stress rupture, and aramid fibres have superior resistance to impact.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Most concerns with composites used for cylinder wrapping relate to the damage that can be done to the composites by abrasion and impact. The report recommends protective coatings, but suggests that it should be ensured that such coatings can retain their integrity over the life of the cylinder, given environmental conditions ranging from expansion and contraction of the cylinder to ultraviolet radiation, salt spray, vehicle exhaust gases, etc.<br>

<font size=3><b>Cylinder weights and sizes</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report goes on to examine the cylinder weights and package sizes required to provide a 200 to 400 mile range in a number of typical vehicle platforms.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Recognising that wall thicknesses and weights vary both between technologies and for different sizes of cylinders, Powertech created a computer model to calculate these for a range of cylinder outside diameters. This was done for all the technologies under consideration. (Not all cylinders, of course, are available in all sizes; for some, major investments would be required.)<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
For example, a cylinder 15 in. long and 48 in. in diameter made of high strength steel has a capacity of 1008 standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas and weighs about 230 lb., while an all composite E-glass cylinder has a capacity of 785 scf and a weight of about 165 lb. An NGV292 specification all steel cylinder would hold 957 scf and weigh 327 lb.; a high strength aluminum cylinder would hold 870 scf and weigh 171 lb.; and a thin aluminum liner, fully wrapped in carbon fibre, would hold 950 scf and weigh 72 lb. All these cylinders have the same outside dimensions, and all capacities are measured at 3000 psi.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Using this same size of cylinders for the calculation, Powertech calculated weight/ storage volume ratios for the different cylinder types. The highest was the NGV292 steel cylinder, at .341 lb/scf; the lowest was the thin aluminum liner, fully carbon fibre wrapped, at .076 lb/scf. High strength steel was .229 lb/scf, high strength aluminum was .196 lb/scf, while all compositeE glass was .221 lb/scf. Given fixed outside dimensions, an increase in service pressure from 3000 psi to 3600 psi does not result in a great increase in storage capacity, because the cylinder walls must be thicker, and therefore the internal volume is less. For a high strength steel cylinder, the capacity increase is about 11.4% for this 20% increase in pressure. The weight increase is 19%.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Manufacturing costs</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Powertech created a cost model for the manufacture of similar sized cylinders using each of the listed technologies. This included raw material costs, the capital cost of manufacturing equipment, all manufacturing costs (including an allowance for wastage), and a 30% allowance for overhead. The result of these detailed calculations was a table of cylinder costs per scf (at 3000 psi).<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The costs, in $US, are calculated to be .383 per scf stored for the billet-pierced NGV292 steel cylinder. This compares with .323 per scf for a high strength steel cylinder drawn from plate. The lowest cost per scf is .313 for a steel cylinder drawn and spun from tube stock. A billet pierced high strength aluminum cylinder is calculated at .624 per scf, reflecting high material costs for aluminum; this is more than a billet pierced steel liner hoop-wrapped with E-glass, at .525. The thin aluminum liner, fully wrapped in carbon fibre, comes out at 1.265 per scf, but the all-composite cylinder wrapped in E-glass is .857. Aluminum and carbon fibre are, of course, the two most expensive materials under consideration.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Future developments</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report went on to identify future materials and technology developments which might have a significant impact on the costs of cylinders. These included a significant drop in the cost of carbon fibre, the availability of higher strength aluminum alloys (less material required for same strength), and the use of higher strength steels (the report points out that these are not permitted by existing US cylinder standards).<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report also discusses a number of design and production optimization strategies for various cylinder manufacturing technologies. Suggestions are made for simplified pressure relief devices, the optimization of filament winding patterns, and the autofrettage of all-metal cylinders.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Recommendations</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The report recommends the continued development of NGV21 high strength aluminum cylinders, both with and without carbon fibre hoop wrapping. It also recommends changes in the NGV292 and FMVSS 304 standards to allow the US use and production of high strength steel cylinders.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A simple low-cost thermally-activated pressure relief device is also advocated.<br>

The CGA has led the way in setting market objectives that benefit every member of the industry. In the United States, the American Gas Association has performed a similar leadership role. This type of industry-wide support is essential to introduce a concept like natural gas vehicle fuelling, which must have the clear commitment of large and responsible organizations in order to achieve the public acceptance necessary for the creation of a long term market. The 1996-1999 NGV Technology Program Plan published by Gas Technology Canada shows a path to meet 
the technical challenges through to the end 
of the century.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
One of the ways the natural gas industry on both sides of the border has demonstrated this commitment is through its support of research and development. While fuelling stations might be said 
to be the responsibility of their proprietors, vehicle conversion 
kits and storage cylinder design the responsibility of conversion kit and 
cylinder manufacturers, and regulation the responsibility of government, cross-industry support for each of these areas clearly has benefits for all. Unless the technology of fuelling and vehicle operation works, and works to the satisfaction of the customer, 
the gas distribution companies would not benefit from the improved load factor which the vehicle market offers.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
As an additional benefit, the organizations and people who have carried out this research in Canada are now in a position to help in the development of NGV markets around the world. This is good international business.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The research carried out in Canada through the NGV Research and Development fund up to the present has focussed on safe dispensing to vehicles and then ensuring that it works in these vehicles. Responsible standards, education, and codes ensure that it is as safe as or safer than conventional fuels. The task ahead is to ensure that it is practical and, in fact, an ideal fuel in a number of targeted markets.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This, combined with new public awareness of air quality, greenhouse gas effects, energy efficiency, and vehicle operational performance, means that new and more difficult technological challenges lie ahead for the transportation market. More than ever, NGV market development depends on continuing research to maintain its advantages over conventional fuels.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The automobile industry itself has demonstrated this awareness over the past few years. Driven sometimes by legislation but ultimately by markets, the technological sophistication of todays vehicles is far ahead of what it was a few years ago. NGV technology must keep up. While no one player in the NGV industry can do this by itself, the combined efforts of the industry have proven to be extremely effective.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The 19961999 NGV TPP research objectives include the continued development of heavy duty natural gas engines for trucks and buses; efficient, low maintenance, low emission engines for high mileage urban applications, such as light delivery trucks, taxis, and limousines; further improvements in CNG and LNG storage containers for all types of vehicles; development of a smart, more sophisticated control system for automated CNG fuelling stations; and the demonstration of natural gas vehicles in heavy-duty applications, like urban buses, garbage trucks, and highway tractors. These research projects directly support the market development plan.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Todays vehicle buyers expect that the cars and trucks they purchase will be fuel-efficient, non-polluting, minimize the production of greenhouse gases, and be economical in both the energy and financial senses. These expectations not only apply to day-to-day operation, but to the entire life cycle of the vehicle, including its original manufacture and recycling at the end of its useful life.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The NGV industrys responsibility to its existing and future customers is to meet those expectations. This objective cannot be accomplished without continuing co-operative research.<BR>

<font size=3><b>What are the advantages?</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
So what are the advantages of hybrids? First, better range and sometimes higher performance than pure electric vehicles, together with very low emissions. The low emissions result from running a small internal combustion engine within a speed range where efficiency is high and emissions are very low. Many hybrids, true to their electric vehicle heritage, can operate for some distance without using the ICE at all; they are ZEVs for some of the time. This time can be chosen, for example in stop & start city traffic, when the internal combustion engine is hard put to maintain low emissions and at the same time produce adequate acceleration.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The hybrid may also require less batteries than a pure electric vehicle. This cuts down weight, which in turn increases performance and/or range, or may reduce the power required. And battery replacement will be cheaper. Hybrids that do not need overnight recharging also will not require the additional electrical utility infrastructure that might be necessitated by widespread use of battery-powered vehicles.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The combination of a small gaseous fuelled engine with an efficient electric motor in a hybrid can result in very low net emissions per mile. Yet drivers require not only low emissions, but also adequate range between fuelling stops, adequate power for acceleration, hills, and heavy loads, adequate carrying capacity for passengers and freight, ease and reliability of operation, and low purchase cost (necessitating a simple, easily built and repaired vehicle). The variety of approaches currently evident in the design of hybrids stems largely from different concepts of the relative importance of these sometimes competing factors.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Emissions</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
HEV emissions depend on how much of the vehicles energy is provided by charging batteries from utility power (which has no associated emissions, at least from the vehicle), and how much use is made of the ICE, particularly at non-optimum speeds and loads. Either way, emissions should be well under ULEV levels. Some HEV builders have suggested that a new standard should be created at, say, 1/2 ULEV emission levels.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Range</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
HEV range depends, for the most part, on how much fuel can be carried for the ICE, which we may expect will run at its maximum efficiency much of the time. Add to this range the energy gained by pre-charging the batteries. In any event, range should be better than a ULEV carrying the same amount of fuel, no matter what fuel is used.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Three groups</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The HEV Challenge attempted to classify hybrids into three groups:<BR>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Charge depleting: the concept is essentially that of an electrically powered vehicle, its batteries recharged from utility-supplied electricity, but which also has a small ICE which will provide either supplemental power, or additional range, or both. Mainly, vehicles of this type are conceived as commuter vehicles of limited range. Typically, they will have large battery capacity and the ICE will be small relative to the electric drive motor.<br>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Charge sustaining: these differ in that the on-board ICE and generator are sufficient to keep the batteries charged while the vehicle is in use. The range of the vehicle is thus limited by the amount of fuel it can carry. The vehicle is not dependent on being plugged in overnight, but the ICE does not run all the time either, but only when the batteries need charging. The battery capacity would typically be less than the charge depleting group, but would be sufficient to operate the vehicle for some distance on electrical power alone. Again, most vehicles built so far have been conceived as commuter vehicles.<br>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Reserve sustaining: This type of vehicle operates in hybrid mode at all times and has minimal battery reserves. Typically, the vehicle operates under a strategy that attempts to maximize the performance of electric components while minimizing the pollution from the ICE. Its range is limited by the amount of fuel it can carry, and examples constructed so far have not necessarily been limited to commuter use.<br>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Its clear that the choice of a strategy involves a complex series of tradeoffs, including the classic: power vs. weight. And one cant ignore the inevitable increase in complication over both conventional and electric vehicles.<br>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Two approaches</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
To illustrate these trade-offs, hybrids of all three types may be serial or parallel:<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Serial vehicles have the ICE operating a generator which charges batteries which power a large electric motor(s) which drive the wheels. The ICE is not directly connected to the wheels at any time.<br>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Parallel hybrids use both the electric motor and the ICE to drive the wheels: on some vehicles the same wheels, on others, separate drive trains for the front and rear of the vehicle. The electric motor may be smaller than on a serial vehicle.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
All hybrids have some sort of load leveling or energy storage device. This is usually batteries, but other devices used are supercapacitors, flywheels, and hydraulic or pneumatic storage devices. How suitable these may be depend, once again, on the intended use of the vehicle and on its energy strategy.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Power</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
HEV power is characterized by the electric motors advantage of very high accelerative torque at very low speeds. In parallel hybrids, this is blended with the internal combustion engine characteristic of high torque at higher speeds. The ICE can be used to supplement the electric motor on demand, or vice versa, depending on the relative size of the two units, and battery storage capacity.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Capacity</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Less batteries, smaller ICEs, and electric motors smaller than ICEs may all increase interior room. However, like any vehicle designed for great efficiency, low weight is vital. In the end, the performance, economy, and emissions of any vehicle depends on the payload it is carrying.<BR>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Cost</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
HEVs, because they are more complex than either conventionally powered vehicles or electric vehicles, would probably be more expensive than either. However, since a large proportion of the purchase cost, and the operating cost, of an electric vehicle lies in the purchase and periodic replacement of large numbers of batteries, an HEV that needed less batteries might be cheaper. And if an HEV could be made using mostly production parts and assembly techniques (which might be possible if it didnt have to carry too many batteries) it could be cheaper than an EV built in small quantities.<BR>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Potential</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
What is the HEVs potential? The HEV is poised to utilize advances in both ICE technology and electric vehicle and battery technology. Its clear that HEV design strategy involves an extremely complex set of trade-offs, together with a very clear idea of what functions the vehicle will be expected to perform. Technological breakthroughs may well initiate rethinking of those tradeoffs, as well as increasing the application of hybrid vehicles. Hybrid buses have already been built. So the hybrid approach will probably not be limited to urban commuter vehicles; the potential is much greater than that of the electric vehicles from which current thinking is derived.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The combination of a small gaseous fuelled engine with an efficient electric motor in a hybrid can result in very low net emissions per mile. Yet drivers require not only low emissions, but also adequate range between fuelling stops, adequate power for acceleration, hills, and heavy loads, adequate carrying capacity for passengers and freight, ease and reliability of operation, and low purchase cost (necessitating a simple, easily built and repaired vehicle). The variety of approaches currently evident in the design of hybrids stems largely from different concepts of the relative importance of these sometimes competing factors.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Emissions</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
HEV emissions depend on how much of the vehicles energy is provided by charging batteries from utility power (which has no associated emissions, at least from the vehicle), and how much use is made of the ICE, particularly at non-optimum speeds and loads. Either way, emissions should be well under ULEV levels. Some HEV builders have suggested that a new standard should be created at, say, 1/2 ULEV emission levels.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Range</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
HEV range depends, for the most part, on how much fuel can be carried for the ICE, which we may expect will run at its maximum efficiency much of the time. Add to this range the energy gained by pre-charging the batteries. In any event, range should be better than a ULEV carrying the same amount of fuel, no matter what fuel is used.<BR>

The use of some fuels offers advantages to the community or the nation. The effect of larger scale use of some alternative fuels may be significant improvements in air quality, or reduction in
national dependence on imported oil.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
For these very good reasons, governments mandate the use of alternate fuels, or reward through tax concessions. Some have complained that it's 'not a level playing field' because of 'government interference'. But these legitimate community or national interests are not represented
by any other player, only government.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The alternatives range from new and improved types of gasoline to new developments such as DME and hythane.<BR>

<IMG align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>So let's look at the alternative fuelsall of them</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Gasoline: Overwhelmingly dominant in supply, distribution, and current use. Not the cheapest of the fuels, but for most users the simplest. Considerable environmental impact, through its refining, distribution, and use. Toxic and easily flammable. Emissions acceptable
under current regulations; further technical developments (close coupled preheated catalysts) may be necessary in future. Distribution structure trending to fewer and larger stations; transport mainly by diesel truck. Pressure for improved emissions performance may result in increased use of oxygenated blends.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Reformulated Gasoline: Improved gasoline at increased cost. Will require additional infrastructure unless it replaces one or more of the existing gasoline grades. Other gasoline characteristics
continue to apply; possibly increased use of more expensive crude oil feedstocks, including imported crude.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Methanol: Appears in a variety of concentrations, such as M85, which is methanol with 15% gasoline added. Requires separate distribution infrastructure. Costs more than gasoline. Spark ignition engines designed for gasoline may require a number of engineering and materials changes to use it. Methanol mainly comes from processing natural gas with some concomitant energy loss.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Ethanol: Essentially the same as methanol except that it is refined from plants (often corn, but other plants may be used). Since ethanol must be transported to refinery sites for blending, high     
costs outside midwest states. Again, requires separate distribution infrastructure, truck transport.<BR>

Diesel: Fuel of choice for heavy duty engines; particularly energy efficient. Supply and distribution system well established; transport mainly by diesel truck. Currently 'clean' and low-sulphur diesel are replacing variable grades of diesel available in the past.
Particulate emissions continue to be a problem. Better diesel requires better (and more expensive) feedstocks.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Biodiesel: Diesel fuel blended with biologically derived ethyl esters. Still experimental so far as its benefits as a fuel are concerned. Would require separate distribution infrastructure
unless it completely replaced regular diesel. Possibly represents a step beyond 'clean' diesel, probably at increased cost. Questions about adequate supply of additive, also its transportation to refining and blending site.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
DME: Dimethyl ether. Fuel which produces clean combustion in diesels but for which there is currently no manufacturing or distribution capacity.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Hydrogen: Very clean fuel of very low energy density. No infrastructure exists for production, distribution, and bulk storage; because of the low energy density, storing sufficient hydrogen in the vehicle to give it sufficient range is a problem. May well be 'the fuel of the future' because of inherent advantages as far as emissions are concerned, but need for vehicle and storage development and a total lack of any distribution infrastructure make this a non-starter for the time being.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Hythane: A mixture of hydrogen and methane. Engine development for this fuel is currently in very early stages. If it does succeed, it will be difficult to develop a fuelling infrastructure.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Propane, or Liquefied Petroleum Gas: Propane is used as a gaseous fuel but stored as a liquid at relatively low pressures. It is easy to handle, and makes a good clean automotive fuel. Vehicle
conversions or OEM vehicles are easily available, and relatively inexpensive.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Sold all over the continent, propane can be produced as a byproduct either of natural gas scrubbing (in the field) or of refining. It is also used as a petrochemical feedstock. It is distributed primarily by truck or railcar, although sometimes, over long distances,
by pipeline. <BR>

The pricing of propane varies widely, depending on supply (in some gas producing areas there can be a significant oversupply in winter, so propane is dumped on the auto fuel market as an
alternative to burning it) and taxes (some states and provinces tax it at an effective rate even higher than gasoline; some states don't tax it at all.) Because of the economics and choices in
refining, the supply of auto propane can be very sensitive to price; a greatly increased supply might result from a small increase in price, as petrochemical users move to imported supplies or
to naptha. Much propane is also used as a fuel in refineries; natural gas could be substituted to free up propane for automotive use.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Compressed Natural Gas: A good clean motor fuel, widely distributed via pipeline throughout the continent, particularly in urban areas. Vehicle conversions not complex, but because of low energy density of the gaseous fuel, tanks take up a lot of space on board the vehicle and the vehicle may still have less than half its gasoline range. Economical; safe, because the installations must be well made to withstand the pressure underwhich CNG is sold or stored. Fuelling installations tend to be more expensive than for most other fuels, because of costs of compressors and high pressure
storage, but transportation costs (by existing pipelines) tend to be less.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Liquefied Natural Gas: Most of the advantages of compressed natural gas plus much increased energy density at the expense of cryogenic storage both at the fuelling point and on board the vehicle. Liquefaction of pipeline gas takes considerable energy from the gaseous state.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
LNG must be stored in heavily insulated pressure vessels and provision must be made for &quot;boil-off&quot;, gas which has evaporated from the liquid form and will build up pressure in the vessel if not provided for. This can occur in both vehicles and storage facilities.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Summing it up</b></font><BR>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
So what are the conclusions?<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
For the next ten to twenty years, gasoline of some sort, refined from partly imported oil and distributed through the big oil companies, will continue to dominate the market. Similarly, for heavy-duty vehicles, diesel fuel will dominate. Both gasoline and diesel will continue to be improved, but because of the cost of additional distribution infrastructure, there will not be more different kinds, either for the mass market or for niche markets.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Improved fuels will be more expensive than the present ones. The practical alternatives will be limited to those which have a distribution infrastructure: propane and natural gas. Natural gas will gain in urban areas, because where there are pipelines, it and its distribution are relatively cheap. Outside urban areas, propane will be practical, but since its price depends on supply and it must be distributed by truck, it will not enjoy a price advantage everywhere. But both gaseous fuels will remain in the game, if only because of good carburetion and emission characteristics.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Even if the 'breakthrough' battery does not appear, technological developments on electric vehicles will continue to make them more practical and cheaper, but it may be many years before they are economically competitive. Before they can take a large share of the market, there may have to be a considerable expenditure on the electrical distribution infrastructure, because the transfer of energy consumption from the petroleum fuels sector to the electricity sector could be significant.<br>

<font size=3><b>Electronic engine control unit</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The electronic control system will be based on the ECOJET system developed by Mogas Sales Inc. for light duty vehicles. This system utilizes a 68332 chip in the control module. This will be connected via a 19.2 kilobyte RS232 port to a personal computer, thus enabling the control chip to be reprogrammed and also operating data and sensor readings to be monitored in real time.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The 68332 has 256K of RAM, and onboard EPROM and flash EPROM to facilitate reprogramming from the PC while under way.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The ECOJET system is also capable of adaptive learning, and this capability will be employed in optimizing the engines operation.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Flywheel and camshaft gear sensors will provide the base timing for electronic control of all engine events, and a solid state ignition system will utilize spark plugs located in the former injector ports of an experimental cylinder head, originally made by Cummins for natural gas use.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Oxygen sensors</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The exhaust manifold has two groups of three pipes, and a single wide-spectrum Horiba type oxygen sensor will be used in each group. The advantage of the wide spectrum sensor 
is that it will give a series of digital signals marking variations in the exhaust oxygen content, rather than the on/off signal which emanates from a conventional sensor. This enables the ECU to detect trends in oxygen content much more quickly, and results in more efficient and quicker adaptation to changing engine conditions.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Instrumentation</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
As a research project, this engine will be thoroughly instrumented, with particular attention to the propane fuel system and 
individual cylinder pressure sensing. Initial testing and development will be carried out on BCRI's large engine dynamometer, which has extensive facilities for real-time data collection.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Engine completed by spring</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The first phase of the project, engine development, is expected to be completed 
by spring 1996. After that, the engine will 
be installed in an operating heavy-duty truck. The second phase, road testing, is expected 
to take about a year.<BR>

<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
So this project involves new technology in several areas:<BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">high turbulence combustion chamber design<br>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">electronic engine management, with adaptive learning<br>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">use of wide-spectrum oxygen sensors<br>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">electronic turbo wastegate<BR>

<IMG align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Cummins 8.3 litre engine will have high turbulence combustion chambers</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Cummins supplied a C8.3 six cylinder engine, along with a spare cylinder head, and piston blanks. This is normally a diesel engine, but Cummins does market a version for operation on natural gas. The combustion chamber of the engine is a bowl-in-piston design, with zero deck clearance and a flat machined face on the cylinder head.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The engine has a log manifold and a turbocharger in its diesel form.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Mechanical Engineering professor Dr. Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia designed a new, very high turbulence combustion chamber (UBC Squish Jet Combustion Chamber) which has been machined into the pistons. The combustion chamber has a number of features to promote a high degree of mixing of fuel and air, essential to successful lean-burn operation. The compression ratio, 9.25:1, must be viewed in the light of a maximum turbocharger pressure of 16 to 18 psi.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Direct propane injection</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Precise fuel control is sought through the use of fuel injectors. These will be located just upstream of each intake port. While the log manifold is probably not ideal for equal air distribution between the cylinders, the control system will be designed so that the injector pulse width on each cylinder can be tuned, while the engine is running, using electronic controls and an external PC, to optimize the performance of each individual cylinder. A custom-built mass flow sensor will be used to monitor airflow.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This approach also has interesting potential from a research point of view. Effectively, the researchers have the equivalent of six separately controlled (and separately instrumented) cylinders in a single engine.<BR>

The authors then go on to cite a number of climatic adaptations that have been demonstrated and which overcome any tendency that LEVs and ZEVs (battery powered ones in particular) might have to lose their utility in severe winter weather. Many of these will be recognised as higher tech variations on those old Canadian standbys, the block heater and the battery heater.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Technologies galore</b></font><BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Although the study expresses considerable optimism about the future of battery-powered electric vehicles, it covers a bewildering range of technologies that have potential for the LEV or ZEV of the future, even the relatively near future. There are, of course, many battery technologies; the authors observe that potential battery powered vehicle range is on a converging course with average daily vehicle mileage. While they do not anticipate that a battery-powered journey from Calgary to Winnipeg in mid-January will soon be possible, they point out that the majority of trips, in Canada as elsewhere, are short and urban. While they admit that range is a factor, they do not see it as a problem.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Beyond batteries, the authors catalogue an astonishing variety of alternative fuels, all providing various combinations of economy, reductions in harmful emissions, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, power and range. There are also fuel cells, hybrids, and diesels, all with their special advantages and potentials.<BR>

The study reflects two common threads that underly the authors conclusions: that both motive power units and the vehicles themselves will become more efficient, and that virtually all of the technologies cited are young and full of potential. All in all, a very hopeful theme.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Emissions benefits</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The study points to reductions in emissions that go with increased fuel efficiency. Drawing on studies that consider the total emissions that result from both production and consumption of the fuel, they conclude that significant reductions can be made in both regulated and greenhouse gas emissions. Canada, they say, gives electric vehicles, which require little marginal power, a particular advantage because so much of its electricity 
is produced from either hydroelectric or nuclear sources. But even for vehicle designs that use internal combustion engines, they conclude that significant reductions in emissions can be gained in the future at little or no 
cost to the consumer.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A number of cost studies cited in the report indicate 
that the actual vehicle purchase cost disadvantage, even today, can be offset over the vehicle lifetime by reduced operating costs. Future cost premiums for LEVs and ZEVs will, they conclude, represent a small percentage of the vehicle price. Many of the cost premiums that have been quoted, they feel, have been due to inefficient, very low volume manufacture.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The authors feel that Canada could, through policies encouraging the use of 
LEVs and ZEVs, both add significantly to production volumes, and take advantage of 
the technology development costs which manufacturers have already incurred in order to satisfy mandates in California and other states.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Special Canadian conditions</b></font><BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The authors refuse to accept either that Canadian regulations make it uneconomic to produce special vehicles for Canada, or that the dreaded Canadian winter would render these vehicles unusable.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
First, the regulations. The study points out that, in fact, the differences between Canadian and U.S. safety requirements are not particularly significant. Some are rather obvious, such as metric labeling and speedometers in kph, but they clearly feel that these would be no barrier to the sort of flexible, small volume manufacturers which are found in the emerging specialty ZEV market. The report notes that a large number of specialty (and not so specialty) automobiles currently sell less than 1,000 units a year in Canada, yet these manufacturers remain in the Canadian market.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Second, the climate. Canadians, they say, mostly live within a hundred miles of the US border, so the climate cant be all that different. It may not be California, but New York and Massachusetts, two states currently debating ZEV mandates, arent all that tropical in the winter either.<BR>

<font size=3><b>A shortage of resources</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Some of the reasons for this technological lag are not difficult to identify. First, it's clear that the aftermarket companies don't have the resources needed to carry out this development. The OEMs do, and in fact, engine management systems have been the main focus of their R&D over the last ten years. They are driven by the absolute necessity, for their survival, to meet US federal, California, and Canadian MOT emission regulations. Until recently, aftermarket conversions have not been required to meet these standards. But now they must.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Losing the inherent advantage</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
If the gaseous fuels are going to meet equivalent standards, they must use technology of equivalent sophistication. In the seventies and the early eighties, gaseous fuels had an inherent advantage in emission testing: during the cold start part of the test, they didnt require enrichment like gasoline. But that advantage has gone; gasoline vehicles with fuel injection operate with an absolute minimum of enrichment; computer controlled cold start routines ensure optimum burning and early light-off of the catalytic converter. The gasoline vehicles get better all the time.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Reverse engineering</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A second reason for the technological lag is the problem of reverse engineering. OEMs have, with few exceptions, made available little information about their engine control electronics. This means that aftermarket product development teams, in developing accessory electronics that will translate the outputs from the OEM ECMs to signals that can be used to control gaseous fuel systems, have to divine the logic used by the OEM by testing ECM behaviour under a wide variety of engine conditions. As the OEM ECM becomes more sophisticated, this type of reverse engineering becomes more difficult, more time consuming, and more expensive.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Even when the aftermarket team have it all figured out, they have to design their own plug in accessory electronics that will ensure that all the functions of the OEM ECM are retained. This can be difficult when dealing with the OBDII requirements, where a single slip can result in false signals.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
And all this work has to be carried out in time to market the conversion while vehicles of the current model year are still being sold.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Elsewhere in this issue, there is a report on the development of a natural gas Geo Metro in which the OEM manufacturer, Suzuki, developed a gaseous fuels version of their original ECM. No reverse engineering was necessary. No rewiring or additional electronic components are needed for the conversion. The advantages in terms of simplification and cost reduction for the conversion are obvious.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Fuel injectiona must</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A third problem is fuel injection. Gaseous fuel injectors must be substituted for the gasoline injectors; this would make it very difficult to do bi-fuel conversions, with the option of switching back to gasoline (particularly a problem on natural gas, where CNG tank range may be an operationally limiting factor). These gaseous injectors have only recently become available; they require precise specifications differing from engine family to engine family; and they may also require more precise control of fuel pressure than was necessary for gaseous fuel carburetion. On propane, there is the option of liquid injection. Recent truck engine research at BC Research Inc. (BCRI) indicated that this could be superior.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The development of these gaseous injection systems is no longer brand new technology, but it takes time and effort. Once again, for a relatively small aftermarket equipment company to carry out this development for a number of engine platforms, the sales revenue may not cover the development cost.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Cost</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This brings us to the escalating cost of gaseous fuel conversions. The cost of R&D must be covered; the manufacturing costs of sophisticated electronics and fuel injection systems are greater than the mixers that the industry previously used. There are two possible results: first, that manufacturers will only develop conversions for those engine platforms where significant sales can be expected; second, that the conversions will cost moreit will take longer to recover conversion costs from fuel savings, and so customers will only convert vehicles which use a lot of fuel.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Sharpening the marketing focus</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
So whats the probable result? Inevitably,  a sharpening of marketing focus. Conversions will only be available for a limited number of engine platforms. Customers will only convert vehicles that use enough fuel to ensure an early payout of conversion costs. Conversion manufacturers and gaseous fuel marketers will concentrate on specific customers for whom high quality conversions are available and the economics are clearly favourable. These customers will likely convert current year vehicles.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
We may also see certain manufacturers concentrate on conversions for certain platforms, and ignore others. This would be the result of a conscious decision to optimize the return for a limited amount of R&D investment and manufacturing capital. So, specialization is another possible result.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Some manufacturers may decide that the North American market requires too much new investment to remain competitive. With demand for alternative fuel vehicles increasing in the third world where emission regulations are not so strict and often nonexistent, a better corporate strategy may be to stay with the existing technology and market it aggressively overseas.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Such a strategy would make it difficult to return to the North American market as long as the present pace of technological development in the automotive industry continues.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A manufacturer may also choose to abandon the aftermarket in favour of gaseous fuel conversion development for an OEM. Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford (through their QVM program) have all marketed gaseous fuel vehicles over the last few years. Its notable that the OEM vehicles have shown generally good performance and excellent emissions results, but they have not been enthusiastically marketed. At press time, Chrysler had suspended their natural gas program, GM had made no new commitments, and Ford was only marketing Crown Victorias, primarily for the police car market.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Recent OEM gaseous fuel vehicles have shown a superior technological standard, although they cost a lot more and have not been without teething troubles. OEMs have spent the money, however, to carry out R&D to produce vehicles which match the standard they have reached with gasoline vehicles in recent years. They also face additional development costs, such as for crash testing, that the aftermarket is not presently required to incur.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
That said, the question for an OEM is whether to invest in alternative fuel development in the expectation of gaining additional market share in markets mandated by government, or whether to put its R&D investment into the improvement of/or cost reduction in all the vehicles the OEM sells. Its a difficult financial and strategic decision, and it may account for the somewhat ambivalent attitude that all the OEMs seem to be taking towards alternative fuel vehicles today.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>A continuing need for the aftermarket</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Of course, the OEMs, with their emphasis on mass production and offering of standard vehicles, cannot meet the total demand for gaseous fuel vehicles anyway. A significant number of such vehicles are specialized. From the customers point of view, his best strategy is to order the specialized vehicles he needs and then have them converted.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
So there is a continuing need for the aftermarket, but the aftermarket faces declining ability to deliver economical conversions, particularly on the latest technology vehicles.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>One solution</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A greater level of cooperation between the OEMs and the alternative fuel equipment manufacturers might lead to a win-win situation. Possibly the Geo Metro/Suzuki Swift project points the way. The participation of the Suzuki R&D people in the reprogramming of the standard ECM has eliminated the usual reverse engineering and enabled both Suzuki and the natural gas industry to offer a current technology vehicle at a low cost suitable for a new niche market.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This is the kind of idea that could change the structure of the aftermarket and give new growth to the gaseous fuels fleet.<BR>

<font size=3><b>New looks at an old problem</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The University of Victoria team have identified several novel refrigeration technologies which appear to have the potential for use on-site in a relatively small LNG/CNG fuelling station. One of these is an Orifice Pulse Tube liquefier, which utilizes a reciprocating piston in a cylinder to push the working gas past a regenerator and a cold heat exchanger to a pulse tube. At the upper end of the pulse tube is a hot heat exchanger, utilizing water as the cooling medium, and a small orifice leading to a ballast tank.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The reverse cycle of the piston pulls the working gas back through the system. The orifice restricts flow resulting in expansion and thus further cooling of the working gas. The cold heat exchanger is used to cool and liquefy incoming gaseous methane to make LNG, which then accumulates to further cool the cold end of the pulse tube.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
According to Dr. Barclay, this simple technology has the advantages of having no cold moving parts (only the working gas is moving), high reliability, and being inexpensive to manufacture.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
A second technology being explored by the University of Victoria group involves active magnetic regeneration (AMR) and utilizes the magnetocaloric effect: when magnetic materials are magnetized and demagnetized adiabatically, they experience a temperature change. In the case of a magnetic liquefier, a heat-transfer fluid (helium) is circulated through a wheel of magnetic material. On one side of the wheel, a superconducting magnet is used to create a temperature differential which transfers heat from the cold side transfer fluid to the hot side transfer fluid, where it is continuously pumped to a heat exchanger. This heat exchanger is used to cool the fluid, thus exhausting heat to the environment.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
On the cold side, the helium is cooled to a temperature lower than the liquefaction point of natural gas, thus enabling liquefaction by simple heat exchange.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This technology is more efficient than pulse tube, but is more complex and has more moving parts.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>More technologies</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Dr. Barclay and his team have more ideas up their collective sleeve, but they are keeping them quiet for now. One of these, they feel, may well be the breakthrough which would make CNG/LNG fuelling stations, and thus natural gas vehicles, more economic for many fleets.<BR>

<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
So this project involves new technology in several areas:<BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">high turbulence combustion chamber design<br>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">electronic engine management, with adaptive learning<br>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">use of wide-spectrum oxygen sensors<br>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">electronic turbo wastegate<BR>

<IMG align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Cummins 8.3 litre engine will have high turbulence combustion chambers</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Cummins supplied a C8.3 six cylinder engine, along with a spare cylinder head, and piston blanks. This is normally a diesel engine, but Cummins does market a version for operation on natural gas. The combustion chamber of the engine is a bowl-in-piston design, with zero deck clearance and a flat machined face on the cylinder head.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The engine has a log manifold and a turbocharger in its diesel form.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Mechanical Engineering professor Dr. Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia designed a new, very high turbulence combustion chamber (UBC Squish Jet Combustion Chamber) which has been machined into the pistons. The combustion chamber has a number of features to promote a high degree of mixing of fuel and air, essential to successful lean-burn operation. The compression ratio, 9.25:1, must be viewed in the light of a maximum turbocharger pressure of 16 to 18 psi.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Direct propane injection</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Precise fuel control is sought through the use of fuel injectors. These will be located just upstream of each intake port. While the log manifold is probably not ideal for equal air distribution between the cylinders, the control system will be designed so that the injector pulse width on each cylinder can be tuned, while the engine is running, using electronic controls and an external PC, to optimize the performance of each individual cylinder. A custom-built mass flow sensor will be used to monitor airflow.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This approach also has interesting potential from a research point of view. Effectively, the researchers have the equivalent of six separately controlled (and separately instrumented) cylinders in a single engine.<BR>

DME is mainly used today as an aerosol propellant, as a replacement for CFC gases, which were found to be harmful to the earths ozone layer. Currently, total world production is around 150,000 metric tonnes per day, and it is made from methanol by a dehydration process.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Haldor Topsoe A/S have investigated the possibility of alternative methods of manufacturing DME, since the present method results in DME being inherently more expensive than methanol as a vehicle fuel. The company proposes that the two processes, the manufacture of methanol from natural gas, and the manufacture of DME from methanol, be combined. The two reactions appear to have some thermodynamic synergy, under relatively low pressures and appropriate catalysts.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Haldor Topsoe say that the retail price of DME, taking into account manufacturing and distribution costs, should not be unduly above the comparable diesel price, when taking into account the environmental benefits from the use of DME. However, the company warns that very large DME plants would be required, in  areas with a low natural gas price, and also the establishment of an infrastructure for DME distribution. In a transition period, they say, there will without a doubt be a need for some government incentives for this scenario to be economically viable.<br>

Energy storage density is the Achilles heel of the natural gas vehicle. Compressing the gas to 3000 or 3600 psi means bulky storage cylinders, high pressure plumbing, and four stage fuelling compressors; the cost of energy used for compression can equal the cost of the natural gas.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
So the potential of adsorbents for vehicle natural gas storage comes from their ability to store large quantities of natural gas at relatively low pressures. Research has been concentrated on improving the energy storage density of the adsorbents.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Adsorbents have the greatest volume advantage over compressed gas at pressures around 4 MPa (500 psi), when the adsorbent will store about four times the quantity of gas that could be stored at the same pressure in an empty container. At these pressures, the vehicle could be fuelled using a two stage compressor, using much less energy, and the adsorbent container need not be cylindrical. In other words, it could be shaped to suit the vehicle design, so there is potential for greater fuel storage without intrusion into the mechanical and cargo-carrying parts of the vehicle. Of course, a low-pressure adsorbent equipped vehicle could be fuelled at a conventional high pressure CNG station provided it was equipped with a pressure reduction device.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Groups reach their target</b></font><BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Two groups working on activated carbons report that they have achieved their target of developing a material which will store 150 volumes of natural gas at 25 deg. C. and 3.5 MPa. This is a volume ratio that is achieved with compressed gas at a pressure of around 13 MPa, or a little over 2000 psi.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
One group is the Atlanta Gas Light Adsorbent Research Group (AGLARG), which includes the Atlanta Gas Light Co., British Gas, Sutcliffe Speakman Carbons, Amoco, Pacific Gas & Electric, Consumers Gas, the Gas Research Institute, and the Northern Illinois Public Service Co. The group is funding work at Cataraqui Research Associates, in Kingston, Ontario. The second group is a consortium of  CANMET, the Hydrogen Research Institute of the University of Quebec at Trois Rivires, the Natural Gas Technologies Centre of Gaz Metropolitain, and FRE Composites.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The Atlanta group have developed a cellular extruded aluminum storage container into which sticks of adsorbent can be fitted. They are currently working on production engineering to make larger quantities of their adsorbent and move the cost down from the currently estimated $5 per lb. to around $2. The CANMET group have not yet released the results of their current testing.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Cost is not the only factor which will determine whether adsorbents will, in the end, prove practical. While the adsorbent can be fuelled at lower pressures, the fuelling produces heat, which slows fuelling. And, with some adsorbents, not all the fuel that goes into the pores can be retrieved at low pressures. Contaminants in the natural gas can plug up the adsorbent. The Atlanta group suggests a front end adsorbent filter cartridge.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Another consideration is weight. Adsorbent containers, designed for lower pressures than CNG cylinders, weigh less. But the adsorbent itself, a solid carbon, presently weighs about .8lb per litre.  If we compare the weight of modern carbon-fibre CNG cylinders  with their energy equivalent in a full steel gasoline tank, we see that the CNG cylinders are becoming weight-competitive. It remains to be seen whether containers of adsorbent will land in the same weight ballpark.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Who pays the front end costs?</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=2 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
While compressed natural gas itself may be cheaper than gasoline, its adoption involves front end capital costs, both for the vehicle owner and the station operator. The user looks to either government or his local NGDC to assist.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The rule of thumb in northern parts of the continent is that a vehicle uses as much natural gas as a house. NGDCs often expend substantial amounts of their own capital installing pipeline distribution systems to secure homeowners as committed customers. Should they be prepared to invest similar amounts in order to secure the commitment of vehicle operators? And who should finance the investment: the NGV users, the existing customer base, or the shareholders?<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Some Public Utility regulating bodies have opposed investment by NGDCs to develop the NGV market. Existing natural gas customers should not be required to subsidize such market growth, they say.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Shareholders may support such investment, or they may view it as carrying substantially greater risk than other gas utility investments, and thus less desirable. And if there is a greater risk, should there not also be a greater return? <BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Some oil companies, while admitting their interest in selling compressed natural gas through their own retailing stations, say that regulated NGDCs should not be able to include their NGV market investments in their rate base, and thus in their regulated prices. This, they say, is unfair competition with unregulated gasoline marketers. Gas company executives point out that oil companies include their market development costs in their prices.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Some NGDCs have been able to rate base their investments in the market, and some have not. Some have spent non-rate-base money. Some have chosen to encourage third parties to provide infrastructure financing. And as more NGDCs get into the market, there will be more different combinations.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>How are they paid?</b></font><BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
So the chicken and egg problem, combined with the need for front end capital investment for infrastructure and vehicles, has led to some interesting schemes. We can measure these schemes against the approaches described above. Some examples:<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Grants to vehicle purchasers or converters, and to builders of fuelling stations. A NGDC could look upon grants as an investment, with the return from future natural gas sales profits. Subsidies can be used to accelerate conversions or purchases and station construction, thus driving the market beyond chicken/egg uncertainty to the point where it is self sustaining.<br>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>

<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">a gas utility may lend funds for vehicle acquisition or fuelling station construction. It will otherwise be difficult for smaller businesses or individuals to obtain loans for these purposes, and so this in itself may be an incentive, but the individual who must pay the loan back must perceive that the costs will be covered by fuel cost savings. Otherwise, why participate in such a program?<br>

These savings may be made even more attractive by providing a special price to either vehicle users or to fuelling stations. Such special price arrangements are often made with commercial or industrial gas users, or special volume or demand based rates are established, and approved by regulators. However, someregulators may not see this as fair to other users.<br>

<IMG align=top hspace=12 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"> <IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">Some NGDCs have made direct capital investments in infrastructure.

<font size=3><b>A six year plan</b></font><BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
One most interesting approach has been put forward by the Southern California Gas Company, which services Los Angeles. Recognising that the purpose of the company is primarily to supply gas to customers at competitive prices, but also faced with a legislative mandate to put forward a six year program to develop the NGV market, SoCal has designed a business plan which gets the company into the fuel retailing market, and then out of it, within six years.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The plan provides for SoCal to build a total of 150 fuelling stations (59 have already been built) and sell them to private enterprise at the end of the six years, or earlier. (At the same time, SoCal expects others to build a further 450 stations.) In the end, SoCal should have minimal rate base investment in NGVs, but should have started a market for the private sector.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The plan has been under consideration by the regulatory authorities for the past year; SoCal has proposed that the cost of the capital required be incorporated in the overall rate structure, with a payback (and consequent reduction in rates) at the end of the program. A regulatory decision on this is expected in the spring of 1995.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=8 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>The importance of public trust</b></font><BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Experience in New Zealand and Canada has shown that, in order to create an NGV market which will be sustainable in the long term, initial investments must be accompanied by a clear long term commitment to fuel availability and stable fuel prices and taxes. Gas distribution companies have, by and large, provided stable fuel prices.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This commitment is important because investments made by individuals and businesses in the NGV market have payout times which may well exceed the term of office of the present government, or of the Public Utility Board office holders.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The legislation intended to improve air quality is very widely supported. The natural gas distribution companies have an obvious and logical interest in making the necessary investments in initial infrastructure and market development.<br>
<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Regulators should allow them to match their initiative to their commitment. Their success is in everyones interest.

How does the PEM fuel cell work? Basically, gaseous hydrogen and oxygen are introduced to either side of a platinum catalysed membrane, and the protons from the hydrogen pass through the membrane to the oxygen side, producing water, heat, and an electrical potential between each side. Each individual cell consists of a sandwich about nine inches square and half an inch thick consisting of an anode, a cathode, distribution plates to provide air and hydrogen under low positive pressure to either side of the membrane, and the catalysed membrane itself. Each fuel cell produces about one volt, and so they are stacked together in banks and connected to manifolding which supplies hydrogen and oxygen, and removes water and unused air.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
So electricity is produced without any moving parts, but various electrically powered pumps and compressors, and a turbocharger, are used to ensure supplies of both hydrogen and air at about
30 psi, and to circulate cooling water through a conventional radiator.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The resultant exhaust consists of water and unused air. For a vehicle, that means Zero Emissions.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Ballard sold its first fuel cell for stationary power generation in 1994. Its first mobile application was in a 32 foot bus, which went on the road in mid 1993. In this bus, the fuel cell and its accessories took up close to a quarter of the vehicle's volume. In Ballard's latest bus prototype, the fuel cell engine occupies the same space that would normally be occupied by the bus's diesel engine. It produces 275 horsepower, the same as the diesel; and the weight is about the same as the diesel. The bus has the same number of seats as the diesel bus. It has a range of 250 miles between refuelling stops.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Ballard has come a long way up the technology development curve. Research now concentrates on improvements in the energy efficiency of the engine, and reducing the cost of its manufacture. This pre-production prototype bus, they say, will be run for about three years to gain operating experience. In that time, between ten and fifteen more will be made. Then they'll be ready for commercial production.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Ballard emphasizes that they are in the engine business, not the bus business. They anticipate having fuel cell engines for sale commercially in 1998.<BR>

There are many greenhouse gases, but their effect can be measured in terms of CO2 equivalents, and that is what these studies have done. The studies also measured the generation of greenhouse gases both in the production of fuel and in its use in the vehicle. This total emissions approach reflects the fact that it doesn't matter where greenhouse gases are generated, they affect everyone on earth.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Clearly, while alternative transportation fuels are chosen because they have an edge when it comes to reducing undesirable tailpipe emissions, their use also confers some benefits in the reduction of greenhouse gas generation.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="table.gif"></BR>


<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
With present fuel production methods, these benefits are significant (up to 25% reduction) but not spectacular. While virtually all alternative fuels produce less greenhouse gases than gasoline (regular or reformulated), the total figures are very sensitive to the method of production of the fuel. For example, the greenhouse gases resulting from the 
production of electricity are based on the mix of electricity generation plants in the 
U.S. for the year 2000. If there were a higher proportion of renewable generation, the figure could be substantially lower. Similarly, emissions for the production of other fuels assume 
current technology.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
But we can conclude that alternative transportation fuels do have a role to play in meeting international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas generation. And this approach gives us new reasons to focus on the emissions involved in the production of transportation fuel, as well as its consumption.<br>

<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Caterpillars production G3306 engine is designed to be a drop-in substitute for the equivalent diesel. It has similar power, driveability, and durability. In addition to significantly reduced emissions, it yields substantial economies due to the favourable price of propane.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The G3306 is a six cylinder, four stroke engine with a displacement of 638 cubic inches. Spark ignited with a 10.5:1 compression ratio, it is rated at 235 hp at 2,100 rpm, with a peak torque of 820 lbs-ft at 1,200 rpm.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The fuel strategy is stoichiometric, with turbocharger and air-to-air charge intercooling. The exhaust manifold is water cooled. Caterpillar has developed a new digital ignition system along with advanced engine sensor technology to calculate timing and fuel delivery. A three way catalyst is used.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Caterpillar is confident that this approach enables the G3306 to operate under a wide variety of operating conditions. The engine is also available for operation on natural gas.<BR>

<font size=3><b>Engine application</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
While the engine currently sells at a price premium over its diesel equivalent, marketing efforts are targeted at intensive user applications. Applications include urban delivery, waste haulage, and urban transit, where returns from fuel use savings and maintenance economies, together with substantial emissions improvements, increase the attractiveness of the G3306 to prospective purchasers.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>The G3406: Caterpillar's next gaseous fuel engine</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Caterpillar is expected to announce the production of the 14 litre G3406 engine soon. Advance information indicates that this new six cylinder engine will employ a lean burn engine management strategy, with a two-way catalyst, to meet stringent emissions standards.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The G3406 will be available with a 350 hp rating at 2000 rpm, with torque rise capability similar to Caterpillar diesel truck engines. Using a two-way catalytic converter, the engine complies with 1994 EPA emissions regulations. The total engine system produces less than 2 g of NOx and less than .05 g of particulates per brake horsepower hour.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Both the G3306 and G3406 share blocks, crankshafts, cylinder liners and connecting rods with their Cat diesel counterparts. Both engines have camshafts and turbochargers designed especially for gaseous fuel application, and both have Air-to-Air Aftercooling (ATAAC).<BR>

One of the functions of the closed-loop feedback system is to ensure that there is sufficient oxygen in the engine exhaust to ensure that the catalytic converter is able to do its job. Many catalytic converters have been damaged through too rich or too lean alternative fuel operation. With OBD II, oxygen sensors are installed both upstream and downstream of the catalytic converter to check on its operation; both are linked to the OEM computer.<BR>

Digicon uses a current project at BCRI to illustrate what can be done with electronic engine controls and alternative fuels. A Cummins 8.3 litre, six cylinder diesel engine has been converted to spark ignition and electronically controlled gaseous propane injection. The engine has special high-turbulence combustion chambers and a turbocharger with electronically controlled wastegate.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
Using the Motorola 68332 computer, a powerful commercially available 16 Mhz 32 bit machine, Digicon has programmed a control algorithm using the same Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) approach used in many industrial control applications. The oxygen sensor used on this project is one which outputs a proportional signal rather than the on/off signal emitted by normal oxygen sensors.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
The control system also reads signals from the Mass Airflow sensor, throttle position, manifold pressure, turbocharger boost pressure, propane pressure and temperature, engine coolant temperature, crankshaft and camshaft degrees, and vehicle speed. It controls the DIS ignition system, six individual fuel injectors, and idle air bleed.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This array of inputs feeds a complex three dimensional mapping algorithm, in which all parameters are individually adjustable. Adjustment is carried out through an operator interface which enables adjustment while the engine (or vehicle) is running, using a notebook PC connected to the Motorola.<br>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
This sophisticated control system is designed to enable BCRI engineers to explore the limits of high turbulence lean-burn combustion in a wide range of operating conditions, including full load and part load acceleration, engine braking, and idle and low speed operation. It is an example of the type of control system that can be designed for alternative fuel engines if the designer is not hampered by having to adapt to the unknown and undocumented characteristics of an OEM computer designed to facilitate operation on gasoline.<br>

<font size=3><b>Fault detection</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
All the OEM systems were designed to detect faults in the operation of the systems or the engine, to turn on a check engine light on the instrument panel, and to store fault codes in the on-board computer for future diagnosis by a technician. This capability is known as On-Board Diagnostics (OBD). During the past year and a half, most new vehicles have been manufactured in compliance with new and more extensive diagnostic requirements (OBD II); the new requirements are mandatory on 1996 model year vehicles. OBD II computers detect a much wider range of faults, including poor performance of major emissions control components such as the catalytic converter. Some of these faults can result in the vehicle going into a limp home mode.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
OEM computers are able to detect spurious signals or results from operation of the vehicle on an alternative fuel. Aftermarket fixes have usually concentrated on blocking or diverting signals so that spurious error codes did not occur. But with OBD II, strategies have had to shift to working with the OEM computer, rather than just trying to fool it.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Reverse engineering</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
The OEMs have not made this easy. Anxious to protect their immense investment in computer hardware and software, they have been most reluctant to release any information about how their on-board computers actually work. This means that designers of aftermarket electronics have had to resort to forms of reverse engineering in order to develop systems which will manage engines on alternative fuels to produce emissions performance equivalent to the OEM gasoline vehicles.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
At first, this reverse engineering was somewhat crude, amounting to little more than blocking key inputs and outputs of the OEM computer. Early aftermarket conversions to closed-loop feedback-equipped vehicles used open-loop technology. Often the signal from the oxygen sensor was ignored, and the equipment supplied was little more than fix boxes.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<font size=3><b>Working with the OEM computer</b></font><BR>
<IMG align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
Douglas Yip, of Digicon Engineering Incorporated in North Vancouver, BC, is one of the few electromechanical engineers who has experience in this kind of reverse engineering. He uses a variety of data acquisition systems to analyse the inputs and outputs of the OEM computer in real time and translate them into the signals necessary to accomplish the same results on alternative fuels. This means that the alternative fuel system uses the same algorithm as the OEMs system in order to control the engine. This could be termed working with the OEM computer rather than trying to circumvent it. But it requires a considerable amount of analysis of the behaviour of the OEM computer before its outputs can be effectively translated into the signals necessary to control the alternative fuel system.<BR>

<IMG border=0 align=top vspace=3 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif"><BR>
<IMG align=top hspace=10 SRC="../cr_gifs/dot_clr.gif">
And with OBD II, the number of functions carried out by the OEM computer is much increased. This means even more reverse engineering to adapt the vehicle to alternative fuels.<BR>

<h1><CENTER>Computer Industry Leaders Detail<BR>
Regulatory Obstacles to Digital Marketplace<BR>
Report Calls for New Public Policy Fundamentals for the 21st Century</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The CEOs of the nation's twelve leading computer systems manufacturers today called on government policy makers to rewrite outdated regulations so that consumers, businesses and society can realize the full potential of dynamic, new digital products and services.
<P></P>
In a report entitled <A HREF="../reports/digicomp.html">Public Policy in the Information Age: Digitization and Competition,</A> the coalition of CEOs emphasizes the endless potential benefits of digitization.  Among the benefits the report cites are more efficient products and services, easy access to resources across the country or around the world, and new trading relationships for consumers and businesses.  Digitization also will increase competition, innovation and customer choice, as well as reduce prices, the report says.
<P></P>
However, impediments to digital competition found in existing regulations could jeopardize the advantages of digitization, according to the CEOs, who together form the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP).
<P></P>
"The digitization of information will revolutionize the way we live and work, on a scale similar to the industrial revolution," said Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard chairman, president and CEO and co-chair of CSPP's GII committee.  "For people to enjoy the full benefits of the digital age, we must take a new approach to policy."
<P></P>
Digitization is the process by which all forms of information can be reduced to a single common denominator (a bit) that can be transmitted, received and manipulated by many different types of equipment.  Thus, products that traditionally perform one function can now perform unexpected tasks, e.g. computers can now receive fax transmissions.  As a result, distinctions among equipment such as telephones, televisions and computers begin to fade, and whole new devices combining their functions begin to emerge.
<P></P>
Without clear boundaries to distinguish products, the report cautions that regulators may subject emerging products and services to existing rules, for the sake of convenience and precedent.
<P></P>
<I>Public Policy in the Information Age: Digitization and Competition</I> is the first comprehensive evaluation of how applying old regulations to cutting-edge technologies can hinder the development of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII).  The report lists five types of regulatory barriers that could thwart new digital products and services by maintaining the segregation between industries and markets and by sheltering incumbents from new market entrants.  These barriers are described as: geographic and cultural; classification-related; technological; false scarcity; and market solutions.
<P></P>
An example of a geographic barrier cited in the report is the current state-by-state medical licensing scheme.  The advent of telemedicine, offered across several state borders through digitization, will be jeopardized if more states prevent patient care by doctors licensed in another state.  State officials in Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma and Nevada have barred physicians without a state license from practicing telemedicine there.  The CSPP reports says another 20 states are considering similar restrictions.
<P></P>
The report suggests that, under digitization, yesterday's technological constraints should give way to virtually limitless networks.  In addition, monopoly markets should expand to include multiple players.  Global communications links should replace national and local connections.
<P></P>
While public policy makers must initially protect emerging competition from dominant market players, the ultimate challenge will be to shift from specific market regulation to open, deregulated markets.  CSPP challenges legislators to develop regulatory principles that do not constrict the dynamic potential of industries, services and products in the digital era.
<P></P>
"New public policy fundamentals for the next century must be embraced now," said Edward R. McCracken, chairman and CEO of Silicon Graphics and co-chair of CSPP's GII committee.  "Rather than regulation, a new framework is needed to encourage economic and social growth on a global scale."
<P></P>
The report articulates those ten policy fundamentals as: allowing previously segregated industries to compete for the consumer's attention; freeing the market from regulations; creating temporary, new regulations to serve transitional needs while moving toward open markets; considering a global digital common market; developing new legal understandings, particularly with regard to intellectual property law; increasing public access to the digital environment; and developing industry rather than government standards.
<P></P>
"It would be unfortunate if in 10 years we were to look back and say 'everything in the world changed except the way we regulate technology,'" said Robert B. Palmer, Digital chairman and chairman of CSPP.  "Digitization doesn't erase the need to protect the public.  It does demand that we create new rules.  Our report lays out this challenge."

<h1><CENTER>CSPP Position Statement<BR>
Updating Export Controls for Encryption and<BR>
Developing Key Recovery Technologies</h1></CENTER>
<p></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), a coalition of the chief executive officers of the 12 leading U.S. computer systems companies, supports the Administration's decision to permit the export of 56-bit encryption products and comparable strength key exchange technology for legitimate uses in all but terrorist nations.  CSPP also supports the Administration's decision to allow U.S. firms to take the lead in developing key recovery technologies that can be exported at unlimited strengths.  CSPP believes that these steps are essential to improving the competitiveness of U.S. computer companies in the world market, stemming the loss of U.S. jobs to overseas firms and laying the foundation for commercially successful key recovery products and systems.
<P></P>
While the U.S. government does not regulate the domestic use of encryption, it has controlled the export of encryption, which significantly restricts technological developments and impairs U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace.  Encryption is a mathematical "lock" which renders digital information worthless to all but those who have the "keys" to unlock it.  CSPP has been working with the Clinton Administration and with Congress to update restrictive export controls and provide immediate relief to global customers who demand stronger encryption to protect their data.
<P></P>
CSPP supports the Administration's decision to encourage voluntary, industry-led key recovery technologies as a means of satisfying important law enforcement and national security concerns.  CSPP member companies recognize that key recovery may have value to customers for commercial reasons and are prepared to invest in key recovery technologies to satisfy customer needs.  CSPP member companies are equally dedicated to ensuring that customers who adopt non-key recovery products are adequately supported in the future.<P></P>
CSPP believes that only market-driven and customer-responsive key recovery products will gain commercial acceptance.  Therefore, CSPP advocates the adoption of voluntary, industry-led standards that are interoperable with existing and future non-escrow encryption systems.  CSPP also favors an approach to encourage development of key recovery technologies that focuses on overall industry progress, rather than on each individual company's implementation plan.
<P></P>
CSPP agrees with the Administration that the ability to export strong encryption is in the interest of national security and the U.S. economy and that exporting strong, high-quality encryption products will help safeguard private and confidential information of law-abiding U.S. citizens and companies.  CSPP commends the Administration for recognizing cryptography as a valuable commercial product by transferring jurisdiction over export of encryption products from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce.
<P></P>
While there are issues yet to be resolved, CSPP acknowledges the progress made by the Administration in removing export restrictions on cryptography.  CSPP stands ready to work with the Administration to expedite the implementation of these decisions that balance the Information Age interests of America's citizens, companies, and government.

<center><h1>Computer Company Executives<BR>
Praise Administration for Concluding<BR>
International Negotiations on Export Controls</h1></center>
<P></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The chief executive officers of 13 of the country's leading computer systems manufacturers today commended the Clinton Administration on successfully concluding the international negotiations necessary to ease export controls on the sale of high-performance computers.
<p></P>
"This was a major victory for the United States" said Robert B. Palmer, chairman and CEO of Digital Equipment and chairman of the coalition of the 13 CEOs.  "Streamlining controls will enable American computer companies to compete more effectively with their overseas counterparts, generating jobs and promoting continued U.S. technological leadership."
<p></P>
The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), as the coalition is known, has worked to underscore the importance of reforming export controls to reflect the rapid technological advances made in computing power.
<p></P>
The Administration policy will streamline control on all computers to be exported.  It will enable U.S. firms to compete fairly in the international marketplace, while continuing an embargo on the sale of computers to select countries.
<p></P>
CSPP intends to work closely with the Administration to ensure that the final rules do not impose administrative burdens that would undercut the progress of these reforms.

<center><h1>Japan Computer Agreement Generates Mixed Results</h1></center>
<P></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The government of Japan purchased more computers from U.S. and other international computer manufacturers in 1994 than in 1993.  However, in one critical area of the Japanese public sector market, foreign computer manufacturers lost share and in another area, procurement was stagnant.  This information is part of a study released today by a coalition of chief executive officers from 13 leading American computer companies.
<P></P>
The study, sponsored by the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), revealed that U.S. and foreign computer manufacturers' share of  the Japanese public sector increased by 5 percent, from 9 percent in 1993 to 14 percent in 1994, the latest year for which data are available.  By contrast, though, U.S. and other international computer manufacturers attained a 37 percent share of Japan's non-public sector market in 1994.
<p></P>
"When market forces can operate without restraints, purchases of our products are almost three times greater," said Robert B. Palmer, chairman and CEO of Digital Equipment and chairman of CSPP.  "The 1992 U.S.-Japan Computer Agreement, which was designed to open Japanese public sector procurement to foreign computer manufacturers, has improved our position, but ever so slowly."
<p></P>
Foreign computer manufacturers achieve the largest percent of purchases in the quasi-government part of the public sector, which includes government-related corporations and agencies such as the NTT.  Sales to the quasi-government sector jumped significantly in 1992,  the year the agreement was implemented, and increased again in 1993.  Last year, however, the U.S. and other international computer system companies' share dropped significantly in the quasi-government sector.  These foreign computer manufacturers received only 21 percent of quasi-government procurement in 1994, as compared to 33 percent in 1993.
<p></P>
Procurement by quasi-government agencies has most closely approximated the non-public sector purchases of foreign-manufactured computers.  In 1993, only 4 percentage points separated foreign manufacturers' share of non-public sector purchases and their share of quasi-government purchases.  A year later, the difference is 16 points.  However, in the same 12 months, total computer purchases by quasi-government agencies surged dramatically, going from 3 percent of Japan's total computer hardware market in 1993 to 8 percent in 1994.  This surge boosted the procurement of computers from foreign manufacturers, despite the drop in market share.
<p></P>
Meanwhile, local government computer procurement dropped, but by less than a percent. Foreign manufacturers' share of those sales edged up to 3.5 percent last year, from 3 percent 12 months earlier.
<p></P>
"Our survey results show that local government and quasi-government agencies can still do a lot more to increase their purchases of competitive offerings by foreign computer makers," said Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and CEO of Compaq and co-chairman of CSPP's working group on Japan public procurement. "It is clear that more needs to be done before we can be satisfied that the Japanese government procurement market is open and competitive."
<p></P>
The brightest spot in the CSPP study is the Japanese national government purchasing twice as many computers from foreign manufacturers in 1994 as in 1993.   National government purchases rose from 6 percent in 1993 to 12 percent in 1994.  This increase took place during a period in which the national government reduced its computer purchases by about 15 percent, or 1 percent as compared to the total market.
<p></P>
"We are pleased to see the U.S. share of  national government purchases double," said William E. Foster, CEO of Stratus Computer and co-chairman of CSPP's working group on Japan public procurement.  "We are eager for local governments to follow suit and for the quasi-government agencies to continue the progress they made earlier in this process."
<p></P>
Computer purchases by the whole Japanese public sector continued to grow last year, as compared to total computer hardware purchases, increasing from 20 percent in 1993 to 24 percent in 1994.
<p></P>
CSPP worked closely with the U.S. government to negotiate the 1992 agreement.  The organization will continue to press for full implementation of the agreement.  CSPP members believe the Japanese government should more strongly encourage local governments to adopt the procedures outlined in the agreement, which can lead to more open practices and result in greater market share for foreign computer manufacturers.

<center><h1>Computer CEOs Say Export Policy Reform Required to
Protect "Cyberproperty" and Competitiveness</h1></center>
<P></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A report released today by the chief executive officers of the 13 leading computer systems companies calls on the federal government to lift its strict controls on U.S. commercial cryptographic products when competitive products are available on the international market from foreign sources.
<p></P>
The report, <A HREF=../reports/report1-96.html">Perspectives on Security in the Information Age,</A> also recommends the U.S. government end technology-based restrictions on exporting strong, commercial cryptographic products to legitimate, commercial users.
<p></P>
Individual and business owners of electronic property, or "cyberproperty," should determine the type and strength of security needed to protect what is fast becoming the most valuable form of currency in the Information Age, according to the report.
<p></P>
The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), as the CEO coalition is known, contends that users of the global information infrastructure (GII) have the need, right and responsibility to protect their confidential information as it travels over open electronic pathways or is stored in unsecured facilities attached to those pathways.
<p></P>
"Cryptographic technology is a must for every individual and business with sensitive data on the Internet or some other component of the global information infrastructure," said Robert B. Palmer, chairman and CEO of Digital Equipment and chairman of CSPP.
<p></P>
The report likens the intangible personal data that, for instance, users of the Internet's World Wide Web transmit instantaneously across geographic borders to the tangible documents the same individuals might store in locked file cabinets or send through the mail. Both types of information are property, similar to manufactured goods or land.
<p></P>
The report states that the most efficient and cost-effective way to protect cyberproperty is with cryptographic products, many of which are subject to 50-year-old export control policies.
<p></P>
Cryptographic products encode and decode individual pieces of cyberproperty at the  point of transmission and receipt.  Since no one nation, corporation or person controls the network of electronic pathways that constitute the GII, the whole of it cannot be secured.  It spans more than 100 countries and serves millions of users.
<p></P>
Encryption is a cryptographic tool that enables owners to protect their individual pieces of cyberproperty from intrusion and theft, much the same way a padlock protects property in a locker or an envelope protects property traveling through the mail.  Encryption hardware or software uses computers to employ many more numbers than are possible even on a sophisticated padlock.  The longer the "combination," the stronger the encryption, and the more secure the cyberproperty.
<p></P>
"As the number of linked networks increases and the cost of computing continues to fall, individual and business owners will require effective security solutions -- effective encryption -- to safeguard their cyberproperty from vandals, thieves, industrial spies and terrorists," said Scott G. McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems and co-chairman of CSPP's working group on security, encryption and export controls.
<p></P>
"Indeed, government and industry should be working together to protect government, industry and individuals from these vulnerabilities, rather than struggling over the futile endeavor to control' encryption," McNealy added.  "The growing number of global interactions by individuals and businesses will also require security solutions that are global in nature," he said.
<p></P>
The U.S. State Department regulates hardware and software encryption products--even when specifically designed for commercial purposes--as munitions that are deemed "inherently military in character."  This policy severely limit the ability of American companies to provide customers with security solutions, based on encryption, that are seamlessly integrated into their computer systems.  Meanwhile, many foreign competitors already export competitive security solutions that U.S. companies cannot.
<p></P>
The competitive advantage that foreign companies derive from their ability to meet the growing demand for secure, integrated, global solutions may well result in lost U.S. market share in encryption and in general computer systems, the report concludes.  Foreign competitors will attract sales not only from foreign companies, but also from U.S. companies.  The report argues that, over time, the government's current restrictive practice threatens to drive sales, technologies and jobs to foreign competitors who are able to produce and export cryptographic products.
<p></P>
The CSPP report reviews the possible consequences facing the American economy and the computer systems industry, specifically, if policy dating back to World War II is not modernized. It proposes a list of principles to shape current and future federal policy controlling the availability and use of cryptography.  Finally, it recommends four critical first steps to bring U.S. export policy, created to protect America's national security interests, in line with the realities of the 21st century.
<p></P>
"Policy changes that reflect these recommendations will promote the legitimate use of security by individuals and companies on the GII, while addressing the U.S. government's concerns about its intelligence gathering and law enforcement capabilities," said James A. Unruh, CEO of Unisys and co-chairman of CSPP's working group on security, encryption and export controls.
<p></P>
The recommendations for changes to U.S. export control policy are:
<ol>
<li>Link the decontrol of U.S. commercial cryptographic products to the availability of competitive products in the international marketplace;<p>
<li>Permit export of effective U.S. commercial cryptographic products, without technology restrictions on key escrow requirements, for legitimate commercial end users, unless the government clearly demonstrates a risk;<p>
<li>Permit the export of effective U.S. commercial cryptographic products that meet reasonable government access needs; and,<p>
<li>Embargo U.S. commercial cryptographic products to terrorist countries.
</ol>
"CSPP believes that the U.S. government, other national governments, the private sector and individual users should work together to develop encryption policies that enable individuals and businesses to protect their cyberproperty and that allow users worldwide to fully benefit from the global information infrastructure," said Palmer.

<h1><CENTER>American Computer Companies<BR>
Welcome Export Announcement</h1></CENTER>
<h2><center><em>CEOs Cite Job Opportunities, Forward Vision</em></h2></CENTER>
<p></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The chief executive officers of 13 leading American computer
companies today commended the Clinton Administration for raising the performance threshold on commercial computers exported to most countries.  The new guidelines clear the way for increased sales of American computer technology abroad.
<p></P>
"Continued deregulation of the computer industry creates new job opportunities for American workers and brings new revenue into the U.S. economy," said Robert B. Palmer, chairman of Digital Equipment and chairman of the coalition of these companies, called the Computer Systems Policy Project.  "The Administration is to be commended for making these goals consistent with national security by continuing the ban on exports of  computers to rogue nations and limiting exports for military uses."
<p></P>
CSPP members worked closely with the Clinton Administration in securing significant export control reform in 1993.  The group played a similar role leading up to today's announcement.
<p></P>
"The Administration recognized the need for decontrol in 1993, and they've done it again with this prudent and very necessary action," Palmer said.  "The market and the technology have outpaced the controls.  This decision enhances the competitiveness of U.S. computer companies without jeopardizing national security."
<p></P>
The decision by the Administration brings computer export controls more in line with the rapid technological advances and ready foreign availability of equivalent computing power.
<p></P>
"These exports help us continue a high level of R&D.  This R&D keeps us number one in the global information society, creates good jobs and promotes our national security," said Scott G. McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems.
<p></P>
"I commend the Administration for a policy that keeps pace with both rapid technological change and the realities of the post-Cold War world,"  said James A. Unruh, CEO of Unisys.  "Today's action addresses one of many export control issues that impact the competitiveness of American business.  We look forward to speedy implementation of today's announcement and will continue to work towards a more comprehensive reform of export controls."

<center><h1>Computer Company CEO's Issue<br>
Recommendations for Government,<br>
Industry Roles In GII</h1></CENTER>
<P></P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The chief executive officers of 13 leading American computer companies today released a report calling on the U.S. and foreign governments to let the private sector lead the development of a truly global information infrastructure (GII). The report, entitled
<A HREF="../reports/perspectives.html">Perspectives on the Global Information Infrastructure,</A> highlights actions governments should take to support private sector efforts to expand the GII.
<P></P>
The report was prepared by the Computer Systems Policy Project(CSPP), an affiliation of the CEOs of the 13 companies.  Among the report's recommendations is a call for governments to remove regulatory and trade barriers that can impede competition and limit the growth of the GII. The report also urges industry and government to jointly sponsor test projects that can identify technological and policy obstacles facing the GII and point the way to solutions.
<P></P>
"Industry has moved with accelerating speed to create applications that bring the benefits of the latest information technologies to people worldwide," said James Unruh, chairman and CEO of Unisys and chairman of CSPP.  "There are several important steps governments must take to support industry efforts to build a GII that can improve the access of people all over the world to public services, cultural opportunities, commercial transactions and much more."
<P></P>
Michael Spindler, CEO and president of Apple Computer and chairman of CSPP's working group on the GII said, "The Administration has done an outstanding job of launching the debate and creating significant international forums to discuss the GII.  Now it is up to the private sector to be a full participant in those discussions.  This report outlines the computer industry's view of its role and the role of government in advancing the GII."
<P></P>
<I>Perspectives on the Global Information Infrastructure</I> describes the GII as a "worldwide assembly of systems that integrates five components -- networks, information equipment (such as telephones, televisions and computers), information resources, applications and people."  The report delineates seven  key CSPP messages on the GII:
<OL>
<LI>The global information infrastructure is already beingestablished.
<LI>The private sector must take the lead in developing the GII.
<LI>The policy agenda for the GII must go beyond issues of concern to the telecommunications sector.
<LI>Competitive markets and deregulation are critical.
<LI>Governments and the private sector must work to achieve global accessibility.
<LI>Substantive issues to be addressed include:  interoperability, market access, security, privacy and intellectual property protection.
<LI>Commercial testbeds, sponsored jointly by industry and governments, will help identify potential barriers to fully developing the GII and point the way to solutions.
</OL>
<P></P>
The report begins with the premise that the needs of the GII are much broader than telecommunications alone.  Deregulating telecommunications is critical, but countries must also look beyond issues such as competition, privatization and market access in the telecommunications sector when formulating policy governing the GII.
<P></P>
Companies and governments must seek to bring the competition that has marked the computer industry to bear on other components of the GII.
<P></P>
"The U.S. government should work aggressively with other governments and within the appropriate international organizations to achieve competitive, deregulated markets," the report says.  Government restrictions and government-sanctioned monopolies of critical network services prevent the informationindustry from participating fully in foreign markets.  Competitive, deregulated markets will stimulate innovation, expand customer choice and reduce costs.  This will go along way to fostering the GII's development, CSPP believes.
<P></P>
While underscoring the importance of the GII being affordable and accessible to people throughout the world, the report states that it would be counterproductive to develop requirements for universal service before the market for the GII has been clearly delineated.  "As the GII evolves, the private sector has a responsibility to work with governments to identify strategies, other than government mandates, for making essential services and information sources broadly accessible to people and communities," the report states.
<P></P>
The report calls for governments worldwide to support industry work to adopt common practices in several critical technological areas.  The first of these is the need for internationally accepted standards to enable interoperability between computers, telephones, televisions, applications and databases, which can interact with counterparts anywhere in the world.  These standards should develop through voluntary industry processes rather than government mandates.
<P></P>
Security and privacy are two other concerns for users of the GII.  Policies addressing these areas must balance the need for information to flow freely across borders with viable protections for sensitive data.  Governments must help the private sector adopt standards that insure confidential material is protected as it travels through the GII.
<P></P>
"The U.S. government must work with industry to implement policies that will allow for the use of international encryption mechanisms necessary for commercial transactions," said Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems and chairman of the CSPP trade committee.  "Those security mechanisms must ensure privacy and authentication for personal and business data."
<P></P>
Finally, the report recommends that the U.S. government continue its activities to strengthen intellectual property protection.  The owners of work that consumers will access through the GII need assurances that their copyrighted material and proprietary designs are safeguarded all along the GII.  "The U.S. government must be willing to take an aggressive stand in negotiating needed copyright protections abroad," the report states.

<H1><CENTER>Public Policy in the Information Age:<BR>
Digitization and Competition</H1></CENTER>
October 1996
<P></P>
<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P></P>
The digital revolution has the potential to alter our lives as comprehensively as the industrial revolution.  New digital technologies have already changed the communications and information industries dramatically and have given rise to many new products and services.  The vision of a globally interconnected world is becoming a reality.  The Global Information Infrastructure (GII) will enable people to exchange information and to participate in the marketplace with greater ease and flexibility. Individuals can choose the form (audio, video or text) in which they prefer to interact, rather than have it dictated by technology.  For instance, the World Wide Web can offer the most current information days, even weeks, before hard-copy materials are available.
<P></P>
The digital revolution traces its history to the computer industry's process of digitization. Digitization reduces all forms of information to a single common denominator (the bit) that can be transmitted, received and manipulated by many different types of equipment.  This single common denominator allows traditional equipment to perform numerous non-traditional functions, such as computers receiving faxes.  As a result, distinctions between equipment such as telephones, televisions and computers begin to fade and the possibility of whole new devices -- e.g., "Internet browsers" -- becomes a reality.
<P></P>
Digitization will foster increased consumer participation in the marketplace and intense competition among different networks, appliances and content formats.  The GII also will enable competition to occur across geographical and political borders as never before and will allow new entrants to compete with market incumbents.  From competition, major economic and social changes will flow.
<P></P>
Digitization's benefits to consumers and businesses are endless.  Digitization will create more efficient products and services.  It will put national and international resources at consumers' fingertips.  It will make innumerable activities possible from the comfort of consumers' homes or offices.  It will speed transactions, reduce costs and open up new sources for business. It will foster new trading relationships for consumers and businesses a world apart.
<P></P>
However, these benefits are far from being fully realized.  In fact, impediments to competition found in existing laws and regulations may jeopardize many of the benefits of digitization and prevent the digital era from ever reaching its full potential.  For instance, applying existing regulations to new digital technologies may limit their availability and usefulness. Classifying goods and services into narrowly defined trade categories -- for example, the classification and regulation of computers as "telecommunications devices" if they contain a modem -- may limit consumer choice.  Further, imposing limits on digital products and services curbs the natural tendency of digitization to minimize the importance of geographic borders and product differentiation.
<P></P>
Policy makers are being challenged to develop regulatory principles that do not constrict the dynamic potential of industries, services and products in the digital era.  With minimal regulation, widespread competition and increased consumer choice should prevail.  The resulting changes in market dynamics should alter the assumptions that policy makers traditionally bring to the table and should virtually eliminate the need for economically based regulation.
<P></P>
It is possible that, in certain situations, creating a truly competitive marketplace may require a transition period. Policy makers can facilitate this transition by protecting emerging competition from dominant players until it is possible to shift from specific market regulation to open, deregulated markets.  Policy makers must also continue to use regulation, as necessary, to protect consumers from dangerous products, fraudulent claims and other social concerns.
<P></P>
Accordingly, CSPP recommends the following policy fundamentals as a starting point for developing affirmative doctrines to replace the out-moded regulatory models of the past:
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI>Previously segregated industries, products and services must be allowed to compete for the consumer's attention.
<P></P>
<LI>Policy makers should strive to impose the fewest possible burdens on the market and should err on the side of regulations that are the least intrusive and offer consumers the greatest choice.  Policy makers should reserve prescriptive government policies for circumstances -- such as health and safety or incumbent domination of a market -- in which the need for intervention is clear and overwhelming.
<P></P>
<LI>Governments, in certain situations, may need to create new regulatory frameworks that address short-term transitional needs while still moving toward competition and open markets.
<P></P>
<LI>The GII can be the foundation of a global digital common market in which world-wide open trade is facilitated by digital technology.
<P></P>
<LI>Public policy should encourage a marketplace in which consumers, rather than regulators, direct the availability of applications.
<P></P>
<LI>Public access to the GII should be promoted through common points of access to public facilities and through individual choice, not through rigid prescriptions for universal service.
<P></P>
<LI>The private sector, not government, should take the lead in developing international GII standards.
<P></P>
<LI>Traditional legal thinking about property law, personal rights and responsibility should recognize that transactions and communications on the GII will take place without reference to physical form or location.
<P></P>
<LI>Governments should rely on general legal concepts, such as antitrust, rather than sector-specific statutes to guide legal issues related to the GII.  Broad, industry-neutral concepts are more readily adaptable to the changing technological circumstances created by the digital era.
<P></P>
<LI>New economic regulations created to foster initial competition should contain sunset provisions to ensure that they do not become permanent barriers to an open and competitive market.
<P></P>
</OL>
<hr align=center width=50%>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P></P>
In recent years, policy makers and the media have heralded the arrival of the digital era and have embraced the image of computer technology linking people across a vast sea of world-wide information networks.  The digital era is expected to bring with it increased consumer benefits and choice as networked, digital appliances with improved functionality and flexibility are developed.  The question of where the digital era will take us, on an economic and societal level, has been the starting point of a number of discussions.
<P></P>
The digital era holds the promise of dramatic change in the way people use technology to accomplish commercial, educational, social, governmental and personal goals.  Digital appliances and networks that will compose the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) are accelerating the world-wide integration of our economic and social communities.   As a result, a radically different marketplace, characterized by competition and choice, will emerge.
<P></P>
However, the full benefits of the digital era may never be realized unless affirmative efforts are taken to enhance its prospects for success. This paper focuses on the challenges for policy makers in the rapidly changing information technology environment.  As set forth below, the move to digitization changes fundamental assumptions about the marketplace and about the need for government intervention in shaping the marketplace. Policy makers need to work towards a new policy framework that limits reliance on government intervention and encourages the private sector to respond to consumer needs.  This paper offers recommendations for such a framework.

<H2>DIGITIZATION AND THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION</H2>
<P></P>
<I>What is Digitization?</I>
<P></P>
Digitization is the process by which information in any form (text, graphics, audio or video) is reduced to a single common denominator that can be transmitted and received by a variety of appliances. In the computer world, this common form is known as a bit and is represented by a 0 or 1.  This evolution to a digital format will create three major changes in the way consumers use communications and information technology.
<P></P>
First, as a result of digitization, many of the long-standing distinctions between telephones, televisions, computers and other consumer electronic devices will no longer be relevant.  Prior to digitization, devices based on analog technologies were often limited to performing only one function.  Digitization and computer technology have changed this picture.  Today, computer technology allows these familiar devices to perform more than their traditional functions. For instance, a business executive may now choose to conduct conference calls over a computer instead of a telephone, by utilizing the computers video conferencing capabilities.
<P></P>
Second, digitization is also lessening the importance of geographic boundaries as a necessary means of defining markets.  Now that information can be made available easily, quickly and in multiple forms, products and services traditionally offered to a limited region can be offered to new markets.  For consumers, the benefits of electronic commerce create far-reaching opportunities in all countries that foster the growth of the GII.  For producers, niche markets expanded globally have the potential to become quite significant.
<P></P>
Third, digitization increasingly allows information (content) to be delivered in many forms (video, audio, text) by multiple pipelines.  More often, consumer preference, provider ingenuity and cost, rather than technology alone, will dictate the format and delivery method.  The World Wide Web already allows students to locate up-to-date information on screen that might elude them if they were to rely solely on library encyclopedias and other hard-copy materials.
<P></P>
Thus, the digital era will be defined by the potential for expansion and growth.  This contrasts sharply with the implications "convergence," which suggests that as technology becomes more interchangeable, the market will reduce to a few vertically integrated corporations.  "Competition" rather than "convergence" best describes the market abundance that will characterize the digital era.
<P></P>
<I>Digitization Increases Competition.</I>
<P></P>
As digitization allows appliances (and networks) to be used interchangeably for a wide array of purposes, telephone and computer companies, for instance, will compete directly for consumers' information services business.  The disappearance of traditional boundaries between products and businesses will generate numerous business opportunities throughout the GII and among industries that rely on critical computing and communications links.
<P></P>
There is little doubt that digitization will produce wide-spread competition throughout the GII:
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Among network providers.  The infrastructure will not be limited to a single network.  In fact, multiple pathways to users -- whether at home, in the office or on the road -- will be created, and consumers will be free to choose which conduits they prefer.  Already, for example, competition exists between the wireless, wireline and satellite providers of telecommunications services.  In the near future, cable companies, public utilities and broadcasters will offer consumers additional conduits.
<P></P>
<LI>Among appliances.  Competition among the different information appliances, (such as the telephone, television and computer) is likely to be fierce.  Vendors will be fighting to provide the "appliance of choice" and will increasingly be forced to cater to consumer demands by providing versatile and flexible information equipment. As this competition grows, consumers will be able to substitute widely among different information appliances, and familiar functions will be performed by non-traditional devices. One example that is already commonplace is the use of digital phones to transmit paging messages.  Rather than leading to one dominant appliance or the creation of a standard function set, digitization both increases the functions traditional appliances can perform and expands the functional configurations that can be offered with these devices.
<P></P>
<LI>Among content formats.  Due to the new means of transmitting and manipulating information, content will be created and used in picture, text or audio form. Competition between content providers to meet the needs of consumers will force increased choice, customization and flexibility.  In addition, consumers will be able to create their own content through the use of digital technologies.
<P></P>
The current trials of interactive television are an example of this new flexibility, which gives television viewers the freedom to explore various programming options and areas of interest.  Many of these trials are testing video-on-demand, allowing in-home audiences to make individual selections of programs and viewing times.  Other trials are exploring viewer-controlled camera angles for televised sporting events and interactive menu systems that allow viewers access to supporting news and background data.
<P></P>
<LI>Across distances.  Since digital information will not be restrained by geographic borders, competition will likely emerge between businesses that were historically segmented due to their location in different cities, states or countries.  Emerging Internet-based companies, for instance, will be able to reach a broader marketplace and therefore, could thrive in this new environment, even if they may not have in their entrenched local market.
<P></P>
<LI>Among incumbents and new entrants using enabling technologies. As more individuals and businesses deploy advanced technologies and information services, competition will arise between incumbents and new market entrants. Small- and medium-sized businesses may soon be able to provide services previously offered only by large companies.  Customized small entrants will be able to interact directly with consumers, sidestepping middlemen and challenging vertically integrated enterprises.  This growth of competition between previously distinct industries has the potential to create revolutionary changes in the way business is done and in the structure of the global economy. Over the long term, various industries may be completely redefined, as nontraditional institutions or non-institutional settings offer new products and services.  Electronic payments and banking systems are examples from the financial industry.
<P></P>
This phenomenon can be seen in the growing on-line service market. Just a short time ago, the market was controlled by a few providers such as America OnLine, Prodigy and CompuServe.  Now, hundreds of new entrants, including companies that come from dissimilar consumer markets such as video rental and local telephone, are trying to carve out a portion of this market.
<P></P>
</UL>
<I>Digitization Benefits Consumers and Business.</I>
<P></P>
As described above, digitization injects the potential for competition within many industries and among many different goods, services and networks. Digitization and competition can foster innovation, increase consumer choice and availability, and reduce the overall cost of goods and services.
<P></P>
Digitization will offer the consumer new products and services that are more efficient or convenient to use.  It will create instant access to national and international information resources, expanding an individual's ability to make educated decisions about economic, health and other personal matters.  It also will enable individuals to perform from home many tasks that otherwise required physical mobility.
<P></P>
Businesses will be able to employ digital solutions throughout their operations.  For example, electronic commerce will speed transactions, reduce costs and open up new avenues for the supply of components and sale of goods.  In addition, companies will have increased flexibility in selecting geographic sites, since electronic communications will make it possible to effectively link divisions scattered across the country.  These and other changes created by digitization and by competition will encourage new market entry.
<P></P>
Further, digitization will have a global effect.  Consumers and businesses from across the globe will be able to build upon and leverage information created by the GII.  New trading relationships will be created.  Digitization and the GII will expand and change the shape of the world economy, benefiting users in every country that fosters its growth.
<P></P>
<hr align=center width=50%>
<H2>DIGITIZATION CREATES CHALLENGES FOR POLICY MAKERS</H2>
<P></P>
As digitization spreads, policy makers and regulators will be challenged to identify new economic principles that are appropriate to the dynamic industries, services and products that will characterize the digital era.  In creating and implementing new policies, it will be important to recognize that the cardinal feature of the digital era should be widespread competition accompanied by increased consumer participation in marketplace choices.  This feature alters the assumptions underlying traditional regulation of these industries and, in many cases, should remove the need for economic regulation.  Failure to address the characteristics of the new environment may actually prevent digitization from delivering its potential benefits to consumers.  The following section outlines the changing foundation for public policy and the challenges that will be faced by decision makers as they address digitization.
<P></P>
<I>Digitization Blurs Distinctions Between Markets.</I>
<P></P>
Digitization has caused many distinctions between existing information appliances, network services and geographic boundaries to erode.  The sharp lines that have traditionally segregated markets have also blurred.  In the past, regulations were designed with these industrial, technological and geographic segmentations in mind.  However, the new technological and economic realities of digitization largely eliminate these segmentations.
<P></P>
Faced with a world without clear boundaries, there is a danger that legislators and regulators may be inclined to fit emerging products, infrastructures and services into old regulatory schemes (e.g., regulating information services under telecommunications rules), subjecting them to out-dated rules for the sake of convenience and precedent.
<P></P>
In many cases, creating a truly competitive marketplace will require a transition period during which important changes must occur.  Yesterday's technological constraints should give way to virtually limitless networks and systems. Monopoly markets should expand to include multiple players.  National and local communications links should be replaced by global ones, and isolated consumers should become empowered.  Public policy makers initially must facilitate this transition by protecting emerging competition from dominant players already in the marketplace.  The ultimate challenge, of course, will be to shift  from specific market regulation to open and deregulated markets.
<P></P>
<I>Old Regulatory Assumptions May Not Apply.</I>
<P></P>
Historically, regulation and active government oversight have been premised on the inability of economic, competitive or social forces to protect citizens from harm.  For example, the inability of a city to support competing cable television networks has justified monopoly franchises of this service.  Meanwhile the existence of a monopoly has in turn justified the imposition of price regulation.
<P></P>
By expanding the competitive options and the availability of goods and services, digitization challenges the regulatory assumption that the marketplace cannot be relied on to respond to consumer needs.  In the example of cable monopolies, it is clear that introducing full competition will encourage market-based pricing, obviating the need for government controls. Similarly, digitization should lead to a re-evaluation of the justification for regulation.
<P></P>
<I>Consumer Protection May Require Different Tools.</I>
<P></P>
At the same time, there is a risk that important public and social goals (such as health and safety) will be undermined by relying on outdated regulations to achieve them.  The public interest continues to demand that government step in to protect consumers from, among other things, dangerous products and fraudulent practices.  Policy makers must understand the effects of digitization on consumers in order to tailor public policy to today's consumer needs.  New technologies and expanded product choices will change the solutions available to individuals faced with specific consumer problems and will alter the extent to which governments must intervene directly.  This change in the way the market addresses individual needs requires a change in our assessment of when and why regulation is necessary.
<P></P>
<I>Incumbents May Resist Market Forces.</I>
<P></P>
Equally alarming is the possibility that incumbents will use regulation to affirmatively block new market entrants.  These incumbents already are actively involved in, and familiar with, the regulatory process in their existing markets.  They are in a position to manipulate the uncertainties surrounding new technologies and players.  This tendency may complicate regulators' attempts to re-structure and liberalize regulations to reflect the competitive environment.
<P></P>
<I>Barriers May Be Created Through Traditional Regulation.</I>
<P></P>
Rapidly changing technology and markets may be hampered by slowly changing laws and regulations.  The time lag opens up the possibility that new products and services will be thwarted by the current regulatory framework.  There already are a number of examples in which regulatory actions, reflecting out-dated assumptions, have reinforced or created barriers to entry for digital technology, product and service suppliers.  These barriers maintain the segregation between industries and markets and will shelter incumbents and traditional markets from new entrants.
<P></P>
Certain barriers, erected through the use of public policy tools, seem aimed at the most fundamental aspects of digitization.  These barriers can constrain immeasurably the growth of a fully open, competitive global market:
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Geographic and cultural barriers. Digitization can eliminate geography as a divider of markets and can expand capacity so that no one language or culture will be exclusive. However, state and national licensing schemes, domestic content requirements and cross-border sales limits are being used to shore up existing geographic and jurisdictional divisions between markets.
<P></P>
For example, the treatment of patients and the delivery of medical care today need not be confined to local doctors providing care within a geographically defined community.  Using digital, broadband communications networks,  patients can consult expert physicians in other regions and isolated or rural doctors can access innovations in research hubs.  However, these benefits are being sharply limited in the United States, due to the state-by-state licensing of medical professionals.
<P></P>
Strong licensing requirements are necessary to protect patients from unprofessional medical care, and states have a clear interest in ensuring that such requirements are enforced.  Unfortunately, the existing licensing system may prevent life-saving use of long-distance telemedicine and other innovative digital treatment methods.  Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma and Nevada bar physicians without a state license from practicing telemedicine there.  At least 20 other states are considering similar restrictions.
<P></P>
In the long-run, the public interest demands that a regulatory system be created that recognizes the role that digital technology can play in delivery of health care information.  The revised system should maximize both patient protection and wide access to medical care.
<P></P>
<LI>Classification barriers.  Classification of products and services into narrow categories for tariff purposes (or for any other regulatory purpose, such as licensing or interconnection) limits consumer choice.  In some cases, these classifications lead directly to higher customs duties and other consumer costs.  In other cases, mandatory technical standards and local testing and certification requirements limit suppliers' options and restrict consumer choice.
<P></P>
Many countries are moving to reclassify certain information technology products.  For instance, the European Union (EU) may reclassify computer imports both to limit the competition by foreign companies and to raise additional revenue for the European Commission.  Reclassification efforts have been justified by claiming that computers can now serve as telecommunications devices (if they contain modems or a local area network (LAN) card) or video reproduction devices and televisions (if they support multimedia functions such as full motion video, audio reproduction or television signal displays).  In 1995, the EU classified CD-ROM drives as video reproduction equipment because the CD-ROM can store enough data to develop full motion video.  Although the World Customs Organization, at Japan's request, found the European CD-ROM classification to be inappropriate, the EU has not accepted this finding.  In addition, there continues to exist a major controversy over the reclassification of LAN equipment as telecommunications devices.
<P></P>
At the time of this report's release, these attempts at reclassification are ongoing and may result in a significant increase in import tariffs paid by manufacturers.  More importantly, due to the higher costs of the appliances, these actions may limit consumer choice, thereby stifling the growth of the GII and preventing Europe from being the strong player it wants to be in the information society.
<P></P>
<LI>Barriers to new technologies.  Applying existing regulations to digital products and services could limit the usefulness or availability to consumers of new technologies.
<P></P>
For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees all medical devices.  Any new applications that are developed must undergo FDA approval before they can be used broadly.  While this process is extremely important for consumers, it must be applied thoughtfully to electronic and networked technologies.  Unless amended, existing regulations will increase the costs of launching new devices and may ultimately prevent their use.
<P></P>
This was illustrated by events at the University of North Carolina.  There, special software has been developed which, when run on high performance computers, can render a 3-D image of a cancerous tumor and model the reaction of the tumor when treated with a specific dose of radiation.  This process has been effective in treating cancerous tumors and minimizing tissue damage.  However, in order to make this system available beyond the North Carolina community, it must be approved as a medical device by the FDA.  The FDA regulations did not contemplate medical software and even a slight change in code requires time-consuming and expensive FDA re-approval.  Further, the FDA requires approval of complete systems and could therefore designate an entire telemedicine network as a medical device.
<P></P>
<LI>The barrier of false scarcity.  Historically, scarcity of resources, such as radio spectrum, has been a linchpin of certain regulations in the U.S. and abroad.  Scarcity has led to a complex framework of government licenses for operators and providers of services.  If it continues to direct regulation, it will limit dramatically the extent to which digital technologies can be offered to consumers.  Because new technological developments, such as digital compression, allow scarce resources to be used more efficiently and effectively, scarcity is of much less importance as a base for regulation today.
<P></P>
<LI>The barrier to market solutions.  In the past, regulators and policy makers have often imposed rigid standards, product criteria or universal service requirements to correct perceived failures of the market.  As the digital era unfolds, these regulatory responses, if applied to newly emerging industries, could unnecessarily distort the development of the GII.  Further, from the standpoint of technology alone, the digital marketplace can be expected to evolve rapidly and in unexpected ways.  If allowed to develop freely, the competitive marketplace may produce solutions that address many consumer needs and, therefore, allow consumers to decide whether they use a particular technology or service.  Premature regulatory requirements will deprive both consumers and the private sector of the ability to make these important decisions themselves.
<P></P>
</UL>
<I>Today's Challenges</I>
<P></P>In the United States and around the world, policy makers are confronting a whole new set of factors that affect the telecommunications, information and mass media industries.  [SEE ATTACHED <A HREF="sidebar.html">SIDE BAR</A> OF IMPEDIMENTS TO THE GII.]  The choices and debates policy makers face will be shaped by the emergence of digitization and its consequences.
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>United States.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 seeks to sweep away the historic divisions between the United States telecommunications, cable and broadcast industries.  The Act recognizes that a transition will be needed to foster emerging competition among existing providers and entrusts the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with implementing the Act's provisions.
<P></P>
The FCC's ability to foresee the new digital environment and to provide for progressive deregulation in many areas will help shape the marketplace.  Among the issues to be addressed in the next twelve months are:  interoperability and
interconnection; universal service definition and supports; radio spectrum; and regulatory incentives to encourage deployment of advanced telecommunications capacity.
<P></P>
<LI>State approaches.  The states and public utility regulators have started to address questions raised by electronic communications and commerce, particularly as they relate to using the Internet for conducting business.  Legislatures in various states are deliberating Internet-related issues such as the validity of electronic signatures, the punishment for on-line crimes, the taxation of electronic mail and other transactions, and the applicability of universal service obligations.  These decisions and possibility of inconsistent state-by-state regulation will determine whether the GII continues to grow or becomes stagnant.
<P></P>
<LI>International approaches.  Because of its global nature, every country and region has a vested interest in promulgating its own rules on the GII.  In fact, in mid-1994, the European Union announced its own Action Plan to achieve a global information society.  The action plan identifies issues on which EU policy decisions are needed to create the appropriate legal and regulatory framework.  Some of these decisions include liberalizing Europe's telecommunications and cable infrastructure, financing universal service, improving intellectual property rights and privacy protection, and deploying advanced networks and applications.  In addition, many other countries, such as Japan and Singapore, are actively engaged in debates over how their countries will implement the GII.
<P></P>
</UL>
<hr align=center width=50%>
<H2>PUBLIC POLICY FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE FUTURE</H2>
<P></P>
The private sector must be ready to assist decision makers in the development of a public policy framework for the digital era that ensures the full benefits of the GII are realized.  Working with policy makers, industry must articulate new, affirmative doctrines to replace the inefficient regulatory models of the past and follow that action with a proactive public-private sector agenda that promotes those new doctrines.
<P></P>
The following ten policy fundamentals are suggested as a starting point in developing this new framework and a longer-term agenda. These concepts must be refined and evaluated in the context of both domestic and international debate.
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI>Consumer choice is the main benefit of digitization.  Digitization  promises to increase consumers' choice of products and services.  This benefit will be realized only if previously segregated industries and their products and services are allowed to cross over old barriers and compete for consumers' attention.
<P></P>
<LI>Let the market do the work.  Governments must adopt public policies that  foster competition and market growth.  Regulations should strive to impose the fewest possible burdens on the market.  Regulators should err on the side of policies that are the least invasive and offer consumers the greatest choice.  Prescriptive government policies should be reserved for circumstances in which there is an overwhelming need for intervention.
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>In order to realize the full benefits of digitization, policies must encourage competition between previously segmented sectors of the information economy.
<P></P>
<LI>These policies should let consumers drive the market.  Market-driven solutions are more likely to reflect the needs of consumers and be available at a range of affordable prices than those solutions dictated by government.
<P></P>
<LI>Regulations generally should not be imposed on markets that are in rapid flux, since market forces frequently obviate the need for any government intrusion.
<P></P>
<LI>Before government intervenes to craft regulations or license requirements, industry should be challenged to develop solutions to perceived market limitations or failures.  An industry-led technological approach, coupled with an industry-government dialogue, will likely yield an effective framework that limits regulation or avoids it.
<P></P>
<LI>Mandatory technical standards and public service obligations should not be imposed unless it is clear that the market cannot respond.  To avoid premature regulatory impositions, criteria should be developed to determine when the market has reached its potential.
<P></P>
<LI>Regulation should empower consumers to make choices based on their own specific circumstances, rather than direct their behavior through subsidies to operators or producers.  This may require targeted subsidies to consumers or well-thought-out access points to public facilities as a short-run solution for certain consumer groups.
<P></P>
</UL>
<LI>Short-term transitional requirements must be addressed.  Unfortunately, the digital era will not suddenly create an open and competitive market in all sectors or in all regions of the world.  Historically, the communications marketplace has been dominated by monopoly providers of telecommunications and cable services and by limited numbers of broadcast licenses.  Meanwhile the computer industry has been largely unregulated.  Digitization changes the potential for competition and interaction among these players.
<P></P>
<LI>The chart below describes the necessary regulatory transition.  The optimal outcome is a world in which the consumer drives the market and competition is prevalent.  However, without the proper transitional framework, existing players and old institutional patterns could shift the process toward greater concentration (e.g. full-service digital monopolies), a less-than-optimal outcome.
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>In certain cases, if there is a history of monopoly, or if the industry has been heavily regulated, there may be a need for a formal regulatory transition to an open, competitive market place.  This may include the need to protect new market entrants from an existing dominant operator that could leverage its market power to stifle competition.
<P></P>
<LI>Governments must provide the necessary leadership by creating new regulatory frameworks that address short-term transitional needs, while still moving toward competition, open markets and industry-led solutions.
<P></P>
</UL>
<LI>A global digital common market should emerge from the GII.  The GII can be the foundation of a global, digital common market in which world-wide open trade in goods and services is facilitated by electronic technology.  To achieve this goal, government and industry must tear down the barriers of location, origin and national identity that have historically blocked goods and services at the borders.  Generally, attempts to offer new products and services across borders should be encouraged, and regulatory efforts to impede the development of the GII should be discouraged.  To move from today's world of trade barriers to a global, digital common market, a number of regulatory matters must be resolved in favor of open, competitive markets.  Among the more critical matters for the digital common market are the following:
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>The globalization of digital networks and the growth of the GII depend on favorable resolution of industry and user concerns regarding interoperability, security and intellectual property rights protection.  Less immediate, but nonetheless important, are questions of privacy, contract law, fraud and taxes.
<P></P>
<LI>Mutual recognition and non-discrimination policies are an important first step to increase cross-border access to goods and services.
<P></P>
<LI>Customs tariffs, rigid local certification and mandatory testing requirements can stifle competition and act as a tax on innovation, impeding the natural development of the emerging technologies.  These product-specific barriers hinder user access to the GII by making all goods and services less affordable and accessible.
<P></P>
Countries that choose not to encourage the growth of the GII and that do not become part of the digital common market may find that they have adversely affected the ability of their residents to use the electronic marketplace and, ultimately, compete in the global economy.
<P></P>
</UL>
<LI>Consumer empowerment is an important goal.  Various circumstances exist in which legislators and regulators must examine whether the marketplace is able to meet specialized consumer needs, such as access needs of consumers with sight, hearing or mobility restrictions.  The new technologies of the digital era offer the promise of expanded product choices for these consumers.  Public policy should encourage the development of this marketplace.
<P></P>
<LI>Public access to the GII should be encouraged.  Rigid prescriptions for universal service should not be used to achieve widespread consumer access to the products and services of the GII.  Instead, governments should emphasize individual choice, open markets and common points of access to public facilities.
<P></P>
<LI>International GII standards should be developed by industry.  Isolated, incompatible infrastructures must be avoided by encouraging interoperability at key interfaces.  Rather than developing or mandating standards, government's role should be to ensure that incompatible national certification and testing requirements do not discourage cross-border trade.
<P></P>
<LI>Our basic legal thinking must recognize the emergence of cyberspace and its characteristics.  Traditional thinking about property law, personal rights and other legal issues will continue to be relevant to the new information infrastructure.  However, the legal framework of the future should also specifically recognize that transactions and communications will take place without reference to physical form and location.  Many assumptions underlying  the traditional laws governing personal and property rights may be changed as a result of these differences.  This, in turn, may change the nature of the laws needed to encourage users to act responsibly in this new environment.
<P></P>
<LI>Laws of general application are preferable to sector-specific regulations.  Reliance on general legal concepts, rather than on idiosyncratic or sector-specific statutes, is generally more prudent.  Laws not crafted to the language of a particular industry or technology, such as antitrust laws, are often more readily adaptable to changing circumstances and are technology and industry neutral.
<P></P>
<LI>Our goal should be phasing-out economic regulation.  Competitive,  deregulated markets are the goal.  However, in the near term, governments may need to impose regulations on market conduct to foster competition.  New economic regulations, if needed, should contain sunset provisions to ensure that they do not become permanent barriers.  Further, governments should take notice that new market dynamics may change players incentives to engage in various types of conduct.  These changes should be factored into evaluating how other public needs, such as health and safety, should be met by new laws and regulations.
<P></P>
</OL>
<hr align=center width=50%>
<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>
<P></P>
The digital age offers the possibility of economic and social growth on a global scale.  However, to realize this potential, policy makers will need to address new digital technologies, widespread competitive opportunities and emerging issues of consumer protection and empowerment in a worldwide context.  In many instances, industry itself will offer solutions that are preferable to government mandates.  Rather than regulation, a new framework is needed to encourage the marketplace to meet economic challenges.  The principles outlined in this paper are a starting point for cooperative decision-making between government and the private sector.

and educational opportunities that could improve the standard of living and the quality of
life around the world.  To achieve this promise, the private sector, with the encouragement
of government, is building the Global Information Infrastructure (GII), the electronic
pathways that will carry vast quantities of valuable commercial, scientific, and educational
information between individuals, companies and customers, doctors and patients, students
and teachers.<p>

While the GII offers unprecedented access to and exchange of information, it also exposes
users to breaches of confidentiality, disruption of their operations, destruction of
intellectual property and outright theft.  These are serious concerns because electronic
data in digital form -- or cyberproperty -- is emerging as the most valuable currency of the
Information Age.  Users of the GII have the need, right, and responsibility to protect the
access to, and the confidentiality of, their information.  They also have the right and
responsibility to determine the appropriate type and strength of protection for their
cyberproperty.<p>

Consider the case of U.S. companies, which currently lead the global information
technology market.  U.S. export control policies severely limit their ability to provide
customers global security solutions, based on encryption, that are seamlessly integrated
into their computer systems.  If U.S. companies are prohibited from meeting this growing
demand for secure electronic commerce, non-U.S. competitors are ready, willing and able
to do so.  In fact, many already are exporting security solutions stronger than those U.S.
firms can export.<p>

The advantage that competitors will derive from their ability to meet the growing demand
for secure, integrated global solutions will result in loss of market share for U.S. computer
systems manufacturers, not only in the encryption market, but also in the general computer
systems market.  Emerging Security Needs and U.S. Competitiveness: Impact of Export
Controls on Cryptographic Technology, a CSPP study released in December 1995,
estimates that the potential exposure to the U.S. information industry's annual revenues
could range from $30 to $60 billion by the year 2000.<p>

While individuals and industry have a compelling interest in protecting their cyberproperty,
the government has an interest in gathering intelligence and enforcing the law.  In addition
to lawful wiretaps and searches, the government meets its security objectives by
clandestinely intercepting information traveling on the GII among criminals and terrorists. 
The government is concerned that the spread of global security solutions may adversely
affect its law enforcement and international intelligence gathering responsibilities.  But 
strong security solutions are already available in the international marketplace to legitimate
users and terrorist and criminal elements alike.  Given this reality, the government  efforts
to prevent the global spread of security technology are doomed to fail.<p>

Governments and the private sector must reach a consensus on broad principles that can
serve as the foundation for a rational export control policy.  CSPP has developed a set of
security principles that offer a framework for agreement on a reasonable and achievable
national policy.  CSPP has also drafted specific recommendations for action that can
satisfy the U.S. computer industry's immediate export  needs while a  comprehensive
policy solution is designed.  How effectively individual users, the private sector, and  
governments work together to define a security policy that fairly balances competing
economic and security interests, will determine the scope and growth rate of the GII.<p>

CSPP believes existing and proposed U.S. policies controlling cryptography should be
based on the following security principles: 
<ol>
<li>Users have the need, right, and responsibility to determine the type and strength of security
required; 
<li>Governments should not impose unilateral controls on trade in commercial security
technology;
<li>Multilateral controls must cover all major sources of commercial security solutions
world-wide; 
<li>Commercial security solutions should be treated as commercial products under the
Department of Commerce export controls; 
<li>The availability of cryptography should not be regulated according to technology levels; 
<li>No regulatory distinctions should be made between hardware and software security solutions;
<li>Industry should be responsible for developing standards for commercial security solutions; 
<li>Actions permitted under the existing U.S. law should be exhausted before creating new laws
to address issues of government access; 
<li>There should continue to be no controls on domestic use of cryptography; and
<li>Export controls should not be used to impose controls indirectly on domestic availability of
cryptographic products.</ol>

Given the present market realities and government needs, CSPP recommends the
following  first steps to promote the legitimate use of security by individuals and companies
and to address the U.S. government's intelligence gathering and law enforcement
interests:
<ol>
<li>Link the decontrol of U.S. commercial cryptographic products to the availability of
competitive products in the international marketplace;
<li>Permit the export of stronger U.S. commercial cryptographic products, withouttechnology
restrictions, to legitimate, commercial end users;
<li>Discuss the export of stronger U.S. commercial cryptographic products that meet reasonable
government access needs; and
<li>Embargo U.S. commercial cryptographic products in  terrorist countries.</ul>

<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3>

The GII offers new economic and educational opportunities to the corporate giants of Wall
Street,  small businesses and cottage industries of Main Street and individual residents
of Maple Street. It  allows companies to communicate more easily with regionally dispersed
departments and with increasing numbers of suppliers, partners, and customers around
the globe.  It is a cost-effective option for electronic commerce, opening new markets and
reducing the cost of doing business.  Companies that do not take advantage of the GII will
lose their competitive edge in the 21st century.<p>

The very aspects of the GII that make it so attractive as a tool for communications and
commerce -- its openness and breadth -- also create risks to the confidentiality, integrity,
and authenticity of data transmitted over the GII or stored in facilities attached to the GII. 
Unless users are assured that they can adequately secure their valuable information, the
GII will not realize its full economic, educational, and scientific benefits.  Companies that
are not permitted to supply secure solutions to users will forfeit enormous commercial,
economic, technological, and indeed global security leadership opportunities.<p>

CSPP's February 1995 report Perspectives on the Global Information Infrastructure
specified security as one of five substantive priorities that governments and the private
sector must address to ensure that the GII reaches its potential as a viable, cost-effective
tool. <p>

Perspectives on Security in the Information Age reviews the security issues that could
hobble development of the GII and  recommends changes to current and proposed U.S.
export policies to allow individuals and companies to protect their electronic information,
transactions, and communications worldwide.  This report establishes security principles
by which U.S. policies should be measured.  It concludes with recommended policy
changes that are in keeping with these principles.<p>

<hr align=center width=25%>

<a name="concept"><h3>The Concept of Cyberproperty</h3>

Electronic data in digital form -- or cyberproperty -- is emerging as the most valuable
currency of the Information Age.  We are on the verge of an explosion in the volume of
information being exchanged among individuals and companies via the GII.  Increasingly
this information is confidential and highly valuable.  Thus the files and messages that are
created in computers, stored on disks, and sent over communications links are becoming
more valuable than the computers, disks and network lines over which they travel.<p>

<a name="concept2"><h4>Cyberproperty at Risk</h4>

A decade ago breaking into a computer system was viewed more as a prank than as an
act with possibly dire consequences.  Laws against unauthorized access or hacking were
scarce.  Today most observers consider hacking a serious crime because once inside a
computer system, hackers can open "file cabinets" and read electronic files; pilfer, change
or delete information; and even steal documents.  Cyberproperty that is completely
unprotected, or "naked," in the GII is exposed to such unauthorized and unwanted access.<p>

Unprotected cyberproperty faces various types and degrees of exposure, just as tangible
property faces a range of threats from vandalism and theft to organized crime and
terrorism.   An individual hacker or credit fraud artist wreaks a different kind of havoc than
do well-financed criminal organizations, industrial spies or international terrorists seeking
to paralyze systems and infrastructure.  Unless effective security measures are
implemented, the potential exposure to global users is projected to reach between $320
billion and $640 billion by 2000.<br>

     </TD>                                
<TR> 
     <TD>
<strong>Telemedicine and Privacy:</strong> The GII equalizes the disparity between developed
and underdeveloped countries by allowing individuals in underdeveloped areas access to
specialized medical expertise found only in developed nations.  However, if these medical
records are transmitted unprotected from a doctor's office to a hospital, individuals can be
exposed to violations of privacy rights and of the confidentiality between a doctor and patient.
Records tampered with by a vandal could result in a potentially disastrous mis-diagnosis and
dangerous treatment.<p>
                                
<strong>Engineering Designs and Industrial Espionage:</strong>  With the GII, companies can
more easily collaborate in strategic joint ventures for a particular product.  New designs
transmitted unprotected from a firm in one country to a firm in another country are subject to
industrial espionage, alterations in design, or outright theft.<p>
                                
<strong>Individuals and Electronic Commerce:</strong> Electronic commerce offers individuals
and companies alike new ways of doing business and reaching new markets.  However, simple
connections to open networks expose credit card information, as well as home computer files like
household spreadsheets, to outside access.<p>
                                
<strong>Small Companies in the GII:</strong>The GII offers new opportunities for small
companies to explore international markets.  Like their large counterparts, small companies
making a proposal to a prospective customer cannot afford to expose bid specifications and
amounts to global competitors. <p>

</TABLE>                 
              
<a name="concept3"><h4>The Right to Protect Cyberproperty </h4>
                                
The ownership of tangible property, such as manufactured goods, confers on individuals
and companies the right and responsibility to control its use.   Custodians, such as doctors
responsibile for patients' files,  have the responsibility to safeguard the property entrusted
to their care.  Owners and custodians can choose the level of protection that best meets
their security needs, based on the threat to and value of their property.  They may choose
from a variety of security tools, including locks, alarms, and armed guards.<p>
                                
Similarly, business, individual, and custodial owners of intangible cyberproperty have the
right and responsibility to protect it as it travels through or is stored in the GII.  They also
have the right to determine the level of security required to safeguard  their cyberproperty,
and they can make that choice from among a number of security tools available today. <p>
                                
One way to think about the strength of available security solutions is to consider the
options for sending a letter.  Individuals, businesses, and governments secure information
being transmitted through the worldwide postal system with envelopes.  If greater security
is desired, envelopes can be sent certified, return receipt required or by courier.  Just as
increased levels of security are needed for the documents transmitted by mail, so
increased levels of security are needed for the documents and other data transmitted
through the GII. <p>
                                
<a name="concept4"><h4>The Tools to Protect Cyberproperty</h4>
                                
No one government, corporation or person controls the GII, which spans more than 100
countries and has millions of users connected to it. As a result, the GII cannot be secured,
so individual pieces of cyberproperty must be protected.  Means of protection to specific
networks such as firewalls, secure tokens and tamper-resistant modules cannot protect
messages and data being transmitted through the GII.  While large companies have been
able to protect cyberproperty through private, leased lines, the escalating cost and lack
of flexibility to connect to anyone, anywhere makes continuing this practice ineffective and
expensive. That leaves encryption as the best method for safeguarding cyberproperty
traveling on the GII.<br>
<br>                                
<TABLE Border>
<TR>
     <TD align=center><font size=+2>What Is Encryption?</font></TD>
<TR>
     <TD>
Encryption is a tool that individuals and companies can use to secure cyberproperty on the GII
from intrusion and theft much the same way a padlock protects property in a locker. 
Cryptography is the science of encrypting and decrypting data. <p>
                                
While a padlock employs only three or four tumblers, computers have the potential to employ
many more numbers as part of their combinations.   If a padlock has three tumblers, each with
10 digits, there are 1,000 possible combinations that a thief might have to try to open the lock --
at least several hours of manual labor.  A computerized cyberlock with as many as five
"tumblers," would take a thief with access to an off-the-shelf PC on several seconds to try all
100,000 possible combinations.  Clearly, a cyberlock with more tumblers is needed to protect
cyberproperty on the GII.  Encryption is available in both hardware and software forms and at
differing levels of strength.<p>

Whether they use a cyberlock or a padlock, the right and responsibility to secure the individual
property rests with the property owner.<p>

<a name="security"><h3>Competitiveness and the Demand for Security in the GII</h3>

As businesses rely on the opportunities afforded them by the GII, confidential and
sensitive data must be protected from vandals, thieves, industrial spies and terrorists. 
Because of the increased number of linked networks and reduced costs of computing,
escalating demand for stronger security solutions is inevitable.  Already, growing reliance
on transmitting purchase orders and credit card numbers over phone lines and open
computer networks has created a demand for appropriate security measures.  Security for
businesses joined in strategic alliances, such as joint ventures, is especially critical when
companies share confidential information over networked computer systems. <p>

The demand for cryptographic-based security solutions is diverse and dependent upon a
variety of factors, such as sensitivity of the data, value of the data, security costs,
performance requirements, and implementation methods.  There is no "one-size-fits-all"
encryption solution.<p>

<a name="security1"><h4>Demand for More and Stronger Security </h4>

CSPP's Emerging Security Needs and U.S. Competitiveness:  Impact of Export Controls
on Cryptographic Technology found that businesses in industries such as financial
services, telecommunications/wireless, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals need strong
security solutions to protect financial transactions and valuable research.<p>

The study also found that companies currently using security solutions are highly sensitive
to the increasing vulnerability of their systems to outside penetration, which can result in
direct financial losses and privacy invasions.  For example, a large multi-national
corporation was forced to shut down its computers for 72 hours to assess the damage from
someone infiltrating its Internet link.  In another instance, a large communications company
suffered a substantial financial loss when 100,000 stolen calling card numbers were used
to place $50 million worth of fraudulent calls.  When a competitor stole its unprotected
files, a U.S.-based manufacturer lost a $350 million contract that would have employed
more than 3,000 workers.<p>

Recently, a French student broke the strongest encryption that can be readily exported
from the U.S. for general GII applications.  By simply using computers to test every
possible combination to decode the message, the student cracked the code in eight days. 
The effort cost an estimated $10,000 in processing costs.   As the cost of computing goes
down, vulnerability in the GII will go up. <p>

Even strong encryption used today by the federal government and the financial services
industry may not be adequate to secure data in a few years.  This year the American
Banking Association recommends using triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) -- virtually
unbreakable encryption -- to safeguard financial data.  And forecasters believe the federal
government is unlikely to recertify DES as its federal standard because it won't be strong
enough by 1998.<p>

<a name="security2"><h4>Demand for Global Security Solutions </h4>

Security solutions that emerge over the coming years will have to be global in nature. 
Competition is driving more businesses to rely on international suppliers, partners and
customers.  Likewise, the GII recognizes no political or geographic boundaries.  Therefore,
international electronic commerce will require universally trusted security solutions. 
Computer systems manufacturers must be able to produce global solutions that also meet
universal export requirements.

<li>All participating countries must adopt standards to support security mechanisms that are
acceptable to the private sector and suitable to commercial transactions.  These standards must
also ensure privacy and authentication.  This may require nations to adopt commercial security
solutions that are different and separate from solutions for national security and diplomatic
purposes.

<li>The U.S. government must cooperate with industry to resolve U.S. policy concerns that have
blocked acceptance of international encryption mechanisms necessary for commercial
transactions.  

<li>The private sector and government should convene a joint international conference to address
the need for security mechanisms to support commercial applications and to develop a strategy
for implementing acceptable security solutions.

<a name="security3"><h4>Global Competition and the Inevitability of Supply</h4>

There are more than 300 companies that develop and export cryptographic products from
the U.S. and more than 355 companies that provide similar products outside the U.S. 
However, U.S-based providers of cryptography can only sell their most effective security
solutions within the U.S.<p>

While U.S. information systems companies derive more than 50 percent of their revenue
from overseas, they also are restricted from exporting strong security solutions, except in
the case of related companies.  Moreover, they are barred from producing the integrated
information systems, complete with a range of security options, that customers worldwide
are demanding.   Further, they are prohibited from exporting pluggable systems, where no
cryptology is exported, but explicit interfaces are provided to allow users to "plug in" a
locally available solution.<p>

Given these constraints, non-U.S. competitors offering integrated, interoperable, market-driven
information systems will attract sales not only from foreign firms, but also from U.S.
companies.  Japanese and German firms are working on integrated information systems
products that will have encryption embedded in the system.   Other producers are racing
to fill the void left by U.S. firms to supply the worldwide demand for global security
solutions.  They will leverage this opportunity to gain market share in other segments of
the information technology industry, including computer systems sales where U.S.
companies currently have the lead.  This will erode U.S. market share in total systems
sales and undermine U.S. jobs and technological leadership.  This could expose $30
billion to $60 billion of the U.S. information industry's annual revenues by the year 2000.<p>

<hr align=center width=25%>

<a name="issues"><h3>Issues of Government Control and Access </h3>

While individuals and industry have a compelling interest in protecting their cyberproperty,
the government has an interest in gathering intelligence and enforcing the law.  In addition
to lawful wiretaps and searches, the government meets its security objectives by
clandestinely intercepting information traveling on the GII among criminals and terrorists.<p>

The government is concerned that the spread of global security solutions may adversely
affect its law enforcement and international intelligence gathering responsibilities.  This
concern ignores the fact that strong security solutions are already available in the
international marketplace to legitimate users and terrorist and criminal elements alike. 
Given this reality,  government  efforts to prevent the global spread of security technology
are doomed to fail.<p>

<a name="issues1"><h4>Enforcing the Law and Gathering International Intelligence </h4>

Domestic development and use of encryption by individuals and companies have never
been controlled within the U.S.  However, the U.S. government has begun to argue for
broader authority to carry out law enforcement activities, such as wire-tapping.  Law
enforcement officials say they are concerned that the spread of very strong encryption
would obstruct their ability to monitor communications and access electronic files.   CSPP
believes existing methods to obtain information, such as search warrants, surveillance and
other types of intelligence gathering resources available under current law, should be
sufficient to address this concern.<p>

<a name="issues2"><h4>Recovery of Stored Data</h4>

Today, companies that encrypt data usually hold copies of their keys within the company
to safeguard against losses, mishaps, disgruntled employees, or other contingencies.  This
practice is known as key retention or self escrow.  While companies usually do not ask
third parties to hold copies of their keys, key escrow systems might provide a useful data
recovery feature for some commercial customers who desire strong encryption but are
concerned about losing their keys.<p>
<br>

<TABLE border>
<TR>
     <TD align=center><font size=+2>What Are Crypto Keys?</font>
     </TD>
<TR>
     <TD>
Anyone who has used a padlock knows that it is necessary to keep a copy of the combination
stored safely away from the lock in case the original series of numbers is lost or forgotten. 
Crypto keys are like the combination to that padlock.  Copies are routinely made as backup
for accessing data secured with encryption in the eventuality that the encryption key cannot
be found. <p>
                                
A backup key for cyberproperty is even more important than one for physical property, because in
the GII there is no option to force entry.   Household tools can break open a padlock.  There are
no equivalent tools in cyberspace.<p>
                                
The concept of key escrow requires that backup keys be held by a third party or parties. 
Third parties could be private, commercial key holders or public, government key holders.<p>
     </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<br>
<br>
<a name="issues3"><h4>The Administration Proposes Mandatory Key Escrow for Exports</h4>
                                
To access encrypted data, the Administration is pursuing a mandatory key escrow solution for
export of commercially available encryption.  Under a generic key escrow scenario, a copy of the
key used to encrypt or decrypt a message would be held in escrow by a third party approved by
the U.S. government.  The government would be able to access the escrowed key and encrypted
data only after meeting certain requirements, such as obtaining a search warrant.  In theory, the
strength of encryption would be irrelevant because the government would have access to an
authorized key to decrypt data.<p>
                                
While it is the responsibility of the  government to enforce the law and gather international
intelligence, a key escrow system is but one method to achieve those objectives. Not everybody
agrees that individuals and companies must provide the federal government with authorized keys
to their encrypted cyberproperty.<p>
                                
The discussion between users of cryptographic products, industry, and the  government is
whether 1) making backup keys to encrypted data is mandatory or voluntary,  2) backup keys
must be held by third parties, in escrow, and 3) such third-party systems will be commercially
viable.<p>
                                
Some individuals and companies may not be concerned about purchasing a product that
has keys in escrow available for authorized government use.  However, others will demand
availability of products without key escrow features and will look to non-U.S. vendors for
these solutions.  Independent of government policy concerns, the complexity, expense,
and potential abuses of a key escrow approach may make it unworkable or commercially
unacceptable to many users worldwide.<p>
                                
Government access to encrypted data may be required to enforce the law or gather
international intelligence, if potential uses of encryption are deemed to be a substantial
risk.  In developing the cryptographic products for these uses, voluntary, industry-led
standards should prevail over government-mandated, design-based solutions. 
Government, working closely with industry, should develop reasonable and achievable
objectives for government access.  This will allow industry groups to craft standards and
designs that meet government requirements for access to encrypted communications and
files using the strongest cryptographic techniques. <p>

<a name="export"><h3>Consequences of U.S. Export Policies</h3>
                                
While demand for security products is growing, U.S. export policies on cryptography
remain frozen in the assumptions of the 1950s.  The State Department, for example,
controls not only the export of hardware products that encrypt data for transmission or
storage, but also the export of encryption software, as munitions -- items that are deemed
"inherently military in character."<p>
                                
Such government controls of strong encryption for export are antithetical to the needs of
individuals and companies to protect their cyberproperty in the age of the GII.<p>
                                
Informal inter-governmental agreements and national laws that allow for exceptions to U.S.
policy regulating export of encryption products exist, but their interpretation and
enforcement varies country by country.  Over time, the U.S.'s restrictive interpretation and
practice threaten to drive sales, technologies, and jobs to non-U.S. competitors.<p>
                                
Current export policies controlling the availability of U.S. security products threaten to
harm not just critical industries such as banking, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, and
petrochemical, but also the computer industry by restricting sales.  These industries and
others are driving the demand for strong security, and non-U.S. vendors are providing
solutions.  If current U.S. export policies remain unchanged, information systems sales and
technologies will erode, and jobs may be jeopardized.  In addition, the architecture of the
predominant security products will be controlled by those countries that do not impose
strict controls.  Ironically, U.S. export policies, created to protect  national security, are
likely to have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and ability of the U.S. to gather
intelligence and enforce the law.<p>
                                
Current U.S. policies may:
<ul type=square>
<li>Restrict the development and availability of security solutions provided by U.S. firms. 
The need and demand for global security solutions are growing, but current export policies
restrict the availability of U.S. products abroad.  With substantial revenues generated overseas,
U.S. firms cannot afford to develop security solutions that cannot be exported or will be
unacceptable to customers.  This will retard the development in the U.S. of future security and
other information technologies;<p>
                                
<li>Allow non-U.S. competitors to develop and provide global security solutions.  The need for
cryptography to protect data in the GII, together with the declining cost of cryptographic
technologies, will outstrip the efforts of the federal government to control development and
availability.  As a result, non-U.S. competitors will supply cryptographic products.  Individuals
and companies unwilling to be exposed in the GII will purchase non-U.S. security solutions;<p>
                                
<li>Drive future computer sales to firms that can provide strong security solutions.  U.S. firms
must sell computer systems outside the U.S. without strong cryptography.  To protect
cyberproperty, individuals and companies abroad must purchase strong encryption devices
separately and bolt them on to their computer systems. Bolt-on security solutions are expensive
and clumsy.  Customers prefer integrated computer systems -- complete with security solutions. 
As non-U.S. firms provide integrated systems, the U.S. will lose market share not only for the

over new the security solutions.

<a name="proposal"><h3>CSPP Proposed Security Principles</h3>
                                
CSPP has developed security principles on which existing and proposed U.S. policies
controlling the availability and use of cryptography should be based.
<ol> 
<li><em>Users have the right, responsibility, and need to determine the type and strength of
protection required.</em>  The absence of a centralized security system in the GII requires
individuals and companies to bear the primary responsibility for their own security.  Global
commercial security solutions are essential if individuals and companies are to protect their
cyberproperty from vandals or thieves.  Users have the right and responsibility to determine the
level of protection required, based on an assessment of a number of factors, including cost, value
of cyberproperty, performance, and risk of penetration into files or communications. <p>
                                
<li><em>Governments should not impose unilateral controls on trade in commercial security
technology.</em>  Unilateral controls are viable only if one source of cryptography exists. Since
cryptography is available worldwide, unilateral controls will not prevent the availability and use of
those products.  <p>
                                
<li><em>Multilateral controls must cover all major sources of commercial security solutions
world-wide.</em>  Multilateral controls are effective only to the extent that all major sources of
commercial security solutions are subject to uniform controls and uniform enforcement.  <p>
                                
<li><em>Commercial security solutions should be treated as commercial products under the
Department of Commerce export controls.</em>  The military is no longer the predominant user
of cryptographic technologies.  As demand and need for stronger commercial security solutions
grow, cryptography should be treated as a commercial product.  <p>
                                
<li><em>Availability of cryptography should not be controlled by technology levels.</em> 
Technology advances will continue to drive the demand for stronger encryption. Export controls
that are tied to technology levels require regular updating, and often lag far behind technology and
commercial need.  Factors such as legitimate commercial use or risk of diversion should help
determine whether controls are necessary.<p>
                                
<li><em>No regulatory distinctions should be made between hardware and software security
solutions.</em> The ultimate result of cryptography is the same, whether the encryption occurs in
hardware or software.<p>
                                
<li><em>Industry has the responsibility to develop standards for commercial security
solutions.</em> Standards for encryption products should be voluntary and industry-led. 
Government-set product design standards stifle innovation and foster customer mistrust in
products built to these design standards.  However, government has a role in working with
industry standards groups to develop mutually agreeable objectives that are both reasonable and
achievable.  Industry standards groups can then develop product standards that factor in these
objectives and meet the need for commercially viable products.  <p>
                                
<li><em>Actions permitted under the existing U.S. legal framework should be exhausted before
creating new laws to address issues of government access.</em>  Before creating new laws to
guarantee access to private communications, the U.S. government should demonstrate clearly that
available courses of action are inadequate.<p>
                                
<li><em>Domestic use of cryptography should continue to be unrestricted.</em> The desire to
withhold cryptographic technologies from a small percentage of users should not proscribe
domestic availability of cryptographic products. <p>
                                 
<li><em>Export controls should not be used to impose controls indirectly on domestic availability
of cryptographic products.</em> oExport controls should be targeted explicitly at international
transactions and should contain no restrictions that would result in controlling the domestic use of
cryptography products.  
</ol>

<a name="recommend"><h3>CSPP Policy Recommendations -- Constructive First Steps </h3>
                                
CSPP recommends that any long-term encryption policy incorporate all 10 security principles
listed above.  CSPP proposed security principles will serve as the basis for our own assessment of
current and future U.S. policies which control the use and availability of cryptographic
technologies.<p>
                                
Given the present market  realities and government needs, CSPP recommends several
first steps to promote the legitimate use of security by individuals and companies in the GII
and to address the federal government's intelligence gathering and law enforcement
interests.  Consistent with our security principles, CSPP recommends the following, initial
four-pronged approach to controlling the export of U.S. cryptography products:                            

<ol>   
<li><em>Link the decontrol of U.S. commercial cryptographic products to the availability of
competitive products in the international marketplace.</em>  The U.S. government already
acknowledges that lower encryption strengths do not present special threats to national security. 
For example, 40-bit encryption is not controlled for export as a munitions item today.  However,
stronger encryption cannot be exported from the U.S. without special licenses or exemptions,
even though it is available for sale in markets globally.  DES-based,  RC4-based, and RSA-based
products fall within this category. <p>
                                
Today, companies that encrypt data usually hold copies of their keys within the company to
safeguard against losses, mishaps, disgruntled employees, or other contingencies.  This practice is
known as key retention or self escrow.  While companies usually do not ask third parties to hold
copies of their keys, key escrow systems might provide a useful data recovery feature for some
commercial customers who desire strong encryption but are concerned about losing their
keys.<p>
                                
To the extent that comparable cryptographic products are available world-wide from uncontrolled
sources, attempts to control the spread of encryption are futile and harmful economically. <p>
                                
<li><em>Permit export of stronger U.S. commercial cryptographic products, without technology
restrictions, for legitimate commercial end users, unless the government clearly demonstrates a
risk.</em>  Today, banks, financial institutions, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms, and
governments that have encryption control agreements with the U.S. can receive strong U.S.
cryptographic products -- without government access requirements -- to satisfy special needs. 
CSPP recommends that other customers be considered in this category, for example, medical
institutions transmitting patients' records or large, trusted enterprises that need to protect vital
trade secrets.<p>
                                
Governments should assume it will approve export licenses for stronger cryptography, unless it
finds an unacceptable degree of risk.  The government interest in controlling the export of U.S.
cryptographic products is outweighed by the need for users to secure their cyberproperty from
large scale theft, fraud, tampering, or espionage in the GII.<p>
                                
<li><em>Discuss the export of stronger U.S. commercial cryptographic products that meet
reasonable government access needs.</em>  For customers who desire stronger  cryptography
products, but do not fall within the scope of Recommendation 2, above, CSPP recommends that
industry lead the effort to develop product standards.  Governments would discuss with industry
reasonable and achievable objectives to access encrypted data.  An industry-led group would then
develop product standards, including interoperability, which would factor-in the government's
objectives.<p>
                                
CSPP believes that only industry has the capability to design and produce a  commercial
cryptographic product that satisfies both customer and government needs.  This step could
include key escrow requirements but would not exclude other technology solutions.  Products
meeting these standards would be eligible for export.  <p>
                                
<li><em>Embargo U.S. commercial cryptographic products in terrorist countries.</em>  CSPP
supports the government's overriding national security interest in restricting the availability of
U.S. cryptographic products to terrorist countries.   
</ol>
                                
<hr align=center width=25%>

<a name="conclude"><h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                
The GII offers individuals, businesses, and governments, alike, unprecedented opportunities to
communicate, interact, and conduct business world-wide.  The promise of the Information Age
can be realized only if individuals and companies can adequately protect their cyberproperty
against risks inherent in the GII.  With or without U.S. government intervention in the security
aspects of the GII, encryption needs of GII users will inevitably be met by better cryptographic
products.<p>
                                
The growing demand for global security solutions contrasts sharply with current U.S. policies that
restrict the availability of U.S. solutions in international markets.  CSPP recommends the 
government and industry develop a national encryption policy together and take necessary steps
to help safeguard the future competitiveness of critical industries. <p>
                                
The GII will develop in one form or another.  Its benefit  in large part will be determined by
that form.  Individual users, the private sector, and the government must work together to
resolve critical security issues to realize fully the advantages of the Information Age. <p>

<hr align=center width=25%>
                                
<a name="append"><h3>Appendices</h3>
                                
<h4>Security issues raised in the GII.</h4>
<ul type=square>                                
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong>  the ability to protect information against the threat of
modification by unauthorized users.  This includes the ability to certify that information or data
was not modified or was legitimately modified during communication or in storage.<p>
                                
<li><strong>Access Control:</strong>  the ability for users and operators to precisely control
who accesses which resources. This also includes control of what level of access is allowed. <p>
                                  
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong>  the process of verifying an identity or credential, to ensure you are
who you say you are and the message has not been altered in transit.<p>
                                
<li><strong>Nonrepudiation or Accountability:</strong>  the ability to prevent communicating
parties in the network from denying that they sent or received given messages or engaged in
particular network activities.  <p>
                                
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong>  the ability to restrict access to authorized users only and
protect information against the threat of disclosure to or theft by unauthorized users.<p>
                                
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong>  the ability to ensure that personal and unrelated information are
not unnecessarily disclosed.
</ul>                                

<h4>Security tools</h4>

Several security tools are available and are used to safeguard electronic data.  Because
the GII is controlled by no one nation, corporation, or person, and millions of users are
connected presently in over 100 countries, encryption is the only cost effective means for
securing data.
<ul type=square>
<li><strong>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</strong>.  DES is a federal encryption standard
used in protecting unclassified computer data and communications.  DES uses a secret key
algorithm whereby the sending and receiving parties must know the secret key they will use to
communicate.<p>

<li><strong>Triple DES.</strong>  The use of three separate passes of information through the
DES algorithm increasing the strength from 56 bits to 168 bits.<p>

<li><strong>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)</strong> public/private key cryptography.  Two
keys, one public and one private, which are mathematically related so that anything locked with
one key can be unlocked only by the other key.  <p>

<li><strong>Digital Signature Standard (DSS).</strong> DSS is a way to generate and verify
digital signatures. <p>

<li><strong>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).</strong> PGP is a key management system available on
the Internet.<p>

<li><strong>Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES).</strong>  EES or "Clipper" is a key escrow
encryption product for federal departments and agencies and their contractors to protect
unclassified information and to encrypt voice, facsimile, and computer data communicated in a
telephone system.  It may be used to replace DES encryption devices now in use by federal
agencies and contractors.<p>

<li><strong>Fire walls.</strong>  A means of protecting a computer from an outside network,
often implemented as a dedicated computer that examines and restricts incoming and outgoing
communications, protecting an organization's network from outside intrusions and inside
disclosures.<p>
    
<li><strong>Secure tokens.</strong>  Tokens are physical devices used to identify users. Secure
tokens, such as Smart Cards that have a computer chip embedded in a credit card, PCMCIA
cards, or solid state floppies and can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, and are built with
some degree of tamper-resistance.   <p>

<li><strong>Tamper-resistant modules.</strong>  These are sealed boxes which are hard to open,
requiring extensive probing and usually leaving evidence that tampering has occurred.  Hardened
modules, a variant, are sealed units that cannot be opened without destroying their contents.   <p>

<li><strong>Private leased lines and networks.</strong>  Dedicated point to point connections
that secure communications and information and are used usually within large organizations.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

To be truly useful, the National Information Infrastructure (NII) will require a high level of
interoperability at a number of critical NII interfaces.  Industry has made significant progress
over the last several years in improving the interoperability of many of the important interfaces
in the evolving NII.  In this paper, the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) describes some
of the computer industry's efforts to improve the interoperability of one subset of those
interfaces -- the exchange of information-rich documents -- and proposes an industry-led
strategy to further improve the interoperability of such documents. <p>

Some degree of interoperability already exists across computing platforms and NII applications. 
Most systems on the market today, and the majority in current use, are capable of performing
a number of basic functions, including exchanging and transporting data between different
devices on different networks, using widely available media, such as discs, modems, and local
area networks.  With these tools, almost every system in use today can save a text-based
document in a standard word processing format, move it to another system by floppy disc,
modem, local or wide-area network, and display it or print it without loss of meaningful
information.  Via the Internet, commercial on-line services, and networks, users can exchange
documents and conduct transactions over a variety of heterogeneous networked systems. 
Additional improvements in interoperability -- beyond today's capabilities -- would allow users
to easily, ubiquitously, and smoothly exchange and interact with data-rich documents that
include graphics (including 3D and color), video, and audio. <p>

The computer and software industries, driven by market forces and user demands, are
developing the tools needed for greater document interoperability through a variety of
voluntary, formal, informal, and ad hoc efforts.  A range of new and improved products, such as
Mosaic, CORBA, OpenDoc, Acrobat, OLE, MIME, and others, are now available to meet users'
differing needs for exchanging and interacting with various types of complex documents.<p>

<strong>Recommendations for Industry Action:</strong>  Further improvement in the interoperability of complex documents can be achieved, without reducing consumer choice or removing the incentive to innovate and compete, if the computer industry, in conjunction with the broader information technology and software industries, undertakes the following action agenda:
<ol>
<li>Participating in standards bodies to define standards for self-describing formats for data interchange and mechanisms to translate information from one format to another. <p>

<li>Urging appropriate standards bodies to adopt standards for software interoperability at higher levels than current networking protocols.  This will allow user applications to interact with distant systems while enabling a confederation, not a commoditization, of diverse, innovative and competitive systems.  Any such standards should possess the following characteristics:
<ol type="a">
<li>encapsulate the richest possible structure for capturing the contents of complex documents;<p>

<li>allow users to build and exchange the richest possible documents, but it must also be scalable, so that lower performance clients are not excluded; and<p>

<li>define a self-describing format for data interchange and provide mechanisms to translate information into and out of required formats.</ol>
<br>
<li>Considering implementing a multi-industry interoperability testbed facility to test potential solutions.<p>

<li>Continuing to advance technologies needed for enabling NII architectures, including:
<ul>
<li>infrastructure that works everywhere
<li>scalability
<li>full interconnection and interoperability technologies
<li>technologies to achieve commercial levels of security
<li>robustness/ability to recover after failure</ul></ol>

<strong>Recommendations for Government Support:</strong>  It is essential that NII interoperability continue to be achieved through the voluntary, industry-driven standards process.  That process affords industry the flexibility it needs to update and change products and guarantees
consumers a wide choice of innovative, useful products.  Government-mandated standards or
levels of interoperability, on the other hand, would inhibit innovation by removing the market
incentive to improve.  The federal government can support private sector interoperability
efforts by:
<ol>
<li>Participating in the industry-led, voluntary standards process. <p>

<li>Representing U.S. industry's positions in international standards fora where the U.S. government is the nation's representative and supporting industry's agenda in other international standards bodies.<p>

<li>Using government procurements to accelerate the adoption of industry-developed NII interoperability standards.<p>

<li>Continuing to fund precommercial R&D, including precommercial testbeds, needed to support standards development and interoperability.<p>

<li>Providing policy leadership where needed to ensure fair competition, protection of privacy, adoption of workable security and authentication solutions.<p>

<li>Championing a vision of industry-led interoperability at critical NII interfaces.
</ol>

<a name="intro"><h4>Introduction</h4>

The National Information Infrastructure (NII) is creating unprecedented opportunities for
people in a variety of situations and settings -- from offices to homes, schools, hospitals, and
even while traveling -- to access and exchange all types of information and interact with others
across interconnected, interoperable networks.  These new opportunities and applications will
require a high level of interoperability at a number of critical NII interfaces.  In "Perspectives on
the NII:  Ensuring Interoperability," (February, 1994) the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) identified four categories of NII interfaces -- of the many that will exist -- for which
interoperability is essential to facilitate the use of different information appliances, applications,
communications networks, and information resources.  A list of the interface categories is
provided in <a href="#appen_a">Appendix A.</a><p>

This paper:  1) describes current computer industry activities to improve the interoperability of
one subset of the many important interfaces in the evolving NII --those that allow users to
exchange and interact with information-rich documents; and 2) proposes an industry strategy
to further improve the interoperability of standards for exchanging information-rich
documents.  While solving the information-rich document exchange challenge is critical to the
NII's success, many other interoperability challenges exist.  CSPP encourages other industries
with a stake in the NII to examine whether similar steps can be taken to improve the
interoperability of critical interfaces that fall within their purview.<p>

<hr align=left width=25%>
<a name="import"><h4>The Importance of Interoperability</h4>

In the NII, users will need to be able to share, transmit, and interact with complex documents
and conduct many types of transactions, regardless of differences in the software or hardware
they use, or on which platforms an application resides.  For example, doctors collaborating
over telemedicine links will need to see and manipulate medical charts and images just as they
could if the charts were on paper.  School teachers and their students will want to be able to
view and interact with multimedia educational materials and books from distant libraries that
look like the texts or movies they use in the classrooms.  Office workers will need to be able
to exchange and work with spreadsheets, charts, and reports among distant offices.  Users at
home will access and use on-line government forms, newspaper and magazine articles, play
video games, and select and pay for goods and services on-line. <p>

These NII applications all depend on users being able to easily and conveniently exchange and
use complex documents that are rich in information.  The adoption of standards for
interoperable document formats will greatly facilitate these types of activities.  Document and
data interoperability is typically thought of in terms of accessing remote information, but the
same interoperability requirements apply to modifying remote information via transaction
processing.  As the NII evolves, many types of activities -- from banking to ordering and paying
for goods and services -- will be conducted on line.  These types of transactions will require
accurate interactions with large numbers of dispersed databases and information repositories. 
With each interaction, information will be retrieved, modified, updated, and/or reviewed.  The
ease and accuracy of these types of transactions can be improved by the adoption of
widely-used standards for on-line transaction processing.  The interoperability requirements
for transaction processing are as important to the evolution of the NII as for complex
documents. <p>

As the NII evolves, people will use information appliances -- including computers (from
supercomputers to laptops), televisions, telephones, and personal communicators -- to access,
retrieve, store, create, transmit, and manipulate information of all types, in many different
formats.  Information appliances and applications for the NII are being developed, built, and
sold by many different vendors, using a variety of technologies.  A huge repository of installed
appliances, programs, and applications already exists in homes, schools, and businesses. 
Interoperability allows these diverse applications, devices, and systems to communicate with
each other.  In particular, interoperable document input and output formats will allow
recipients of information-rich documents to display the information, manipulate it, and print it
in the same form as it was created. <p>

<hr align=left width=25%>
<a name="efforts"><h4>Efforts to Improve Document Interoperability</h4>

As the NII evolves, people and businesses are increasingly using electronic formats, rather than
print, to capture and exchange documents of all types.  In the print world, exchanging a paper
document is a simple matter of printing or copying the document, and sending it by mail or
facsimile.  With these methods, the recipient receives a document that looks exactly like the
one that was sent.  Exchanging plain-text electronic documents is also relatively easy -- the
documents can be converted to ASCII and sent across a variety of communications networks. 
However, the electronic document received does not always look exactly the same as what
was sent because ASCII is not capable of handling formatting information, such as fonts, page
numbers, underlining, bolding, and other information about the document's appearance.  And,
since ASCII can only handle plain text documents, graphic, video, and audio information cannot
be sent.<p>

As technologies advance, users are increasingly able to create and store more complex forms
of documents, sometimes called "information rich" or "compound" documents, which include
images, video, audio, and graphics along with text.  These documents may also incorporate new
kinds of information in one part of the document that is "linked" with information in other
parts of the document or to other documents altogether.  Emerging NII applications will
require that users be able to exchange and interact with these types of complex documents.  <p>

At present, however, a lack of interoperability makes the exchange of these types of complex
electronic documents difficult.  In general, software applications create documents with unique
and non-interoperable characteristics.  Word processors, for example, typically create and
process documents that have specified formats which cannot be processed by other word
processors without special converter technologies.  Computer platform differences, which
often use incompatible applications and file formats, add a complicating factor to the exchange
of electronic documents.  Thus, people who want to exchange information-rich documents
electronically generally must communicate with each other to ascertain that they have the
appropriate software to accept and read the message being transferred. <p>

The computer and software industries, driven by market forces and user demands, are
continuing to develop the tools needed for greater document interoperability through a variety
of voluntary, formal, informal, and ad hoc efforts.  A few examples include methods for
exchanging formatted text (i.e., PostScript), images (i.e., GIF and JPEG), video (i.e., MPEG), and
hypertext links (i.e., HTML).  A range of new and improved products are now available to meet
users' differing needs for exchanging documents, including, for example:  Mosaic, a graphic
interface to the World Wide Web which allows users to access and view text, pictures, audio
and video files on their screens; the Object Management Group's Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (CORBA), which allows communication between different vendors'
software over any hardware; OpenDoc, a new open software technology that is being
developed by one multi-vendor team to allow complex information to be shared freely among
different applications and different platforms; Acrobat, a technology that handles multiple
document printing formats in a final-form environment; OLE, a Windows protocol for
referencing and including external objects in compound documents; and Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extension (MIME), which allows the exchange of multimedia electronic mail through the
Internet.<p>

The computer and software industries are making progress in developing structural markup
languages, such as the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) or HyperText Markup
Language (HTML), to support the display of structured multimedia documents.  However,
while these markup languages solve some of the problems with the exchange of certain types
of complex documents across different computing platforms, the languages do not include
presentation specifics.  This means that in an Internet environment, for example, where the
World Wide Web has become a significant means of information exchange, most web
documents' presentation parameters are established in the "browser" for editing and viewing
programs, not within the documents themselves.  To solve these structural problems, new
browsers, such as Netscape, create new HTML tags that include presentation information. 
Unfortunately, these tags are non-standard, so the user is still unable to exchange documents
with others without losing important formatting information.<p>

In addition to individual company efforts, a number of cross-industry groups are working to
advance the interoperability of critical NII interfaces.  The American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) is a sponsoring a cross-industry body, the Information Infrastructure Standards
Panel (IISP), to bring companies from different industries, Standards Development
Organizations, consortia and ad hoc groups, and government personnel together to identify NII
standards needs and better coordinate NII standards-setting activities.  Multi-industry testbed
groups, such as NIIT and Smart Valley, are testing different solutions to interoperability
challenges.  The Cross Industry Working Team (XIWT) is examining and describing potential
architectures and technology solutions.  The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Forum is an
association of vendors united to accelerate the development and adoption of standard,
interoperable technology.  The Internet Engineering Task Force continues to substantially
improve Internet standards that make the Internet available to over 20 million people
worldwide.<p>

<hr align=left width=25%>
<a name="strat"><h3>Strategy for Improving the Interoperability of Complex Documents </h3>

Exchanging information-rich documents in the NII requires meeting two fundamental goals:  1)
users must be able to see and interact with documents that look the same as they did when
they were created -- in other words, the document received must be what was sent; and 2)
users' investments in data, hardware, and software must be preserved to the extent possible. 
A scalable standard may provide a means to achieve the latter goal, as users would be able to
access as many of the components of the document as their system is capable of displaying and
manipulating.<p>

The voluntary private sector standards groups should designate as a priority the development
and adoption of data exchange standards that support these two goals.  Initially, the standards
should focus on allowing users to display formatted information-rich documents on their
computer screens.  Extensible standards would support eventual upgrades to allow users to
fully manipulate those documents. <p>

Any standards that are adopted should possess the following general characteristics:
<ol type="a">
<li>free of legal barriers, i.e., either public domain or licensed on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms;
<li>well documented, with a public process for revision;

<li>based on available technology, as opposed to a set of abstract specifications;

<li>have reference implementation information readily available to developers, preferably with sample code widely distributed for testing to allow very broad, very rapid deployment; and

<li>responsive to market requirements, including legacy systems and international support.</ol>

These characteristics should apply to all of the interface standards that will be developed and
adopted by the private sector as the NII evolves.<p>

<hr align=left width=25%>
<a name="conc"><h3>Conclusion</h3>

CSPP recommends that the computer industry, working with the software and other key
information industries, adopt a strategy for improving the interoperability of complex
documents.  This strategy should include urging standards bodies to define standards for
self-describing formats for data interchange and mechanisms to translate information into and
out of required formats; urging standards bodies to adopt standards for software
interoperability at higher levels than current networking protocols; considering implementing a
multi-industry interoperability testbed facility to test potential solutions; and continuing to
advance technologies needed for enabling NII architectures.<p>

Competitive markets and the voluntary, industry-driven standards process are the best way to
drive interoperability for document exchange, while still providing industry with the flexibility
to compete and meet consumers demands.  Government-mandated standards or levels of
interoperability, on the other hand, would inhibit innovation by removing the market incentive
to improve.  Governments should take special care to support private sector efforts to
improve interoperability rather than setting their own interoperability goals and agendas.<p>


<hr align=left width=25%>
<a name="appen_a"><h3>Appendix A:  Key NII Interfaces for Interoperability</h3>

In "Perspectives on the NII:  Ensuring Interoperability," CSPP identified four categories of NII
interfaces -- of the many that will exist -- for which interoperability is essential to facilitate the
use of different information appliances, applications, communications networks, and
information resources.  Open interfaces at these key points will help ensure that the NII that
evolves is ubiquitous, interactive, and accessible to users and service providers.  Open
interfaces at critical NII locations will allow users and providers to transmit information
smoothly throughout the NII; stimulate competitive markets for NII products and services; and enable wide access to NII applications and services.  <p>

An interface is physically and logically "open" if its specifications are made readily available to all
vendors, service providers and users, and if such specifications are not revised without timely
notice or public process.  While open interfaces at critical points in the NII are important for
enabling interoperability, it is also important to maintain the intellectual property rights of
expressions of implementations as a key incentive to industry to develop advanced
technologies and applications that will speed the deployment of an enhanced NII.  The four
categories of critical interfaces identified by CSPP include: 
<ol>
<li>Information appliance to network service provider.  Open interfaces would allow users of the NII to attach any type of information appliance to the local access provider's network.<p>

<li>Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs) to information appliance and emerging NII applications, such as multimedia applications, telephony, database access, and X.400. Open APIs will enable developers of NII applications, such as interactive video games, remote database access, and electronic publishing, to make them available to any user regardless of the type of information appliance the user has. <p>

<li>The protocols that one NII application, service, or system uses to communicate with another service or system (for example, communications between different mail messaging systems or between database query programs and databases).  Open interfaces between different implementations of NII information systems, services, and applications that allow the systems, services, and applications to "communicate" with each other will enable users to generate and receive information in various formats and media, without having to make special adjustments to translate between different implementations. <p>

<li>The interfaces among and between network service providers, including between different local communications service providers, such as telephone companies and cable companies; interfaces to local companies' networks at key points and to intelligent switching software; and interfaces between local service providers and long distance carriers and enhanced service providers.  Open interfaces at certain key network points will ensure that users have maximum choice in their selection of and access to network and information services and that information providers can reach all users. </ol>

<a name="intro"</a><h1>Introduction</h1>

<h3>The Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is more than a &quot;network of
networks.&quot;  In CSPP's vision, the GII is a worldwide assembly of systems
that integrates five essential components:</h3>

<ul type=square>

<p><li>communications networks, such as telephone, cellular, cable and satellite
networks;</li></p>

<p><li>information equipment/appliances, including computers, televisions and
telephones;</li></p>

<p><li>information resources, including educational materials, medical databases,
and entertainment and commercial programs;</li></p>

<p><li>applications, such as telemedicine, electronic commerce and digital
libraries; and</li></p>

<p><li>people of all skill levels and backgrounds.</li></p>

</ul>

<p>The GII will continually evolve as it incorporates more advanced technologies,
new information, new consumers and different ways to use its resources.</p>

<p>The GII is already creating a whole new way of learning, working and playing.
Fully deployed, it will link individuals around the world to each other and to
private and public institutions, from schools and businesses to libraries and
laboratories.  It will revolutionize the way people and businesses relate to each
other.  It will unleash enormous potential to improve our quality of life by
providing virtually unlimited access to public services, cultural opportunities,
commercial transactions and many additional sources of information.  However,
real strides in advancing the GII will require industry action to address complex
technological issues and government action to eliminate regulatory and policy
barriers to its deployment and use.</p>

<p>In this report, CSPP offers a summary of the issues of most immediate concern
to the computer systems industry and recommendations for future actions in the
U.S. and abroad.</p>

<hr>

<a name="foundations"</a><h1>Foundations for Policy</h1>

<a name="foundations1"></a><h2>Launching the Global Information
Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The GII is not waiting for government action.  Industry is creating and
deploying many innovative, global applications.  CSPP companies have established
domestic and transnational applications to support electronic mail systems,
distance learning projects, commercial networks, and interconnected libraries,
medical facilities and service organizations, among others.  Around the world,
other companies are piloting similar applications and making them available to an
increasing number of consumers.  These applications represent the beginning of
the GII.  Much work remains to be done to ensure its long-term viability.</p>

<a name="foundations2"></a><h2>Putting the Private Sector in the Driver's
Seat</h2>

<p>The private sector has taken the lead in creating and making available the
networks, appliances, information services and applications that will constitute
the GII.  The role of governments around the world is to nurture the GII by
establishing policies that support and encourage private sector initiatives.
Governments must also ensure that private sector views are fully represented in
any international dialogue about the GII.</p>

<a name="foundations3"></a><h2>Going Beyond the Telecommunications Agenda</h2>

<p>The GII is the integration and interaction of all five components mentioned
above--networks, information appliances, information resources, applications and
people.  The GII will not thrive unless both the government and industry agendas
for GII policy go beyond competition, privatization and market access in the
telecommunications sector.  The other components of the GII are subject to very
different regulatory and policy treatment in the U.S. and abroad, and the issues
affecting these components must also be addressed.</p>

<a name="foundations4"></a><h2>Advances Depend on Competition and Deregulation
</h2>

<p>Competitive markets and deregulation are the most effective mechanisms to
stimulate innovation, expand customer choice and decrease costs.  For example, in
the U.S., demand for access to commercial on-line services and the Internet has
resulted in a rapidly growing number of competitive on-line service providers.
Consumers have experienced easier to use interfaces, reductions in prices and a
huge expansion in the information available over computer networks.</p>

<p>Governments should identify and remove regulatory, trade and policy barriers
that impede competition and limit widespread deployment of the GII.  The U.S.
government should work aggressively with other governments and within the
appropriate international organizations to achieve competitive, deregulated
markets.</p>

<a name="foundations5"></a><h2>Markets Will Drive Availability and
Affordability</h2>

<p>The U.S. government and other governments have identified universal service as
an important goal in the deployment of the GII.  This is a laudable and
appropriate concern. However, at this early stage, new definitions of universal
service would be premature and counterproductive.  Competitive markets and open
access to networks are the most effective mechanisms to ensure wide availability
of products and services at affordable prices, and energy should be focused on
creating those conditions worldwide.  Moreover, it is not possible to predict
from today's limited vantage point the potential uses that people will make of
the GII, the services they will want or the prices they will be willing to pay.
Consumers in different nations (and in different regions within nations) will
have their own unique needs for the GII.  The marketplace must be allowed to
develop before policies requiring new services are implemented.  In the interim,
however, an ongoing dialogue between the private sector and governments will
assist in identifying unmet needs and the potential for technological solutions.
As the GII evolves, the private sector has a responsibility to work with
governments to identify strategies, other than government mandates, for making
essential services and information sources broadly accessible to people and
communities.</p>


<a name="foundations6"></a><h2>Substantive Priorities To Be Addressed</h2>

<p>At this early stage, the GII could easily slip into the realm of international
rhetoric and overstatement.  Ensuring that it becomes a viable, useful tool
requires that the private sector and governments work through the following
substantive issues:</p>

<ul type=square>

<p><li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> developing and adopting globally
accepted standards for key interfaces;</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Market Access:</strong> achieving open and competitive markets, in
a deregulated environment, for all components of the GII throughout the
world;</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Security:</strong> developing and adopting security mechanisms,
including encryption standards, that ensure privacy and authentication for
business and personal transactions;</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Privacy:</strong> protecting sensitive and personal information
and providing access to personal information only in accordance with accepted
guidelines; and</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Intellectual Property Protection:</strong> defining and protecting
the rights of the owners of intellectual property in the GII
environment.</li></p>

</ul>

<a name="foundations7"></a><h2>Testbeds</h2>

<p>International testbeds or pilot projects, supported by joint
industry/government action, will both increase knowledge about practical and
legal barriers to the GII and identify potential solutions to overcome them.
While testbeds on socially beneficial applications are important to illustrate to
consumers the benefits of the GII, testbeds that focus on commercial applications
will provide the best means to identify and address policy issues preventing
private sector investment and deployment.  CSPP strongly encourages the U.S.
government to assume a leadership role in creating commercial international
testbeds.</p>


<a name="foundations8"></a><h2>Purpose of the Report</h2>

<p>This report will examine some of the substantive issues that could pose a
threat to realizing the full potential of the GII.  It will also recommend steps
that governments and industry, separately and together, can take to make the GII
an international success.</p>

<hr>

<a name="substantive"></a><h1>Substantive Priorities</h1>

<p>Many of the concerns described below are already being considered at the
domestic level in the context of the U.S. National Information Infrastructure
(NII). However, addressing these issues in the context of the GII will require
more than simply applying U.S. experience to other national systems.  The
barriers that exist differ between markets and cultures. Restrictions are
practical and technological, as well as legal and regulatory.</p>

<a name="substantive1"></a><h2>Interoperability</h2>

<p>The GII will enable computers, telephones, televisions, applications,
information and databases located in one country to interact with counterparts
anywhere in the world, but only if the components of the GII are interoperable at
critical interfaces. Market forces will play a central role in driving
interoperability. However, developing and adopting internationally accepted
standards will also be a key factor. Industry should lead the way in developing
these standards, which will have to be flexible and open to allow for the rapid
pace of technological innovation.</p>

<p>The U.S. government can support this process by:</p>

<ul type=square>

<p><li>helping other governments understand the benefits of inter-operability at
critical interfaces and the value of market-driven (i.e., customer-driven)
standards;</li></p>

<p><li>encouraging other countries to adopt an industry-led, voluntary standards
process, rather than rely on government-led standards processes or on mandated
standards;</li></p>

<p><li>encouraging other nations and their private sector standards organizations
to participate in a variety of international standards bodies, including the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the International Standards
Organization (ISO), and in ad hoc industry/user standards groups, since no single
international organization can address the full range of standards concerns
presented by the GII;</li></p>

<p><li>encouraging international participation in the Information Infrastructure
Standards Panel (IISP), which is sponsored by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) and other entities and offers a coordinated, cross-industry
approach to developing standards for interoperability;</li></p>

<p><li>ensuring that U.S. companies can participate in standards processes in
other countries, just as foreign companies can participate in the U.S processes;
and</li></p>

<p><li>encouraging other nations to recognize the rights of owners of
intellectual property included in standards for interfaces and to refrain from
implementing compulsory licensing related to standards.</li></p>

</ul>


<a name="substantive2"></a><h2>Market Access</h2>

<p>A viable GII depends on markets that are open to real competition and are
hospitable to foreign-owned suppliers of goods and services.  This principle
applies equally to the U.S. and to other countries.  The objective for market
access is to overcome barriers whenever and wherever found, whether legal,
regulatory, technological or trade-related.  The barriers affecting the various
elements of the GII -- networks, appliances, applications, information sources
and individuals -- differ enormously in nature, scope and purpose.  They all,
however, must be addressed before the GII can be fully deployed.</p>

<p>Liberalization of the telecommunications sector is a critical step in fully
realizing the GII. Markets throughout the world must be open to providers of
basic and enhanced telecommunications services, within countries and across
national borders.  Government-sanctioned monopolies of critical network services,
which exist throughout much of the world, distort efforts to achieve widespread
availability of innovative, low-cost services.</p>

<p>Until the telecommunications sector is deregulated, the information industry
is at risk of also being subjected to the existing burdensome telecommunications
regulatory model.  The information industry generally has not been subject to
elaborate regulation.  The convergence of technologies and the slow pace of
telecommunications liberalization has heightened the risks.</p>

<p>For example, while relatively free trade in computer equipment (computers,
peripherals, software and related products) is well established in much of the
world, trade in telecommunications apparatus is often subject to higher customs
duties, different standards and certification rules and other technical trade
requirements.  Reclassifying computer equipment containing communications
software or modems as &quot;telecommunications apparatus&quot; significantly
distorts the cost of trade and may stifle competition, delaying the
implementation of the GII. Maintaining the industry's competitive and deregulated
character will be critical to the GII's deployment.</p>

<p>Finally, there are existing impediments to market access that specifically
affect the U.S. information industry.  The U.S. government should give early
attention to addressing these barriers.  As suggested by the example above, one
important objective should be to eliminate tariffs, worldwide, on computers,
semiconductors, software and telecommunications equipment.  More broadly,
attention is required in the following three areas.</p>

<p><strong><font size=+1>Existing trade barriers: </font></strong> The
information industry's ability to participate in foreign government equipment
procurement and to interconnect with regional, national and global networks is
drastically restricted in a number of markets. Governments must work together to
eliminate the following obstacles that stand in the way of the industry competing
in foreign markets:</p>

<ul type=square>

<p><li>mandated standards;</li></p>

<p><li>subsidized domestic providers;</li></p>

<p><li>domestic content or manufacturing requirements;</li></p>

<p><li>tariffs;</li></p>

<p><li>restrictive import and export controls;</li></p>

<p><li>investment restrictions;</li></p>

<p><li>discriminatory or archaic customs administration;</li></p>

<p><li>lack of intellectual property protection or enforcement;</li></p>

<p><li>governmental refusal to accord mutual recognition to testing and
certification procedures in other countries; and</li></p>

<p><li>encouraging other nations to recognize the rights of owners of
intellectual property included in standards for interfaces and to refrain from
implementing compulsory licensing related to standards.</li></p>

</ul>

<p><strong><font size=+1>National regulations: </font></strong> The GII will
develop most rapidly if marketplace economics, rather than government planning,
determine what products and services are offered and at what prices.  To achieve
that goal, each country should ensure that participants in the information
industry are treated the same as local businesses (national treatment), can
establish businesses in the country (right of establishment), can conduct
business in the country from outside of its borders (cross-border business), and
can import components and services from other countries (transnational
sourcing).</p>

<p>Government action also may be required to ensure that the newly competitive
marketplace is protected from unfair practices by current state-owned or
-sponsored monopolies.  Crucial protections include fair and open access to
networks (interconnection rights), pricing for network components that is based
on cost rather than on market-distorting subsidies, and roaming privileges across
borders for mobile uses.</p>

<p>The U.S. itself must seek an open domestic market that enables foreign
participation, in conjunction with open foreign markets.  Limitations in any
country on domestic content, foreign ownership or participation in various
research and development programs create barriers to the goal of a GII.</p>

<p><strong><font size=+1>Technological barriers to access: </font></strong>
Governments and the private sector, together and separately, must address
technological barriers to access that could also impede the GII's progress.  The
most critical example is radio spectrum allocation.  The new technologies will
require access to substantial allocations of radio spectrum on a timely and
global basis. Governments must act to streamline existing domestic and
international spectrum allocation and coordination processes.  For its part, the
private sector must develop spectrum-sharing strategies and compression
technologies.</p>

<p>Private sector research and development also must focus on technological
issues that affect use of the GII by individuals and businesses.  These include
electronic payment mechanisms, ease of use and reliability.  While private sector
solutions will be required, government action may also be needed to encourage
international acceptance.</p>


<a name="substantive3"></a><h2>Security</h2>

<p><img src="quote.gif" align=right>The GII will not flourish without effective
security mechanisms to protect commercial transactions.  Consumers and providers
of products and services, particularly those involving health care and
international commerce, will not use GII applications unless they are confident
that electronic communications and transactions will be confidential, that the
origin of messages can be verified, that personal privacy can be protected, and
that security mechanisms will not impede the transnational flow of electronic
data.  Governments have a critical interest in commercial security mechanisms
that are consistent with their own national security needs.  As a result, they
must participate in private sector efforts to develop and adopt security
standards.  However, government needs should not be used as reasons to replace or
overwhelm the private sector standards processes.</p>

<p>To meet the security goals for the GII:</p>

<ul type=square>

<p><li>All participating countries must adopt standards to support security
mechanisms that are acceptable to the private sector and suitable to commercial
transactions. These standards must also ensure privacy and authentication. This
may require nations to adopt commercial security solutions that are different and
separate from solutions for national security and diplomatic purposes.</li></p>

<p><li>The U.S. government must cooperate with industry to resolve U.S. policy
concerns that have blocked acceptance of international encryption mechanisms
necessary for commercial transactions.</li></p>

<p><li>The private sector and government should convene a joint international
conference to address the need for security mechanisms to support commercial
applications and to develop a strategy for implementing acceptable security
solutions.</li></p>

</ul>

<a name="substantive4"></a><h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>The GII will vastly expand the quantity of readily available information and
the distance and the speed with which it can travel.  It is imperative that
sensitive and personal information be protected and made available only in
accordance with accepted guidelines.  Overzealous protection of data, on the
other hand, could stifle the growth of a dynamic, useful GII. Many nations,
including the United States, are presently drafting and refining policies to
guide the use of personal information available over electronic networks.</p>

<p>For the GII to proceed successfully, these policies must balance the need for
the free flow of information across borders with individual privacy protections.
Further, policies of different nations must be compatible.  Different levels of
protection and expectation can disrupt cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>The U.S. Administration's current efforts to update U.S. privacy practices are
a step in the right direction, but should be pursued in the context of the GII.
One practical action would be to include privacy policies in the international
conference on security recommended above.  This is appropriate since many of the
concerns associated with security mechanisms for commercial applications apply
equally to the privacy needs of individuals and institutions.</p>

<a name="substantive5"></a><h2>Intellectual Property Protection</h2>

<p>The U.S. has always been in the forefront of the effort to strengthen
international intellectual property protection.  In the GII context, it is even
more essential to continue this effort, since &quot;bits don't recognize
borders.&quot;  The problems for the providers of content -- on which the success
of the GII depends -- have been analyzed extensively by the U.S. Administration's
Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) working group in its
&quot;Preliminary Report on Intellectual Property Rights in the NII&quot; issued
last year.</p>

<p>The preliminary report, however, did not address in detail the additional
concerns of the suppliers of high technology equipment in the international
arena.  For example, the U.S. government must address the practice by some
nations of adopting mandatory standards and compulsory licensing that incorporate
proprietary designs.  While the new intellectual property agreement and the
dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization will be an important
foundation, the U.S. government must be willing to take an aggressive stand in
negotiating needed protections abroad.</p>

<hr>

<a name="roleofind"></a><h1>The Role of Industry</h1>

<p><strong>The GII ultimately will develop through the efforts and investments of
the private sector.</strong> Industry's role is to lead the development and
deployment of new technologies, services and applications in response to market
demand.  Industry also can help accelerate the GII's evolution by:</p>

<ul type=square>

<p><li>convening private sector-only international meetings on privacy and
security, prior to the joint conference on security recommended in this paper, in
order to develop suggested private sector positions and approaches;</li></p>

<p><li>continuing to lead efforts to develop and adopt, on a global basis,
standards for GII interoperability; and</li></p>

<p><li>continuing to invest in research and development for new information
technologies.</li></p>

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="roleofgov"></a><h1>The Role of Government </h1>

<p><strong>The role of governments, both in the U.S. and abroad, is primarily to
enable the private sector to develop and deploy the GII, not to regulate or
control it.</strong> The U.S. government can support GII initiatives worldwide
by:</p>

<ul type=square>

<p><li>working with other governments to develop a vision for the GII and its
uses;</li></p>

<p><li>developing a U.S. public/private partnership to support U.S. GII
initiatives;</li></p>

<p><li>funding research and development on pre-commercial technologies needed for
security, ease of use, reliability and other requirements identified in the
public/private sector paper entitled &quot;R&amp;D for the NII: Technical
Challenges;&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>promoting private sector efforts to develop interoperability standards for
the GII;</li></p>

<p><li>collaborating with other governments to create a political and regulatory
environment that encourages the development of new technologies and opens markets
worldwide; and</li></p>

<p><li>joining other governments and the private sector around the world to
address complex policy issues, such as market access, security, privacy and
intellectual property protection.</li></p>

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="need"></a><h1>Need for Cooperation and Collaboration</h1>

<p>Governments and the private sector together should establish one or more
multinational testbeds.  These projects would serve as concrete examples of what
can be accomplished in the formative stages of the GII and would crystallize
where obstacles lie, for both industry and government.</p>

<p>Governments should give priority to testbeds that address the issues
identified as critical in this paper: interoperability, market access, security,
privacy and intellectual property protection.  The testbeds should identify the
immediate policy and regulatory barriers associated with each area. Participating
countries should then quickly consider necessary policy changes to remove the
barriers.</p>

<p>Testbeds on a variety of applications can help accelerate international
adoption of information technologies and diffusion of their benefits.  However,
testbeds for commercial applications, such as electronic commerce, electronic
collaboration, information retrieval and distributed data processing, appear to
provide the best opportunity to highlight the issues identified in this
paper.</p>

<p>Countries participating in testbeds may have to waive or revise certain
policies and regulations -- for the purposes of the testbed -- that are currently
hindering rapid adoption of new technologies and use of the GII.  Such policies
or regulations might affect approval of licenses, restrictions on electronic
commerce, data transmission across borders and rules regarding privacy and
encryption.</p>

<p>Multinational testbeds should balance sharing and exchange of technology and
resources between participants.</p>

<p>There are many possible models for GII testbeds, including an international
commercial network based on the existing U.S. CommerceNet.  The specific design
of test projects should be left to the testbed sponsors but should be fully
supported by the governments involved.</p>

<h1>BORN IN THE USA</h1>

<h2><i>Leading the World</i></h2>

<h3><i>An American Success Story</i></h3>

<p>Ever since the first commercial electronic computer was installed in 1951,
American computer technology has led the world. This home-grown industry is the
global leader in market share and technological innovation. It is a genuine
example of an American success.</p>


<blockquote><strong>Public policy decisions made in Washington, D.C., can either
help or hinder America's global technology leadership. The decisions made by the
U.S. government need to be carefully weighed for their impact on the computer
industry, a catalyst for our nation's economic growth.</strong></blockquote>

<h1>GETTING THE FACTS STRAIGHT</h1>

<h3><i>The truth about the U.S. computer industry</i></h3>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><font size=+3><strong>FACT:  </strong></font><br> <blockquote><font
size=+2><strong>U.S. computer companies are creating high-quality, high-paying
jobs for Americans.</strong></font></blockquote></p>

<h3><i>The U.S. computer industry is <strong>not</strong> exporting American
jobs.</i></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the majority of computer jobs are located in the
U.S., not other countries. Computer companies employ nearly 1.2 million in the
U.S. An additional 1.5 million people are employed in the U.S. in
computer-related fields, like software design and telecommunications, which are
directly affected by the strength of computer-system makers.</p>

<ul type=disc><li>68% of computer industry employment is in the U.S., even though
62% of our sales are overseas.</li>

<li>88% of all research and development jobs are located in the U.S., and 70% of
all manufacturing jobs are located in this country.</li>

<li>Most computer jobs are knowledge-based, not manufacturing-based.</li>

<li>Over the next decade, it's projected there will be a 79% increase in the
number of systems analysts/computer scientists and a 56% increase in computer
programmers.</li></ul>

<p><i><strong><center><img src="freedom/graph1.gif"><br> The computer systems
industry creates high-paying jobs.</i></strong></p></center>

<p> <br> </p>

<p><strong>To continue to create jobs for the future and contribute to the
overall economic health of the country, U.S. computer companies need freedom to
grow.</strong></p>

</pre>

<p><font size=+3><strong>FACT: </strong></font></br> <blockquote><font
size=+2><strong>The U.S. computer industry is fueling America's global
competitiveness.</strong></font></blockquote></p>

<h3><i>The U.S. computer industry is leading the competition in every major
product category.</i></h3>

<p>U.S. computer companies are the global leaders in computer systems -- ahead of
Japan and Europe. The economic impact of the industry extends deeply into the
American economy. Our products are essential to the improved efficiency,
competitiveness, and profitability of many other industries that rely on computer
technology to compete, including health care, manufacturing, transportation,
defense, entertainment, finance, retail, and real estate. The industry is an
<i>enabler</i>, helping the U.S. lead in productivity, creativity, and
ultimately, knowledge, which makes us all more competitive.<br>

<ul type=disc><li>U.S. computer companies spend more than 8% of their revenue in
research and development, second only to health care as an industry.</li>

<li>U.S. computer companies rank one, two, and three in worldwide sales of:
<blockquote>- supercomputers<br> - mid-range computers<br> - workstations<br> -
personal computers.</blockquote></li>

<li>U.S. computer companies rank one and two in worldwide sales of mainframe
computers.</li>

<li>U.S. computer companies compete successfully in more than 140 countries,
against 50,000 worldwide competitors.</li>

<li>By the year 2000, nearly 70% of the demand for information technology will
come from outside the U.S.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The ability to sell products and access technology worldwide is
essential to the continued competitiveness of the U.S. computer industry and its
success around the world. The industry must grow globally or die!</strong></p>

<p><i><strong><center><img src="freedom/graph3.gif"><br> The U.S. computer

<p><font size=+3><strong>FACT: </strong></font><br> <blockquote><font
size=+2><strong>Technology is perishable.</strong></blockquote></font></p>

<h3><i>Technology changes every 18 months and computer companies must
&quot;reinvent&quot; themselves and their product lines every 24 months.</i></h3>

<p>The incredibly rapid pace of change in the computer industry distinguishes it
from traditional manufacturing businesses. Every 18 months, improvements in
technology double the amount of computing power a dollar will buy. As a result, a
single bad public policy decision can wipe out an entire product generation. Miss
one development cycle and a company is seriously hurt; miss two and a company is
mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Given this business reality, computer companies are at the forefront of change
in the U.S., having adapted to a new way of doing business that requires us to
&quot;reinvent&quot; ourselves every two years.</p>

<ul><li>In 1993, 74% of computer companies' product revenues came from products
that did not exist two years ago.</li>

<li>Today, computer companies don't have time to make every thing in-house; they
need to form partnerships with other companies to source parts, technology, and
component anywhere in the world -- wherever the best can be found.</li>

<li>The continued success of the industry depends on its ability to bring the
best products to worldwide markets quickly.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The time-critical nature of our industry means that U.S. computer
companies must have access to the most innovative technologies, products, and
people in the other countries to produce the best products and continue to lead
in the world market.</strong></p>

<p><h1>CREATING POLICIES THAT CREATE GROWTH</h1>  </p>

<h3><i>How government can help</i></h3>

<p><blockquote><strong>U.S. public policy must change to meet the realities of
the global marketplace and prepare for the 21st century. CSPP urges Congress and
the administration to consider the following recommendations to give computer
companies  freedom to grow.</strong></blockquote></p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><h3><font size =+2>Work with industry to coordinate trade and technology
policies.</font></h3></p>

<p>Continued success of the U.S. computer industry around the world depends on
its ability to bring competitive products to market quickly. To do that, it's
essential that companies be able to source technology globally -- wherever it can
be found -- to maintain the industry's competitiveness and productivity. No
country can have a monopoly on technology -- its flow across international
boundaries is a business reality.</p>

<p><strong>CSPP recommends that the government: </strong><br>

<ul type=disc><li>Reform the export control system to keep pace with the
international marketplace and rapid advances in technology.</li>

<li>Reflect in U.S. policymaking the importance of exports to the economic
strength of the U.S., by assuring that U.S. competitiveness is not needlessly
undermined by inappropriate barriers to exports.</li>

<li>Avoid provisions restricting foreign participation in domestic markets, which
may lead to retaliation against U.S. companies in world markets.</li></ul></p>


<p><h3><font size =+2>Establish open markets.</font></h3></p>

<p>Open markets are the key to global competitiveness. To remain competitive
around the world, U.S. high-technology companies must be strong exporters and
wise importers.</p>

<p><strong>CSPP recommends that the government:</strong> <br>

<ul type=disc><li>Maintain open markets for trade and investment while
aggressively pushing other countries to open their borders to trade and
investment.</li>

<li>Devote adequate resources to ensure an effective implementation of the
Uruguay Round, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other multilateral
trade and investment agreements.</li>

<li>Emphasize full implementation of the 1992 agreement to open Japan's public
sector computer market to foreign products and services while ensuring continued
progress on the 1990 Revised Supercomputer Procurement Agreement and the 1991
Semiconductor Trade Agreement with Japan.</li></ul></p>

<p><h3><font size =+2>Support industry efforts to develop national and global
information infrastructures.</font></h3></p>

<p>The private sector is, and will continue, investing in the development and
deployment of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and Global
Information Infrastructure (GII). However, the government does have an important
role to play as a stimulator of private sector efforts.</p>

<p><strong>On the NII, CSPP recommends that the government:</strong><br>

<ul type=disc><li>Continue to promote a vision for the NII</li>

<li>Support an industry-led strategy to ensure interoperability</li>

<li>Implement a political and regulatory climate that encourages competitive
markets</li>

<li>Work with the private sector to address policy issues such as wide access to
the NII, privacy, authentication, security, and intellectual property
protection</li>

<li>Fund pre-commercial R&amp;D technologies and pre-commercial testbeds for the
NII</li>

<li>Make government information easily accessible electronically.</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>On the GII, CSPP recommends that the government:</strong><br>

<ul type=disc><li>Strongly encourage other nations to rely on industry-led,
market-driven processes to achieve global interoperability</li>

<li>Work to achieve open, competitive, and non-discriminatory markets
worldwide</li>

<li>Recognize the necessity for commercially acceptable security, authentication,
and privacy mechanisms to protect commercial transactions and individual privacy
rights</li>

<li>Continue efforts to strengthen international intellectual property rights
worldwide</li>

<li>Work with the private sector to establish one or more multinational testbeds
focusing on commercial applications.</li></ul></p>

<p><h3><font size=+2>Improve federal R&amp;D spending priorities and
incentives.</font></h3></p>

<p>The U.S. computer industry accounts for 21% of all private R&amp;D investment
in the country. Yet computer-related R&amp;D accounts for less than 4% of the
federal R&amp;D budget. Our goal is not to increase the federal budget, but to
reprioritize how it is spent.</p>

<p><strong>CSPP recommends that the government:</strong><br>

<ul type=disc><li>Improve federal R&amp;D budget review mechanisms and increase
industry involvement</li>

<li>Improve incentives for private investment in R&amp;D</li>

<li>Maintain federal R&amp;D funding for pre-commercial relevant technologies, in
particular:

<blockquote>- Research on high-performance computing and communications
technologies<br> - Research to address challenges in deploying the NII/GII,
emphasizing security, ease of use, and reliability<br> - Pre-commercial testbeds
to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of selected NII
applications.</blockquote></li></ul></p>

PERSPECTIVES ON COMPETITION AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE NII</title>
<center><h2>PERSPECTIVES ON COMPETITION AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE NII<br>
The Computer Systems Policy Project and<br>
The Information Technology Industry Council<br>
December, 1994</h2></center>
<hr>
<p></p>
<b><p>Executive Summary</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>The information technology industry believes that the competitive marketplace and open interfaces at critical locations will drive the availability of the affordable networks, information appliances, and information services that people will need to use the National Information Infrastructure (NII).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past sixty years, the concept of universal service promoted the provision of affordable local telephone service by regulated franchised carriers.  It has been argued that federal and/or state governments should move quickly to establish a similar policy to promote a minimum level of NII service.  While service for all should remain a policy goal for the United States as the NII evolves, the information technology industry believes that market forces and competition, along with an infrastructure that provides open access at critical interfaces, are the best way to achieve this goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The NII is evolving rapidly, technologies are changing and advancing continually, and new, untried services are emerging.  In this environment, it is impossible to predict with accuracy the potential uses that people will make of the NII, the services they will want, or the prices they will be willing to pay for such services.  The highly competitive computer, electronics, and information industries are already successfully producing a wide array of products and services that meet users' needs at affordable prices.  In the increasingly competitive and diverse information and network service markets, the use of a broad, system wide regulatory structure, first established in the 1930's, will no longer serve the nation well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The best way to ensure that markets drive widespread opportunities to use the NII is to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and to encourage competition in NII markets and open access to communications networks.  Rather than attempting to fit a universal service regulatory structure onto new and varied NII services, policy makers should establish a goal of marketplace competition for all elements of the NII.  As the networks are deployed and the NII evolves, markets and private investment will work to ensure universal access to the networks, tools, and information resources people will need to use the NII, in their homes and through other facilities, such as public libraries and Schools.  Only as new NII services are widely adopted should policy makers consider whether the marketplace has not achieved the goal of enabling all users to obtain essential NII services. if there are limited cases where the goal is not achieved, appropriate mechanisms can then be considered for meeting these needs.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Government/Private Sector Roles</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>The information technology industry has identified the following roles for the government and the private sector in addressing the needs for access to the NII as it evolves.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Roles for State, and Local Governments:</p></b>

<ul>
1 .   Foster competition in NII markets and encourage open access to communication networks so any user or service provider can connect to the NII.<br><br>

2.	Refrain from imposing regulations in competitive markets.<br><br>

3.	Ensure that government information and services are available on line,	relying upon, and not competing with, commercial services to the extent	possible.<br><br>

4.	Provide incentives to states to incorporate NII use and training in public school curricula, such as including funding for training NII teachers, navigators, and "coaches" for community access centers.<br><br>

5.	Fund a pilot program, including a limited number of grants to communities, to test various concepts to establish community access, including access for people with disabilities, building to the extent possible on existing facilities.  If the test centers are successful, follow up with a program to help underwrite the establishment of centers in poorer communities around the country.<br><br>
6.	AS competition is fully realized, develop effective mechanisms to ensure that communications networks are available to users not served by the competitive marketplace.
</ul>
<b><p>Roles for Private Industry</p></b>

<ul>
1 .   Develop a vibrant market of competing goods and services to meet evolving customer needs.<br><br>
2.    Continue to invest in research on advanced networking technologies and easier to use, affordable appliances and information services.<br><br>
3.	Continue deploying new communication technologies and applications packages as widely as possible.<br><br>
4.	Continue efforts to train users of the NII.<br><br>
5.	Participate in government pilot programs to establish community NII access centers.</p>
</ul>

<p></p>
<b><p>What is the NII?</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>Conceptually, the NII is a nationwide assembly of systems that integrates five essential components -- communications networks, computers and information appliances, information, applications, and people -- using a wide variety of technologies to create a whole new way of learning, working, and interacting with others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Information will be transmitted through the NII via a set of many interconnected, interoperable communications networks, both wired and wireless, that provide a range of different services and capabilities, from high to low speeds.  However, the NII will be much more than just communications networks. it also will include the information appliances and devices that people will use to access NII services, such as powerful personal computers and workstations, televisions) telephones, and devices that combine the functions of all of these.  It will encompass a wide range of information services, including public and private databases, digital libraries, and bulletin boards, government information, commercial applications, directory and other services, and entertainment programs.  Finally, the NII is being -- and will increasingly be -- used by people of all ages and backgrounds, who possess a very wide variety of experience, education, and training, in the skills necessary to locate, retrieve, use, and create electronic information, and whose interests, needs, desires, and physical abilities are likely to be quite varied.  Through these interconnected and interoperable components, the NII will link together people and public and private institutions and resources, from schools and businesses to libraries and laboratories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we do not know exactly what NII services people will use, we do know that they will not only be able to search an enormous variety of databases and information resources from around the world, containing information in text, audio, video, image, and multimedia formats, and they will also be able to create their own information and exchange it with virtually anyone else.  With the as-yet unimagined services and applications the NII will make available, distance, location, and time barriers will tend to disappear.  This is especially important for those in rural areas, those with disabilities, and those who work and learn at home.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Markets Will Drive Availability and Affordability</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>As the private sector works to develop and deploy the NII, the federal government can best help ensure that all Americans can obtain the NII information and services they need by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers and by encouraging competition in NII markets and open access to communications networks.  The information technology industry agrees with the Clinton Administration's recognition in the <i>Agenda for Action for the NII</i>  that markets are driving the evolution of new NII services and their widespread availability, and that policies to promote competition, in combination with targeted support for disadvantaged users, will advance both rapid infrastructure modernization and expanded access to the NII.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rapid advances in technology are enabling increased competition in communication and information services, changing the communications environment from one of scarce resources to one of abundant choices.  The global computer, consumer electronics, and information industries are already applying these new technologies, through competitive markets, to make new products and services widely available and affordable.  For example, one-third of U.S. households already have personal computers -- many with CD-ROM drives and modems.  Many more households have radios, televisions, VCRs, stereos, and video games.  The prices of all of these products have declined significantly over the last decade, even though the Consumer Price Index has risen and the products' performance levels have improved exponentially.  Recently, the number of subscribers to on-line services, such as America OnLine, CompuServe, and Prodigy, have increased dramatically as those services compete for customers.  And the introduction of competition into the long-distance telephone market has resulted in improved service at lower prices.  We are confident that as the NII evolves, these competitive trends will continue to result in the deployment of new, advanced, and affordable products and services.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>The NII is Evolving</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>Since the NII is evolving rapidly, technologies are Changing and advancing continually, and new services are only just coming on line, it is impossible to predict with accuracy the potential uses that people may make of the NII, the services they will want, or the prices they will be willing to pay for such services.  Initially, many people may not need to use many of the services available through the NII.  Some people will use the NII only occasionally.  Many of their uses will require different information appliances, different transmission capacities, and different applications.  Until people are familiar with the various services available, they may not be willing to make the investments necessary to purchase even the most basic options or service levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Until we are better able to assess the uses and needs people will have for NII services, we should not adopt policies requiring new services to be provided universally. in fact, it is entirely possible that many people will use some NII services so seldom that they will prefer to go to a public access point on those occasions when they need them, just as they go to public libraries to use materials they do not need to have at home.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Definitions</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>The terms "universal service" and "universal access" are often used when discussing how to ensure that people will be able to obtain information and reach other people in the NII.  To help provide a common ground for discussions about these important concepts, we propose the set of definitions below.  But first it is helpful to understand that there are three basic prerequisites for people to benefit from the NII:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
1 .   There must exist an available network, either wired or wireless, to provide a connection to the NII;<br><br>
2.    A person must have the tools and skills necessary to connect to the NII and use its available services; and<br><br>
3.There must be some information or services available through the NII that a person wants to use.
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>With these prerequisites in mind, we developed the following definitions:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><i>NetWork Deployment</i> addresses the physical availability of a communications network to those in a region who wish to connect to the NII, creating a "network of networks." Thus, network deployment provides the medium to which a person may connect an information appliance -- personal computer, interactive television, wireless telephone -- to send, receive, and retrieve information.  <i>Universal Network Deployment</i> refers to the availability of reasonably convenient connections to the NII's communications networks at the necessary bandwidth.</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Access deals with the ability to use the services that are available, and thus relates primarily to the people and appliance aspects of the NII.  It focuses on the tools and the skills necessary to be able to use the services that are available and the existence of special features to meet the needs of disabled users.  <i>Universal Access</i> refers to the opportunity that everyone should have to use the NII, either in their homes, at work, or at public access points.  This must evolve over time and community by community as technologies and services become widely used and people's skills and interests develop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Service</i> is an economic concept.  Historically, <i>universal service</i> referred to a policy goal to provide all Americans With the ability to obtain affordable telephone service.  Where regulated franchises on their own do not achieve this goal, federal, state, and local government mechanisms help to accomplish it.  In the context of the NII, universal service would refer to some minimum level of service that Should be affordable for all, either at home or work, or through public facilities.  It would only apply to essential economic, public safety, and educational uses, which would, for the most part, be provided through the competitive marketplace.  Other uses, such as entertainment or avocational uses, would be addressed solely through market mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Ensuring Universal Access to the NII</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>The information technology industry recommends that rather than attempting to fit a regulatory concept born in a monopoly environment onto the NII, policy makers should adopt the following strategies to ensure universal access to the NII:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>1.	Communications Networks -- Federal, state, and local policy makers should encourage universal deployment of communications networks, with the necessary bandwidths and interoperable at critical interfaces, by encouraging competition and removing unnecessary regulations as effective competition emerges.  As network deployment occurs, policy makers should consider whether mechanisms are needed to ensure universal deployment or to assist users to connect to networks in special circumstances where competitive markets do not achieve this goal.<br><br>

2.	Tools and Skills -- The competitive marketplace will ensure that the necessary tools, including a variety of information appliances, will be affordable and available to most people.  Community-based public access centers would supplement that availability.  NII access centers can provide assistance with skills development, and provide special tools for people with disabilities, with additional government assistance where necessary.<br><br>

3.	Information -- Competitive markets, combined with open interfaces at critical network access points, will ensure that information resources are accessible to all.  Competition will create the information services that users demand, while open interfaces, which CSPP described in its February, 1994 paper, <i>Perspectives on the National Information Infrastructure: Ensuring Interpretability</i>, will enable any provider to make its information services available over the NII and enable users in any region of the country to access information.  In some cases, subsidies to users may be needed to make essential information resources affordable to certain users.<br><br>
</ul>
<p>Thus, as networks are deployed, markets and private investment, in conjunction with open interfaces at critical locations, will drive universal access to the resources made available by the NII.  Whether and where the concept of universal service may be appropriate in the NII remains to be seen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike today's telephone service, NII services will largely be provided by companies operating in competitive markets.  If it is determined based on experience that mechanisms are needed to achieve universal service, those mechanisms will have to be considered in the context of competitive markets and a diverse availability of technologies and services.  With today's "plain old telephone service," it is relatively easy to decide what services should be made available and affordable to all. in the diverse and competitive environment of the NII, it will be impossible to choose a particular technology or type or service for universal service without limiting consumer choices and inhibiting innovation.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Community NII Access Centers</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>Until we have a better idea about what technologies, services, and information people will want to use and how they will use them, community-based NII access centers, building on existing mechanisms and models for making information available, can help meet evolving needs for using the NII, as well as identify the applications people will most want to use.  Today, many people use centralIy-located facilities, such as libraries, schools, community centers, and social clubs, to obtain information.  The information technology industry believes that these institutions, and the mechanisms already in place to support them, provide a natural foundation for providing access to new information technologies and services made available by the NII.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Community NII access centers could offer a wide variety of technologies and services, tailored to meet community needs and commensurate with available resources.  The centers would help introduce people to new technologies and services without requiring them to commit to purchasing or subscribing to products before they are certain they want them.  For many people today, libraries and schools serve as the only connection to information not available in their homes; for many others, they are a key supplemental source of information.  Community NII access centers would ensure that this resource is not lost as we move into the digital age.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To the extent possible, community NII access centers should build on existing centers of information.  We believe that public libraries provide the most logical and appropriate locations for such activities.  However, where libraries are not convenient, many other types of existing facilities could serve as public access centers, including, for example, elementary and secondary schools, universities, and community colleges; government offices, including agricultural extension offices and recreational facilities; and privately-run facilities, such as veterans organizations, community health centers, and senior citizens clubs.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Initiatives for Community Access</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>Many communities are already beginning to invest in initiatives to provide public access to the NII in response to local needs, including providing on-line capabilities at public libraries, installing information kiosks at local government offices and other public locations, and funding access to low-cost community networks.  We encourage localities to provide these types of community access mechanisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For communities that do not have the resources to establish NII access centers, we recommend the federal government fund a series of demonstration projects to define the levels of needs for NII services in communities and to test potential approaches for addressing those needs.  The criteria and potential approaches could then be applied to address the needs of particular communities as necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Funding for a set of pilot community access programs could be made available through federal, state or local grants, similar to the funds being provided through NTIA's program for connecting non-profit facilities to the NII, and by allowing companies that donate products or services to community centers to claim enhanced tax deductions.  Low income users who purchase information technology products, network time, or essential information services could be assisted with tax credits to offset the costs of use.  The source of funding for services with broad, general benefits such as the NII should be general government funds, rather than specific, targeted taxes, which tend to distort markets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whatever type of mechanism is used to fund community NII centers or the use of the NII by people who need financial assistance, any subsidies should be provided directly to the users or to the community access centers, rather than to service providers.  Such subsidies could take the form of vouchers to purchase network or information services.  Subsidizing providers would distort markets and limit the flexibility of choice for users and access centers.</p>
<p></p>
<b><p>Summary</p></b>
<p></p>
<p>Competition will ensure that the needs of most people to access information and communicate with others can be met through a combination of access to the NII in their homes and in community centers.  If, in the future competitive environment, a determination is made that the market has failed to address the needs of certain users, targeted and measured responses can be tailored to address these needs.</p>

<h2 align=center>
Information Technology's Contribution<br>
to Lifelong Learning<br>


March, 1994</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary</b></p>
 
<p>Success in the knowledge-based society of the future will require a variety of critical skills, including active, self-directed learning, the ability to access, analyze and manipulate remote data, and the ability to communicate across regional and nati
onal boundaries.  In the job markets of the future, employers will demand workers who can learn new skills to adapt to changing job requirements and new technologies, use knowledge and information to make decisions, and work collaboratively in groups.  Mo
st Americans are not acquiring these types of skills as part of their education today.  Improving the effectiveness of our education system is essential if the United States is to compete effectively in the global work place of the future.  From pre-schoo
l through graduate school, we must provide a meaningful way for individuals to continue learning and retraining throughout their lives to obtain and maintain the skills they will need for the high wage, information-based economy of the future.</p>
 
 
 
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) believes that the enhanced national information infrastructure (NII) will provide a tool to meet these needs by linking together a range of institutions and resources -- from schools, hospitals, and businesses
 to libraries, laboratories, and government agencies -- that will allow students of all ages to interact with each other and with teachers, mentors, advisers, and experts.  Through existing and new information technologies the NII will transform the way p
eople learn by enabling them to learn and work together and to access, share, and generate information without regard to geography.  Teachers will be able to custom tailor lessons to accommodate their students' special needs and interests.  Adult learners
 will be able to access, at their convenience, the information they need to learn new skills or improve current skills.  Learners of all ages will be able to find and use information from distant and distributed resources.  People in remote or less well o
ff areas will have access to the best learning resources available.  As the Clinton Administration noted in its 1993 Agenda for Action for the National Information Infrastructure, "Although technology alone cannot fix what is wrong with America's educatio
n and training system, the NII can help.  "</p>



<p>Innovative approaches to education and training using information technologies are already being applied in classrooms and corporate learning centers around the country.  The NII will provide opportunities to build on and expand these efforts.  CSPP be
lieves that demonstration projects highlighting the benefits of information technologies and addressing the problems that are hindering their adoption will accelerate the adoption of information technologies in classrooms, homes, and other learning enviro
nments.  CSPP recommends that the federal government and the private sector together invest in projects to demonstrate On-line Libraries, Electronic Librarians, Virtual Laboratories and Field Trips, Preschool/Head Start/Schools of Education Networks, Comm
unity-based Education and Vocational Resource Centers, the Internet as Library, and Electronic Assistants.</p>
 
<p>The Challenge -- Preparing the Workforce for the Future</p>
 
 
 
<p>Ensuring that all citizens are adequately trained and educated to meet the changing workforce needs of the future will require taking steps to provide the means to teach students the skills they will need to succeed in the high wage, information-based 
economy of the future, as well as providing the means for individuals to continue learning and upgrading their skills throughout their lives.  As many Americans are realizing, the best, highest-wage jobs are increasingly going to those who have the skills
 employers need, or who can upgrade their skills as job needs change.  The ability to locate, access, and use information is becoming essential to virtually every high-wage job.  The U.S. education and training system must help students of all ages acquir
e those skills.</p>
 
<p>The National Information Infrastructure (NII) will provide a powerful tool for meeting these challenges.  Through the NH, America's edge in computing and communications technologies can be extended to education services in schools, communities, work pl
aces, and homes, making knowledge and information resources of all types readily available, accessible, and usable by all Americans.  By using the resources of the NII to locate information, solve problems, and communicate interactively with others, peopl
e will learn and hone the skills they will need for the 21st century.</p>
 
 
 
<p>Teachers and students of all ages are already using information technologies to enhance and expand their learning experiences and opportunities.  As described in CSPP's report Perspectives on the National Information Infrastructure: CSPPs Vision and Re
commendations for Action, the NII will enhance and integrate four essential components -- communications networks, computers and information appliances, information, and people -- to revolutionize the way people learn.  The NII will enable students and te
achers to work together, to collaborate with experts, and to access, share and generate information -- all without regard to geographic, race, class and gender boundaries.  Information technologies will enable fundamental changes in the way students inter
act with their peers, their teachers, and information resources of all kinds, bringing information to learners when and where they want it.  The NII will provide a tool for addressing many of the learning needs the country is facing, including, for exampl
e:</p>


<ul>
<li>tailoring curriculum and instruction methods to meet the needs of individual students;



<li>providing teachers with the resources they need to improve their skills and update their knowledge;



<li>providing a means for Americans to continually acquire the knowledge to adapt to new or changed career objectives;

<li>providing seniors and disabled or homebound Americans direct access to information resources critical to their health and welfare; and

<LI>providing better access to information that affects our quality of life and cultural awareness.

</ul>

<p>President Clinton and Vice President Gore have explicitly recognized the benefits that information technologies can bring to achieving the education goals the nation has established for the beginning of the 21st century.  The Administration's technolog
y initiatives include a plan to improve technology for education and training by supporting the development and introduction of computer and communications equipment and software designed to increase the productivity of learning in formal school settings,
 a variety of business training facilities, and in homes.</p>

<hr>

<H2 ALIgn=center>How Can Information Technology<br>
Contribute to Achieving the Challenge?</h2>



<p>While information technologies are already being used in a variety of settings to improve the effectiveness of education and training, the enhanced NII will provide many opportunities to better prepare our population for the work place of the future:</
p>


<ul>
<li>Computers will make learning complex ideas easier by providing learning environments that closely approximate real work environments or experimental apparatus.

<li>Students interconnected via networks will be able to collaborate as teams, even though members of the team are geographically separated.  Teachers and school and college administrators from around the country will be able to communicate electronically
 to exchange ideas and build a sense of community.

<li>Instruction will be tailored to the specific learning needs of individuals, particularly adults re-entering a training environment, minorities, women, people with disabilities, and others that may benefit from customized approaches to instruction.

<li>People who do not have direct access to a wide variety of opportunities, either because they live in remote areas or because of the demands of work or family responsibilities, will be able to access information from other locations in a variety of for
mats and media, obtain degrees from distant colleges, and access facilities with unique learning resources.

<li>Information technologies, such as visualization, will provide new ways to learn difficult concepts and data.

<li>Information technologies will reduce the burden of record keeping and other paperwork that consumes so much of teachers' and administrators' time.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 align=center>Meeting America 2000 Goals</h2>



<p>The following are just a few of the ways information technology, through the NII, can help us meet the America 2000 goals that were established by former President Bush and the National Governors Association in 1990. </p>
 
 
 
<p><b>Goal 1, By the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn.</b> </p>
 
<p>An enhanced NII has the potential to move learning, at any age, from beyond the four walls of a classroom to a broad community of reamers.  Many of the problems that make it difficult for children to arrive at school ready to learn, including a variety
 of difficult societal problems, can be addressed or minimized through information technology.  For instance, through links to the home, the NII can provide parents with the necessary tools to expand their roles in their children's education and better pr
epare their children to enter schools ready to learn.  Through computers linked to social agencies, assistance with specific problems can be provided directly and confidentially to parents, or to schools, to help teachers and administrators deal more effe
ctively with learning difficulties caused by social problems.</p>


<ul>
<li>Linking from home with a personal computer or an interactive TV, a parent will be able to access high-quality and developmentally appropriate preschool education materials to use with their children.  Working in this fashion not only promotes inter-ge
nerational literacy but strengthens communications between parents and educators very early on.


<li>Through the NII, day care and other providers of services for young children will easily access the latest nutritional and healthcare information and services.  Model programs for early childhood care could be disseminated easily electronically, along
 with customized information for children with special problems or circumstances.

<li>Parents and preschool teachers will be able to access an interactive "Ask the Experts" electronic bulletin board to get insights on all types of developmental-related issues; or, with a simple electronic message, they would automatically receive a mon
thly newsletter with guidance on developmental milestones and exercises.

</ul>

<p><b>Goal 2,	By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90%.</b></p>



<p>One of the most common reasons cited by students for dropping out of school is a lack of relevancy in education -- they see little real-world pay back from traditional education.  By fostering better communications between the schools, the private sect
or, and higher education, and making learning more exciting and hands-on, the NII can play a crucial role in enhancing the linkages between education and career options, strengthening the school-to-work transition, and providing incentives for staying in 
school.</p>

<ul>

<li>NII applications will allow students to directly interact with scientists, researchers, journalists, entertainers, or even Members of Congress.  Through these interactions, students will see firsthand skills and education being applied in relevant rea
l-world situations, helping them gain an understanding of the benefits of staying in school.

<li>Career counseling and career information available electronically will provide students with immediate, interactive information about career options and education requirements.  Mentors and people practicing specific careers around the country could b
e available to answer students' questions via networks.

<li>Instruction can be made more exciting, and better tailored to students' interests and needs, through the use of networked multimedia, speech recognition, intelligent tutors and tools, and curricula that integrate voice, video, data and text.  This wil
l help enhance retention and provide the flexibility to meet the varying learning styles of disabled, at-risk, and other non-traditional students.
</ul>


<p><b>Goal 3.       By the year 2000, Americans will have competency in challenging subject matter, including English, mathematics, science, history and geography, and... be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment
 in our modern economy.</b></p>



<p>In a global, knowledge-based economy, skills in generating, accessing, manipulating, and managing information will be paramount.  Information and the base of knowledge about any particular subject are growing so quickly that a person can no longer expe
ct to "know" all there is to know about a subject.  Instead, workers and students will need to know how to find the information they need quickly and in the right format.  While tools and software will help make the NII easier to use and navigate, informa
tion technology-based education techniques will still require reamers to conceptualize a problem, use critical thinking skills, access distant resources, and collaborate with fellow students, all while using basic reading and writing skills.</p>

<ul>

<li>Integrated curriculum supported by information technology will move learning beyond memorizing "facts" like the periodic table, to inquiry-driven, on-line, interactive sessions, such as discussions with NASA researchers working on the Hubble Telescope
, collaborations with oceanographers charting undersea volcanoes, or writing reports with images downloaded from the Voyager satellite.

<li>Global networking capabilities will enable students to interact with students and teachers around the world, bringing current events right into the classroom.  Projects like the National Geographic's Kids Net are already moving lessons from static tex
tbooks and outdated maps to powerful, interactive exchanges with students from cultures and countries around the globe. 
 
<li>Understanding and appreciating diversity, whether different countries, races, cultures or languages, will be essential for American students and workers operating in an increasingly interconnected, global environment.  Through the NII, information tec
hnologies will enable students and teachers to access resources and perspectives from around the world.</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Goal 4:	By the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement.</b></p>



<p>Through the NII, information technologies have a huge potential to reinvigorate how science and mathematics are taught, used, and learned by students.  With network-supported simulated experiments, project-based learning, and authentic problem solving 
exercises, students can generate their own scientific data, which they can share with researchers in the field.  This makes students active participants in their education, rather than passive observers.</p>

<ul>

<li>With electronic access to resources like the National Academy of Science's Science Resource Center, or materials from the Science 2000 and the AAAS's Project 2061, teachers will be able to develop exciting, up-to-date curricula.



<li>NII technologies will enable students to participate in creative, collaborative mathematics projects, such as student-conducted electronic polling, or designing an urban bike path, that provide hands-on experience in statistics, architecture, sample g
athering, testing, design, assessment and forecasting.

<li>Innovative curricula and technologies can significantly improve outreach to traditionally under-represented and under-served populations in math and science.

<li>Innovative tools and resources, such as supercomputers, visualization, and statistics software will bring difficult mathematic functions, including modeling, simulation, probability, and finite analysis alive and within the reach of many students.

</ul>

<p><b>Goal 5:	By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.</b></p>


<p>The global economy is moving rapidly to one driven by information and knowledge.  High-wage jobs, quality of life, and competitive advantage will be based on the ability to create, manipulate and deliver information quickly to the right person and plac
e.  Literacy, or technological fluency, will require the skills to acquire knowledge and to adapt to emerging technologies and work methods.</p>


<ul>
<li>A continuum of networked services and resources drawn from academia, business, and the community will provide lifelong learning opportunities for workers, students and teachers.  Distance learning technologies will enable innovative retraining initiat
ives, designed and adapted to meet the needs of mid-career and other non-traditional students.

<li>The NII will make possible expanded citizen access to Federal, State and Local information, (electronic town halls), or even the White House, providing an important tool for citizens to exercise their rights and responsibilities.

<li>The NII will improve the way adult literacy is addressed by providing opportunities to learn in convenient settings -- at home, at work, in libraries -- at times convenient to the users.  New multimedia learning tools and graphical interfaces will mak
e learning literacy skills easier.

</ul>

<p><b>Goal 6:	By the year 2000, every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and will offer a disciplined environment to learning.</b></p>



<p>Technology will not cure the societal problems that are making learning more difficult in many schools.  However, it can help create an environment in which the preconditions for drugs and violence are minimized.  Students that are excited, engaged, an
d challenged by the education system are less likely to turn to destructive behavior.  The NII will be a tool to engage students in meaningful, innovative, and interesting learning experiences as well as to directly address specific behavior problems via 
interactive programs.</p>

<ul>

<li>Innovative student assistance programs implemented with electronic support can provide anonymous and accurate information about specific problem areas to curious students or students-at-risk.

<li>Information technologies will support interdisciplinary research and development to produce educational products that address drug and alcohol abuse and an array of drug prevention and counseling techniques that can be made available to parents and te
achers electronically.

<li>Linking schools with community organizations, the police and other public safety agencies will facilitate communication among these agencies and assist in identifying trouble spots or issues before they erupt into classroom violence.

</ul>

<hr>
<h2 align=center>Research Challenges</h2>



<p>Delivery of advanced educational and learning services will be enabled by and built on richly varied and interoperable communications and computing technologies interconnecting millions of people with huge amounts of information and media services from
 public institutions and private enterprises.  While many of the technologies necessary to make this happen already exist, several research challenges must be addressed to achieve the vision:</p>

<ul>

<li>Improved end-user experience, including development of easy to use interfaces, such as speech and character recognition, common presentation and search languages, and information retrieval and analysis techniques.

<li>Improved authoring and service creation techniques, including multimedia authoring techniques, simulation software, and techniques for digitizing libraries.

<li>Improved platform technologies, such as reliable and fair mechanisms for protecting and publishing intellectual property, multi-user multimedia servers, distributed computer architectures, and multi-user multimedia conference bridges.

<li>Improved network connectivity, performance, and reliability, including interoperability between local telephone exchanges, wireless networks, cable networks, regional carriers, and national and international long distance service providers; low cost a
nd reliable two-way wireless communications; low cost high performance networks providing variable bandwidth on-demand, guaranteed latency, virtual circuits, and multi-point synchronization; and scaleable, consistent and pervasive network addressing and d
irectory schemes.

<li>Visualization technologies, to make it easier for students to see and understand difficult concepts, especially involving complex scientific data.

</ul>

<p>In addition to meeting the research challenges, effective deployment of an advanced computing and communications infrastructure for education and lifelong learning requires well trained and technologically experienced teachers and administrators.  Educ
ators must be able to facilitate the use, installation, and management of new instructional technologies, such as digital interactive video, local area networks, and gateways to national networks.  Users and students will need new skills to help them retr
ieve, review, categorize, and analyze the information and knowledge they will be able to access.  This will require investment in training for educators and students in the use of new technologies, development of model curricula, new instructional techniq
ues, development of new information resources, improvement in the quality of existing resources, and extension of public access to electronic schools and libraries. </p>
 
 
<p>The NII will make all kinds of information instantly accessible at the fingertips, regardless of where the information is physically located.  It will enable individuals of all abilities to create their own information resources for distribution across
 the nation.  This will help remove some of the traditional barriers to learning, such as distance, access to resources, gender, race, and differences in ability.  However, the NII must reduce, rather than exacerbate existing differences between technolog
y-rich and information-rich schools and communities and schools and communities that are less well-equipped.  Initiatives to increase the use of information technologies in classrooms must include specific measures to ensure access to the necessary basic 
technologies, including computers, network connections, and databases.  This will have to address how to account for the costs associated with incorporating new technologies -- including training people to use them, given the restrictive budgets most educ
ation institutions have available for new investments. </p>
 
 
 
<p>For the benefits and capabilities of the NII to become ubiquitous and universal, ease of use, simplicity of training, and interoperability across different vendors' systems is important.  Schools and communities will want to leverage their existing inv
estments and ensure that future investments are protected.  TVs will be critical at the implementation level if the sharing of information and resources among localities, states, regions, and nations is to be encouraged.</p>

<hr>
<h2 align=center>Recommended Demonstration Projects</h2>



<p>Many of the technologies necessary to bring exciting, effective information technology applications to classrooms, homes, business training centers, and community learning centers are available.  However, experience is still needed to integrate the tec
hnologies in ways that are easy to use and scaleable to the size and complexity needed to accommodate a very large number of school districts, colleges and universities, homes, and users.  Demonstration projects that focus on large-scale use of informatio
n technologies in classrooms, work places, and homes will test new ways of using information technologies in real-world settings, help identify technological and other barriers to widespread implementation of the techniques and technologies that work, and
 stimulate the adoption of innovative solutions by users. </p>
 
 
 
<b><p>Assessment of Ongoing Efforts </p></b>
 
<p>Many public and private schools and education institutions at all levels are planning to make major investments over the next ten years in experimental educational services.  These projects will be funded by a wide variety of private and public sector 
entities.  In this time of scarce public and private funds, both federal and private investments in educational technology must be based on the most effective instructional models.  In order to rapidly deploy proven effective instructional models, and to 
avoid very expensive redundant investment and costly repeated failures, CSPP recommends expanding the Department of Education's clearinghouse for gathering and disseminating information on ongoing public and private programs to integrate information techn
ologies into education and lifelong learning activities. </p>
 
 
 
<b><p>Recommended Demonstration Projects </p></b>
 
<p>It is equally important to move education reform forward both by applying existing technologies in increasingly more effective and innovative ways and by adopting breakthrough technologies as they emerge.  CSPP recommends allocating funds for new proje
cts that demonstrate innovative curricula and teaching methods within the context of the existing computing and networking technology base.  Funding should also be allocated for the use of existing technology in applications that foster collaboration and 
efficiency by integrating the instructional and administrative areas of educational institutions. </p>
 
 
 
<p>Technology advances in wireless LANS, speech synthesis and recognition, pen computing, extensions to multimedia technology, video conferencing, virtual reality, high speed, cost-effective communications networks, and other advances hold promise for enh
ancing, even transforming, the learning process and for providing effective and efficient management of our educational system.  As breakthroughs in technology take place, on going funding of leading edge demonstration projects will ensure that </p>
 
 
<p>Technological progress in education will continue to keep pace with other segments of the United States infrastructure. </p>
 
 
 
<p>The following are examples of the types of demonstration projects that would illustrate the potential range of education and lifelong learning applications:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>On-line Libraries </b>-- Develop and make available on-line at job sites information and knowledge on a wide variety of subject matter, including career and job training materials and federally-developed information.  This should include performanc
e support networks that would provide task-oriented information on job sites to make learning and job performance improvement incremental and casual rather than formal and intermittent.



<li><b>Electronic Librarian </b>-- Develop an electronic librarian capability for use by students in the classroom or at home, which would include tools to permit efficient literature reviews, identification and acquisition of relevant statistical data, a
nalysis and presentation of data, and searches of textual and multimedia information.

<li><b>Virtual Laboratories & Field Trips </b>-- Set up classroom virtual laboratories that would allow students to perform science experiments using equipment and facilities located anywhere in the United States and take "field trips" to museums, observa
tories, science exhibits, and research centers without leaving the classroom.  Students would experiment using computer simulations that would otherwise be too dangerous or too expensive to conduct on site.

<li><b>Preschool/Head Start/Schools of Education Network </b>-- Establish a network that would link preschools, head start programs and schools of education in a region or across the country that would make available innovative curricula and programming s
pecifically for day care, preschool, and head start facilities.

<li><b>Community-based Education and Vocational Resource Centers </b>-- To ensure greater access for traditionally underprivileged or economically depressed areas to the burgeoning resources of the NII, establish an initiative that gives priority access t
o community agencies offering job training and placement.  The initiative should target community based organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs and YWCAS, local schools that offer after-school hours, and other community learning centers.  Th
ese centers could be linked to job and training resources in a Jobs Clearinghouse that posts job information from state Divisions of Employment Security and private sector personnel offices.  The Clearinghouse should include a browsing/indexing interface 
so users can locate the job listings they are best suited for and a means for users to submit their resumes electronically to potential employers listed in the database.

<li><b>The Internet as Library </b>-- Give secondary-school students research projects on current topics and provide full Internet access (on-demand) as a data and information resource.  Students would learn to use the Internet resources to find experts a
nd data sources world-wide.  This should include evaluation of the quality of projects compared to students using traditional "library" methods, and evaluation of the students' abilities in and understanding of information gathering.

<li><b>Literacy Assistant </b>-- Develop an interface to on-line information resources for the "textually-challenged" to enable workers with poor literacy skills to access the information that is available, including basic literacy improvement tools, buil
t-in basic pictorial dictionaries, audio translators (text-to-audio readers), and reformatters for minimally-literate users.  A demonstration project could explore how much minimally-literate users will use on-line information if they have text-to-audio t
ranslators, how quickly they will become literate as they see what information is available, and to what extent information technologies can help make information available to minimally-literate adults.

<h2 align=center>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Information technologies are rapidly becoming available that will 
make learning more effective, more accessible, more interesting, and 
more convenient for reamers of all ages.  Through the NII, these 
technologies will be available to meet the education
 and training needs of Americans in classrooms, homes, at work, and in 
community public facilities.  Through new applications of information 
technologies, the NII will enable unemployed workers to train for new 
careers and employed workers to upgrade their skills to meet changing 
workplace demands; it will make learning exciting for students, from 
preschoolers to graduate students; it will allow teachers to create and 
customize multimedia curricula on demand; and it will turn community 
centers into information gateways for a host of network-based 
resources.  A coordinated effort among federal agencies, through 
programs that complement and supplement efforts by private, state, and 
public service organizations, will help bring the benefits of 
information technologies to the U.S. education and lifelong learning 
system.</p>

<p><b><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a> </b></p>
 
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) outlined its vision for an enhanced National Information Infrastructure ( NII) in its January 1993 report, <i>Perspectives on the National Information Infrastructure</i>, which also recommended a joint effort between the Administration, Congress and the private sector to accelerate the development and deployment of the  NII.  In CSPP's vision, the  NII is an advanced information infrastructure that will be accessible to all Americans anytime, anywhere that will allow all Americans to take advantage of our rich resources in information, communication, and computing technologies.  The  NII will integrate four essential elements -- communications networks, computers, information, and people - to create a whole new way of learning, working and interacting with others.  It will put information technologies to work to benefit people through improved access to health care, better education opportunities, more efficient manufacturing processes and business practices, and easier access to all kinds of information and government services. </p>
 
 
 
<p>In order for this vision to become a reality, investments are needed in research on the underlying technologies that are critical to the NII's further enhancement and evolution.  The private sector is already investing heavily in a wide range of research on information technologies and applications.  The Administration's High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program, and in particular the Program's Information Infrastructure Applications Technologies component, is an excellent step in support of the private sector's efforts to lay the research foundation for the  NII.  To help guide federal R&D funding prioritization decisions in order to better meet the nation's needs for an enhanced  NII, this paper describes the research needed to advance nine technology areas that CSPP considers critical to enable the  NII, and identifies specific research needs in each of those areas that would benefit from federal funding support. </p>
 
 
 <hr>
<h2><a name="government">GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT </a></h2>
 
<p>The private sector has the primary responsibility for developing and deploying the  NII and is investing significant amounts in R&D to advance the necessary technologies.  However, there are certain pre-commercial research challenges -generally long-term and high risk -- that are beyond the scope of any single company.  In these cases, the federal government, with private sector input, has a role in funding research and in promoting collaborative work among industries, academia, and government labs.  Universities, government labs, and private industry should all participate in carrying out such research.  Pilot projects that will apply and integrate advanced technologies must involve users and private sector participants as well as technology providers and academic researchers. </p>
 
 
<p><b>Testbeds and Demonstration Projects </b></p>
 
<p>It is important to address, apply, and integrate the nine technology areas identified in this paper in  NII pilot projects to obtain near-term feedback on the most pressing problems, on what technology works, and where more work is needed.  Pilot projects will help to rapidly develop and integrate needed technologies, to make them responsive to real requirements, and ultimately, to achieve the NII goals as expeditiously as possible.  Testbeds and demonstration projects should focus on precommercial areas and should include benchmarking of present status, agreed-upon evaluation processes, and a mechanism for technology information dissemination to take advantage of the outcome.  To the extent possible, demonstrations of the use of information technologies should include testing and deployment in appropriate government institutions. </p>
 
 
 
<p>Funding of NII pilot projects should be based on the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relative importance of the pilot application to national goals.
Healthcare, manufacturing, and education should be given highest priority.  High priority should also be placed on pilot projects focused on government and library applications.<br>

<li>Quality and aggressiveness of the proposal, with respect to the scope of work and to how hard it pushes the technology envelope.<br>

<li>Likelihood of the participants to successfully complete the proposed work and to transfer resulting new technologies into robust commercial products.

</ul>

<p>In order to make best use of its R&D resources, the U.S. government should develop a set of guidelines for determining when a given technology, demonstration project, or testbed is precommercial (thus qualifying for government R&D support) and when it has matured to be competitive (therefore best addressed by competing commercial providers).  When funding R&D on precommercial technologies, the government should develop a plan for how it will phase out its role as the technologies, demonstration projects, and testbeds evolve and become competitive. </p>
 
 <hr>
<h2><a name="goals">GOALS FOR THE  NII</a></h2>
 
<p>To bring the benefits of information technology to all Americans, the  NII must be powerful enough to carry voice, video, and text simultaneously, provide two-way interactive capabilities when users need them, be easily accessible by users with widely varying skills and abilities, operate across different technologies and media, provide the right amounts of reliability and security, and be flexible enough to grow to meet the changing demands of an increasing number of users, all at a cost that makes it affordable to large numbers of users. </p>
 
 
<p>The information technologies of the  NII must provide the underpinning needed to advance and support large-scale applications in healthcare, education, manufacturing, and access to government information and services.  To focus on one application area for example, NII technologies, as they mature and are integrated and deployed, will help improve the quality and the efficiency of the U.S. healthcare industry.  Through the use of advanced information technology, the healthcare industry will shift from using information technology to perform basic data processing tasks like client and insurance billing and hospital management to using it for a wide variety of advanced applications aimed at providing better and more efficient client care and training of healthcare professionals.  The following are a few examples of how the delivery of healthcare can be improved through advancements in the  NII technologies identified in this paper:</p>


<ul>
<li>Medical libraries, medical schools, and reference labs across the U.S. will develop large data warehouses of medical specialty image and video data (hematology, cytology, surgical, diagnostic, etc.) for reference, education, and advanced training.  Heterogeneous computer systems at major medical schools and hospitals will be joined via wide bandwidth data networks to share and update this valuable information.  Using intuitive visual inquiry and navigation computer interfaces, physicians and students will routinely access this national data resource to remain informed about the best, most successful medical practices.<br>



<li>Secure medical information networks will revolutionize the provision of daily care.  Private physicians, dentists, clinics, HMOs, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities will be linked directly to insurance companies and government agencies in a highly secure, heterogeneous records management system.  Millions of standardized transactions per day for claims, payments, and logistics will be created and transmitted across this network -- dramatically reducing paperwork, loss, waste, and delays that plague the healthcare data processing infrastructure today.  Healthcare workers will be able to instantly determine the status of claims and electronic fund transfer payments for which they are authorized.<br>

<li>Medical dictation and transcription will be revolutionized by new user interface technologies, such as speech recognition systems with dozens of custom vocabularies for particular medical specialties (radiology, cardiology, pathology).  Doctors on rounds in the hospital will dictate to and make corrections on an electronic tablet -- a speech-enabled, portable computer with handwriting recognition and wireless connection to the hospital's clinical information system.  Turnaround time on patient reports will go from hours (or days) to minutes.
<br>


<li>Electronic "charts" and clinical information systems will provide the physician and the hospital or HMO staff with a single view of the text and data gathered about the patient from all sources while in the facility -- including the admitting clerks, doctors, nurses, monitoring equipment, operating room, specialty labs, pharmacy, dietitian, and social workers.  Complete, accurate, up-to-the-minute data from all the departments servicing the patient will improve the quality of care and reduce errors resulting from missing or incorrect information.

<br>

<li>Advancements in high-performance, affordable multimedia technologies and development of easy to use systems will enable the delivery of customized healthcare education to patients.  Users will be able to access information "on-demand" about topics such as AIDS, pre-natal care, smoking, and lung cancer, using interactive video (with questions and answers).  On-demand video would also provide in-home treatment information, thus enabling more comfortable and lower cost home treatment in place of frequent outpatient or emergency room episodes.  In an emergency, a doctor could "demand" video to his home, office, or another location to receive information or image data on an ill-patient.

<li>Wireless networks and powerful portable computers will enable emergency workers to access medical information during a natural disaster and assist in coordinating relief activities, evacuation, medical supplies, and triage.

</ul>

<p>To help achieve these and other potential benefits of  NII technologies, CSPP recommends that the private sector, with complementary government support, invest in research to meet the following nine technology goals:</p>

<ul>

<b>1. Scalability: </b>The  NII must be able to grow in many dimensions as the number of network users and access points increases, as the demand for greater and expanded capacity grows, and the heterogeneity of the NII components and user requirements increases.<br><br>

<b>2.  lnteroperability: </b>The NII will be comprised of many interconnected, diverse systems, applications, and services.  These systems must be interoperable -- able to communicate with each other so users do not have to make major adjustments to account for differences in different products or services.<br><br>



<b>3. Robustness of Networks: </b>The  NII will be composed of a large number of communications networks that are interconnected to form a synergistic internetwork which must be reliable, dependable, and available at needed bandwidths on demand.<br><br>



<b>4. Security and Authentication: </b>As the  NII grows, a vast amount of information will	be collected, transmitted, stored, and manipulated electronically.  This information must	be protected against unauthorized access, tampering, and misuse, consistent with the needs of the applications and the desires of the user.  New policies will also be needed to ensure the protection of privacy rights in the digital information era.<br><br>



<b>5.  Integrity and Robustness of Data Storage: </b>As vast quantities of data become available on-line, businesses, governments, and individuals will increasingly rely on being able to have timely access to accurate information.  This will require information providers to be able to ensure round the clock access to information and to protect against natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and system failures.<br><br>



<b>6.	Database Technology:  </b>NII applications will require efficient and effective methods	to access, create, share, search, manage, and manipulate very large amounts	of distributed and diverse forms of information.  This will require information management, processing, and searching capabilities at a scale heretofore not possible.<br><br>



<b>7.	Multimedia Technologies: </b>The convergence of telecommunications, broadcast, cable, and computing technologies offers the promise of a new way of information processing and communication.  With this new "multimedia technology" people will be able to access information and communicate in video, voice, text and data formats.  Multimedia services will be essential to a number of  NII applications, such as collaborative work by people in remote locations, work-at-home, distance learning, and telemedicine, as well as home shopping and interactive entertainment.<br><br>



<b>8.  Ease of Use: </b>The services provided by the NII will require user interfaces that are easy and natural to use by users with varied backgrounds and competency levels.  Graphical user interfaces, handwriting recognition, voice recognition, touch screens, and intelligent agents will help make the  NII easy to learn and use.<br><br>



<b>9.	Affordability and High Performance: </b>To be widely used, the  NII will require very	high performance technologies that are, at the same time, affordable.  Over the last	decade, many of the underlying technologies that will enable  NII applications, including high speed networking, high performance computers, and very fast microprocessors, have been improving at orders of magnitude rates, driving large increases in performance at lower cost.  These rates of increase must be sustained, and in some cases accelerated, to obtain the performance rates and affordable costs that will make NII technologies widely accepted.

</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="recommendations">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND R&D INVESTMENT</a></h2>



<p>The further advancement of the above  NII technology goals will require industry leadership and federal R&D funding support.  In the following section, CSPP identifies, for each goal, the critical technologies necessary to achieve the goal and the priority research areas appropriate for federal funding support.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="scalability">Scalability</a></h2>

<p><b>A.	Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1.	Network Topology </b>-- The enhanced  NII will grow to provide ubiquitous connectivity to a large proportion of the general population.  Research is needed on how users will connect to the  NII, particularly as wireless access to networks grows, and how the connection mechanisms and architectures will expand to accommodate new users as the NII grows.  The network topology of the  NII will have important effects on the management of the networks that make up the infrastructure.
<br><br>


<b>2. Addressing </b>-- Each user of the  NII will require a unique address (or name), analogous in some ways to a telephone number.  A location independent method for finding users will be needed, along with "directory information" services.<br><br>



<b>3.	Forwarding </b>-- Since users are likely to access computing resources through	the NII from a variety of locations and also while mobile, mechanisms must be	provided to forward user data and messages to wherever the user is currently accessing the  NII.  Ideally, this will be handled transparently by the addressing scheme.  The addressing scheme should be targeted toward people and services, rather than physical places.
<br><br>


<b>4.	Applications </b>-- As technology advances and users' needs change, new NII applications will evolve.  This will require software that allows application development independent of the underlying infrastructure.  This software should provide bandwidth-independent interface paradigms, so that an application will provide the same basic functionality over links with widely varying bandwidth, with additional features available at higher bandwidths.  For example, an application might provide an iconic or still-picture interface over a low-bandwidth interconnect, but full-motion video over an interconnect capable of providing the necessary bandwidth.  The capability to construct applications independent of the underlying network protocols will also be important.<br><br>



<b>5.	Physical </b>-- Much work is needed to ensure that the NII's various transmission media, including, for example, fiber networks, All Optical Networks, wireless networks, cable television systems, and telephone service ISDN connections, will work seamlessly together, will accommodate new media, technologies, and applications as they become available, and will extend to new users.
<br><br>


<b>6. Name and Directory Services </b>-- Services will be required to locate resources and services available through the NII, particularly as the  NII grows, becomes more heterogeneous, supports greater user mobility, and adds new services.  Providers of new products and services will want information about the availability of such products to be easy to find by users.
<br><br>


<b>7. Distributed Information System Architecture </b>-- The NII will be a distributed information system of unparalleled proportions, in terms of numbers and types of users and uses, overall scale, complexity, and sheer volume of information.  Improvements are needed in techniques for architecting such large, complex systems to work efficiently, including how functionality should be apportioned in the infrastructure.  This should include how the multitude of distributed services -- such as transaction management, storage management, query management and execution, security, billing, administration, and others will efficiently and effectively interact to meet user needs.
<br><br>
</ul>

<p><b>B.  Scalability Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>Scalability research that would benefit from government support includes the development of techniques to synchronize network resource databases that are distributed among many organizations; architecting databases to maintain coherence and reliability when network configurations (which these databases affect) change; techniques for providing services to an ever-increasing number of users, including work on directory and locator services; and development of software to support the evolution of common NII services.  Understanding how to build a scaleable NII requires knowledge of the practical problems encountered when the size of the infrastructure grows dramatically.  This can be best addressed through testbeds that provide information services to many users.  Scalability of databases is very important and is covered in the Database section of this paper. </p>
 
<p>The government, with private sector input, can complement industry R&D efforts on scalability by investing in research in the following areas:</p>

<ul>

<b>High Priority</b><br>
Large scale testbeds of heterogeneous components and technologies<br><br>



<b>Medium Priority</b><br>
      Directory and location services<br>
     Addressing<br>
     Common software environment/interfaces
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="interoperability">Interoperability</a></h2>

<p>The enhanced  NII will consist of many different physical components,including:	information appliances, from smart televisions and portable wireless computers	to high-end workstations and supercomputers; communications networks using a variety of technologies -- cable, telephone, wireless, satellite, and others; and databases and information services, such as government documents and data, libraries, private bulletin boards, interactive games and shopping, public service information and government services, education programs, and medical information.  These different pieces of the  NII will be built, supplied, and maintained by hundreds of different vendors, as well as by individuals and government agencies.  lnteroperability -- the ability of different systems to work together -- at key locations in the  NII will ensure that these components will work together and communicate with each other.  This will allow any user to get the information he needs and communicate with the people he needs to, as easily, quickly, and transparently as he can with today's telephone system, and any provider of information to make it available through the NII. </p>
 
<p>As described in CSPP's February, 1994 paper, Perspectives on NII Interoperability, achieving an interoperable  NII requires an industry-led strategy to ensure that the specifications for certain interfaces at critical locations in the infrastructure are open. </p>
 
 
 
<p><b>A.     Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal </b></p>
 
<p>While interoperability is best addressed by the private sector, government support for research on new testing techniques will help accelerate the private sector's adoption of open interfaces.  For example, to guarantee that NII components work together smoothly and seamlessly, research is needed on improved techniques to test and verify interoperability of interface implementations.  A neutral forum in which industry could demonstrate the interoperability of such implementations would help increase end user confidence that various NII components will work together. </p>
 
<p><b>B.	lnteroperability Research and Development Funding Priorities </b></p>
 
<p>Federal investments in research in the following areas will complement private sector efforts to develop open NII interfaces.</p>


<ul>
<b>High Priority</b><br>
	Interoperability demonstration forum<br><br>

<b>Medium Priority</b><br>
	Test methodology<br>
      lnteroperability certification techniques
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="robustness">Robustness of Networks</a></h2>

<p><b>A.     Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1.	Network Management </b>-- The NII will be made up of many interconnected, interdependent networks using a variety of technologies.  This will require new techniques for network management to ensure the different networks work together.  With vast quantities of data, applications, and services on-line, businesses, governments, and individuals will increasingly depend on being able to access such information in a timely manner.  This requires dependability, from the requester through the networks to the server and back, for all critical NII services.<br><br>
<ul>
<i>a.	Network Planning </i>- The operation of networks changes as the load imposed	by users changes.  Increased network load may lead to failure of a network	that was stable at a lower level of usage.  Being able to track and analyze long term network trends is critical for the reliability and stability of large internetworks.  Today's network management tools are aimed at detecting faults and correcting malfunctions in stand-alone networks, and are not capable of collecting and analyzing the large amounts of data that will be required to support the internetworks that make up the  NII as it evolves.  Methodologies must be developed for collecting and abstracting relevant data and using it as input in simulation- and analytical-based predictive capacity planning tools.<br><br>



<i>b.	Integration of Networks </i>-- Current network management systems practices focus on using monitoring devices, such as bridges, routers, and subscriber attachments, with emphasis on conveying the device-oriented data to the network management console.  The ability to control a network's operations is typically limited to setting individual device parameters.  As the size and complexity of a network increases, the management task grows more complex, and the device-oriented method must be replaced by an integrated system view that takes into account the load placed on the network by mobile users.  As the  NII evolves and network management challenges grow more complex, systems should be able to respond to a wide variety of situations automatically, without human intervention.  Additionally, presentation services for network management data must be developed that include methods for visualizing and interpreting the management data generated from extremely large internetworks.  These services will provide a means to understand internetwork operational trends and identify management actions required for proper internetwork operation.
<br><br>


<i>c.	Network Operations </i>-- The current state-of-the-art for network management must be expanded to include methodologies and tools for dealing with the network management issues encountered in extremely large internetworks, which include multiple, distributed, autonomous domains and multiple, cooperating managers and interdomain management by multiple, mutually suspicious managers.  These tools must address synchronization and conflict resolution issues between multiple managers.</ul>
<br>
<b>2.	Engineering a More Reliable lnternetwork</b>
<ul>
<i>a.	Network Design </i>-- The  NII will include an extremely large internetwork of both wired and wireless networks.  Methodologies and tools are needed to assist network designers in designing reliable and robust network interconnects in order to produce internetworks that will meet specified reliability and robustness criteria.<br><br>

<i>b.	Policy Routing Algorithms </i>-- The NII's internetwork will be comprised of dissimilar domain types.  For example, one domain may provide for low latency guaranteed delivery, while another may provide slower, unguaranteed handling of traffic.  Methods and techniques must be developed to reconcile these differences so that traffic generated in one domain requiring a specific class of service (e.g., bandwidth or protocol) can be handled, delivered to, or through, another domain with dissimilar abilities.  Policy routing is important to ensure reliability for two reasons.  First, the behavior of the networks that comprise the  NII should be repeatably predictable when users attempt to route between two dissimilar domains.  Second, due to outages of communication links and nodes, it may be necessary to transparently reroute traffic on an alternate path through domains that have very different characteristics.<br><br>

<i>c.	Engineering Protocols and Routing Algorithms </i>-- The internetworks of the NII will grow and change over time.  Tools and methods will be needed to provide a high level of assurance that the components of the NII will function correctly when they are connected in the  NII internetwork environment.  Improved methods for specifying protocols and designing, implementing, validating and verifying protocol implementations applied to interdomain routing protocols and algorithms are needed to increase the reliability and availability of the components of the  NII.<br><br>

<i>d.     Reliable Protocols and Routing Algorithms </i>-- Research is needed to design protocols and routing algorithms that provide reliable service in the face of planned or unplanned network changes (topological and operational).  These protocols and routing algorithms must: be able to rapidly respond to changes in the network topology that are caused by either component failures or by reconfiguration of the internetwork; be able to accommodate the requirements of the mobile network user, such as connections implemented on physical circuits that may not be permanent or physically reliable; be designed to be manageable; interface with network management systems and provide data that describes the state of the internetwork; and be able to make use of redundant paths in networks in order to provide enhanced reliability as well as load balancing.<br><br>

<i>e.	Hardware Dependability Technology </i>-- Research is required to determine how transients affect logic and memory circuits, and how VLSI scaling will affect transient error rates.  Improved computer aided design (CAD) tools to ensure design correctness, new design-for-test methods, and on-line techniques to detect errors before they can corrupt the data are needed.  In addition, high quality resilient power, perhaps including new battery technologies, could benefit from additional research.<br><br>


<i>f.	Software Dependability Technology </i>-- With new  NII services and applications being developed, software engineering research is needed in areas of software fault modeling, design test, and verification of the NII services for the ability to tolerate arbitrary failures, fault recovery and discovery.</ul><br></ul>

<p><b>B.	Network Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>The federal government can help the private sector advance the reliability,
availability, dependability, and robustness of networks by focusing research in the
following areas:</p>
<ul>
<b>High Priority</b><br>
	Network interconnection methodologies and tools<br>
      Reliable protocols and routing algorithms<br><br>

<b>Medium Priority</b><br>
     Tracking and analyzing long term network trends<br>
	Network management methodologies<br>
     Reliable network connections</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="security">Security and Authentication</a></h2>

<p><b>A.	Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>

<p>Many of the technologies needed to provide the security people will need for their	NII applications already exist.  However, many of these technologies are available only in high security environments to protect the nation's most sensitive and classified information.  Making these technologies available for public use, along with reducing their cost, will significantly improve the security of information available through the  NII.  For technologies that are not currently available, research investments are needed to enable secure systems to access information, protect user identity, provide message encryption, and guarantee reliability of networks.</p>
<ul>
<b>1.	Access to Information</b>
<ul>
<i>a.	Controls </i>-- At present, access to information, communications, and computing resources is usually controlled by a combination of electronic and physical barriers, such as passwords and access to computer rooms, data centers, and buildings.  One computer's access to another is usually controlled primarily by the static structure of the underlying communication network.  These available systems of access control result in an inflexible and insecure network.  New technologies that would improve access controls include: 1) a family of international standards for 'smart cards' or other personal tokens to allow challenge and response authentications and to eliminate the passage of plain text passwords over the NII; and 2) similar cryptographic techniques for computer to computer access control.<br><br>

<i>b.	Auditing </i>-- Technologies will be necessary to record sufficient information about transactions or other events in a manner that will establish accountability for a later study of the records.  Often, it is difficult to select the correct events to audit or to analyze the audit trail once it has been collected, particularly if the system attempts to do real time intrusion detection.  Auditing is further complicated by the need to guarantee that the audit trail is not itself a threat to user security or privacy.</ul>

<b>2.	Identity Protection</b>
<ul>
<i>a.	Anonymous Transactions </i>-- With the adoption of electronic delivery of services, there will be increased demand for the ability to conduct anonymous transactions to protect the privacy rights of individuals and to protect against fraudulent users who might use anonymity to their advantage.  For example, an individual casting his electronic vote in a popular election will need to be guaranteed that his anonymity and security against fraud are protected.  Present techniques for both digital money and voting are cumbersome and fail to capture the precise qualities of more traditional forms.  Protocols for both anonymous voting and digital money are active topics of research in security and need to be improved.<br><br>

<i>b.	Authentication of Identity and Data </i>-- In many transactions, the identity of an individual or computer must be identified in the course of communication or computing.  Excellent cryptographic techniques for identity authentication are readily available, though not widely deployed.  Authentication is also necessary to determine that data, such as digital signatures, have not been altered in ways that change the meaning of the data.  Digital signatures can guarantee that the signed object has not been altered.  It is often difficult, however, to determine whether a person has signed his name to something more complex than just the intended message.  With authentication of digital signatures, the identity of a signator must be established so that a third party, not involved in the transaction, can be convinced of the signature identity and the signator cannot later deny having made his signature.  Data authentication will become more difficult as the NII fosters use of complex services, such as interactive simulations, as means of interpersonal communication.  Currently, digital signature schemes suitable to most computer communication applications are available, though not yet widely deployed.</ul>


<b>3.	Encryption</b>
<ul>
<i>a.	Message Traffic </i>-- Sensitive information may need to be encrypted so that	messages cannot be understood or produced by anyone who does not possess the secret keys.  Cryptographic keys function very much like passwords.  The keys are pieces of information with no intrinsic value that control access to valuable information.<br><br>

The public availability of cryptographic systems suitable for message encryption varies with speed:<br>
<ul>
<li>at 1 0 megabits	good
<li>at 1 00 megabits	fair
<li>at 1 gigabit	poor
<li>at 10 gigabits	non-existent
</ul>
Within the U.S., the most popular choice for message encryption is the Data Encryption Standard (FIPS 46) or multiple applications of this standard. However, this system is generally not exportable, which often makes reliable message encryption unavailable in international communications.<br><br>

<i>b.     Public Key Technology </i>-- Public key technology allows for the construction of cryptosystems controlled by corresponding pairs of keys that permit a message to be encrypted for authenticity or privacy independently.  Public key cryptography provides a flexible and secure mechanism for negotiating and transmitting keys used in electronic mail and interactive communications.  To guarantee secure communications, key management is essential in placing suitable keys in the possession of various pieces of cryptographic equipment.<br><br>

The current number theory based methods for encryption appear very strong.  The actual parameter sizes in use and proposed for many applications are too small for long term security.  The performance of current systems (in both size and speed) makes them unsuitable for some applications and the mathematical diversity of current systems is undesirably low.  A single breakthrough in discrete logarithms or integer factoring would be disastrous.  Consequently, it is important to develop additional methods based on different fields of mathematics.</ul>



<b>4.     Secure and Reliable Networks</b>
<ul>
<i>a.	Secure Computing </i>-- Users of the NII must be confident that the hardware and software perform as specified and cannot be undermined by untrusted programs or interacting resources.  More specifically, a user or system administrator must be able to guarantee that a security policy in a workstation, server, or network cannot be altered by another user.  All known techniques for demonstrating that cryptography programs of even modest complexity perform as intended are extremely expensive.  As a result, guarantees are limited to elementary security properties of essential programs so that a disaster will not occur if there is a malfunction in another part of the system.  Unfortunately, even this has proven ineffective and does not guarantee diverse kinds of correct functions required in many commercial applications.<br><br>



<i>b.	Strength and Security Assessment </i>-- Attacks to defeat a security system are often costly.  Users assess the security and strength of a crypto system through a combination of formal methods and penetration attempts.  The public community has had substantial success recently in developing cryptanalytic methods for strength assessment, but lacks confidence in any system that has not been studied for several years.  It is believed that there is no rigorous theory of resistance to cryptanalysis available anywhere in the world.  Presently, there does not exist a method for customers (individual or corporate) to protect themselves against trap doors installed, for whatever reason, by the suppliers.<br><br>


<ul>
1) Tamper Resistance -- Tamper resistant equipment must be built that can resist reverse engineering and operate unattended while concealing its operating parameters (often cryptographic keys) and perhaps its design.  Assessment of the tamper resistance of chips and other hardware is by and large an art proprietary to companies in the physical security or smart card businesses.  The quality of such assessments is open to debate.  Various techniques for building tamper resistant chips or packaging equipment in tamper resistant containers have been proposed, but none is readily available to the commercial security equipment designer.
<br><br>


2)	Electromagnetic Shielding -- Electromagnetic shields must be developed to protect information in computer and communication systems from being radiated or conducted to outsiders along unintended paths.  Assessment of the exploitability of electromagnetic emissions or the signal contamination depends largely on development of specialized test equipment and is virtually non-existent in the public domain.  An elaborate technology code named TEMPEST is employed by the military, but this technology is secret and its products have generally been more expensive, heavier, and bulkier than comparable unshielded equipment.  A public theory of electromagnetic shielding for security purposes, that could provide the basis for deciding how much shielding is required in commercial equipment, is lacking.</ul></ul>
</ul>


<p><b>B.    Security and Authentication Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>Because security technology has undergone extensive development in both the public and private sectors, many of the basic security mechanisms needed for the National Information Infrastructure already exist.  Nonetheless, there is a wide gap between our present situation and the tools we need to provide users with the security they will need for various NII applications.  The federal government can help close this gap by funding, in close cooperation with the private sector, research in the following areas.</p>

<ul>
<b>High Priority</b><br>

Development of security assessment methodology<br>
Efficient methods for anonymous transactions<br>
Super-high-speed cryptosystems<br>
Worldwide interoperable secure systems</ul>
<hr>

<h2><a name="integrity">Integrity and Robustness of Data Storage</a></h2>

<p><b>A.    Technologies needed to achieve the goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1.	New Storage Media and Devices </b>-- The evolution of the  NII will fuel enormous growth in the quantity of on-line data.  Today's storage devices are unlikely to be economic or provide adequate performance given the magnitude of growth in information.  Research should be focused on the development of new kinds of storage media and devices.  Particular focus should be given to improvements in cost per byte, higher storage density, and intrinsic reliability through the elimination of moving parts.  Consideration should be given to the development of hierarchical storage systems that migrate less frequently accessed data to slower, more cost effective storage media/devices over time.  Further research is needed on the extension of storage techniques such as holographic and molecular storage technologies.<br><br>



<b>2.	Size and Performance </b>-- The management of very large databases, on the order of petabytes (1 OA 12 bytes), represents a significant challenge for physical storage management techniques such as indexing, archiving, dumping/loading, reorganizing, partitioning, and sorting, as well as strategies for data retention and periodic deletion.  New data organization and query processing strategies will be needed to provide users with easier ways to locate data.  To accommodate databases that grow in size and usage over time, it will be important to devise scaleable systems, such as those that employ hierarchical storage strategies and multiprocessing approaches that can grow with needs to accommodate huge data sets, complex requests, and large numbers of users.  To avoid loss of data through media deterioration/volatility, tests must be devised and deployed for automatic monitoring of storage media, with alerts issued when it is necessary to migrate data to newer media.  To facilitate the administration of large scale databases, knowledge-based techniques must be devised to enable systems to be self-administering, e.g., by performing self-monitoring of activities and access patterns, self-indexing, and self-partitioning and reorganization.<br><br>



<b>3.	System Configuration and Maintenance </b>-- Even with today's specialized, high availability systems, scheduled down time is required to update key software.  Systems also require down time to deal with addition, deletion or backup of critical data.  Such down time will be poorly tolerated as the NII becomes a critical component of business and individuals' lives, with round the clock availability a necessity.  Research should be directed towards developing ways to maintain system access in the face of inevitable configuration and backup requirements.  Particular emphasis should be given to the problem of on-line upgrade of the operating system and other critical components.  Highest levels of availability will only be achieved through a systematic elimination of single points of failure and the need to change system components, software or configuration through planned outages.  Research should be directed towards eliminating these causes of system outage.<br><br>

<b>4. Multimedia Servers and Database Systems </b>--  NII databases will have to allow for efficient searching as well as delivery of high volumes of multimedia information, including handling combined coded and non-coded information.  The scheduling algorithms used in today's databases are optimized for most transaction throughput, and will not be adequate for multimedia servers, where audio and video information must meet real-time playback constraints.  Many applications will also require queries based on information content rather than coded indices.<br><br>



<b>5.	Aging Effects on Long-Term Storage </b>-- Although some information can be thought of as short lived, that is, having a finite useful life, the majority of information has long lasting value.  Once committed to data storage, information must continue to be safely stored for the foreseeable future.  Although typical storage devices such-as magnetic and optical disks have become more reliable, research is needed to understand the effects of aging and environmental impact on different media types.  Research in this area should also focus on the development of new storage media with stable and long lasting properties for information storage.  Given current limitations on media life, research should be conducted on the prediction of data loss and how and when to copy or upgrade information.  Models describing the long term characteristics of media degradation should be developed and incorporated into the long term storage strategy.<br><br>


<b>6.	High Speed Archiving Techniques </b>- As the volume of on-line data increases and availability requirements approach 100% up time, today's mechanisms for archiving and making backup copies of information will become too slow.  The majority of today's on-line archival techniques require either that data is maintained in a read-only state or captures updated information to deal with change.  As the NII evolves, the ability to access the state of information at a particular time will become a requirement.  Archiving evolving data will become common place.  Research is needed to develop new techniques and approaches to achieve data capture of large quantities of data and strategies for dissemination as needed.  Research is also required to achieve rapid access to archived data through storage hierarchies and other techniques.<br><br>



<b>7.  Protection From Malicious Corruption </b>-- Significant impact to businesses and individuals will result if information in the NII is corrupted through malicious intent.  While physical and logical computer security can address these concerns to some degree, accurate and high performance techniques are required to facilitate real-time monitoring of information and to enable the immediate freezing of access upon detection of corrupted data in order to prevent decisions or actions being based on altered information.<br><br>

<b>8. Protection From Natural Disasters and System Failures </b>-- Perhaps the only viable approach to dealing with natural disasters and large system failures is redundancy of storage in widely separated geographic areas.  Specific research is needed to facilitate high speed, distributed mirroring of information while maintaining data integrity and accessibility.</ul>



<p><b>B.	Data Storage Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>Research on data storage should be directed toward architecture and system management strategies and how these interact with user models and data "popularity." Selected focus should also be given to material physics and storage mechanisms where expertise exists or could be developed or expanded.  Federal funding, with private sector input, should be targeted in the following areas.</p>


<ul>
<b>High Priority</b><br>
	New storage media<br>
     Size and performance of storage media<br>
     System configuration and management issues<br><br>

<b>Medium Priority</b><br>
	Long term storage<br>
      Protection from malicious corruption<br>
      Protection from natural disasters<br>
	High speed archiving techniques<br>
      Multimedia servers and database systems</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="database">Database Technology</a></h2>

<p><b>A.	Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1.	Integration and Distribution </b>-- A current pressing need in and across industries is to provide integrated and ready access to independently developed and autonomous data systems.  The problem of enabling a company or an industry to gain such access is commonly called the "legacy problem." Virtually every major business and government agency suffers from the legacy problem, and solutions to it have the potential to dramatically improve operational efficiencies of these organizations.<br><br>



The capability to provide point-to-point access to distributed information is well in hand.  However, the ability to correlate and semantically integrate information from multiple sources must be devised, to free each individual user from the burden of performing such integration manually.  This capability should include the ability to seamlessly integrate information from multiple sources, multiple data models, and multiple data formats, e.g., records, text, images, audio, multidimensional sensor data, and many others.  Research is needed on devising a multi-database capability, which will enable users to develop, maintain, and efficiently use a single "logical view" of multiple databases, obtain a consistent view of the data, and have transparent access to the underlying multiple sources.<br><br>


<b>2.	Intelligent Information Systems </b>-- Research is needed to develop enriched information systems that can: process, reduce, abstract and fuse data to make it more useful; represent, manipulate, and search approximate and/or fuzzy information; use semantic information to dramatically improve query performance; and apply rule-based reasoning within and across information systems to derive answers to queries (some applications of the latter have been called information dredging or mining).  In addition, capabilities must be devised for pattern recognition on data-rich forms of information, including images, multidimensional data, and voice segments, to greatly improve users' ability to find such information without exhaustive search.<br><br>

<b>3.	Mobile Computing/Computer Appliances </b>-- Technology advancements are needed to support mobile information devices or appliances in the synchronization of information between the mobile device and the source, and the ability to modify it in either or both places; caching strategies for efficient interoperation; small and specialized database management systems (DBMS) engines especially tuned for use on a portable computer; and easy and possibly transparent administration of mobile databases for lay users.<br><br>

<b>4. Multimedia Database Management </b>-- Multimedia data places quite different demands on a database management system than traditional record-based data.  Although today's multimedia servers have built-in data management systems tailored to these large volumes of information, they do not allow for index-based searching common to relational database systems, nor do they scale to handle the large volume that will be available through the NII.  For example, what does it mean to update an image?  Does it mean total replacement, or can one modify or enhance just part of the image?  If the latter, how is such an update expressed, and how is the image structured in storage to permit such an operation?  Also needed will be new query optimization, concurrency control, and transaction management techniques to support efficient use and sharing of multimedia data.<br><br>



<b>5.	Data Modeling and Representation </b>-- The more expressive a data model	is, the better able it is to capture the semantics of an application.  DBMSs	that support rich (object-oriented) data models seem best suited to a number of important services in the  NII, including information integration, meta-data repositories, dictionaries, and directories.  Experiments with object oriented DBMSs for such NII applications should be conducted, and their capabilities extended.  To free users from having to know the precise terms used in databases relevant to the query, capabilities should be developed for the semantic normalization of queries.  This capability would map query terms, using something similar to a thesaurus.  To facilitate data organization and presentation, techniques for data summarization and abstraction will be needed to capture high-level descriptions of documents, scientific data, and various collections of related items, including multimedia.  Finally, development of information representation and communication standards will become increasingly important for efficient use of the NII.  The standards must cover data models, query languages, electronic data interchange representations and protocols for all types of information, including documents, text, drawings, video, audio, and every other abundant form of information.<br><br>

<b>6. Customization for Specialized Applications </b>-- It is not feasible for any single database engine to anticipate and provide the necessary functionality to efficiently store, access, search, and manipulate the diverse forms of information available through the NII.  Research is needed on tool kits and piece parts to facilitate easy construction of specialized database management engines for multimedia and other diverse forms of information.  Such kits should provide for appropriate and customizable storage structures, search, update capabilities, query optimizer construction, concurrency control and transaction management.<br><br>
</ul>
<p><b>B.    Database Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>The government, with private sector input, should focus database R&D support in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<b>High Priority</b><br>
      Integration and distribution<br>
	Intelligent information systems<br><br>

<b>Medium Priority</b><br>
	Synchronization of information for mobile computing<br>

<hr>

<h2><a name="multimedia">Multimedia Technologies</a></h2>

<p><b>A.     Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1. Common Software Environment </b>-- Research is needed to develop common platforms and a common software environment within which multiple multimedia applications can function and be linked.  This is necessary so that entrepreneurs can write applications for the common software environment, rather than developing applications software repetitively for each distinct operating environment.<br><br>



<b>2. Display Technology </b>-- Advances are needed in display technology, combining high resolution and proper color-rendition with lightweight, space saving display screens.<br><br>



<b>3. Switching and Transport of Multimedia Signals </b>-- While significant bandwidth to support multimedia is available (or can be deployed) within the fiber-optic networks of many telecommunications transport providers, current network switching capabilities are limited in their ability to handle the varying combinations of information units that will arise in multimedia applications.  Emerging switching and transport techniques based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), for example, are aimed at providing support optimized for multimedia applications.  However, significant work needs to be done to develop "call control" and signaling techniques best suited to multimedia.  Industry needs to continue R&D and deployment of multimedia switching and transport technology.<br><br>

<b>4. Compression </b>-- Multimedia has a unique set of compression problems as one moves through the various media formats -- full motion video, image and text.  Full motion video transmissions can tolerate greater amounts of data loss than can transmissions of images, which, in turn, can tolerate greater losses than text transmissions.<br><br>
</ul>

<p><b>B.	Multimedia Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>Government support for private sector research in the underlying technologies to enable the development by industry of multimedia applications for the NII should be focused in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<b>High Priority</b><br>
	Display technology<br>
      "Call control" and signaling of multimedia<br>
	Common software environment<br><br>

<b>Medium Priority</b><br>
	Compression</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ease">Ease of Use</a></h2>

<p><b>A.	Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1. User Interfaces </b>- Research is needed to develop context-sensitive interface agents that are adaptable to individual styles of interaction with computers.  These agents will use models of the task, in conjunction with the user's and the appliance's capabilities, to determine what information to present, when to present it, and how to best present it; as well as how to best receive information and direction from the user.<br><br>

<b>2.	Media Models and 1/0 Techniques</b><br><br>
<ul>
<i>a.	Voice and Audio Processing</i>: Voice/audio processing is an important natural	interface application.  New voice/audio features are needed to match features available with current text processing.  More natural quality and affordable speech synthesis (with personal characteristics) systems are needed.
<br><br>


<i>b.	Pen-based systems: </i>Pen-based systems, such as Personal Digital Assistants or Personal Communicators, have recently been introduced as portable commercial products.  They are based on electromagnetic digitizer or resistive digitizer technologies and have mostly hand printing (as opposed to handwriting) recognition capabilities.  Pen-based systems technology has emerged as the new input medium supplementing keyboard for mobile applications.  Greater robustness in handwriting recognition capabilities of these systems is needed.  New techniques, such as "inking," which is a new data type that uses vector-based bit-map storing of chronological pen-specific stroke information such as pen's starting and ending-points, velocity, pressure, and color, are emerging to address this need.<br><br>

<i>c.	Touch and Gesture</i>: Research is needed to improve touch and gesture input techniques, which will be used for many  NII applications (particularly in applications that use virtual reality).</ul>

<b>3. Information Navigators and Visualizers </b>-- Workable navigation techniques with user-friendly interfaces are needed to help users access complex, widely distributed data in multiple formats.  Building a system that allows NII users to easily find the sources of information they are looking for is a challenge in itself, and the additional constraints of low cost and fast response create an important and difficult problem.  Advanced user interfaces to information resources will require new database access and data rendering techniques.  Advanced software will be needed to construct and maintain physical and logical databases, including integrated views of multiple databases.  New capabilities that help the user to browse data and formulate queries will be essential.  Research is also needed on ways to specify or otherwise construct user interest profiles and the infrastructure to continuously monitor selected sources and route matching information to the user.</ul>

<p><b>B.	Ease of Use Research and Development Funding Priorities</b></p>

<p>The private sector is investing heavily in research on technologies needed for a user friendly NII.  In addition to research on the following technologies, the federal government can support these efforts by increasing its investment in the development of personnel skilled in cognitive engineering or human factors.  Such professionals are needed to transform user cognitive and physical needs into easy to use product designs.</p>

<h2><a name="affordability">Affordability and High Performance</a></h2>

<p><b>A.	Technologies Needed to Achieve the Goal</b></p>
<ul>
<b>1. High Resolution Display Subsystems </b>-- Affordable high resolution displays will enable a multitude of new  NII applications and greater access to the NII.  High resolution display subsystems are needed that will support full motion video and provide image quality approaching that of printed material.  Mobile appliances will need displays of similar quality.  Also, the display architecture/standard must be scaleable, extensible, and open to allow display units, with higher/lower values of resolution, rates, and color, to produce a reasonable image.
<br><br>


<b>2.	High Speed Networking </b>-- In local area networks, many applications, such as video conferencing and client-server computing, require bandwidths of a few megabits per second (on a non-shared basis).  Other applications, however, such as designers using CAD/CAMs, will require much higher bandwidths.  The very high speed local area networks (LANS) (several hundred megabits per second) will be used for backbone LAN and supercomputer/high performance workstation interconnections.
<br><br>


<b>3.	Optoelectronics </b>-- Additional research on optoelectronic technologies will lead to the development of high capacity, lower cost, and low-maintenance transmission systems which will support the aggregation of multimedia applications and the provision of affordable bandwidth across a wide area.
<br><br>


<b>4.      All-Optical Networks </b>-- Advancements in All-Optical Networks (AONS) will increase the availability of low cost telecommunications capacity.<br><br>


<b>5.	Wireless Technologies </b>-- One of the critical technologies needed to realize the  NII goal of communication with anyone, anywhere, and any time is wireless technology.  Hand-held Personal Communicators capable of fax, electronic mail, voice and data communication through wireless medium have just appeared in the market, but are still not commonly affordable.  Today's cellular voice communication is mostly based on analog technology, but is gradually evolving to digital technology which improves spectrum efficiency and security.  Work is needed to increase the transmission speeds of wireless data networks.<br><br>

<b>6.	Interactive Video Technologies </b>-- Interactive video applications will be one of the major attractions of the NII.  Improvements in several technologies will be key to making interactive video affordable at adequate performance levels, including connection mechanisms that provide low-cost, simple interfaces with adequate bandwidth, and local processing and memory to meet the delivery constraints of real-time data at low cost.<br><br>

<b>7.	Computer-aided Software Engineering Tools </b>-- Advanced software engineering tools will be necessary to enable vendors to create affordable applications and content for the NII.  Today's software engineering techniques are adequate for addressing the creation of large scale applications, but have not been tested with a community of users as large, and applications as diverse, as those that would make up the NII.

<p>The NII is well on its way to becoming a reality.  The Administration and Congress are committed to addressing a number of policy issues that are inhibiting private sector investment in and deployment of new technologies.  In the meantime, significant research is being conducted by both the public and private sectors on an array of underlying technologies needed for a successful NII.  This paper is intended to provide guidance for federal policymakers as they develop R&D budget priorities for the HPCC and other research programs so they can best complement private sector research.</p>

<a name="executive>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>

<p>The concept of an improved and enhanced National Information Infrastructure (NII) has captured the American imagination.  Over the last several years, various industries, including the computer industry, have devoted significant time to outlining a vision for the NII - what could it and should it do? </p>
<p>Now, with a vision for the NII firmly in place, attention has shifted to how industry and government can work together to make that vision a reality.  CSPP believes interoperability is the key. </p>
<p>In this report, CSPP proposes an industry-led strategy to ensure interoperability in the NII, and proposes that the government support this strategy by following industry's lead and by working with industry to reach the interoperability goals for the NII.  CSPP is not suggesting an architecture for the NII.  Instead, CSPP has identified critical points in today's infrastructure that </p>
<p>must be	interoperable if the NII vision is to be successfully implemented.  The interfaces identified by CSPP fall into four categories:</p>

1.	Appliance to Network: the interface between an information appliance and a network service provider;<br><br>
2.	Appliance to Application: the applications programming interfaces (APIS) between an information appliance and emerging NII applications;<br><br>
3.	Application to Application: the protocols that one NII application, service, or system uses to communicate with another application service or system; and<br><br>
4.	Network to Network: the interfaces among and between network service providers.
</ul>
<p>Ensuring openness of the interfaces identified by CSPP will help advance critical NII goals.  In particular, open interfaces at the recommended locations will:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow users and providers to transmit information smoothly throughout the NIT;
<li>enable wide access by users and providers of information and services; and
   <li>stimulate competitive markets for NIT products and services.
</ul>
<p>The members of CSPP are prepared to work, through the appropriate standards bodies, to advance the openness of those interfaces that are within the computer industry's responsibility.  For inter-faces that fall within the responsibility of other industries, such as the local access provider interfaces, CSPP encourages those industries to develop similar strategies to ensure interoperability through the adoption of open, interoperable, and interconnected interfaces. </p>
<p>Finally, CSPP has identified a set of principles to help guide the industry led effort to achieve an interoperable NII and recommends that the government work with industry to facilitate reaching the interoperability goals for the NII.</p>

FROM VISION TO REALITY</b></p>


<p>Over the last several years, fewer issues have captured the American imagination more than the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  In fact, the concept of an improved and enhanced NII has become a primary focus for many industries including the computer, telecommunications, software, and entertainment industries.  It has also become a priority for policymakers in Congress and the Administration.  Legislation to accelerate industry's NII efforts has been introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The Clinton Administration, which has made the NII a cornerstone of its technology policy agenda, is examining a range of important NII-related policy issues, including privacy, intellectual property protection, and widespread access. </p>
<p>To date, NII efforts have focused mainly on defining a vision for the NII -- what is it and what should it do in the future'?  CSPP, for example, believes that by enhancing and integrating four essential components: 1) communications networks; 2) computers and information appliances; 3) information; and 4) people, the NII will create a whole new way of learning, working, and interacting with others.  The NII will link together public and private institutions and resources, from schools and businesses to libraries and laboratories.  More importantly, it will link together individuals, from senior citizens and students to healthcare professionals, manufacturing managers, and business people.  It will allow all Americans to take advantage of our nation's rich resources in information, communications, and computing technologies.  It will revolutionize the way individuals relate to one another by enabling them to work together and access, generate, store. process, transmit, and receive text, data, audio, images, video, and multimedia anywhere, at any time.  Distance, location, time, and language barriers will disappear as the NII evolves.  This vision is consistent with those articulated by other industries and by the Clinton Administration. </p>
<p>Now, with a vision for the future NII largely defined, work on the NII has shifted to how industry and government can work together to turn the vision into reality.  The news over the last several months has been replete with announcements of companies and industries joining together to design, build, or provide services over the NII.  While these alliances involve various entities -- both public and private -- and address different aspects of the NII, there is a common theme: the private sector is making the NII a reality. </p>
 
<p>The private sector's role in the NII is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop and make available the services, products, networks, information, and applications that will constitute the NII;
 <li>   continue to invest in NH-related research and development;
    <li>lead the development of standards for interoperability
<li>create an inter-industry forum on interoperability,,
<li>fund precommercial testbeds; and
<li>work with government to refine the NII vision and develop policy ground rules.  
</ul>
<p>As the private sector leads the way, the federal government has an important role to play as a catalyst and stimulator of private sector efforts.  CSPP believes the federal government can best support private sector efforts by:</p>
<ul>
<li>refining and promoting the vision for the NII and developing a government-industry-public interest partnership to oversee its implementation;

<li>funding research and development on precommercial technologies;

<li>investing in precommercial demonstration projects in socially beneficial areas such as education, healthcare, manufacturing, and access to government information and services;

    <li>making government information easily accessible electronically;

<li>supporting an industry-led strategy to ensure interoperability;

<li>implementing a political and regulatory climate that encourages the development of new technologies and enables competitive markets; and

<li>coordinating public and private action to address complex policy issues such as widespread access to the NII, privacy, security, carrier liability, intellectual property protection, and affordability.

<h2><a name="interoperability">INTEROPERABILITY IN THE NII</a><br>

<a name="an">AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT</a></h2>

<p><a href="job04.html">Key Terms</a></p>
<p>As envisioned. the future NII will integrate and build upon many different existing and emerging physical components.  These include: 1) communications networks using a variety of technologies-cable systems, telephone networks, data networks, including the Internet. wireless technologies, satellite systems, and others; 2) computers and information appliances, from smart televisions and portable wireless computers to high-end workstations and supercomputers; and 3) information in the form of databases, information services, and creative content, such as government documents and data, libraries, private information services and bulletin boards, interactive games and shopping, public service information and government services, education programs, and medical information. </p>
<p>The NII will also rely heavily on human resources and support services that will enable users to conduct business, locate, access, and retrieve information from remote databases, transmit multimedia documents, be billed and pay for services used, authenticate the information in the documents accessed, ensure security for stored and transmitted data, and track and pay for the use of copyrighted information. </p>
 
<p>Because these different aspects of the NII are being built, supplied, and maintained by hundreds of different vendors, as well as by individuals and government agencies, interoperability - the ability of different systems to work together - is essential. </p>
<p>Today, a lack of interoperability in our nation's information infrastructure presents minor inconveniences.  For example, setting up a video conference may require searching for compatible conferencing equipment.  Sending or receiving a document through electronic mail may require use of translation software or involve significant editing by hand.  In the future,, however, a lack of interoperability at key locations in the NII will have much more serious consequences - it may prevent users from obtaining essential information or making critical communications altogether. </p>
<p>Interoperability at key NII interfaces, both domestically and internationally, will ensure that existing and new NII components work together as easily, quickly, and transparently as the components of today's telephone system.  Equally important, interoperability will enable anyone to provide information or information services through the NII.  An NII that is interoperable at key interfaces will help create an infrastructure that is ubiquitous. interactive, and accessible to all users and service providers.</p>

INTEROPERABILITY  IN THE NII<br>
<a name="advancing">ADVANCING NII GOALS</a></h2>
<p><a href="job05.html">Key Terms</a></p>


<p>Interoperability is not a luxury - it is an essential element for meeting many of the goals that have been articulated for the NII. In particular, an NII that is interoperable at key locations will:    </p>
<ul>
1.<i> Allow users and providers to transmit information smoothly throughout the NII</i><br>.  In a highly interoperable NII. a high school student in Montana will be able to use research resources located anywhere in the country and simultaneously discuss that research with students at distant schools.  A business traveler will be able to use a wireless computer to retrieve files from the office, edit the file on screen with colleagues, and to send and receive documents from the airport, airplane, or hotel room. If a vacationer falls ill, the local doctor will be able to quickly access the patient's up-to-date and complete medical record, and consult in real time with the patient's regular doctor and specialists from other cities. An entrepreneur with an innovative idea for a special interest on-line bulletin board will be able to reach all of the users who may be interested in accessing the bulletin board.  With open interfaces at the critical locations for information appliances, communications networks, and databases, all of these things, and much more, will be possible.<br><br>

2.	<i>Enable wide access by users and	 providers of information and services</i>.<br>
Interoperability will help ensure that the NII will be accessible to the broadest number of people - both users and vendors of products and services. An NII that is interoperable at critical interface will enable providers of information and information services and products, such as specialized bulletin boards, locator services, and libraries, to make them available through the NII to anyone who wants to use them, regardless of the type of information appliance the user has, the communications networks the information has to travel to reach the user, or where and how data is stored.  Users will not be limited to a particular vendor's products or certain services to receive or send the information they want. Users will be able to access the NII through computers at public libraries or schools as easily as those who access it from home or work.  <br><br>

3.	<i>Stimulate competitive markets for NII products and services</i>.<br>  An NII that is interoperable at critical interfaces will promote greater competition in NII products and services. In today's marketplace, competition is critical in driving innovation and technology advances. With an interoperable NII, any vendor or independent provider of information will be able to plug a product or service into the NII and reach all potential users of the product or service. Since users will be able to select from a wide range of products and services that best meet their needs, sellers will have to compete with each other to win customers.  With open specifications at key interfaces, all providers of NII products and services will know what is expected and what is necessary for their products and services to interoperate with the rest of the infrastructure. Thus, small companies will be able to make their NII products and services available as easily as larger companies, generating additional competition. A wide range of vendors and open interfaces at the key locations will give users the freedom to change products, services, vendors, and technologies as their needs change or as new technologies become available.

INTER0PERABILITY IN THE  NII<br>
<a name="critical">CRITICAL  NII INTERFACES</a>
</h2>
<p><a href="job06.html">Key Terms</a></p>

<p>In the Appendix, CSPP has identified several key NII interfaces that Must be a priority for an industry-led strategy to ensure interoperability and openness in the NII.  The list is not intended to be definitive or exhaustive, but merely a starting point for dialogue.  Further, the members of CSPP are prepared to work, through the appropriate standards bodies, to advance the openness of those interfaces that are within the computer industry's responsibility.  For interfaces that fall within the responsibility of other industries, such as the local access provider interfaces, CSPP encourages those industries to develop similar strategies to work through their appropriate standards bodies to ensure interoperability through the adoption of open, interoperable, and interconnected interfaces. </p>
<p>The interfaces in the Appendix are examples of interfaces in today's information infrastructure that must be open in order for information and services to flow smoothly from-n end to end in the NII.  The interfaces in the Appendix were selected based on two criteria: 1) they are located at critical points in the infrastructure, and 2) they are not moving to openness quickly enough.  CSPP believes these interfaces are key, high leverage points in the NII which can enable or catalyze the development and interworking of a broad array of existing or new products and services by multiple competing providers and users.  As the N-H grows and evolves, the private sector should use these criteria to evaluate new interfaces to be sure they meet the desired degree of openness. </p>
<p>The key NII interfaces identified in the Appendix fall into the following four categories. </p>
<p>The	Appendix includes specific examples of each.</p>
<ul>
1.	<i>Appliance to Network: The interface between an information appliance and a network service provider.  </i><br>Open interfaces at these points will allow users of the NII to attach any type of information appliance (such as computers, television set top boxes, smart telephones, or other intelligent consumer appliances) to the local access provider's network.<br><br>

2. <i> Appliance to Application: The Applications Programming Interfaces (APIS) between an information appliance and emerging NII applications, such as multimedia applications, telephony, database access, and X.400</i>. <br>Open APIs will enable developers of NII applications, such as interactive videogames, remote database access, and electronic publishing, to make them available to any user regardless of the type of information appliance the user has.<br><br>

3.  <i>Application to Application: The protocols that one NII application, service, or system uses to communicate with another application, service or system</i><br>.  These would include for example, communications between different mail messaging systems or between database query programs and databases.  Open interfaces between different implementations of NII information systems, services, and applications that allow the systems, services, and applications to "communicate" with each other will enable users to generate and receive information in various formats and media without having to make special adjustments to translate between different implementations. <br><br>

4.  <i>Network to Network: The interfaces among and between network service providers</i><br>.  They include interfaces between different local communications service providers, Such as telephone companies and cable companies; interfaces to local companies' networks at key points and to intelligent switching software; and interfaces between local service providers and long distance carriers and enhanced service providers.  Open interfaces at certain key network points, as noted in the Appendix, will ensure that users have maximum choice in their selection of and access to network and information services and that information providers can reach all users.  This will also ensure the proper conditions for competition.</ul>

<h2>INTEROPERABILITY  IN THE NII<br>

<a name="principles">PRINCIPLES FOR A STRATEGY ON INTEROPERABILITY</a></h2>
<p><a href="job07.html">Key Terms (Open or Closed)</a></p>
<p><a href="job08.html">Key Terms (Proprietary or Nonproprietary)</a></p>
<p><a href="job09.html">Key Terms (Standard)</a></p>

<p>As the private sector develops, deploys, and upgrades the components of the infrastructure, it must also take the lead to ensure that the NII is interoperable.  This will require innovative thinking and bold action, from both a technical and policy perspective, to ensure that the infrastructure of the 21st century best meets the needs of all its potential users.  CSPP has identified the following set of principles to help guide the industry-led effort to achieve an interoperable NH. CSPP believes the government's role should be to work with industry to facilitate reaching the interoperability goals for the NII.</p>
<ul>
1. <i>Open Interfaces Are Essential </i>- Open interfaces at critical NII locations will allow the smooth transfer of information throughout the system.  Thousands of interfaces, both open and closed, exist in today's information infrastructure.  Many more will exist as the NII evolves.  If the interfaces at critical locations, such as those identified in the Appendix, are open, the diverse components of the NII will be able to work together so that users can communicate and interact easily and transparently.<br><br>

2.  <i>Industry-Led Standards Are Critical </I>- Industry must lead the development of standards for interoperability.  Users of the NII are increasingly demanding that products and services interoperate so they can access the resources they need.  In markets that are competitive, market forces will generally result in interoperable and open interfaces among key NII products and services.  Customers and other providers will have multiple choices with whom to interconnect, so there are incentives for providers to define open interfaces and to disseminate standards, resulting in maximum interoperability without a need for government intervention.  Development of standards for key interfaces in competitive markets should be entirely industry-led and industry-implemented, driven by market forces and user requirements.<br><br>



3.  <i>Government Has a Role in Regulated Franchised Markets </i>- In regulated franchised markets which are not yet fully competitive, some government stimulation and intervention may be necessary to ensure interoperability.  Without competition, there is limited incentive for providers of franchised monopoly products or services to open the interfaces they control to third parties.  In some cases, this may require the government to identify requirements for interconnection and to specify certain critical interfaces that must be open.  As a last resort, the government may have to require these traditionally regulated franchised monopoly industries to establish interoperable and open interfaces.<br><br>



4.  <i>Interoperability Fosters Competition </I>- Interoperability will promote competition among technologies, providers, and media, leading to the greatest choices, lowest prices, highest value, and maximum innovation.  Interoperability, by making the NII accessible to the greatest number of competing providers, will improve the availability and affordability of products and services, value for price, and competitive rather than exclusive offerings.  This will stimulate demand for NII-related products and services, thus building volume and driving affordability.
<br><br>

5. <i>Minimize Government Intervention </i>- In competitive markets, government intervention should be kept to the minimum level necessary to achieve public policy goals, such as ensuring access by users and providers, reliability, privacy, and freedom of speech.<br><br>

6. <i>Government Must Promote Competition </i>- In traditionally regulated franchised monopoly markets, government policies should be designed to move the markets toward competition by encouraging market openness and interoperability.  This can be achieved by eliminating barriers to entry and exit in local communications markets, requiring standardized, open interfaces to unbundled components to enable interconnection; and removing safeguards and line of business restrictions as soon as meaningful competition is achieved.  Eventually, only those regulations that are necessary to achieve specific public policy goals noted above should remain.<br><br>

7.  <i>Broad Access is Key </i>- Everyone should have the opportunity to access the NII at some level.  Different people have different needs for communications services, information appliances, and information resources at different times, as well as different skill levels and abilities.  A definition of the NII services everyone should be able to access must be developed and new approaches to providing access to underserved populations will have to be explored.  For instance, libraries and schools, which have long been places where people acquire information and develop skills, are two examples of locations at which a reasonable selection of appliances and access to advanced NII services and information resources could be made available.  Other points of access might include non-profit organizations, chambers of commerce, and neighborhood business associations serving small businesses.  Public access points may also provide places for training people in the use of the NII and coaching them on its use thereafter.  Further, people at some sites may be NII intermediaries for those who need NII-based services but are incapable of accessing them.<br><br>

8.  <i>Government Must Ensure Access When Necessary </i>- In cases where market forces do not make the NII widely accessible, there is a role for federal, state, and local governments in ensuring access to the NII.  Where it is agreed that users should have access to certain NII services - such as, for example, government services and information - subsidies may be needed to make access to the NH components affordable to certain users.  Where subsidies are needed to offset the cost of using the NII, suppliers of NH components should not be required to subsidize users.  Subsidies should be provided by governments directly to institutions, such as libraries or schools, that will make the appropriate NII components publicly available to users, or perhaps directly to users to access on-line information services.  Developing a workable strategy to meet these needs will require the cooperation of NII providers and the federal, state, and local governments.  The means of providing such subsidies to points of access and people who warrant them will have to be developed in such a way that it can evolve in parallel with the NII without inhibiting its advance or distorting competition.<br><br>

9.	<i>Ease of Use Must Be a Priority </i>- NII components intended for use by the general public should be easy to use; correspondingly, people should be adequately trained and educated to use the NII to meet their needs.  Accessibility could be enhanced if user interfaces provide a consistent set of basic procedures to perform tasks across a wide range of applications and platforms, including the development of standardized procedures for locating information, such as an electronic version of "yellow pages;" standard procedures for retrieving information from widely distributed sources; and standard document presentation forms that are able to support multimedia formats.  It is important, however, that such procedures provide a basic way of accessing information and contain sufficient interface specification information to permit vendors to offer advanced easier-to-use user interfaces.</ul>
<hr>

<h2> <a name="cspp">CSPP RECOMMENDATIONS</a><br>
<a name="action">ACTION AGENDA FOR INDUSTRY</a></h2>
<p>1. <b> Establish Cross-Industry Forum </b>- The private sector should establish a cross industry open forum to monitor the development by standards bodies of open, critical NII interfaces.  The forum should: 1) lead the development of a roadmap that identifies critical interfaces within the NII, including those in the Appendix-, 2) assess the degree of interoperability and openness of each critical interface on an ongoing basis; 3) identify goals and milestones for achieving maximum interoperability and openness where needed; 4) evaluate progress toward meeting those goals and milestones; and 5) update the list of critical interfaces as necessary. </p>
 
<p>2. <b>Facilitate Quick Adoption of Open NII Interface Specifications </b>- Industry members of standards bodies and other forums that address NII interface specifications should commit to ensuring that proposed standards are considered and decided upon as quickly as possible in order to accelerate the acceptance and adoption of open NII interface specifications by users and vendors.  The development and implementation of voluntary, industry-developed interoperability standards for the critical NII interfaces should be accomplished through existing industry-led groups, including ANSI-accredited standards bodies, with appropriate collaboration and input from other independent industry forums, such as the ATM Forum and the Telecommunications Operations Forum.  Industry should encourage coordination among these groups, when appropriate, such as the current effort to establish a liaison between ISO/IEC JTC- I and the Internet Society to lead to the ultimate goal of harmonization between their architectures.  In all cases, efforts should be made to accelerate the approval process to the extent possible, in both the domestic and international domains. </p>
 
<p>3. <b>License Proprietary NII Technologies on Reasonable Terms </b>- When a developer of an NII system proposes proprietary technologies for incorporation in critical NII interface standards, the developer of the technology should be prepared to license the technology on reasonable terms and conditions, demonstrably free of discrimination. </p>
 
<p>4.  <b>Fund and Participate in Testbeds and Demonstration Projects </b>- In partnership with the federal government, companies should fund and participate in precommercial testbeds and demonstration projects that will accelerate the development and adoption of interoperable and open NII interfaces.</p>

<p>1. <i>Develop Milestones</i>-The government should work with industry to develop realistic milestones for open NII interfaces and monitor progress by industry in meeting those milestones. </p>
 
<p>2. <i>Promote Industry-Developed Interoperability Standards </i>- The government </p>
<p>should promote the adoption of industry-developed standards for interconnection and interoperability through government purchases of NII-related equipment and services. </p>
 
<p>3. <i>Support U.S. Industry's Standards Interests in International Bodies </i>- The government should continue its critical support for U.S. industry's standards interests in international standards forums sponsored by treaty organizations, e.g., the International Telecommunications Union, where the U.S. government represents U.S. interests.  The federal government must explicitly recognize the importance of U.S. leadership in standards and ensure that a U.S. industry perspective is accurately and forcefully represented in global standards bodies sponsored by treaty organizations. </p>
 
<p>4. <i>Fund Testbeds and Demonstration Projects </i>- The government should fund, in partnership with industry and users'. precommercial testbeds and demonstration projects to test and develop interoperable and open NII interfaces. </p>
 
<p>5. <i>Remove barriers to competition in franchised monopoly communications markets. </i></p>
 
<p>6.<i> Eliminate safeguards and regulations applicable to traditionally regulated franchised monopolies as meaningful competition is achieved</i>. </p>
 
<p>7. <i>Develop Definitions of Essential NII Services and Resources </i>- In conjunction with state and local governments and public interest groups, the government should develop definitions of essential NII services and resources that all Americans should have the ability to access, and a plan to ensure some minimum level of access/availability for such essential NII services.</p>

<h2>CRITICAL INTERFACES FOR<br>
INTEROPERABILITY IN THE  NII<br>

OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>Interoperability is an essential element in transforming today's information infrastructure into a National Information Infrastructure (NII) that will be a primary resource for the future.  With the Information Age upon us, the ability to quickly and efficiently generate and exchange information, technology, and ideas is the key to increased economic prosperity, improved quality of life, and global competitiveness in a range of industries. </p>
<p>CSPP has identified the following four categories of interfaces between and among information appliances, NII applications, information services and network service providers: 1) Appliance to Network; 2) Appliance to Application; 3) Application to Application; 4) Network to Network.  With interoperability at these critical NII interfaces, both domestically and internationally, CSPP believes industry can develop and deploy an NII that will most effectively and efficiently serve the needs of its users.  In addition, interoperability at these key junctures in the NII will enable the broadest possible range of applications based on the most extensive information provided by the greatest variety of vendors.  Interoperability will promote competition and create new opportunities for the development of products and services we cannot even begin to imagine today.</p>

<img src="5.gif"></center>

<p><b>Current Status: </b>While standards for many of today's services and systems are evolving, difficulties remain.  For example, X.400, the electronic mail messaging standard, is not widely implemented because of its complexity; today's voice messaging systems are generally closed, so a recipient of a voice message cannot forward it or broadcast it to someone on a different system; several standards exist for describing printed text and images in databases; and common standards for providing and accessing databases are not yet widely implemented.  Standards need to be defined and adopted for today's applications that can accommodate evolution to new systems and services, such as multimedia applications of electronic mail, electronic publishing, and database access. </p>
 
<p><b>Recommended Industry Action: </b>The computer, communications, and information industries need to work through their respective standards bodies and industry associations, such as X.3, IEEE, OSI Implementor's Workshop, the Electronic Mail Association, the Information Industry Association, the Association of American Publishers, Society of Motion Picture and TV Engineering (SMPTE), Audio Engineering Society (AES), SQL/Access Group, X/Open, the Intenet Society, ITU-T, and JTC-1, and other appropriate forums, to simplify current standards and promote their adoption, and to develop standards where ones do not exist for new multimedia and other NII applications.</p>

<a name="executive">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a>

<p>The Administration, Congress, and U.S. high-technology exporters all agree that the export control system must be changed.  The current system was created over 40 years ago to impede the economic and military development of the "Communist Bloc." It has not been updated to reflect the  dramatic geopolitical changes that have unfolded over the past few years and it cannot keep pace with rapid advances in technology.  As a result, the U.S. export control system is now a serious impediment to U.S. competitiveness. </p>
 
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) supports a rational export control system that efficiently meets national security objectives without imposing unnecessary adverse effects on the nation's economy.  Today, a sound economy is absolutely essential to preserving the nation's global military superiority.  This means that the U.S. export control system must carefully balance military superiority, economic strength, and technological leadership -- the interdependent facets of national security. </p>
 
<p>CSPP has developed a balanced approach to export controls that will enable the government to meet its legitimate objectives while allowing U.S. industry to maintain its economic competitiveness in export markets.  The CSPP proposal applies only to commercial items -- it does not deal with military hardware or munitions.  Finally, CSPP has chosen to address only substantive issues of export control, not the important organizational and management issues that will emerge with any new approach to export control policy. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends that the new U.S. export control regime:</p>
<ul>
1 . Focus on the major security challenges of the coming decade: preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems, and combating the spread of international terrorism;<br><br>

2.     Rely on multilateral control arrangements to the maximum extent possible,
employing unilateral controls only in exceptional circumstances;<br><br>

3.	Impose licensing requirements only on products or technologies that are required for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missile delivery systems -- not on those that simply contain cutting-edge technology;<br><br>

4.	Specifically identify the export control targets (countries and end-users); and
<br><br>
5.	Recognize that exports are essential to the economic security of the United States, and that exports of commercial items, particularly information technology products, contribute to the development of market economies and democratization.</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="exports">EXPORTS: THE KEY TO U.S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVENESS</a></h2>

<p>High-technology industries, like the computer industry, must grow globally or die.  Today, the markets for computer products and services are worldwide, as are the industry's customers and competitors.  As a result, exports are vital.  In fact, more than sixty percent of the computer industry's revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the U.S. </p>
 
<p>High-technology companies must also be quick to market with new, innovative products.  The average life cycle of today's computer technology is under eighteen months.  More dm seventy percent of the U.S. computer industry's 1992 revenue came from products that did not exist two years earlier.  This figure is expected to exceed eighty percent by 1995. </p>
 
<p>The bottom line: U.S. high-technology industries must be able to quickly export their most innovative products to be successful in the global marketplace.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="current">THE CURRENT EXPORT CONTROL REGIME: A THREAT TO U.S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVENESS</a></h2>

<p>The current export control regime poses a real threat to U.S. high-technology competitiveness by preventing U.S. high-technology companies from quickly exporting their most competitive products.  As a result, U.S. companies are unable to effectively exploit their competitive position in global markets.  For example, in 1993, outdated computer export licensing requirements threatened to delay delivery of leading edge U.S. computer products based on a new generation of microprocessors.  In addition, an obsolete definition of 'supercomputer' imposed extraordinary export restrictions on U.S. computer systems readily available on the world market. </p>
 
<p>On September 29, 1993, the Administration took bold and decisive action to temporarily address these issues and avert a pending high-technology export crisis.  Working with industry, the Administration crafted a plan for short-term export control relief that eliminated unnecessary controls on the export of U.S. computers to countries not engaged in proliferation activities or international terrorist activities. </p>
 
<p>Once implemented, the Administration's plan will significantly benefit the U.S. economy.  U.S. computer companies will be able to export tens of thousands of computers made by U.S. workers that would have otherwise been controlled. </p>
 
<p>The Administration's plan will also help ensure that limited government resources are devoted to better policing those exports that directly contribute to proliferation and terrorism.  The plan will also temporarily eliminate an unmanageable flood of export license applications at the Commerce Department for products that are widely available from other sources around the globe.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="need">THE NEED FOR LONG-TERM EXPORT CONTROL REFORM</a></h2>

<p>The Administration's September 29 action signaled an important shift in U.S. export control policy, acknowledging that in today's global economy, the export control system must simultaneously balance the nation's security needs and its economic objectives. </p>
 
<p>The President's action was positive and necessary, but it was only a "stop gap" measure taken to address problems created by an export control system that is fundamentally flawed and badly out of date.  Major flaws in the current system include: 1) unilateral U.S. controls, which often impose crippling restrictions on U.S. companies while foreign competitors operate unhampered in the international market; 2) restrictions that do not take into account the diffusion of technology throughout the world; and 3) controls based on the level of technological sophistication of a product or technology rather than on whether it is required for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missile delivery systems.  The idea that a product or technology is necessarily a more significant proliferation concern if it contains advanced technology is unfounded: the United States, as well as other nuclear powers, developed nuclear weapons without using today's advanced technology.  In fact, Congress' Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) recognized in a September, 1993 report that high performance computers "are not required to design first generation fission weapons." </p>
 
<p>As the Administration and Congress work to reauthorize the Export Administration Act, the time is right for fundamental reform.  Without it, the United States will be forced to address the system's flaws through repeated short-term fixes in the midst of pending export crises.  A crisis management approach prevents appropriate and thorough consideration of critical issues.  The United States needs a new export control system that provides the certainty and stability that America's exporters need to compete effectively in the global market.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="cspp">THE CSPP APPROACH: STRIKING THE NECESSARY BALANCE</a>
</h2>
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) has developed a balanced approach to export control policy that will enable the government to meet its legitimate objectives while allowing U.S. industry to maintain its economic competitiveness in export markets.  The CSPP proposal applies only to commercial items -- it does not deal with military hardware or munitions.  Finally, CSPP has chosen to address only substantive issues of export control, not the important organizational and management issues that will emerge with any new approach to export control policy. </p>
 
<p>CSPP's recommendations are based on the following key principles.</p>
<ul>
<i>1 . Exports are critical to U.S. economic security.</i>
Exports create U.S. jobs.  Exports also generate revenue that companies reinvest in the research and development essential to maintaining technological superiority over foreign competitors.  Today, unemployment and the erosion of our technology base are as serious a threat to the United States as a hostile military power.<br><br>

<i>2. Trade encourages the development of market economies and democratization</i>.
This is particularly true for the information technology industry, which provides the products and infrastructure that are essential to the operation of market economies and that encourage the free exchange of ideas and information.  Today's global economy demands that we encourage economic development in all nations, excepting those few that threaten international stability.<br><br>

<i>3. Export controls should only be used to meet the following critical national objectives:</i><br>
<ul>
<li>to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems;

<li>to enforce multilateral sanctions designed to compel adherence to international norms of behavior; and
<li>to deter terrorist activity.
</ul>
<i>4. The system must focus on "controllable " products and technologies</i>.
This requires recognizing the broad diffusion of technology and the rapid speed at which it advances.  The export control system should aim to control only those products and technologies that are not widely available from uncontrolled sources.<br><br>

<i>5. The export control regime should focus on chokepoints -- those products and technologies that are required for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missile delivery systems.</i>

Focusing controls on proliferation chokepoints will ensure that the government effectively uses its limited resources to meet the nation's proliferation goals.  It will also help prevent unnecessary adverse effects on U.S. exporters of commercial products.  Burdensome export licensing requirements on products and technologies that are not critical for proliferation prevent U.S. industries from being first to market with the most innovative commercial products.  As a result, legitimate trade opportunities are lost without accomplishing any important national goals.<br><br>

<i>6.	Export controls must normally be multilateral</i>.

In most situations, export controls must be multilateral to be effective.  Unless the United States has a monopoly over a particular technology, unilateral controls are simply symbolic.  What is worse, they essentially hand markets over to foreign competitors.<br><br>

<i>7.	The system should be "positive" and transparent</i>.

To facilitate compliance by U.S. exporters, the government must clearly identify the targets of control and the reasons for control.<br><br>

<i>8.	Export controls should be employed only as part of a comprehensive economic, political, and  diplomatic strategy</i>.

Export controls will be effective only if employed in conjunction with other remedies available to the government and the international community.  In a vacuum, export controls are likely to harm U.S. exporters and do little to advance legitimate U.S. objectives.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="recommendations">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A NEW U.S. EXPORT CONTROL REGIME</a>
</h2>
<p>In accordance with the principles outlined above, CSPP recommends that the U.S. implement a new export control system based on the following three-tiered structure.</p>
<ul>
1.	<b>Tier I </b>consists of. products and technologies that are required for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missile delivery systems.  The government will have discretion to require prior approval for the export of these 'choke point" products and technologies.<br><br>

2.	<b>Tier II </b>consists of commercial products and technologies not essential to proliferation.  Export of these products and technologies will be restricted only in narrowly defined circumstances.<br><br>

3.	<b>Tier III </b>contains products and technologies with no connection to proliferation activities.  There will be no restrictions on their export.
</ul>
<b><p align=center>Tier I<br>
"Choke Point" Products and Technologies</p></b>

<p>Identifying "Choke Point" Products and Technologies.  A product or technology will be categorized as a Tier I item only if rigorous technical analysis determines that there is a direct and substantial link between the product or technology and proliferation activity.  To be classified as a "choke point' product or technology, the item must be required for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missile delivery systems.  In other words, a "choke point" product or technology is something without which proliferation activity cannot occur.  A high level of technological sophistication alone will not justify classification as a Tier I item. </p>
 
<p>To ensure the integrity of the classification process, the government must provide for substantial input from industry and academia.  Furthermore, the government must ensure that classifications of products and technologies as 'choke points" are regularly reviewed so those that no longer meet the criteria for categorization as a Tier I item can be quickly decontrolled. </p>
 
<p>Controls on "Choke Point" Products and Technologies.  The government will be able to require prior approval of Tier I exports to specified countries.  However, these controls will normally be allowed only if they are part of an effective multilateral control regime.  Effective multilateralization requires full participation by all countries that are a source of the product or technology. </p>
 
<p>In addition, export controls on "choke point' products and technologies may only be imposed if the item is controllable.  This means that a feasible method must exist to prevent the product or technology from reaching the export control target.  As the OTA has recognized, a product or technology cannot be controlled if:</p>
<ul>
1.	it is available from non-controlled sources; or
<br><br>
2.	it can be replaced by a similar and reasonably available non-controlled substitute.
</ul>

<p>Minimizing Unilateral Controls.  The U.S. should rely on multilateral control arrangements to the maximum extent possible, employing unilateral controls only in the following limited and exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ul>
1.	Pending Multilateralization.  The U.S. may impose a temporary unilateral U.S. control, with multilateralization required within six months.  The purpose of such controls will be to obtain broad-based participation, with the government providing incentives for other countries to join in the U.S. led controls.  The multilateralization must be effective; that is, it must include full participation by all countries that are a source of the product or technology in question.  If efforts at multilateralization fail within six months, however, the unilateral controls will be discontinued.<br><br>

2.	Sole Source.  Unilateral controls will be allowed on a product or technology for which the United States is the only source of supply.  This is the only situation in which unilateral controls can possibly be effective.  However, the government will have to make a specific finding that this requirement for unilateral controls has been met.  Upon reasonably sufficient evidence that a new source of supply is set to enter the market, the unilateral controls will be discontinued.<br><br>

3.	Terrorist regimes or entities.  Unilateral controls on "choke point" products and technologies may be imposed on identified terrorist regimes or entities if the U.S. determines such controls will deter terrorist activity.
</ul>

<p>Minimizing Re-export Controls.  Controls on re-export of Tier I items to countries that are not part of the relevant multilateral regime will normally be allowed only if they are applied by all members of the regime.  Unilateral re-export controls will be allowed only in the three situations described above -- pending multilateralization, U.S. sole source, and terrorist regimes or entities.</p>

<b><p align=center>Tier II<br>
Commercial Products and Technologies</p></b>

<p>This category includes all products and technologies that do not meet the "choke point" criteria, in other words, are not essential to proliferation activity.  Exports of Tier II products and technologies will not be subject to prior government approval or export licensing.  However, the government may prohibit their export to any specifically identified country or end-user that is subject to a multilateral embargo or is determined by the United States to be a terrorist regime or entity.  Re-export controls will be similarly limited. </p>
 
<p>In those instances in which the export of Tier II products and technologies are controlled, the following framework will apply.</p>
<ul>
1.	The government will issue and maintain an explicit list of embargoed countries and end-users.
<br><br>
2.	Exporters will be responsible for export screening to ensure that they do not make prohibited exports.
<br><br>
3.	Exporters will be prohibited from exporting to any end-user who the exporter knows to be involved in prohibited proliferation or terrorist activities.  However, the standard is actual knowledge.  The responsibility of investigation to determine proper targets of export controls belongs with the government, not the private sector.
</ul>
<b><p align=center>Tier III<br>
Unrestricted Products and Technologies</p></b>

<p>Tier III includes all products with no direct connection to proliferation activities.  These products will not be subject to any controls whatsoever, regardless of destination.  For example, humanitarian items, such as medicine, food, and educational material, do not directly contribute to proliferation efforts.  Restricting exports of such benign items cannot meaningfully contribute to any of the goals of an export control regime.</p>

<hr>
<h2 align=center><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></h2>

<p>The world has changed significantly since the U.S. export control system was created over forty years ago.  From a national security perspective, the Cold War is over.  In its place, we are confronted with the specter of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems.  From an economic perspective, markets, customers, and competitors are increasingly global, and national economic security has become essential.  Balancing these changes demands bold reform of U.S. export control policies. </p>
 
<p>Government and industry must work together to craft a new export control regime that will help prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems, and curb international terrorism, while fostering U.S. competitiveness in global markets.</p>

<head><title>Improving Access to Goverment IS</title>
<h2 align=center>Information Technology's Contribution
to Improving Access to Government
Information and Services</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary</b></p>

<p>Interacting with government employees and locating available government information can sometimes be a frustrating, timely, and costly process.  Today, governments disseminate services to citizens in almost the same way they did 50 years ago -- manually, from behind counters and desks, with paper forms, lines and waiting rooms, ringing telephones, and face-to-face interviews.  In many cases services are available only Monday through Friday from nine to five and information may be accessible only at locations distant from the person who needs it.  The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) believes that the enhanced national information infrastructure (NII) will provide a tool to overcome these difficulties by linking together a range of institutions and resources -- from schools, hospitals, and businesses to libraries, laboratories, and government agencies -- allowing people to more easily interact with government employees and to locate the government information and services that they need.  The NII will revolutionize the way governments relate to their constituents by enabling government employees to work together and collaborate to access, share, and Generate information without regard to geographical, bureaucratic, or jurisdictional boundaries. </p>
 
<p>The NII will enable the application of existing and new information technologies, such as user friendly computers and information appliances, advanced telecommunications networks, distributed data management and retrieval techniques, and interactive technologies, to the delivery of government information and services.  Ms will enable governments to accommodate the special needs of diverse populations, streamline their processes, locate information and services centrally, and link dispersed offices and functions.  As Vice President Gore noted in the September, 1993 report of the National Performance Review, information technologies are key tools for reinventing government: <i>"With computers and telecommunications, we need not do things as we have in the past.  We can design a customer-driven electronic government that operates in ways that, 10 years ago, the most visionary planner could not have imagined." </i>With an electronic deliver service system, individuals will be able to conduct their business with the government from convenient locations, at convenient times, often in one stop rather than many. </p>
 
<p>Innovative service delivery approaches are already being applied around the country, particularly in state and local governments.  The new technologies that the NII will make widely available will provide opportunities to build on and expand these efforts.  CSPP believes that the adoption of information technologies by federal, state, and local governments can be accelerated through their participation with the private sector and users in demonstration projects that will highlight the benefits of information technologies and overcome many of the barriers to their adoption.  While there are innumerable ways that information technologies can be applied to improve the delivery of government services to citizens, CSPP recommends that the federal government and the private sector invest in projects to demonstrate an Integrated- Human Services Delivery System. a Service to the Citizen Kiosk System, and an Electronic Locator for Federal Information.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align=center>The Value of Information Technology to<br>
Improving Access to Government Information and<br>
Delivery of Government Services</h2>

<p>While public demand for more effective government services and better access to government information is growing, fiscal constraints at all levels of government require that these needs be satisfied at minimal cost increases to payers.  As the recent report of the Vice President's National Performance Review notes, these conflicting forces require governments to find new ways of doing business and to radically improve the old methods.  It is clear that the current model of government service and information delivery -- formed in the industrial era - is ineffective in meeting the changing demands of today's informed public and the growing information management challenges of the public sector. </p>
 <hr>
<h2 align=center><i>The Challenge of Improving Service and Access at Reduced Cost </i></h2>
 
<p>Individuals and organizations look to their governments for a wide variety of services and information, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Generic services </b>-- Services that the general public encounters in the course of daily life, such as driver's licenses. voting, job information, vital records, education. emergency services, building permits. recreational services, and paying taxes.

<li><b>Services to special populations </b>-- Services that address the needs of specific groups or that people rely upon in special situations, such as benefits and services for military veterans, services provided by health and human services organizations. agricultural extension services, and small business support.

<li><b>Access to government information/data bases </b>-- Governments are the repository of vast quantities of data and information about a variety of topics that are of interest to virtually every segment of society.  Federal laboratories produce research reports of interest to scientists and engineers.  The Commerce Department provides daily summaries of new trade opportunities for business.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis maintains historical records of economic activity, as do the Bureau of Labor Statistics. the Bureau of the Census, and many other statistical organizations.  People frequently travel to Washington to use historical documents found at the National Archives.
</ul>
<p>Not only is demand for each of these types of services increasing, each also involves increasing amounts of information that must be collected. analyzed, stored, updated, manipulated. extrapolated. and retrieved on a daily basis.  Most government agencies are beginning to apply information technologies. including computers and communications links, to help meet their exploding information management needs.  A growing amount of public information is now available on-line.  However. most of the efforts to date are designed primarily to meet the needs of the government agencies and their employees. not the needs of the citizens -- or customers - that are using the services.  Strategic application of new information technologies, through the NII. will enable fundamental changes in the way governments do business that will not only improve efficiency and reduce costs, but will also help them better meet their customers' needs across all types of services. </p>
 
<p>Many agencies and departments, particularly at the state and local levels. have already begun reinventing their service delivery approaches with information technologies.  These early innovations provide lessons that can be applied to similar approaches elsewhere and foundations for future deployment of improved systems.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>State of California: Info/California </i>- To meet the increasing needs of its large and very diverse population, the State of California is implementing Info/California, a "one stop shopping" approach to service delivery.  A multilingual, intelligent touchscreen system, Info/California is a multimedia kiosk network which provides statewide transactional services 24-hours a day, seven days a week.  The kiosks, which are placed in shopping malls. grocery stores. retail stores. and other public locations, offer a variety of services.  Residents have access to the state's "Job Match," that allows the users to match their qualifications with available jobs free of charge.  Users can also order copies of birth certificates and pay for the service using a credit card or debit card, and renew their automobile registrations with the same system.  California will expand the system to include additional services in the near future.

<li><i>State of Hawaii </i>-- The State of Hawaii operates two information services networks "Hawaii FYI" and "Hawaii Access." Hawaii FYI allows residents anywhere in the state the opportunity to access a broad array of international, national, and state government databases and information services.  The network and its electronic gateway allows residents to use a home computer and modem, or a terminal at any one of the state's public libraries, schools, or state information offices. to access a multitude of services, most of which are free.  The services range from reports on the latest legislative action, to restaurant guides and chat lines.
<br><br>
Hawaii Access, an island-wide network for information and referral services, allows the public to access the state's health insurance program services from multilingual kiosks located on several islands in the state.  Individuals can conduct their own interviews for the State Health Insurance Program. with the kiosks expert systems helping to determine their eligibility and transmitting the electronic application to program administrators at the Department of Health.  Hawaii Access was recently expanded to include "ALEXIS," an island-wide network for employment.  Individuals can complete and submit job applications using the same system.

<li><i>Departments of Motor Vehicles </i>-- State Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVS) are beginning to use digitized imaging for driver's licenses and improved information delivery systems to revolutionize the way DMV business is conducted.  These emerging technologies enable the provision of high quality, tamper-resistant. digitized driver's licenses and identification cards and allow the public to access DMV services on a seven day a week. 24-hour a day basis from remote locations. such as home. library computers. or shopping mall kiosks.  Six states have already implemented digitized drivers licenses and are beginning to realize the benefits of using the digitally stored images.  For instance. other government agencies. such as Law Enforcement.  Social Services, and Secretaries of State can use the image databases for identification purposes.  In California. the new digitized image system dramatically improves the information flow between DMV and law enforcement agencies. reducing the time needed to make personal identification from days to minutes. additionally, multiple agency services can be provided easily, such as voter registration at the same time as driver's licenses are issued.  Individuals benefit from the implementation of the new technologies by having to spend less time in line obtaining licenses, and even being able to do it from more convenient locations.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 align=center><i>Technologies That Will Enable Enhanced Access to Information and Services </i></h2>
 
<p>The challenges presented by the diverse needs of communities and individual constituents can no longer be solved with traditional solutions.  Budget constraints prevent agencies and departments from hiring more staff, bringing in language experts, or building new sites. as they often did in the past when demand for services changed or increased.  However. as the above examples of early innovations illustrate, today's information technologies provide tools for governments to more effectively collect and communicate complex information and services to an increasingly diverse and dispersed public. Information technologies also allow members of the public to easily and conveniently locate the information and services they need.  In the near future, new technologies that will be available through the NII will allow all levels of government to better accommodate the special needs of diverse populations through easily accessible, easy to use. public access information systems.  The NII will make possible a network of advanced telecommunications networks that will link individual Americans directly to their governments, to one another, and to virtually any information and service resource they want.  These new technologies, if made available in convenient locations, can supplement, rather than replace entirely, the direct interactions citizens have with agency personnel, freeing agency employees to focus on the most complex and difficult problems.  Some of the present and near-term technological solutions that will enable improved government service delivery and access to government information include:</p>
<ul>
<b>Intelligent multilingual kiosks</b>, which are user-friendly computer stations that combine audio, video, text, and graphics to store information about all types of government services, including social security and welfare benefits, help for people with special needs, and information about available community services.  Kiosks, which are already being used by governments around the country, can be operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, can substitute for trips to government offices, and can also link users directly with government personnel through telephone and, eventually, video hookups.  They can print forms and documents and will even accept payment by credit card, debit card, and check.  To be effective, kiosks must be conveniently located, easy to use, and have high quality content that is responsive to users' needs.  As kiosk technologies improve, users will be able to conduct fully interactive, two-way government business from one location.
<br><br>
<b>Automated telephone voice processing systems </b>today provide a convenient, easy to use means of accessing government services through touch tone telephones.  In the future. voice recognition technologies will enable individuals to obtain customized services and responses to inquiries. through- automated- telephone contacts any time of the day.
<br><br>
<b>Public computer bulletin boards</b>, if kept up to date, are good sources of information about government programs and activities.  There are currently over 150 publicly available federal bulletin boards which are accessible to users who have access to personal computers and telephone lines.  With improved technologies for locating and presenting information, bulletin boards will become easier to use, will include more information, and will be linked to other sources of information to be more responsive to users' needs.
<br><br>
<b>Electronic funds transfer</b>, through the use of smart cards, is being used in an increasing number of jurisdictions to deliver monetary government benefits electronically, directly to recipients.  Using cards reduces human errors, paperwork, and delays.  Passwords and cryptology reduce opportunities for fraud and counterfeiting.  Service recipients are spared the embarrassment of using food stamp coupons or public assistance checks.  Smart cards have computer chips embedded in them that can encrypt, process, and store all information on the card.  In the future, smart cards will be used in any store just like other electronic funds and bank cards.  Amounts spent by recipients would be automatically deducted from monthly entitlements.

<b>Interactive cable television </b>will allow individuals to conduct many government transactions from their homes at their convenience.  Today, many local governments 'de information to communities about government programs via one-way cable programming.  In the future, interactive television technologies will enable individuals to use their televisions to find specific information, to send and receive information, to obtain specific answers to questions, and to transact government business from home.
<br><br>
<b>On-line information </b>can be obtained through communications networks and personal computers.  This provides users with direct access, at their convenience, to data and information stored in government databases or libraries.  Today, a limited amount of government information is available on line, and much of it is difficult to locate and retrieve.  New technologies, including better storage, searching, and indexing techniques, combined with government policies to expand the availability of on-line information, will make electronic access a convenient way to find government information.
<br><br>
<b>Expert Systems </b>are computer-based components that aggregate the knowledge of experts in a particular application discipline and simulate the decision-making process.  They are being used to supplement routine agency decision-making processes by having a benefits applicant enter specified information at a touchscreen that is a to a host computer.  The system analyzes the information that was provided, requests follow-up or clarifying information where necessary, and immediately determines whether the applicant is eligible.  In the future, widespread implementation of expert systems in agencies where decisions are routinely made using a set of fixed criteria will free employees to spend more quality time with clients who need special help.
<br><br>
<b>Document imaging and retrieval systems </b>permit the electronic digitization, storage, and retrieval of documents.  State of the art facilities provide options for storing documents on various media, including magnetic disk, tape, and optical disk, as well as retrieval options that include electronic display, printing, and remote facsimile distribution.  These technologies reduce the space needed to store documents and make them easy to retrieve quickly by government employees or consumers in remote locations.  As governments move increasingly to on-line and kiosk-based actions, digitization of information and images for storage will become more important.

<h2 align=center>Issues Facing Government and Industry in<br>
Implementing a Public Access Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The public and private sectors have important roles in making public access applications of the NII a reality.  The private sector has primary responsibility for deploying the. communications networks and  services, and developing and making available products, applications, and services for the infrastructure.  The government's primary role is as a catalyst.  It can do this by:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>leading the development of a public access vision and defining a national challenge in support of the vision;

<li>investing in research on precommercial technologies and demonstration projects and supporting technology transfer;

<li>making appropriate government information easily accessible to the public electronically;

<li>implementing a political regulatory environment that encourages the development of new technologies and enables competitive markets;

<li>supporting and adopting industry-developed interoperability standards; and

<li>coordinating public and private action to address complex policy issues, such as access to the NII, privacy, security, carrier liability, intellectual property, and affordability.
</ul></ul>

<p>In developing new ways to meet individual's needs through electronic service delivery, the government's leadership will be especially important in working with the private sector to address the following issues: </p>
 
<p><b>Equitable Access </b>-- Strategies need to be developed to ensure that all individuals have access to and the ability to use information and service systems, regardless of social and economic status.  The NII must provide a tool for reducing difficulties in accessing government information and services.  This may require educating members of the public to use the new technologies effectively. </p>
 
<p><b>Protection of Privacy/Adequate Security </b>-- Technologies and policies must be implemented to protect the personal privacy of individuals, organizations. and enterprises that provide information to government.  Personal information must not be disclosed to unauthorized users or for inappropriate uses. </p>
 
 
<p><b>Protection of Data Integrity </b>-- People and organizations will rely on the data and information they receive from the government to make decisions.  It will be imperative to ensure the security and accuracy of data and protect information and service systems from accidental or intentional misuse or alteration. </p>
 
<p><b>Data Availability </b>-- To meet the needs of all users, which will vary widely, government information will have to be published and disseminated in multiple formats -- printed, magnetic. optical, or on-line. </p>
 
<p><b>Ownership and Control of Information and Services </b>-- Government data and information in its various forms must be treated as public records which must be managed and made available as public assets.  Those who manage the assets must be held accountable for their protection and preservation.  Individual and enterprise-specific information must be treated the same way such information is treated when maintained in paper form. </p>
 
<p><b>Fees for Accessing Government Information </b>- To ensure that government information and services are available and accessible to all who need them, strategies must be developed to ensure they are affordable to all users. </p>
 
<p><b>Training Government Employees to Use New Technologies </b>-- Failure to ensure that government employees are adequately trained to use the new technologies effectively is critical. adding technology without corresponding training could make service delivery worse rather than better. </p>
 
<p><b>Organizational Cultures </b>-- In their delivery of information services, many government agencies view themselves as independent entities rather than integral parts of the larger organization of government.  This may create some difficulties in developing "one-stop shopping" centers designed to address the full spectrum of citizen needs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align=center><i>Recommended Pilot Projects</i></h2>

<p>Through the NII emerging information technologies will be integral components of efforts to improve access to government information and to, improve the delivery of government services.  Steps are already being taken to accelerate the application of these technologies in government.- -settings, but significant barriers exist.  Demonstration projects in the following areas will help to accelerate the acceptance of information technologies as key tools in the improvement u'. government service delivery.  They will also help overcome the operational, programmatic. organizational. technological and other barriers to their adoption. </p>
 <hr>
<h2 align=center><i>Integrated Human Services Delivery System </i></h2>
 
<p>A number of recent federally-sponsored studies, including the work of the Welfare Simplification and Coordination Advisory Committee, identified the lack of a single point of service delivery as a critical common barrier limiting access and coordination among human services programs.  Families must go from agency to agency to apply for the different services to which they are entitled.  Convenient access to information about programs and eligibility would not only reduce the amount of time people had to spend obtaining t-hem, it would eliminate many of the barriers that make the system especially difficult for those who need the services most -- children, the elderly, the disabled, and others with limited mobility. </p>
 
<p>One of the models studied by the Advisory Committee is Delaware's Service Center approach.  The Center has eliminated barriers to access by offering a variety of services from all levels of government -- federal, state, and local - at a single site.  Although successful, this approach can be costly because it requires additional staff and additional space that agencies cannot afford.  An alternative approach is to link existing programs at different sites through an integrated electronic delivery system.  This would make all services immediately available from one site. creating a virtual one-stop service center to reach throughout the community.  Information about a client would be entered into the system once. then transferred to each program site.  The automated system could be programmed to identify family needs and determine eligibility for other appropriate services. </p>
 
<p>Many of the technologies required to develop an automated integrated human services system exist today.  Multimedia touchscreens and interactive video provide user-friendly interfaces.  Videophone technology, enables the applicant to speak with a human services agency representative from a kiosk when required.  On-line computer services match information provided by applicants with existing databases to verify whether the individual has already received services that would affect eligibility for other programs. Expert systems automatically schedule appointments for on-site follow-up visits when required and print the associated details for the client.  These and other technologies need to be refined, integrated, and tested in applications settings to ensure that they work effectively and transparently from the user's perspective. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends that funds be allocated for a set of demonstration projects to integrate. on a large scale. the various aspects of human services delivery within several ,geographic areas.  The projects should have as a goal the creation of a user-friendly one-stop shopping site for human services programs that would streamline service delivery from the perspectives of both the clients and the agencies involved. </p>
 <hr>
<h2 align=center><i>Service to the Citizen Kiosk System </i></h2>
 
<p>In an effort to demonstrate the ability of federal civilian agencies to partner and leverage their respective resources to rapidly meet common agency goals. the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Veterans Affairs jointly produced a prototype "Service to the Citizen" system.  This multi-agency, one stop shopping kiosk contains interactive information and video programs from each organization.  If successful the Service to the Citizen project will be used to help define a nationally deployable system of kiosks that all government agencies that deal with the public on a regular basis could use as a first (and in some cases, last) point of contact with citizens.  For example. the Veterans Administration would make general benefit information available through the kiosks.  By inputting individual identifier information, a veteran could obtain information about his eligibility for benefits, or the latest status of his application for a VA-guaranteed mortgage. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends that funds be allocated to demonstrate, on a large scale, a system of multimedia kiosks linking a variety of agencies and departments across a number of disciplines that would address the needs of the public for easy-to-use, convenient. timely, and responsive government services.  The Service to the Citizen kiosk would be a consolidated single point of contact for the individual to access information about the availability of services. and to transact business with government agencies. to provide information to the government (such as changes of address). and to request forwarding of materials from the government. </p>
 <hr>
<h2 align=center><i>Electronic Locator for Federal Information </i></h2>
 
<p>A wealth of federal information is currently available in paper form from the federal government. including, for example. census data. environmental information about specific geographic locations. food and nutrition information. information about business opportunities overseas. availability and associated eligibility- requirements of mortgage assistance programs, eligibility criteria for Social Security, benefits. and updated regulations affecting small businesses.  Today, accessing such information is neither convenient nor easy.  The information that people want is often distributed across several agencies -- or many departments within agencies -- with little coordination among the holders of the information.  There is often no good way to identify, which agency,, or who within an agency, is responsible for particular information.  In many, cases. organizations are open for business only during hours when it is difficult for people to get there physically.  With a centralized locator service. however. an individual with a particular topic or problem in mind would only have to enter some key words or phrases into a conveniently-located computer or kiosk in order to be directed electronically to the appropriate agencies.  The locator will show all sources of the desired information. as well as relevant related information that the user may not have been aware of. </p>
 
<p>CSPP proposes that the federal government establish a centralized federal electronic locator service to streamline access to government information by the general public.  Through the locator, people would have direct access to a wealth of information across all government disciplines. accessible from "one-stop shopping" public access systems. personal computers and modems in homes and libraries, bulletin boards, and other easy to use widely accessible outlets.  This effort should include developing and deploying locator services that make government information easy to find, deploying indexes of information. and expanding the type and amount of government information that is available electronically to eventually include library material in multimedia and hypermedia formats. </p>
 
 <hr>
<h2 align=center>Conclusion </h2>
 
<p>Information technology is dramatically reshaping the world.  The private sector ' is using it to drastically improve customer service by making services available from anywhere and at any time.  If federal, state. and local governments are to be responsive to the needs of their citizens for improved services at lower cost. they must integrate information technology into their information and service delivery mechanisms.  Governments at all levels have begun to take seriously the need to improve service delivery, as demonstrated by the progress of successful innovative projects using voice- and kiosk-based technologies.  Early, small steps to improve service delivery with existing technologies are significant, but giant steps can be realized through the NII.  A series of strategic, coordinated initiatives. including large-scale demonstration projects which use the skills, leadership, common visions and technology tools of the public and private sectors, will help ensure the successful implementation of new information technologies that will improve service delivery by governments as we move into the 21st century.</p>

<head><title>Information Technology's Contribution to Health Care Reform</title>
<h2 align=center>
Information Technology's Contribution<br>
to Health Care Reform<br>

April, 1993
</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary</b></p>

<p>Healthcare costs are rising at an g rate.  In 1993, healthcare will cost the United States $900 billion - 14% of Gross Domestic Product.  Without a change in current spending practices, healthcare expenditures will rise to more than 18% of GDP by 2000 
and 22% by 2010.  One immediate result is that millions of Americans do not have access to health care services because they cannot afford health insurance or they have inadequate coverage.  The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) believes that by sign
ificantly increasing the application of information technology to our healthcare delivery system, we will be able to provide greater access to high-quality health care services at reduced costs for all Americans. </p>
 
<p>A healthcare information infrastructure will provide a foundation for improving healthcare information management, which can be applied throughout the healthcare system, from billing and payment to delivery of services by medical experts.  The healthca
re information infrastructure will include a network of interconnected, interoperable, multi-speed communications networks; medical information resources; computers and information appliances; and people able to access the information they need, when they
 need it.  The infrastructure will be based on regional community health infrastructures, which will provide services to individuals, hospitals, physicians, HMOs, emergency or ambulatory care centers, employers, and payers. </p>
 
<p>Nationwide adoption of an integrated healthcare information infrastructure will require joint public-private sector efforts to overcome a variety of human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological challenges, including: economic feasibilit
y; professional and organizational adaptation to new technologies; development and adoption of standards; reimbursement mechanisms for using information; and legal barriers, such as liability and ownership of data.  Some of the technology challenges inclu
de data capture, retrieval, and distribution; data access and delivery; data storage; integration; communication technologies; and data presentation. </p>
 
<p>CSPP believes these barriers can best be overcome through regional and interregional demonstration projects in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Computerized Patient Records;
	<li>Telemedicine;
	<li>Application of Outcomes Information; and
      <li>Computer Aided Medicine.
</ul>

<p>These demonstration projects, when scaled to the level of nationwide implementation, would realistically test the viability of various technologies and the costs and benefits of their application in healthcare settings. </p>
 
<p><b>The Value of Information Technology to Healthcare Reform </b></p>
 
<p>The major healthcare challenge for the United States as we close the 20th century will be to increase the quality and access to healthcare services while reducing the overall cost of delivering those services to all Americans.  Healthcare reform is a l
arge and multifaceted endeavor for which there is no 'silver bullet'.  It is, rather, a complex set of problems that will require equally complex choices that can favorably impact quality, cost and access and that are sustainable over an extended period o
f time. </p>
 
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) believes that new information management techniques and the application of information technologies win provide the opportunity to improve productivity, quality, and cost control in care delivery, health manag
ement, education and research, security of health-related information, and reimbursement.  CSPP recommends implementing a joint public-private sector effort to significantly increase the information technology investments made by major healthcare stakehol
ders, to accelerate nationwide deployment of a healthcare information infrastructure. </p>
 
<p>In his Economic Plan for America, President Clinton announced a major initiative to create an Information Infrastructure Technology Program in healthcare, education, manufacturing, and libraries.  CSPP applauds this recognition of the important contrib
ution that advanced information technology can make in healthcare and recommends that a healthcare information technology coordination function be included as part of the National Economic Council's task force on information infrastructure This should pro
vide a focal point for consulting with private sector experts in information technology; healthcare professional organizations and user groups that represent the broad array of stakeholders in the healthcare delivery and management, consumer groups, and r
esearch institutions. </p>
 
<p>The essential elements of the healthcare information infrastructure will include: a network of interconnected, interoperable, multi-speed communications networks connecting regional community health infrastructures; information resources, such as onlin
e medical databases and patient histories; computers and information appliances; and people -- both medical professionals and consumers - who are able to use the technologies.  Community health infrastructures will provide information services to individu
als, hospitals, physicians, HMOs, emergency or ambulatory care centers, employers, and payers locally.  Healthcare consumers and providers must be confident that medical data is correct, complete, and up to date, and that it is not provided to unauthorize
d users or used for unauthorized purposes.  Services available might include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>authorized access to computer-based lifetime patient records;
	<li>medical plan enrollment data;
	<li>medical eligibility criteria;
	<li>coordination of benefits information;
	<li>physician credentialing data;
	<li>authorization of care services;
       <li>patient monitoring and testing data;
	<li>financial settlement services; and
       <li>secure patient medical information.
</ul>
<p>Through nationwide links, medical research and outcomes assessment 
data could be aggregated and made available to local and regional 
users.  Ultimately, the community infrastructures would be linked, both 
locally and nationally, to payers, suppliers, pharmaceutical companies, 
employees, and party databases, as well as support systems for public 
sector quality assessment, clinical research, and education. </p>
 
<p>Pieces of this information management structure exist in the healthcare system today, and should be the foundation of the integrated and automated healthcare system of the future.  Today's healthcare system is a fragmented set of players.  Information 
technology can provide the thread that weaves the disparate pieces together into an integrated and seamless system of high-quality, low-cost, widely accessible care. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Quality</i> </ul>
 
<p>As advanced and sophisticated as clinical care is in the U.S. today, most diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is still executed based on the knowledge and experience of individual clinicians and care teams responsible for the patient.  That know
ledge resides principally in the clinicians' minds and may be augmented by journals, papers, and conferences they may have attended.  By providing access to complete patient histories and current patient information, along with online medical libraries, o
utcomes data, medical literature, and even consulting specialists, clinicians will be able to make decisions in real-time with the benefit of the entire range of medical knowledge available.  This access to a broad range of up-to-date information will res
ult in higher quality clinical decisions, which will generate higher quality outcomes.  By tracking and analyzing outcomes data, higher quality information to support clinical research and medical education can be gathered and made available consistently,
 nationwide. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Cost</i> </ul>
 
<p>Better access to medical information by healthcare practitioners and consumers can reduce excessive or redundant tests, procedures, and visits to doctors' offices and hospitals.  For example, on-line patient medical information will provide practitione
rs with all current medical information about a patient, including complete test result information, eliminating the need to order tests that may be redundant.  Automated practice guidelines and protocols will deliver lower cost treatment options to clini
cians.  The higher quality care that results will tend to reduce the length of stay in hospitals.  Hospital efficiency will be improved through better education of clinical support resources.  Automated medical charting with voice-to-text conversion and h
andwriting-to-text conversion win ensure timely completion of medical records, ensuring higher quality of information input.  Computerized records of clinical transactions will speed the billing process, while providing complete data for patient/provider 
billing.  Higher quality clinical outcomes should help reduce malpractice premiums, which in turn should reduce the incidence of defensive medicine.  This is consistent with a 1992 Arthur D. Little, Inc. study which concluded that annual healthcare costs 
can be reduced by at least $36 billion through nationwide application of certain information technologies. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Access </i></ul>
 
<p>Access to care is complicated by geographic, cultural, and economic factors.  Many areas of the U.S. -- both urban and rural - do not have sufficient numbers or types of healthcare practitioners.  In particular, the lack of specialists and diagnostic e
quipment prevents many people from receiving adequate diagnostic and treatment services.  Cultural factors, such as unfamiliarity with the English language, prevent many Americans from receiving adequate healthcare services.  In addition, cultural factors
 sometimes inhibit people from seeking medical intervention until a medical condition reaches very serious stages of advancement.  The lack of health insurance, as well as inadequate healthcare coverage, prevents millions of Americans from obtaining healt
hcare services.  Many Americans must choose between purchasing healthcare services and basic living items, such as food, shelter, and clothing.  Information technologies can help overcome these types of barriers to access through telemedicine and other ap
plications. </p>
 
<p><b>Barriers to Adoption of a Health Care Information Infrastructure </b></p>
 
<p>To achieve the promise of healthcare information technology, a variety of technological, human, organizational, and economic barriers must be overcome. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Economic Feasibility </i></ul>
 
<p>Information technology has the potential to significantly improve the quality of, and access to, clinical treatment in the U.S. and to reduce administrative costs.  However, questions remain regarding how to fund its widespread implementation and the c
ost savings that are possible from such implementation.  The Center for 
Healthcare Information Management (CSPP has recommended developing 
mechanisms for various stakeholders (the federal government, other insurers, patients, vendors, and healthcare institu
tions) to share in the costs of development and implementation of computer-based patient records.  CSPP recommends establishing pilot projects that will test such mechanisms by demonstrating the economic and technological feasibility of large-scale implem
entation of information technology in healthcare settings. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Professional Adaptation </i></ul>
 
<p>Healthcare providers have concerns about the impact of technology on their professions.  For example, physicians may perceive that their autonomy as clinical decision makers will be reduced by automation which enables implementation of protocols of car
e or outcomes research.  In addition, physicians may resist the necessary relearning and changes in procedures needed to adapt to using the new technologies.  Some nurses are concerned about technology substituting for nursing staff.  Finally, physicians 
and nurses may have reservations about the organizational implications of hospital administrators mandating automation without regard to the risks it poses for their professions.  Addressing these issues, will be no less challenging than commercializing t
he sophisticated technologies described later in this paper.  Demonstration projects that involve medical professionals can help better identify potential issues and possible solutions. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Information Technology Standards </i></ul>
 
<p>Standardized communications formats and interoperable networks are essential to connect patients and caregivers within community health networks and to connect the community networks in a unified and fully integrated national system.  To exchange data 
among providers, insurers, researchers and consumers, standard data formats and definitions will be needed.  Such standards will be best developed and adopted through regional and interregional demonstration projects led by private sector stakeholders. </
p>
 
<ul><i><li>Lack of Reimbursement Mechanisms for Using Information </i></ul>
 
<p>A major obstacle to the adoption of information technology in healthcare is the lack of an appropriate mechanism for reimbursing providers for the cost of sharing information in treatment delivery.  Several problems exist: the U.S. healthcare system do
es not explicitly recognize the monetary value of health information; the collection and handling of patient data is viewed as a cost, but it is a cost that may not be reimbursable to the patient or the physician under today's compensation mechanisms; and
 delivery of treatment via the use of telemedicine is not reimbursable under present federal and state policies.  Demonstration projects that show the value of healthcare information will highlight the need to develop new reimbursement practices to take a
dvantage of new technologies. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Legal Barriers </i></ul>
 
<p>A number of legal barriers are inhibiting the widespread adoption of information technologies by the healthcare community, including issues about the ownership and appropriate use of patient information as well as liability for the misuse of informatio
n.  These are complex issues that need to be examined carefully by the fun range of affected stakeholders.  CSPP applauds efforts by the Computer Patient Record Institute (CPRI) and other groups to develop recommendations on these issues. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Technology Challenges </i></ul>
 
<p>The healthcare information infrastructure of the future will link providers, payers, and patients in an automated, interconnected healthcare system which provides reliable, secure access to authorized users anywhere and at anytime using a range of acce
ss methods -- voice, data, multimedia.  To achieve this vision, further research is needed on leading edge technologies for the entry, storage, communication, and presentation of multimedia information.  The Information Infrastructure and Technology Act o
f 1993, currently being considered by the Senate as Title VI of S.4, would authorize funds for research in these technologies.  In addition, though many of these technologies are already being demonstrated, they have not been integrated seamlessly through
out the healthcare system and have not been demonstrated on a scale large enough to support the nation's healthcare delivery system.  Large scale demonstration projects in the areas suggested in Section III are necessary to integrate the technologies into
 the healthcare system and identify specific additional research and scalability challenges. </p>
 <ul>
<b>1. Data Capture, Retrieval, and Distribution </b>- Healthcare practitioners frequently require mobility, are often in environments that are hostile to electronic equipment, and will not use an automated system if it requires more time to do a task than
 it takes to do it manually.  Fundamental to the success of the healthcare information infrastructure is the ability to capture information when and where it is generated and to retrieve and distribute that information when and where it is needed.  This w
ill require advancements in technologies for voice recognition input, handwriting recognition input, natural language understanding, pen-based computing, and portable information appliances. <br><br>
 
<b>2. Data Access and Delivery </b>- Healthcare practitioners must be able to locate the information they need very rapidly, and consumers of healthcare information must be able to find medical and cost information quickly and easily.  This will require a
pplication of state of the art technologies in both distributed database and information filtering technologies.  Intelligent agents will be needed to help users formulate queries and filter the responses. <br><br>
 
<b>3. Data Storage </b>- The U.S. healthcare system includes:<br>
<ul>
	<li>5,892 short stay hospitals
	<li>1,033,881 short stay beds
	<li>539,228 physicians
	<li>1,648,000 registered nurses
      <li>1,487,000 nursing home or personal care residents
</ul><br>
For every thousand beds, a large hospital generates about 3 gigabytes of image data per day; emerging technologies such as 3D magnetic resonance imaging have the potential to generate 20-40 megabytes of data for a single test.  The requirements for data s
torage and retrieval technology are already large and growing with the current uses of information technology.  In the future, the widespread application of information technologies in 1.3 billion patient contacts per year will, coupled with federal and s
tate laws that require certain kinds of medical information to be stored for a minimum of 25 years, will require significant advancements in information storage and retrieval technologies to handle that data efficiently and effectively. <br><br>
 
<b>4. Integration </b>- Given the pluralistic nature of the U.S. healthcare environment, the information stored throughout the system will be based upon a heterogeneous set of storage and retrieval technologies.  Leading edge technologies will be needed t
o integrate this heterogeneous information base so it works as one seamless system. <br><br>
 
<b>5. Communications Technologies </b>- Delivery of multimedia healthcare information when and where it is needed will require an information infrastructure that includes interconnected, interoperable networks that provide adequate levels of security, pri
vacy, and reliable transmission.  Mobile communication appliances will be essential elements throughout the healthcare information infrastructure. 
 <br><br>
<b>6. Presentation </b>- Presentation of healthcare information to a wide variety of users, with a wide range of computational skills and information needs, is a major challenge.  Emerging technologies, such as data mining tools, 'information agents,' voi
ce-to-text conversion, non-destructive compression algorithms, and interactive two-way video over local area and remote wireless networks, will find application as the need to quickly and unambiguously grasp the significance of a wide range of healthcare 
information becomes commonplace.  Visualization tools and virtual reality are already being applied in both surgical training and certain kinds of treatment. 
 </ul>
<p><b>Representative Demonstration Projects </b></p>
 
<p>Projects that demonstrate, on a regional and interregional basis, the application of information technology to healthcare would highlight the potential benefits of information technology in increasing access, improving quality, and reducing costs.  Whi
le there is consensus that information technology will result in substantial cost savings, demonstration projects can quantify the magnitude of the savings in a way that is scaleable to nationwide implementation. </p>
 
<p>Furthermore, demonstration projects can provide vehicles to overcome the technological and non-technological barriers to widespread implementation of the information technologies, by furthering research, testing the viability of various technology solu
tions, and catalyzing their adoption by important stakeholders.  To be effective, demonstration projects must be of sufficient scale and variety to give competing technologies a fair trial and to be credible when scaled to the level of a nationwide health
care delivery system.  Projects should be based upon national and international consensus healthcare information technology standards which are being developed to support the healthcare information infrastructure.  This way, the demonstration projects wil
l both drive and test the emerging standards. </p>
 
<p>Demonstration projects in the following areas will help accelerate the adoption of information technologies in healthcare.  While a number of projects are currently ongoing in each area, additional efforts should build on the progress currently being m
ade.  The automation of billing and claims reimbursement will be an important means of reducing indirect costs of healthcare in the future, and should use national and international standards where they are available. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Computerized Patient Records </i></ul>
 
<p>The National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine's Committee on Improving the Patient Record concluded after an 18 month study that the Computer-Based Patient Record (CPR) is an essential technology for improving the quality of healthcare while 
reducing costs.  The committee recommended that both the public and private sectors should expand their support for the CPR and CPR system implementation through research, development, and demonstration projects. </p>
 
<p>The CPR is an integrated information system designed around an electronic database of patient information with links to medical knowledge bases, such as the National Library of Medicine.  The patient information is generated by clinicians and care prov
iders as a result of interaction with patients during care episodes and represents all of the care episodes during a patient's lifetime.  This way, practitioners will have easy access to the most up-to-date health information, such as test results, allerg
ies, and family history.  Treatment decisions based on higher quality information are likely to result in better outcomes and lower costs.  Focused demonstration projects would demonstrate the value of the CPR and instruct users how to implement systems c
ost effectively. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends that funds be allocated as part of healthcare policy reform efforts for a set of demonstration projects that will accelerate progress towards national implementation of CPR technology. The demonstration projects should be at least regio
nal in scope and should involve multiple healthcare providers and multiple vendors using a variety of technologies, building upon emerging national and international consensus standards.  The demonstration projects should include as key elements the devel
opment of standards for privacy protection and the quantification of the economic viability of computerized patient records. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Telemedicine </i></ul>
 
<p>Telemedicine is the extension of medical information from its major source, the hospital, to the physicians in surrounding areas and beyond.  Through telemedicine, caregivers in areas lacking the full range of healthcare providers will be able to consu
lt with experts; improve or maintain their education; share medical records, x-rays, ultrasound images, and monograms; and monitor and treat patients in their homes without the need for extensive travel.  Less travel, with better monitoring to detect prob
lems early, will reduce healthcare costs dramatically while providing patients with access to higher quality care.  For example, Michael McDonald, chairman of Communications and Computer Applications in Public Health, stated in testimony before the House 
Subcommittee on Science, that homebased telemedicine could save $15 - 20 billion per year by allowing health professionals to monitor and interact with patients remotely via telemedicine systems that merge computer, video, and telecommunications technolog
ies. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends allocating funds to demonstrate, on a large scale, the underlying technologies for telemedicine, including high capacity network connections, by linking primary care physicians in rural areas with other providers throughout the nation. 
 While telemedicine has been successfully demonstrated many times in recent years, demonstration projects will address the barriers to accelerating its deployment.  The telemedicine demonstrations should include both teleradiology, which is the ability to
 share x-ray information with others, and which can be done now, and telepresence, which permits a practitioner to look at 3-dimensional images built from two-dimensional x-rays and manipulate the devices as if they were located in the room with the patie
nt. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Application of Outcomes Information </i></ul>
 
<p>Outcomes research, accessible databases, and user friendly information for consumers will help healthcare providers, payers, individuals, and communities make better healthcare decisions that will reduce costs and enhance the quality of service.  Too o
ften, consumers make healthcare decisions in a vacuum.  Decisions made without adequate information result in unnecessary trips to doctors' offices and emergency rooms, an inability to compare prices and services offered, and postponing care until it has 
reached a crisis stage.  Michael McDonald estimates that personal health information systems -- even if used only 25 % to 35 % of the time - could save $40-60 billion per year in the U.S. by helping healthcare consumers make more informed choices. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends funding projects to demonstrate how regional healthcare information infrastructures designed to serve the needs of healthcare stakeholders can help forge collaborative care partnerships that would be outcomes-driven.  Care would be deli
vered and evaluated by quality and cost together, enabling decision-making to be guided by outcomes rather than procedures.  Interregional healthcare links could help measure and calibrate the mobile character of our population and the dynamic nature of h
ealthcare. </p>
 
<p><b>1. Aggregating Data </b>- Aggregating the data stored in individuals' computerized patient records would increase the quantity and quality of information that researchers and practitioners use to determine which treatment protocols lead to the best 
health outcomes.  For example, Pennsylvania's coronary artery bypass graft surgery project has made aggregated medical information available to consumers, payers, and providers. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends funding a demonstration project that would include development of standard formats for collecting, storing, and reporting cost, quality, and outcomes information.  From this data, consumer report cards can be produced to bridge the medi
cal information knowledge gap in communities. </p>
 
<p><b>2. Information Dissemination and Education</b> - Once the aggregation process has begun, the benefits to individual consumers and other payers can take root.  Community outreach programs similar to local recycling campaigns can focus attention on de
veloping more informed health care consumers.  Cable television, home computer networks, and public health initiatives, connecting local departments of health, libraries, and physicians' offices, are all mechanisms that can be used to educate the public. 
</p>
 
<p>Once available and broadly disseminated, information will foster knowledgeable consumers, enhancing prevention, wellness, self-we, and early intervention.  With this additional knowledge, consumers will be able to avoid unnecessary trips to emergency r
ooms and doctors' offices, and people will be able to select among providers offering the best and most appropriate services at the lowest prices. </p>
 
<p>CSPP recommends funding a demonstration project designed to bring health information to people with the same ease that sports, entertainment, financial, and other types of consumer information are brought into peoples' homes.  Convenient consumer acces
s to understandable healthcare information will contribute significantly to changes in individual behavior that are necessary to recast the nation's healthcare profile. </p>
 
<ul><i><li>Computer Aided Medicine </i></ul>
 
<p>The application of computing technologies to medical procedures can help reduce the cost of performing many of those procedures while increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes.  For example, with high-performance computers, surgeons can construct 
three-dimensional images of the human anatomy. These images can then be rotated on a computer screen, examined from all angles, and used to plan surgical treatments and design prosthetic replacements.  CSPP recommends-,ids funding demonstration projects i
n the following areas to examine the cost effectiveness of commercial application of high performance computing to surgical practice.</p>
<ul>
1. Develop a system for simulating multiple interacting physiologic systems -- in essence, a whole body simulation.  The proposed system would permit both forward modeling to simulate physiologic processes and reverse modeling in which data collected from
 a single individual is used to construct a specific model for that individual.<br><br>

2. Develop a system of computer-aided decision support, including the use of artificial intelligence for diagnosis and treatment.<br><br>

3. Develop robotic surgery systems enabling distant, as well as traditional, surgical interaction.<br><br>

4. Develop advanced imaging technology supporting enhanced image presentation and manipulation.<br><br>

5.     Develop 3D modeling systems to aid in craniofacial and orthopedic treatment.</ul>

<p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>
 
<p>A wide variety of information technologies are being applied successfully in other industries to reduce cost and increase productivity and quality.  Applying those technologies to the delivery of healthcare services can help alleviate the tremendous pr
essure on the healthcare system, By s g administrative and management processes, using telemedicine to make healthcare more widely accessible, providing complete and up to date patient and medical information to practitioners when and where they need it, 
and making better use of high performance computing technologies, the healthcare industry -- and American healthcare consumers - can reap the benefits of the Information Age.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary</b></p>

<p>As the 21st century approaches, our nation's challenge is to find ways to rekindle economic growth, remain competitive abroad, and create the kinds of jobs that will enable Americans to raise their standard of living.  This will require that we be more productive and innovative than our competition abroad, and that we act more quickly and more efficiently. </p>
 
<p>Across a range of industries, Americans are increasingly turning to information technology to do just that.  Our ability to generate and exchange information, technology, and ideas is helping us to increase output, decrease costs, improve quality, and bring new products to market.  The United States has a unique opportunity to capitalize on this increasing reliance on information technology and the benefits it can bring. </p>
 
<p>We are currently the world leader in computing and communications technologies, yet we have not taken steps that will allow us to make the most of our potential.  This report calls for concerted efforts by the U.S. public and private sectors to develop and deploy an advanced information infrastructure that will put our information technology advantage to work for all Americans. </p>
 
<p>Throughout history, the United States has been successful, in part, because we have taken bold steps to make our national resources available to individual Americans by creating a variety of underlying foundations or infrastructures.  Our transportation, telephone, electric power, and water systems are all solid examples of this tradition.  By developing the infrastructures to make these resources readily accessible to individual Americans and easy to use, we have experienced an economic prosperity, quality of life, and global competitiveness virtually unmatched by any nation.  We need to build on this tradition to carry us into the 21st century. </p>
 
<p>A national information infrastructure, which will be as accessible and easy to use as our existing national infrastructures, will revolutionize our ability to communicate and collaborate by erasing geographical boundaries.  It will enable us to tap into our existing resources of creativity and knowledge.  It will lead to the development of products and services today unimagined.  It will create new jobs and economic strength for individual Americans.  It will accelerate the development of critical technologies.  And finally, it will enable us to address more effectively many societal problems, including challenges in the areas of health care, education, and manufacturing. </p>
 
<p>The call for a national information infrastructure builds upon the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program.  The HPCC Program is an excellent first step.  It provides an initial research foundation to create a more extensive information infrastructure that will be broadly accessible to the public and capable of meeting a wide variety of information needs.  Nevertheless, it alone is not enough.  CSPP believes the United States must make a national commitment to create a new national information infrastructure that complements, builds upon, and delivers the advantages of the research being performed in the HPCC Program, enabling the private sector to create new services that will benefit individuals in all walks of life.  This will require improving upon and linking together current communications, computing, information, and human resource capabilities.  More importantly, it will require developing new capabilities to enable broad access to a variety of public and private information resources.  Finally, it will require the integration of a range of computing and communications technologies to enable transmission of text, images, audio, and video to anyone, anywhere, at any time. </p>
 
<p>CSPP believes the first step is to develop a consensus vision - across industries and with the government - of what the Information infrastructure should be.  It will also require building a widespread understanding of the benefits this infrastructure could bring to Individual Americans.  On the following pages, CSPP presents its vision of the national information infrastructure (NII).  In addition, CSPP recommends the following actions be taken by the new Administration, Congress, and U.S. industry:</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Summary of Recommendations</b></p>

<p><i>Administration Agenda</i></p>

<ul>
1. Make the NII a National Technology Challenge<br>

2. Establish a National Information Infrastructure Council<br>

4. Invest in Research for an NII<br>

5. Fund Pilot Projects to Demonstrate Technologies<br>

6. Develop a Public Education Program<br>

7. Make Government Information Easily Accessible<br><br>
</ul>

<p><i>Legislative Agenda</i></p>
<ul>
1. Authorize a National Information Infrastructure Council and Appropriate Funds for its Operation<br>

2. Authorize and Appropriate Funds for Research and Technology Demonstrations<br><br>
</ul>

<p><i>Industry Agenda</i></p>
<ul>

2. Continue to Invest in Research and Development of Applications<br>

3. Reach Out to Other Industries<br>

4. Promote NII Efforts<br>

5. Develop and Participate in Pilot Projects<br>

6. Develop NII Goals and Milestones<br><br>
</ul>

<p>Finally, CSPP believes the public policy principles outlined at the end of this report must be addressed jointly by the private sector and government before the information infrastructure of the future can become a reality.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>In December 1990, the CEOs of CSPP met with Administration officials to discuss their public policy positions on technology issues.  At that meeting, CSPP was asked to assess the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program and provide recommendations to increase industry's involvement and interest. </p>
 
<p>On December 3, 1991, after almost a year of review and analysis, CSPP issued its report and video, "Expanding the Vision of High Performance Computing and Communications: Linking America for the Future," concluding that the HPCC Program is a significant and critical undertaking.  It would, CSPP determined, advance research in high performance computing and networking technologies as well as increase the use of high performance computers to solve important science and engineering problems.  At the same time, CSPP observed that the HPCC Program could provide a foundation for something more.  If properly designed, HPCC research could advance the development of technologies to help solve a wide range of social and economic problems and improve the competitiveness of U.S. industry by providing the foundation for a national communications and information infrastructure. </p>
 
<p>CSPP continues to support the HPCC Program and believes it should remain a national research priority.  CSPP applauds the recent creation of a new, improved management structure for the Program, which will provide a clear mechanism to coordinate, manage, and govern the implementation of the Program and a central point for private sector interaction.  In addition, CSPP commends Senator Al Gore and Representative George Brown for introducing the Information Infrastructure Technology Act in the summer of 1992 to move the HPCC effort to a new level. </p>
 
<p>The research and technology advancements supported by the HPCC Program remain a high priority for CSPP.  In October 1992, in the <i>CSPP Agenda for the 103rd Congress</i>, we recommended enhancing and expanding the HPCC research agenda to: 1) provide the foundation for an information and communications infrastructure of the future; 2) bring the benefits of HPCC technology to individual Americans in areas such as health care, education, and manufacturing; and 3) develop technology demonstration projects. </p>
 
<p>In addition to supporting the HPCC Program, CSPP believes the nation must focus on creating the information infrastructure for the future.  Together, the HPCC Program and the NII will provide the means to address the difficult challenges the nation now faces.  HPCC research advancements will pave the way for the applications a national information infrastructure will make possible, and the infrastructure will provide a vehicle to deliver the benefits of HPCC research.  The following report describes our vision for the infrastructure and recommendations for action that will help to make the vision a reality.</p>

<hr>
<b><h2>Part 1: CSPP's Vision</h2></b>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p align=center><i>Information in the 21st Century</i></p>

<p>In the future, the United States' primary resource for generating economic prosperity, improved quality of life, and global competitive will be our ability to quickly and efficiently generate and exchange information, technology, and ideas. </p>
 
<p>Increasingly, across a range of industries from banking and retail to automotive and aerospace, information technology has become instrumental in product development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and service.  The flow of information has become the foundation for improving productivity and increasing innovation in most every business enterprise.  U.S. industry is not, however, the only beneficiary.  Information technology continues to become an increasingly integral part of the every day lives of individual Americans. </p>
 
 <hr>
<p><i>The information infrastructure of the future will revolutionize the way individuals relate with one another by, enabling, us to work together, collaborate, and access and generate information without regard to geographical boundaries</i>. </p>
 <hr>
<p>Automated tellers, airline reservation systems, anti-lock brakes, and personal computers are just a few examples. </p>
 
<p>As we face the 21st century, we have an advantage over our foreign competitors.  We currently lead the world in computing and communications technologies.  But to make the most of the increasing reliance on information technology and our current strengths, we, as a nation, need to take the bold step of developing and deploying an advanced information infrastructure that will help us remain more productive and more innovative than our competitors abroad. </p>
 
<p><b>The National Information Infrastructure </b></p>
 
<p align=center><i>What Is It? </i></p>
 
<p>The infrastructure of the future is a nationwide system that will allow all Americans to take advantage of our rich resources in information, communication, and computing technologies.  It will link together a range of institutions and resources, from schools and businesses to libraries and laboratories.  More importantly, it will link together individuals, from senior citizens and students, to health care professionals, manufacturing managers, and business people from all fields. </p>
 
<p>The information infrastructure of the future will revolutionize the way individuals relate with one another by enabling us to work together, collaborate, and access and generate information without regard to geographical boundaries.  It will enable fundamental changes in the way we educate our children, train and retrain our workers, earn a living, manufacture products, deliver services of all kinds, and interact with family and friends. </p>
 
<p>Throughout its history, the United States has followed a tradition of creating underlying national foundations - infrastructures - that have fostered a quality of life in America unmatched by any nation.  Our transportation, electric power, and water systems are all solid examples of this tradition.  As we move into the 21st century, these existing infrastructures will continue to be important, but they, alone, will no longer be sufficient to meet our national needs. </p>
 
<p>Today, we think nothing about turning on a faucet and immediately getting hot water for a shower, flipping a switch and getting electricity to make coffee, and another switch to get a weather report.  We pick up the telephone without a second thought.  We must create an advanced information infrastructure for the future that will provide Americans with the same easy access to all sorts of information and people. </p>
 
<p>The information infrastructure, used in conjunction with a collection of "information appliances" - tools that will combine computing, communications, and video technologies, for example - will give people in rural areas ready access to libraries, museum exhibits, job information, and medical care now only available to those who live near those resources.  People all over the country will be able to work and interact with others, without even knowing their collaborators' locations.  By making information resources readily available and easy to use, the information infrastructure of the future will revolutionize our ability to access the information we need and our ability to collaborate and cooperate with others. </p>
 
<p>This infrastructure will integrate four essential elements - communications networks, computers, information, and people - to create a whole new way of learning, working, and interacting with others.  A more detailed description of the elements of the infrastructure includes the following:</p>
<ul>
Communications Networks<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>a network of interconnected and interoperable public and private communications networks ("public" networks refer to those networks, such as the public switched telephone network, that are open to use by anyone; "private" networks refer to those that are limited to use by a specific group of people meeting certain criteria, such as corporate networks), providing services ranging from high to low speed, allowing a range of uses anytime, anywhere;

	<li>agreed-upon technical standards for piecing together the network, having all its pieces work together, and plugging into it;

	<li>the capacity to transmit information, at both high and low speeds, in a variety of data formats, including image, voice, and video; and

	 <li>multiple mechanisms, perhaps including digital signatures, to support the electronic transfer of funds in exchange for services received.
</ul>
Computers
<br><br><ul>
	<li>high-performance computers resident on the communications networks to provide intelligent switching and enhanced network services;

	<li>powerful personal computers and work stations - including machines that respond to handwritten or spoken commands and portable, wireless devices that are easy to use and mask the complexity of the underlying system so people can tap into it as easily as they dial a phone; and

	<li>distributed computer applications that are widely accessible over the network (which acts like a lending library) and that help people perform a wide variety of tasks quickly and easily.
</ul>

Information
<br><br><ul>
	<li>public and private databases and digital libraries that include material in video, image, and audio formats; and

	<li>information services and network directories that assist users in locating, synthesizing, and updating information.
</ul>

People
<br><br><ul>
	<li>people of all ages and backgrounds who are easily able to use the rich and varied resources available through the infrastructure to improve how they learn, live, and work; and

	 <li>people who create, package, communicate, and sell information in the many new ways made possible by the existence of the information infrastructure.
</ul></ul>

<p align=center><i>Why Is It Important?</i></p>

<p>The investments the nation has made over the years to develop our existing transportation, communications, and energy distribution infrastructures were instrumental in making the United States an economic and political world leader.  They were also instrumental in improving the quality of life for individual Americans.  To remain an economic power in the 21st century, the United States must have in place an infrastructure that allows us to compete in the Information Age by providing a tool to be continually more productive and innovative. </p>
 
<p>An information infrastructure will enable the U.S. to tap into the vast resources of knowledge and creativity that already exist in this country.  As the volume and complexity of our information resources has increased, it has become almost impossible for any individual or business to take full advantage of what is available.  An information infrastructure will make the benefits of information technology as available to individual Americans as the transportation infrastructure made available the benefits of automotive technology and the communications infrastructure made available the benefits of telephone technology.  It will create new opportunities for the development of products and services we cannot even begin to imagine today, creating new jobs and economic </p>
 
 <hr><i>
<p>It will create new opportunities- the development of products and services we cannot even begin to imagine today, creating new jobs and economic strength for Americans and providing a resource for our current workers to continuously improve their-job skills. </p></i><hr>
 
<p>strength for Americans and providing a resource for our current workers to continuously improve and upgrade their job skills. </p>
 
<p>In addition, an information infrastructure will accelerate the development of critical U.S. technologies.  A strong consensus exists as to what technologies bolster the competitiveness of our economy and where we stand in those technologies relative to the rest of the world.  Initiatives to develop, deploy, and use an information infrastructure will create a market demand for many of these technologies, spurring an increase in private sector investment.  Moreover, these technologies would be put to work in the real world, a testing ground more powerful than the laboratory and with the potential to directly benefit individual Americans by generating advancements in commercially relevant technologies and creating an infrastructure they can use. </p>
 
<p>Finally, the information infrastructure will lead to the development of a range of new "information appliances" that will allow Americans to tap into the resources of the infrastructure in ways beyond our understanding today.  Some of these tools for the infrastructure could include interactive learning devices, wireless computers capable of simulating design and engineering plans onsite, and pocket size devices allowing doctors access to medical resources from remote locations.  The only thing that will limit the shape, form, and use of these appliances is our imagination. </p>
 
<p align=center><i>Why Should The United States Act Now? </i></p>
 
<p>Today, many of the changes taking place in our economy and influencing our competitive position are driven by the advent of the information age and the new set of economic ground rules this has created.  In the information age, the value of the products and services we exchange is increasingly a function of their information content and the knowledge used to create them rather than the raw materials used to produce them.  Because of this shift, the ability to easily access and share information and stimulate the creation </p>
 <hr><i>
<p>A coordinated, focused drive for a national information infrastructure will enable us to more effectively and efficiently devote our collective talents to developing the competitive edge against other nations. </p>
 </i><hr>
<p>of new ideas is essential to maintaining a strong economy, developing world class industries, and enhancing the quality of life for every citizen.  America now has the opportunity to create the information infrastructure required to achieve this. </p>
 
<p>Other nations, including Japan, Germany, France, and Singapore are taking significant steps to upgrade their own infrastructures and have long-term plans in place to continue doing so.  With U.S. industry and government working together as partners, we can build on our already strong lead in information technology to maintain our current lead, help us compete abroad, and improve our quality of life at home. </p>
 
<p>A coordinated, focused drive for a national information infrastructure will enable us to more effectively and efficiently devote our collective talents to developing the competitive edge against other nations.  Working together toward a common goal, America will realize the benefits of an information infrastructure sooner - we will establish the standards the world will need to follow and we will be the first to market with important new products, services, and applications for the infrastructure.  More importantly, we will be able to dramatically change the way Americans learn, care for the sick and elderly, and manufacture products. </p>
 
<p>The following descriptions provide a glimpse of the important benefits an information infrastructure could make possible. </p>
 
 <hr>
<h2>The Potential Benefits </h2>
 
<p><b>Health Care </b></p>
<center><img src="../report13/2.gif"></center> 

<p>Americans spend more on health care than on any other industry, but they are getting less in return for their expenditures than is possible.  For many people, health care is too expensive and often unavailable.  CSPP believes that computing and communications technologies can provide solutions to both of these shortcomings. </p>
 
<p>Health care is a large, high growth, recession resistant industry, with spending rising about 2 1 times faster than GNP.  In 1991, health care spending totaled $738 billion, or 13% of GNP, up from 7.3% of GNP in 1970.  The Health Care Financing Administration projects that the nation's health outlays will reach $1.6 trillion by the year 2000.  The soaring cost of health care has triggered concern about the ability of the nation to continue providing quality health and medical care as well as the ability of individual Americans to afford it. </p>
 
<p>Health care is extremely information intensive.  Each year, Americans make approximately 636 million visits to doctors' offices for ambulatory care.  In addition, 23 million surgical procedures are performed annually.  Each visit and procedure generates large amounts of medical and financial data.  There is presently no means to preserve or track that information for use in future or related health care situations.  In fact, the cost of managing health care information is one of the prime causes of the increasing cost of health care. </p>
 
<p>Improving the management of this information through a health care information infrastructure will enable efficiency gains and cost savings throughout the entire health care process.  First, roughly 20% of annual health care expenditures go to administrative costs, including processing an estimated five million health care claims per day.  Computing and communications technologies offer new opportunities to improve the manage- </p>
 
 <hr><i>
<p>Improving the management of this information through a health care information infrastructure will enable efficiency gains and cost savings throughout the entire health care process. </p>
 </i><hr>
<p>ment of and access to health care-related information and to reduce costs for processing insurance claims through electronic payment and reimbursement.  Second, better access to medical data and patient medical histories will help improve doctors' diagnoses by providing fast and easy access to accurate, complete, and up-to-date information.  Third, high speed networks will enable residents of rural areas and inner cities to enjoy the benefits of the latest medical technologies and expert opinions without leaving their home towns.  Finally, easy access to information by individuals in their homes on self-care and healthy lifestyle practices will enable people to better manage their own health, reducing the number of visits to doctors' offices and hospitals, and increasing the likelihood that medical problems will be identified earlier. </p>
 
<p>The challenge is to create a medical information infrastructure that will support the following types of applications that could help, in the near and longer term, to solve the health care problems the nation is experiencing:</p>
<ul>
	 <li><b>On-Line Patient Records </b>- Hospitals, doctors' offices, and community clinics will be interconnected through high speed networks.  Patient records, including medical and biological data, would be available to authorized health care professionals anytime, anywhere (with privacy assured) over these networks.  This would enable health care providers to access immediately, from any location, the most up-to-date patient data, including medical images from tests, resulting in improved diagnoses and more informed treatment decisions.

	<li><b>Medical Collaboration </b>- Medical personnel will use interactive, multimedia telemedicine technologies to collaborate and consult with each other over distances.  Doctors in hospitals or offices will consult on short notice with experts located anywhere in the nation; emergency room physicians will provide vital assistance to emergency medical personnel on the scene via wireless technologies.  Patients and their doctors would have instant access - at affordable cost - to experts and specialists, no matter where the patient is located.

	 <li><b>Surgical Planning and Treatment </b>Physicians and surgeons will use high speed computing technologies to simulate the function of human organs to facilitate medical diagnoses and treatment decisions, and to plan complex surgical procedures.  Imaging and modeling techniques will be used to produce realistic and detailed 3D models of a patient's organ, to develop the most effective and safe surgical procedures, to demonstrate planned procedures to patients and medical students, and to develop alternate non-invasive treatments.  With high speed networks, images could be transmitted instantly to experts located elsewhere for confirmation of diagnoses and treatment recommendations.
</ul>
<hr>

<b><p>Education</p></b>
<center><img src="../report13/3.gif"></center>
<p>To ensure a secure and prosperous future, Americans need to be able to think critically and to have access to the widest possible body of knowledge.  The work force requirements of the future will increasingly require people to be able to learn new, skills to adapt to changing job requirements and new technologies and to use knowledge and information to make decisions.  Changes must be made to the United States' education system to ensure that it will give individuals the skills they will need for lifelong learning in a high wage, information-based economy of the future. </p>
 
<p>Meeting these challenges will require extending America's edge in computing and communications technologies to education services in schools, communities, work places, and homes.  An information infrastructure for lifelong learning will offer unprecedented potential for improving lives by making knowledge readily available and usable by all Americans.  Such an Infrastructure would provide a tool for addressing many of the learning needs the country is facing, including, for example, making additional resources available on-line for teachers who want to improve their skills and update their knowledge; providing a means for Americans to continually acquire the new knowledge to adapt to the multiple careers will likely undertake; providing seniors and disabled or homebound Americans direct access to information resources critical to their health and welfare; and providing better access to information that affects our quality of life and cultural awareness. </p>
 
<p>Effective deployment of a computing and communications infrastructure for education and lifelong learning requires well trained and technologically experienced teachers and administrators </p>

<p>who can facilitate the use, installation, and management of new instructional technologies such as digital interactive video, local area networks, and gateways to national networks.  Users and students will need new skills to help them retrieve, review, categorize, and analyze the information and knowledge they will be able to access.  This will require investment in training for educators and students in the use of new technologies, development of model curricula and new instructional techniques, development of new information resources, improvement in the quality of existing resources, and extension of public access to electronic schools and libraries. </p>
 
<p>A national information infrastructure will create an enormous range of education and lifelong learning applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
	 <li><b>On-line Job Training Libraries </b>- Interactive, multimedia, digital libraries will be Table on job sites to provide workers with task-oriented information that they could use, at their own convenience and pace, to improve and upgrade their job skills and performance.  Workers in any job - assembly lines, retail outlets, sales, or offices - would be able to continuously upgrade their skills and learn new skills at any time through customized training libraries.


	 <li><b>Electronic Libraries </b>- Students will use on-line electronic libraries in classrooms and at home to learn more about any topic.  For example, if a student wanted to learn about the works of Shakespeare - or about a specific play - he or she will simply turn on a computer and, with the flick of a switch, be connected to the entire works of Shakespeare, complete with photographs, videos, and recordings.  The electronic libraries will include software tools to help students find the information they need, identify relevant data, analyze, and present the information and will provide access to information and reference specialists to help users locate the material they need.

	 <li><b>Virtual Laboratories & Field Trips </b>-Through virtual laboratories, students will perform science experiments using equipment and facilities located anywhere in the United States, including at the national laboratories, in collaboration with some of the nation's best laboratory scientists.  Students will also take "field trips" to museums, observatories, science exhibits, and research centers without leaving the classroom.

	 <li><b>Collaborative Learning </b>-Students of all levels and ages, teachers, and experts will collaborate, in real time, via high speed networks, on a wide variety of learning projects.  The collaborators will access information and high performance computing resources located throughout the country, such as images collected by NASA's Earth Observing System satellites, and would work together to develop research projects that focus on their own interests.
</ul>

<b><p>Intelligent Manufacturing</p></b>
<center><img src="../report13/5.gif"></center>
<p>The U.S. manufacturing enterprise faces enormous challenges over the next decade just to keep up with new information and new technologies.  The industrial world is rapidly moving to electronic commerce, in which suppliers and design collaborators will be on-line; factories will be highly programmable and staffed with highly skilled personnel product design and manufacturing will be fully integrated; and custom-made, high-quality products will be manufactured rapidly in small quantities.  Failure to keep-pace and maintain technological leadership will threaten our long-term competitive position in the world market. </p>
 
<p>Increasingly, to stay competitive, companies of all sizes must be able to respond rapidly to customer demands for high-quality products at low cost.  This requires manufacturing and design processes that are highly efficient and flexible to enable the shortest possible design, development, and production times.  Companies able to adapt and apply the latest information and communications technologies to their manufacturing processes will have an advantage over their less innovative competitors in the future.  The challenge, therefore, is to develop, deploy and apply the technologies for a manufacturing infrastructure that incorporates computing and communications technologies to support integrated development, engineering, and manufacturing processes. </p>
 
<p>It is critical to ensure that small and medium manufacturers are stakeholders in this new infrastructure.  Small and medium manufacturers are vital to the nation's economic development and growth, accounting for 40 percent of GNP, half of all employment, and more than half of job creation.  Providing small and medium companies with access to computing, communications, and information resources will enable them to adopt new technologies and manufacturing techniques, reducing the cost of doing business and increasing efficiency and productivity. </p>
 
<p>Work is already underway in the private and public sectors to expand the use of advanced computing and communications technologies in the manufacturing process, but much more is needed.  HPCC Program research in aerospace vehicle design and advanced materials are just a few examples of the application of high performance computing to benefit our industries.  Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technologies are being incorporated into U.S. manufacturing enterprises at increasing rates.  However, CAD/CAM technologies, which are further advanced than many other intelligent manufacturing innovations, still need improvement before they can be widely implemented and must be integrated into both the design and manufacturing processes to fully realize their benefits. </p>
 
<p>A national information infrastructure has the potential to significantly increase the productivity and quality of U.S. manufacturing by enabling applications such as:</p>
<ul>
	 <li><b>Concurrent and Distributed Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing </b>- Manufacturers of products, from automobiles to airplanes, and from machine tools to televisions, will distribute scheduling and production across geographically dispersed facilities to reduce production delays, minimize manufacturing, transportation, and inventory costs, perform design, engineering, and manufacturing concurrently, and leverage unique skills and availability of skilled resources.  Large amounts of information, such as engineering modeling data, product specifications, test specifications, and bills of materials, will be

</ul><hr><p><i>
Companies able to adapt and apply the latest information and communications technologies to their manufacturing processes will have an advantage over their less innovative competitors in the future.</i></p><hr>
<ul>
distributed and shared among dispersed facilities in real time.  All of these techniques will significantly reduce the time to develop new products and bring them to market.

	 <li><b>Electronic Commerce for Manufacturing Enterprises </b>- Companies of all sizes will increase their efficiency and productivity while reducing costs by incorporating electronic commerce into their operations.  Through links with suppliers, customers and local, state and federal governments, companies will be able to conduct virtually all of their essential business opportunities electronically, including: locating the best suppliers to meet their needs, identifying potential customers for their products, placing and receiving orders, exchanging payments, and ascertaining the latest government regulations affecting their businesses and submitting required compliance reports electronically.

	 <li><b>Virtual Design and Manufacturing Project </b>- Manufacturers of complex, expensive products will use virtual design facilities to model, simulate, and visualize product designs and manufacturing processes in advance, saving the costs of building prototypes.  Eventually, virtual reality technologies will permit product designers to "walk through" new products before actually building the products and through manufacturing facilities before production begins.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Part II: Recommendations for Action</h2>

<p>By investing in the HPCC Program, the United States has already begun investing in the research for an infrastructure based on high speed networks, high performance computers, and on-line information.  CSPP will continue to work with Congress and the new Administration to implement our recommendations to improve the structure of the HPCC Program.  However, we must now make a national commitment to take the next step to develop a new national information infrastructure that will provide us with the best opportunity to compete in the global economy of the future. </p>
 
<p>Through a public and private partnership to develop and deploy a national information infrastructure, we will not only lay the best foundation for remaining internationally competitive, we will also give ourselves the best chance to solve many of our domestic challenges - the declining quality of education, the skyrocketing cost and limited availability of high-quality health care, and the need for businesses of all sizes to increase quality and productivity - which increasingly require the ability to access and use large amounts of distributed information. </p>
<hr> 
<i><p>We must now make a national commitment to take the next step to develop a new, national information infrastructure that will provide us with the best opportunity to compete in the global economy of the future. </p></i><hr>
 
<p>The time to act is now.  Creating a national information infrastructure of the future will require improving upon and linking together current communications, computing, information, and human resource capabilities.  More importantly, it will require developing new capabilities to enable broad access by millions of Americans to public and private information resources and to enable people to generate, transmit and receive text, images, and video anywhere, at any time. </p>
 
<p>Before the comprehensive information infrastructure of the future can be realized, a broad cross-section of American industries, academic and research institutions, and the federal government need to agree on a common vision for the effort.  With a common vision in place, the private and public sectors can make a commitment to do what they need to do, independently or together, to make the vision a reality.  While the private sector has primary responsibility for developing and making available the services, products, networks, and applications to make the infrastructure possible, the federal government has an important role as a catalyst in stimulating the effort and creating a regulatory environment that will encourage private sector investment and implementation. </p>
 
<p>To accelerate the development and deployment of a national information infrastructure, CSPP recommends that the Administration, Congress, and the private sector begin a joint effort to take the following actions: </p>

<p align=center><i>Administration Agenda</i></p>
<ul>
<b>1.  Make the NII a National Technology Challenge</b>: The President should declare the national information infrastructure a new national technology challenge.  The President should, in his State of the Union address and his FY94 budget submission, issue a challenge to Congress, industry, academic, and research institutions, and potential users to work with him to create a new information infrastructure.<br><br>

<b>2. Establish a National Information Infrastructure Council</b>: The successful development and deployment of a national information infrastructure will be contingent upon the government adopting a vision and a strategy for its implementation.  The best way to accomplish these objectives is to establish a National Information Infrastructure Council, chaired by the Vice President, to provide a management focus for the effort.  Members of the Council should include the Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and the heads of other federal departments, agencies, and White House Executive Offices who have roles or responsibilities in the information infrastructure, and private sector experts, including representatives of industry, user groups, and research institutions.  The Council should have as its initial responsibilities:
<ul>
	<li>adopting a vision for an NII;

	<li>working with the private sector to develop and adopt several concrete goals for the NII, with accomplishable milestones;

	<li>coordinating the NII activities of the various government agencies and departments; and

	<li>developing a strategy to address the information infrastructure policy principles listed following these recommendations.
</ul>
<br>
<b>3. Establish an NII Implementation Entity</b>: Establish a federal entity to implement the National Information Infrastructure Council's vision, plans, strategies, recommendations, and other directions.  The entity should have the responsibility and the authority to:<br>
<ul>
	<li>manage and focus the NII research agenda, including research performed by the national labs;

	<li>coordinate, in conjunction with other appropriate agencies and departments, the NII technology demonstrations; and

	    <li>develop strategies to overcome policy and regulatory barriers affecting the deployment by the private sector of a national communications network of interoperable, interworking networks.
</ul>

<b>4. Invest in Research for an NII: </b>The FY94 budget request should include funds for precompetitive, generic research on enabling technologies for an NII, such as the following:
<br><ul>
	<li>research on the generic, enabling technologies needed to address challenges in health care, education and lifelong learning, and intelligent manufacturing;

	 <li>research on the scalability problems associated with aggregating many high, medium, and low speed users;

	<li>technologies and architectures to ensure the security of information available in an NII and to guarantee privacy of information;

	<li>interoperability;

	<li>integrity and robustness of networks and databases;

	<li>human/computer interfaces, such as speech and handwriting recognition and machine intelligence; and

	 <li>research on creating and managing distributed electronic databases and libraries, such as indexing databases, digitizing libraries, and organizing material.
</ul>

<b>5. Fund Pilot Projects to Demonstrate Technologies</b>:	In conjunction with industry, the federal government should fund pilot projects to demonstrate the application of high performance computing and communications technologies to health care, education and lifelong learning, and manufacturing.  Such projects will help solve problems in scaling technologies and accelerate development of standards.
<br><br>

<b>6. Develop a Public Education Program</b>: Request the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering to develop, in conjunction with the private sector, a program to educate the general public about the potential benefits of an NII and the impact it will have on their lives.

<b>7. Make Government Information Easily Accessible</b>:	An information infrastructure could provide federal, state, and local governments with a system to better serve their citizens while reducing the cost of providing those services.  Through a national information infrastructure, people would have ready access to the most up to date information about their entitlement to health, education, housing, and social security benefits.  Citizens could, for example, use the infrastructure to register to vote, renew their drivers licenses, and pay their taxes.  The National Research Council should assess federal information collection and dissemination policies and practices and make recommendations on how such policies and practices should be changed to make public information easily available and accessible to citizens through the NII.  The NII implementation agency should be charged with developing a strategy to implement the recommendations across all affected departments and agencies.<br>
</ul>

<p align=center><i>Legislative Agenda</i></p>
<ul>
<b>1. Authorize a National Information Infrastructure Council and Appropriate Funds for its Operation</b>: Introduce legislation to authorize creation of a National Information Infrastructure Council to oversee development of the NII and appropriate funds for its operation.<br><br>

<b>2. Authorize and Appropriate Funds for Research and Technology Demonstrations</b>: Introduce legislation, based on the Information Infrastructure and Technology Act of 1992, to authorize research on NII technologies and demonstration projects in health care, education, and manufacturing, and appropriate funds for-such projects.<br>
</ul>

<p align=center><i>Industry Agenda</i></p>
<ul>
<b>1. Continue Investments to Develop and Deploy an NII</b>: The U.S. computer industry is investing billions of dollars each year in research and development relevant to an NII.  Industry must continue to work to develop and deploy the NII, including:
<ul>
	 <li>deployment of interoperable communications networks;

	<li>development of on-line databases and applications;

	 <li>development of easy to use computers and information appliances; and

	 <li>training people to design, develop, and use the various elements of the infrastructure.
</ul>
<br>
<b>2. Continue to Invest in Research and Development of Applications</b>: Companies must continue independent and collaborative efforts to invest in research on NII technologies and development of new products and services.<br><br>

<b>3. Reach Out to Other Industries</b>: CSPP will initiate a project to encourage other industries likely to benefit from the applications made possible through an NII to join the effort to achieve an NII.
<br><br>
<b>4. Promote NII Efforts</b>: A wide range of affected industries should form a non-profit group to work with the National Research Council to promote the NII.
<br><br>
<b>5. Develop and Participate in Pilot Projects</b>: Industry should undertake an effort to develop strategic plans and facilitate the formation of teams to design technology demonstration projects in health care, education and lifelong learning, and manufacturing.
<br><br>
<b>6. Develop NII Goals and Milestones</b>: The private sector will work with the Infrastructure Council to develop specific examples of accomplishable goals for an NII, with concrete milestones, such as, for example, a nationwide system of on-line patient records accessible by any authorized health care professional, anywhere; and all small and medium manufacturing companies networked with the manufacturing extension centers.<br><br>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Policy Principles for a National Information Infrastructure</b></p>

<p>The public and private sectors have important roles in making the information infrastructure a reality.  While the development and deployment of the infrastructure must be led by the private sector, guided by the forces of a free and open market, the federal government can accelerate its implementation by acting as a catalyst and a coordinator. </p>
 
<p>CSPP has identified the following important public policy principles that will have to be addressed jointly by the public and private sectors before the information infrastructure can become a reality.  CSPP looks forward to working with the new Administration, new Congress, and other industry groups to address these issues.</p>
<ul>
<b>1. Access </b>-- Because an informed citizenry is essential to the nation's growth, all individuals must have access to the NII.
<br><br>
<b>2. First Amendment </b>-- To ensure freedom of expression in an NII, First Amendment principles guaranteeing freedom of speech, as articulated by U.S. courts, should apply to electronically-transmitted communications.
<br><br>
<b>3. Privacy </b>-- Consumers of NII services have a right to privacy in their use of the NII.
<br><br>
<b>4. Security </b>-- Information available through the NII must be protected against unauthorized access, tampering, and misuse, consistent with the needs of the applications and the desires of the user.
<br><br>
<b>5. Confidentiality</b> -- NII users must be free to use effective, industry-developed encryption to ensure confidentiality of communications and data.
<br><br>
<b>6.  Affordability</b> -- To promote maximum use, the NII must be affordable.
<br><br>
<b>7. Intellectual Property </b>-- The fundamental principles of copyright should apply to electronically-available information in the same manner as for other media.
<br><br>
<b>8. New Technologies </b>-- While it is impossible to anticipate all of the technologies that will eventually be part of the NII, the political and regulatory environment must encourage the development of new technologies and their incorporation in the NII.
<br><br>
<b>9. lnteroperability </b>-- The NII must support maximum interoperability among networks in this country and internationally.
<br><br>
<b>10. Competition </b>-- Service providers must have fair and open access to the NII in order to assure competition among such providers.
<br><br>
<b>11. Carrier Liability </b>-- Information services carriers and distributors who have no editorial control over the contents of electronic information should not be liable for the content of the information transmitted over the NII.

<p><b><a name="executive">Executive Summary</a></b></p>

<p>The computer industry was borp in America over half a century ago.  The industry's progress since then is an impressive example of an American success story.  Over the years, U.S. companies have grown and developed in America and have contributed significantly to the overall economic health of the country.  At the same time, they have gained a competitive edge and leadership position in what is now a global industry. </p>
 
<p>The success of the past, however, does not guarantee similar success in the future.  The American computer industry is in the midst of an international competitive struggle.  To maintain and improve its world leadership position, the U.S. computer industry must address the combined challenges presented by: 1) fierce competition; 2) increasingly shorter product life-cyclesand 3) foreign governments' support for their domestic computer industries. </p>
 
<p>The chief executives of thirteen leading American computer companies, the members of the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), recognize that the primary burden for meeting those challenges and seizing new opportunities rests with each company.  As a result, CSPP's member companies are taking independent actions to: 1) maintain a steady investment in R&D and innovation; 2) focus on commercialization; 3) emphasize quality; 4) compete globally; and 5) educate their work force. </p>
 
<p>Nevertheless, the U.S. government also has a role to play.  Through its policies and practices, the government can create a supportive public policy climate and set an appropriate national tone that facilitates the industry's ability to succeed.  In addition, the government can provide a research foundation for industry to build upon by continuing its commitment to basic research and focusing more attention on commercially relevant R&D. </p>
 
<p>To that end, CSPP recommends the federal government take the following actions during the 103rd Congress to bolster economic performance and build a solid technology and trade policy foundation for the future:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take Action to Increase the Nation's Return on the Federal R&D Investment;
 <li>Expand the Research Agenda of the High Performance Computing and Communications Program;
 <li>Create a New National Technology Challenge: A National Information Infrastructure for the Future;
 <li>Implement Policies to Open Markets and Expand Trade; and
	<li>Enhance the Ability of U.S. Companies to Compete Globally by Modernizing and Strengthening U.S. Antidumping Law and Modernizing the U.S. Export Licensing System.
</ul>

<p><b><a name="introduction">Introduction: The U.S. Computer Industry</a></b></p>

<p><b>Made in America </b>- The success of the computer industry is an example of the American entrepreneurial spirit at work.  The computer industry was born in a university laboratory less than half a century ago.  A ballroom-sized invention performed in minutes calculations that until then took dozens of people days to compute.  Through American ingenuity and a commitment to continuously increasing efficiency, those same calculations are now performed in moments on computers that can fit in the palm of your hand or in your shirt pocket. </p>
 
<p>Today, computers and computer technologies are a pervasive and strategic element in the competitive marketplace.  With power and speed once unimaginable, computers are on the desks and in the briefcases of scientists, students, and business people in virtually every industry.  They are essential to the efficient production and operation of products from automobiles to airplanes and to the efficient functioning of businesses from grocery stores to banks. </p>
 
<p><b>Global Success </b>- Perhaps more than any other industry in the United States, computer systems producers, and the high technology industry of which it is a part, are highly integrated into the global market system.  In fact, there is quite possibly no other sector of the U.S. economy that contributes so much to, and depends so heavily upon, international markets for its domestic as well as its international success. </p>
 
<p>In 1991, CSPP companies had worldwide revenue in excess of $140 billion, almost 60% of which was derived from outside North America.  As information technology continues to develop into the 21st century and its value is realized around the world, the importance of overseas markets will continue to grow. </p>
 
<p><b>Future Outlook </b>- The successful companies of the future will be globally competitive companies that provide seamless solutions to business problems and emphasize quality systems development and service.  More and more, the real value of the computer industry is more than just manufacturing-based- it is knowledge-based as well.  The industry's value-added, and the best prospect for ensuring its future success, is the technology used to power its products and the applications designed for those products.  Moreover, the industry adds value through the jobs it provides, not only in manufacturing, but in high-quality, highpaying, knowledge intensive jobs in engineering, R&D, sales, marketing, and services, including repair, maintenance, and development of applications. </p>
 
<p><b>Challenges</b> - To be counted among the successful companies of the future, U.S. computer companies must have access to global technology and a presence in markets around the world.  Moreover, they must address various challenges presented by: 1) fierce competition; 2) increasingly shorter product life-cycles; and 3) foreign govemments' support for their domestic computer industries.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Fierce Competition</b>.  The rapid pace of technological advancements and the computer industry's success in domestic and global markets make it one of the most fiercely competitive U.S. industries.  Because technology and innovation are the primary products of the industry, and because there is no monopoly on either, there is always room for a new idea and a new company advancing that idea.  The result is constant competition not only from foreign competitors, but from domestic rivals as well.
	<li><b>Increasingly Shorter Product LifeCycles</b>.  In such a competitive environment, the speed with which any given company can bring a new product to the market increasingly determines the success or failure of multi-million dollar investments and the maintenance or loss of thousands of jobs.<br><br>

Typically, companies that manufacture computer systems derive half their revenue from products that did not exist two years earlier.  These incredibly short product lifecycles demand that the computer industry continuously develop new products based on innovative technologies.  In addition, it demands increasingly efficient production as newer products impose price pressures on older designs which become quickly obsolete.  As a result, research and development (R&D), the industry's primary resource in developing new technologies and processes, has always been and continues to be the foundation upon which the success of the industry is built.

	<li><b>Foreign Governments' Support for Their Computer Industries</b>.  The synergy between investment in R&D and the success of high technology industries is widely recognized by our international competitors.  Much of the competition the U.S. computer industry faces from its foreign competitors comes from the degree of support foreign governments provide their domestic industries.  This support is not just financial.  It also includes foreign governments' commitments to setting national technology priorities and identifying and developing technologies of strategic importance to the economic wellbeing of the country.
</ul>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><a name="industrys">Industry's Role</a></b></p>

<p>Clearly, the primary responsibility for meeting the challenges posed by the competitive domestic and international environment rests with each company.  In response, American companies continue to: 1) invest steadily in R&D and innovation; 2) focus on commercialization; 3) emphasize quality- 4) compete globally; and 5) educate their work force. </p>
 
<p><b>Invest Steadily in R&D and Innovation </b>-  The computer industry, like all corporate America, is in the midst of one of the most difficult economic periods in recent memory.  Nevertheless, our industry increased its R&D spending in 1991.  The U.S. semiconductor and computer industries invested $18.6 billion in R&D, more than any other single industrial sector (see Appendix A).  As a percentage of sales, the semiconductor and computer industries' investment in R&D was 8.7%, more than double the average for spending by all U.S. industry (see Appendix B).  Overall, the broader electronics industry, including computers, accounted for 3 1 % of all industrial R&D spending.  Of that, the semiconductor and computer industries' spending alone accounted for 24% of all industrial R&D spending (See Appendices C and D). </p>
 
<p><b>Focus on Commercialization </b>-Recognizing that the development of new technologies is only the first step, U.S. computer companies continue to expend significant efforts on turning those technologies into marketable products.  Companies are working to bring various corporate departments such as research, development and marketing together early to speed the commercialization process; forming strategic alliances with other companies and universities-, and capitalizing on the resources at the nation's federal laboratories.  For example, this past spring, the CEOs in CSPP and the Secretary of Energy, Admiral James D. Watkins, signed a model Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) designed to boost collaborative research efforts between the U.S. computer industry and the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Laboratories. </p>
 
<p><b>Emphasize Quality </b>-Delivering quality products to their customers has made the industry competitive and will keep the industry competitive for the long-term.  As a result, the computer industry has made quality a top priority by emphasizing internal programs and practices designed to ensure quality, beginning in the research phase and continuing through the development, manufacturing, delivery, and service phases. </p>
 
<p><b>Compete Globally </b>- The computer industry has become one of the most competitive industries overseas by developing products that capitalize on available technology from around the world and that respond to the needs and expectations of its global customers.  Overseas markets are the fastest growing markets for the computer industry.  Gross revenue from sales by the U.S. computer industry is approaching $200 billion, with almost 60% of those revenues derived from sales abroad.  According to export figures featured in the June 29, 1992 issue of Fortune Magazine, six CSPP companies currently account for over 13% of all exports generated by the top 50 exporters in the country.  The global success of the industry provides the constantly growing revenue base it needs to fund critical R&D.  While almost 60% of the industry's revenues come from overseas, 61% of the industry's employees are located in the United States, and 90% of the industry's research and development is conducted here. </p>
 
<p><b>Educate the Work Force </b>- The computer industry depends on technically proficient workers to design and develop new products, manufacture quality products, and design, install and use applications for computer technologies.  To ensure an on-going, steady supply of skilled workers, computer industry companies have instituted and continue to expand their own worker training and education efforts.  In addition, computer companies continue to participate in and establish programs to attract young students to careers in math, science, and engineering.  In total, CSPP companies spend over $2.25 billion per year to educate and train those they employ and to reach out to future generations of employees. </p>
 <hr>
<p align=center><a name="governments"><b>Government's Role</b></a> </p>
 
<p>While the primary burden for competing successfully rests with industry, the federal govemment has a clear role to play.  The government must implement supportive technology and trade policies and set an appropriate national tone that allows U.S. companies to innovate, create, and compete. </p>
 
<p><b>Technology </b>- The federal government has always had a role in investing in research on technologies critical to its mission needs.  Govemment research was, for example, instnnnental to the early beginnings of the computer industry.  Its role is just as cr-ucial today. </p>
 
<p>In 1991, total U.S. R&D spending, both public and private, was $151 billion (see Appendix E).  U.S. government spending accounted for nearly half that total at $66 billion, which was more than that of all of our major competitors' goverm-nents combined.  Despite the fact that this is a significant amount, there is room for improvement. </p>
 
<p>For the last several years, about 60% of the govemment's R&D spending has been devoted to defense research (see Appendix F).  Given world developments over the last few years, now is the time for the goverm-nent to work with industry to increase the focus of the federal R&D investment on commercially relevant research.  In addition, the government should work with industry to be sure public and private R&D spending priorities are more complementary.  For example, while 24% of private industry spending was devoted to computer-related R&D in 199 1, the U.S. govemment allocated only 2% of its R&D budget to computer-related R&D (see Appendices C and D).  During the same time, the goveniments of our international competitors recognized the importance of R&D in computing technologies and are investing billions of dollars in multi-year projects such as the Real World Computing Program and Teletopia Project in Japan; RACE, ESPIRIT and EUREKA in Europe; and the POLIKOM Project in Germany.  Better aligning U.S. government and private sector R&D spending priorities would improve the nation's return on its R&D investment and would provide the country with a stronger research base. </p>
 
<p><b>Trade </b>- Through its trade policies, the U.S. government can either help or hinder the ability of U.S. companies to compete.  To help companies compete, U.S. trade policies must recognize the global nature of the industry and the global nature of technology, and be designed to foster the flow of technology and products. </p>
 
<p>While this country has historically advocated policies that encourage open trade, other countries have not.  For example, the European Community created high tariffs to protect their computer and computer component industries.  The result was a decline in the competitiveness of the companies and a reduction in their global business.  If the goal is a healthy, vital computer industry, trade policies must not create artificial borders and boundaries. </p>
 <hr>
<p align=center><a name="cspp"><b>The CSPP Recommendations for the 103rd Congress</b></a> </p>
 
<p>On the following pages, CSPP offers a series of specific recommendations to improve the federal government's technology and trade policies in the 103rd Congress.  Taken together, these recommendations can help improve the ability of the computer industry to compete and bolster the country's domestic economic situation and international competitive position. </p>
 
<p>Nevertheless, the following recommendations will not have the desired effect unless they are complemented by the enactment of long-term policies to improve the overall business climate in the United States and to build a stronger U.S. educational system.  CSPP maintains a limited agenda focused on technology and trade policy issues.  As a result, CSPP's member companies work on business and education issues through a variety of other trade and professional associations, CSPP encourages the government to work with those organizations to create a sound business climate and policy framework that will enable the following specific recommendations to improve our economic performance and help provide the necessary technology and trade policy foundation for the future:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Take Action to Increase the Nation's Return on the Federal R&D Investment',
 	<li>Expand the Research Agenda of the High Performance Computing and Communications Program-,
 	<li>Create a New National Technology Challenge: A National Information Infrastructure for the Future:
	<li>Implement Policies to Open Markets and Expand Trade; and
	 <li>Enhance the Ability of U.S. Companies to Compete Globally by Modernizing and Strengthening U.S. Antidumping Law and Modernizing the Export Licensing System.
</ul>
<hr>

<p><b><a name="one">Recommendation #1</a></b></p>

<p align=center>Take Action to Increase the Nation's<br>
Return on the Federal R&D Investment</p>

<p>To help improve national economic performance, the return on the federal research investment must be increased by making it more relevant to the private sector.  CSPP recommends that the government work with industry to:</p>
<ul>
	 <li><b>Increase the Allocation of Funds to Commercially Relevant Technologies: </b>In addition to continuing its strong support for basic research, the federal government should work with industry to reallocate, over the next four years, $5-$10 billion more per year of its total R&D budget to research on pre-competitive, generic technologies.  This can be accomplished in part by:<br>
<ul>
1.	Developing and implementing model Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAS) that meet the needs of different industries, making it easier for companies to enter into collaborative research efforts with the govemment's research laboratories; and<br><br>

2.	Setting aside a portion of government laboratories' budgets for industry-driven cooperative research projects.</ul><br>

	<li><b>Improve Federal R&D Budget Review Mechanisms and increase Industry Involvement: </b>Budget crosscuts (summaries of major federal research initiatives that cut across the budgets of several different agencies) have proven very usefw in assessing federal spending on various research projects.  CSPP recommends that the government continue working with the private sector to develop and refine crosscuts of federal spending on generic technologies that can contribute to the improved economic competitiveness of the U.S. Furthermore, private sector advisory panels should be created such that they allow fWl participation by industry representatives in setting federal R&D priorities.

	<li><b>Improve Government Incentives for U.S. R&D: </b>In today's global marketplace, promoting American innovation is critical.  The U.S. government can enhance the incentive for U.S. companies to increase their spending on domestic R&D by making the R&D tax credit permanent and by permanently resolving the 861-8 research allocation issue by regulation.  CSPP urges the government to demonstrate its commitment to a healthy and vital U.S. R&D enterprise by taking immediate action on these two important issues.
</ul>
<hr>

<p><b><a name="two">Recommendation #2</a></b></p>

<p align=center>Expand the Research Agenda of the High
Performance Computing and Communications Program</p>

<p>U.S. research on high performance computing and communications (BPCC) is a significant and critical undertaking by the federal government.  CSPP believes BPCC technologies have the potential to provide the country with the foundation for an infrastructure that will help improve America's quality of life for the 21st century and beyond. </p>
 
<p>To date, CSPP has strongly supported Administration and Congressional BPCC initiatives and applauds the government's creation of a new, improved management structure for the current B:PCC Program.  As CSPP has advocated, the new structure provides a clear mechanism, which draws on private sector expertise, to coordinate, manage, and govern the implementation of the initiative.  In addition, CSPP is pleased Congress is considering legislation that will begin to move the BPCC effort to a new level. </p>
 
<p>CSPP believes that federal and private investments in BPCC technologies will be maximized by increasing the focus on how current research on BPCC technologies can benefit individual Americans and businesses.  To that end, CSPP recommends that the government enhance and expand the BPCC research agenda to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide the Foundation for an Information and Communications Infrastructure of the Future: The BPCC Program includes research to deploy a high-speed research and education network (NREN).  CSPP believes this research can be leveraged to provide the foundation for a much broader communications and information infrastructure for the future.  That broader infrastructure would not only bring the benefits of BPCC technologies to bear on scientific and engineering problems, but on difficult social and economic problems as well.  To that end, CSPP recommends that the government fund the current BPCC research program at the level in the budget request and allocate additional funds for research needed to enable a broader communications and information infrastructure for the future.

	 <li>Bring the Benefits of HPCC Technology to Individual Americans in Health Care, Education and Lifelong Learning, and Manufacturing: The federal government is committed to promoting a healthier, more educated, and more productive citizenry, and to improving the productivity and quality of the nation's manufacturing enterprise.  CSPP recommends that the government and private sector work together to be sure @CC technology helps meet these goals.  Specifically, CSPP recommends the government expand the BPCC budget in FY '94 to include funds within the Departments of Health and Human Services and Education, and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to begin research needed to solve problems in health care, education, and manufacturing, respectively.  In addition, CSPP recommends allocating additional funds to the current HPCC agencies (National Science Foundation, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, and others as appropriate) to expand their efforts in these areas.

	 <li>Create Technology Demonstration Projects: CSPP also recommends that the federal government work with relevant industry groups, future user groups, research and educational institutions, and state and local governments to develop technology demonstration projects to test the ability of an advanced communications and information infrastructure to support applications in health care, education and manufacturing.  Government support for such demonstration projects will help drive private sector investments in developing and producing applications.  In a separate paper to be released this fall, CSPP will provide more detail about the research needed in each of the areas and will suggest possible technology demonstration projects.
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="three">Recommendation #3</a></b></p>

<p align=center>Create a New National Technology Challenge:<br>
a National Information Infrastructure for the Future</p>

<p>The U.S. faces a challenge that is as significant as the challenge we faced when Sputnik was launched in 1957.  The current challenge is to enhance our future prospects for economic prosperity, an improved quality of life, and our global competitive leadership.  Meeting this new challenge will require the same level of national cooperation and commitment that led us to win the space race. </p>
 
<p>As we enter the Information Age, our best resource is our ability to create and exchange information, technology, and ideas.  Today, we have an edge.  The U.S. leads the world in its communications infrastructure and in the development of supercomputers and important computing and software technologies.  In addition, the BPCC Program will provide a critical, initial research foundation.  However, this is not enough.  We must elevate and accelerate our effort.  The United States needs to make a national commitment to capitalize on our leadership position and build upon the research foundation provided by the EPCC Program to create a new national information infrastructure for the future. </p>
 
<p>Creating a new national information infrastructure will require improving upon and linking together current communications, information, and human resource capabilities.  More importantly, it will require developing new capabilities to enable broad access to a variety of public and private information resources and enable transmission of text, images, and video to anyone, anywhere, at any time.  To realize the comprehensive information infrastructure of the future, CSPP recommends that the federal government work with industry to:</p>
<ul>
	 <li>Make the Drive for a National Information Infrastructure the New National Technology Challenge: The President and Congress should challenge American industries, universities and laboratories to form a public/private partnership to create the new information infrastructure.  The goal should be to immediately begin implementing a nationwide high speed communications and knowledge infrastructure capable of bringing the benefits of computing and communications technologies to bear on social and economic areas of widespread concern such as health care, education and lifelong learning, and manufacturing.

	 <li>Adopt an Industry/Government Vision and Milestones to Measure Progress: The government should work with industry, academia, potential users, and other interested parties to develop a vision for the future computing, communications, and information infrastructure, and a set of milestones to measure progress toward reaching that common vision.  CSPP is currently working to develop our industry's vision of a future information infrastructure and plans to issue a report in mid-1993 that will describe that vision and the steps we believe are necessary to move the country toward that vision.

	 <li>Address Public Policy, Political, and Regulatory Issues: A widely accessible, reliable, and useful national information infrastructure based on fair and open competition will require addressing a range of networking policy issues from interoperability, security, and broad access to copyright protection and availability of federal information.  During the 103rd Congress, the federal government should establish fora where these and a myriad of other relevant public policy issues can be addressed by experts from a range of industries, potential users and consumers, and the federal government.  CSPP also recommends that federal and state governments work with industry to ensure that various political and regulatory hurdles preventing the implementation of an information infrastructure are addressed in an open, timely, and systematic manner.

	 <li>Effectively Manage the Public/Private Partnership to Foster Commercialization: The government should encourage the near-term implementation of the new information infrastructure by- 1) facilitating access to and ensuring compatibility/interworking among multiple private and public networks- 2) investing in precompetitive technologies needed to make the national information infrastructure possible, including addressing interoperability and human factors issues; and 3) assisting disadvantaged users in obtaining access to the information infrastructure.
</ul>
<hr>

<p><b><a name="four">Recommendation #4</a></b></p>

<p align=center>Implement Policies to Open Markets and Expand Trade</p>

<p>To be competitive, U.S. high technology industries need access to the major markets of the world to earn the returns needed to sustain capital investment and critical research and development.  CSPP recommends that the U.S. government continue its commitment to opening markets around the world to U.S. goods and services by creating effective multilateral and bilateral agreements that focus on results, not managed trade.  Specifically, CSPP recommends that the government:</p>
<ul>
	 <li>Successfully Conclude the Uruguay Round of Trade Negotiations: The most important step that the United States can take to improve market access worldwide is to strengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Since open markets are one of the principal benefits of an effective multilateral system, the U.S. government should make every effort to successfully conclude the current negotiations on the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.  In particular, CSPP urges the government to be sure the final agreement includes a reduction in the very high European Community tariffs on computer parts and semiconductors.

	 <li>Implement an Effective North American Free Trade Agreement: CSPP actively supports actions to open markets around the world, CSPP urges the government to implement the NAFTA because it recognizes the realities of the global marketplace and will promote the growth and expansion of markets for U.S. computer products in Mexico and Canada.

	 <li>Implement the Japan Public Procurement Agreement: The U.S. government also should focus on bilateral market access initiatives.  In particular, the U.S. government should seek aggressive implementation of the January 1992 agreement by the Japanese government to open its public sector computer market to foreign products.  This agreement is critical because it directly addresses a significant problem: CSPP found that while foreign computer manufacturers have established a major share position in Japan's private sector mainframe market (41%); the foreign share of the Japanese national government mainframe market is only 0.4%. CSPP urges the U.S. government to continue working with the computer industry to define the most appropriate mechanisms for measuring progress under this agreement.

	 <li>Continue Efforts to Broaden U.S. Companies' Access to the Japanese Semiconductor Market: In accordance with the 1991 Semiconductor Trade Agreement with Japan, C SPP urges the U.S. government to continue working to ensure that Japan continues progress toward an open market for U.S. semiconductors.
</ul>
<hr>

<p><b><a name="five">Recommendation #5</a></b></p>

<p align=center>Enhance the Ability of U.S. Companies to Compete Globally</p>

<p>The ability of U.S. computer companies to compete globally is critical to the future health and vitality of the industry.  The U.S. government should work with industry to be sure its policies and practices do not act as a disincentive to global competition.  In particular, CSPP recommends that the U.S. government:</p>
<ul>
	 <li>Modernize and Strengthen the U.S. Antidumping Law: Modernizing and strengthening the U.S. antidumping law is a major trade policy priority for CSPP for two reasons: 1) CSPP members are highly integrated into the global trading system, sourcing from and selling to every major market in the world.  Our ability to compete globally is significantly affected by the antidumping law in the U.S. and foreign countries; and 2) effective antidumping law is one element of the high technology business environment necessary to nurture a healthy U.S. high-technology enterprise.<br><br>

CSPP believes antidumping law should be an effective remedy for injuriously unfair pricing, no more and no less.  Above all, CSPP believes antidumping law should be balanced and should not interfere with ordinary business practices, particularly practices vital to maintaining a strong U.S. high technology industry.  CSPP outlined its initial position on antidumping law reform in its May 1990 report, " Perspectives on Market Access andAntidumpingLawReform." CSPP recommends that the U.S. government begin working with industry to modemize and strengthen the U.S. antidumping law to reflect the realities of the current global marketplace.<br>

	 <li>Modernize the U.S. Export Licensing System: To be effective and to prevent negative effects on U.S. industry, government regulations must keep pace with the rapid rate of technological advancements.  CSPP is concerned that technological change is outpacing U.S. government export control policy.
<br><br>
Export control regulations based on older generations of technology may actually create or subsidize foreign competitors by reducing or eliminating the ability of U.S. companies to compete in viable markets.  For example, the performance threshold for supercomputers as currently defined by U.S. export control regulators is so low that it currently includes systems that perform at less than 1% of the speed of the top of the line machines.  As a result, even single chips used in desk-top workstations are, in some cases, currently defined as supercomputers.  Prohibiting U.S. exports of these chips does not protect a particularly high-level technology, it simply restricts U.S. sales.  In another example, the government is currently seeking to control the export of software with encryption capabilities.  This software is heavily in demand and widely available throughout the world.  Limiting exports of products with these features simply places U.S. companies at a disadvantage by prohibiting U.S. companies from selling their products overseas.  It does not control this technology.<br><br>

CSPP recommends that the U.S. government, working with industry, regularly and systematically revise its export regulation definitions to reflect the most recent technological developments.  Moreover, any controls over the export of computer technology should be multilateral, not unilateral, in nature.<br><br>

Expanding the Vision of High Performance Computing and Communications:<br> <i>Linking America for the Future</i>
<br>

December 3, 1991
</h2>
<center><img src="1.gif"></center>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary</b></p>

<p>Over the past year, the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), an affiliation of major U.S. computer systems companies, has reviewed the Administration's High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative (HPCCI), as outlined in <i>Grand Challenges: High Performance Computing and Communications</i>.  CSPP believes the HPCCI is a significant, critical and necessary undertaking by the government.  As currently designed, the HPCCI will advance research in high performance computing and networking technologies as well as increase the use of high performance computers to solve a range of scientific and engineering "Grand Challenges" -- problems whose solutions are critical to national needs.  CSPP believes, however, that the HPCCI can provide the foundation for something even more important: a new national infrastructure to promote America's growth in the 21st century and beyond. </p>
 
<p>Today, high performance computing and high speed networks are being used at an increasing rate in a wide variety of scientific, engineering, academic, and business settings.  The potential benefits of these technologies, however, extend far beyond this country's laboratories, universities, businesses, and supercomputer centers.  High performance computing, in conjunction with widely accessible high-speed networks, offers exciting new opportunities to improve the quality of life for all Americans. </p>
 
<p>To make the most of federal and private research investments in the HPCCI, however, the software, hardware, and networking technologies being developed must be based on the broadest possible vision of what high performance computing and communications can make possible in the future.  This requires expanding the current vision of the HPCCI to include Grand Challenges motivated by social and economic needs in areas of interest to the government and general public, such as advances in the delivery of health care and services for senior citizens; improvements in education and opportunities for lifelong learning; enhanced industrial design and intelligent manufacturing technologies; and broad access to public and private databases, electronic mail and other unique resources. </p>
 
<p>As a major user of computers, the government is appropriately investing in advanced computer technology research through the HPCCI.  By leveraging these investments, the government can develop more broadly applicable generic, enabling technologies and stimulate the additional research by the private sector needed to solve the expanded Grand Challenges. </p>
 
<p>CSPP strongly believes the HPCCI program will have maximum benefit to the country only if the government collaborates more closely with industry and supports the broader vision of the HPCCI; advances the technologies to meet that vision; and implements a stronger management approach.  To accomplish this, CSPP recommends the following changes to the current initiative:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Expand the vision of the HPCCI and include research on generic, enabling technologies to support a wider range of applications;
	<li>Establish a technology and policy foundation for an information and communications infrastructure for the future;
	<li>Improve management and governance of the initiative and increase opportunities for industry participation; and
      <li>Reorder HPCCI budget priorities to achieve a more balanced program.
</ul>
<p>Working together, the government, industry, and the broader science and technology community can construct an HPCCI program that will contribute to our nation's ability to meet many of the science, engineering, economic and social challenges we face.  In addition, by cooperating, we can ensure a better return on the federal R&D investment; promote increased industry investment; and generate productive collaboration between industry, academia, and government.</p>

<p><b><i><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></i>
</b></p>
<p><i>Linking America for the Future</i></p>

<p>During the growth of the Industrial Age, America built national transportation links to move people, goods, and raw materials across increasingly greater distances.  Just as these interstate highways were crucial to our post-war development, national data links are necessary for growth in the 21st century and beyond.  As the United States enters the Information Age, a new national infrastructure is required. </p>
 
<p>Today, high performance computing is increasingly used in a wide variety of scientific, engineering, academic, and business settings.  The potential benefits, however, extend far beyond these current uses.  In conjunction with high-speed networks, high performance computing could be the new national infrastructure, offering virtually unlimited opportunities to solve challenges and improve efficiency in ways which directly affect the lives and well-being of all Americans.  Among the opportunities are:</p>
<ul>
       <li>better health care;
	<li>lifelong learning;
	<li>improved services for senior citizens, the disabled, and the housebound;
	<li>enhanced industrial design and intelligent manufacturing technology; and
	<li>broad access to public and private databases, electronic mail, and other unique resources.
</ul>
<p>Realizing these opportunities requires harnessing the collective energy, talents, and unique resources of industry, academia, the general public, and the federal government.  By enhancing the ability of all Americans to better communicate, share resources and exchange information, the HPCCI can promote a new national infrastructure -- potentially the most powerful tool our nation has ever had to bolster its international economic position and long-term national well-being. </p>
 
<p>Over the last nine months, the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), an affiliation of chief executives of twelve leading American computer companies, has begun to define this broader vision of high performance computing and communications.  If followed, the recommendations offered in this report could help establish the new national infrastructure that would bring the benefits of high performance computing and communications to individual Americans.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><i><a name="providing">HPCCI</a></i></b></p>
<p><i>Providing the Foundation</i></p>

<p>In February, 1991, as part of its budget submission to Congress, the Bush Administration released <i>Grand Challenges: High Performance Computing and Communications</i>, summarizing its High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative (HPCCI), a cross-agency research program on computing and networking technologies.  The HPCCI is designed to advance research in high performance computing and networking technologies as well as increase the use of high performance computers to solve a range of scientific and engineering "Grand Challenges" -- problems whose solutions are critical to national needs. </p>
 
<p>CSPP fully supports the goals of the HPCCI and the Administration's program described in <i>Grand Challenges</i>, and commends the Administration for its leadership in designing this important initiative.  Similarly, CSPP commends Congress for funding the initiative in Fiscal Year 1992, and for recent legislation that would establish a high performance computing program and National Research and Education Network. </p>
 
<p>In addition to helping the U.S. maintain its worldwide lead in high performance computing, the HPCCI will lead to specific critical developments in areas such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>improving the accuracy of weather forecasts;
	<li>identifying and analyzing cancer-causing genes;
	<li>finding new ways to reduce air pollution; and
      <li>increasing the efficiency of internal combustion engines.
</ul>
<p>Just as important, however, the HPCCI has the potential to benefit the nation much more broadly by driving important advancements in technologies and policies that will make possible a wide range of future high performance computing and communications applications.</p>

<p><i><a name="expanding">Expanding the Vision</a></i></p>

<p>CSPP believes expanding the vision of HPCCI to include a more comprehensive view of what HPCCI technologies can make possible in the future will increase the return on the research investments made in the program.  This requires that the HPCCI program include additional Grand Challenges to supplement those already identified by the Administration.  Basing federal and private research in software, hardware, and networking technologies on the broadest possible vision will make the most of the foundation provided by the current HPCCI. </p>
 
<p>CSPP firmly believes that the best means to advance the long-term goals of the HPCCI is for all America to become captivated by the possibilities.  The following pages provide just a few examples of what an expanded HPCCI could make possible.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><i><a name="better">BETTER HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL SERVICES</a></i></b></p>
<center><img src="2.gif"></center>
<ul>
	<li>Patients will be linked directly to computers that will not only monitor medical data, but will continuously transmit that information for rapid analysis and ongoing diagnosis by remote experts.
	<li>Interactive video coupled with high capacity networks will deliver medical care, including consultations and diagnoses, to populations without easy access to state of the art medical care and equipment.  Besides improving the accuracy of diagnoses, this could reduce the cost of providing medical care throughout the United States by permitting more efficient use of expensive equipment.
	<li>Doctors, patients, and hospitals will be able to confer and consult with specialists in distant cities, sharing high definition video images, audio transmissions, and statistical data from several sources as needed.
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b><i><a name="lifelong">LIFELONG LEARNING</a></i></b></p>
<center><img src="3.gif"></center>
<ul>
	<li>Students will have easy access comprehensive remote databases providing information such as historical and forecasted weather data for their localities.  They will be able to compare it with data they collect themselves, analyze the accuracy of predictions, and compare it with data collected by students in other parts of the country through interactive video conferences.

<p><b><i><a name="one">RECOMMENDATION #1</a></i></b></p>

<p align=center>Expand the Vision of the HPCCI and Include Research on<br>
Generic, Enabling Technologies To Solve a<br>
Wider Range of Grand Challenges</p>

<p>To expand the vision of the HPCCI, federal agencies, such as the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Commerce, should work with industry to identify additional Grand Challenges in social and economic areas of direct interest to the government, such as those described on the previous pages.</p>

<p>To make the new vision a reality, the HPCCI must include research on the generic, enabling technologies and the computing and communications architectures needed to enable a wide variety of applications.  These include technologies needed for development of open, scaleable platforms and systems, from high performance workstations to parallel vector, heterogeneous and massively parallel systems.  The current HPCCI will address a range of technologies, including, for example, the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>new computer architectures that will permit high-capacity information processing;
	<li>advanced microelectronic technologies, including packaging;
	<li>compression and decompression techniques;
	<li>broadband networks and protocols;
	<li>improved techniques for mass data storage and retrieval to permit storage of complex images;
	<li>improved technologies and algorithms for accessing large databases;
innovative user interface technologies;
	<li>new algorithms for massively parallel machines, heterogeneous computers and workstations, and other platforms and applications;
	<li>advanced database technology, including tools and services to tie together the users, the applications, the systems technology and the operating systems; and
      <li>enhanced multimedia technologies and capabilities.
</ul>
<p>These technologies, while useful in solving the science and engineering Grand Challenges, can help to do more.  The national investment in the HPCCI research program can be enhanced by designing it in such a way that the technologies also support solving the additional social and economic Grand Challenges. </p>
 
<p>CSPP companies are already pursuing these and other necessary technologies individually.  Moreover, we are prepared to invest in collaborative work with the government.  In fact, we are developing a computer industry model Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Department of Energy designed to increase industry/laboratory interaction. </p>
 
<p>Throughout implementation of the program, it is critical that the government collaborate with both the user and computer systems industries to be sure the HPCCI research and development priorities will support the development of the hardware, software and networking tools needed to solve the expanded Grand Challenges.  It is equally critical that new insights, knowledge, and technology developments generated by the HPCCI be quickly transferred to the private sector for actual development, production, and deployment. </p>
 
<p>CSPP also urges that the Library of Congress and the many government agencies that generate and maintain large amounts of useful information be included in the HPCCI to help lay the research foundation for a National Digital Library.  The participation of agencies such as the departments of Agriculture, Transportation, Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, is necessary to most efficiently develop the technologies needed to make databases easily accessible over a network.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><i><a name="two">RECOMMENDATION #2</a></i></b></p>

<p align=center>Establish a Technology and Policy Foundation for an<br>
Information and Communications Infrastructure for the Future</p>

<p>Developing the most efficient, effective and broad-reaching communications and information infrastructure for the future requires that near-term research and policy decisions be made with an eye toward the long-term.  As it is described in Grand Challenges, the National Research and Education Network (NREN) will provide a basic infrastructure for research and education.  However, the NREN offers the foundation for something broader and more exciting. </p>
 
<p>Through an expanded HPCCI research agenda, there is an opportunity to lay the technology and policy foundation to support a much more comprehensive electronic communications and information infrastructure.  Such an infrastructure, to be developed and deployed by the private sector, will consist of a number of interconnected networks that will not only connect research hubs across the country, but will bring educational, health, social, business, and entertainment services to households, schools, hospitals, and offices across the United States.  This "network of networks" will provide all Americans with access to unique resources, public and private databases, and other individuals throughout the country. </p>
 
<p>To make this possible, government and industry must work together to address the following.</p>
<ul>
<i>1. NETWORK POLICY CONSIDERATIONS </i>-- As a broad communications and information infrastructure develops, many important policy and network management issues will need to be addressed, including, for example:
<ul>
	<li>how to ensure security and privacy of widely accessible networks and the communications transmitted over them, including methods for ensuring privacy of data and files identifiable to individuals;
	<li>protection of copyright licensing and royalty rights;
 	<li>allocation of radio and broadcast spectrum for networking purposes;
	<li>the role of the FCC with respect to networks; and
	<li>how to develop and implement flexible and fair standards applicable to high capacity networks.
</ul><br>
CSPP urges the Administration to ensure the HPCCI serves as a stepping stone to a broader future information infrastructure by beginning to address these and other network-related issues now.  This will require expanding the activities under the NREN component of the HPCCI to include research and development on the technologies needed to support broadly accessible and affordable networks.<br><br>

<i>2. ENSURING NETWORK INTEROPERABILITY </i>-- The future information infrastructure is expected to be a network of today's many separate regional, local, private,, and public networks.  To be able to send information around such a network of networks, each must connect physically and logically with the others, a concept known as interoperability.<br><br>

To ensure interoperability, the multitude of commercial and research networks in the U.S. and around the world must be built on a harmonized set of coding schemes and protocols.  Because government policies and programs will have a significant effect on the protocols used in future networks, they must be coordinated to meet the goal of network interoperability.<br><br>

<i>3. ENSURING BROADEST POSSIBLE ACCESS </i>-- In the past, the federal government has been the sole convener and principal funding source for research and education networks.  Today and into the future, however, more and more of the funding for these and other networks, even experimental networks, will come from the private sector.<br><br>

While market forces must be allowed to operate to assure full competition in the provision of networks and services, an expanded HPCCI must include a plan for ensuring the widest possible access to the infrastructure as existing networks are upgraded and broadened.  The federal government should also work with foreign governments to ensure equitable access and use of foreign networks, as well as the ability of U.S. information providers to compete abroad.</ul>

<hr>
<p><b><i><a name="three">RECOMMENDATION #3</a></i></b></p>


<p align=center>Improve Management and Governance of the Initiative and<br>
Increase Opportunities for Industry Participation</p>

<p>CSPP is concerned that the current HPCCI management approach is not strong enough to guarantee effective results.  In particular, it does not take sufficient advantage of existing industry expertise in implementing similar systems. </p>
 
<p>The HPCCI is a complex project which is being undertaken by at least eight federal agencies, each with separate needs for high performance computing and networking activities.  With the exception of the National Science Foundation, the agencies are focused primarily on pursuing agency missions and objectives.  At this time, there is no unified vision of the HPCCI or any ultimate point of responsibility for ensuring the overall program goals are met. </p>
 
<p>If the HPCCI is to move forward effectively and efficiently, CSPP believes there must be explicit coordination and accountability, as well as a clear mechanism, which draws on industry expertise, to coordinate, manage and govern the implementation of the initiative.  CSPP is willing to work with the government to help identify an appropriate lead body within the Executive Branch that would:</p>
<ul>
	<li>develop and support a national vision for the HPCCI;
	<li>develop a coordinated research and public policy agenda designed to make the national vision for HPCCI a reality;
	<li>identify the government's role in accomplishing and overseeing the vision and the necessary computing and communications architecture;
	<li>develop a set of measures and checkpoints against which progress toward the ultimate goals of the initiative can be measured;
	<li>develop a mechanism to ensure that industry, academia, and other parties with expertise to offer can interact with the government and directly contribute to the design and implementation of the HPCCI; and
	<li>develop a system to ensure the efficient transfer of government-developed technology under the HPCCI to the private sector for product development and application.
</ul>

<p>CSPP is particularly interested in working with the government to ensure close and continuing
involvement with user industries and the computer and telecommunications industries.</p>
<hr>
<p><i><b><a name="four">RECOMMENDATION #4</a></b></i></p>
<p align=center>Reorder HPCCI Budget Priorities
to Achieve a More Balanced Program</p>

<p>Following a series of meetings and interviews with the relevant agencies, CSPP has concluded that in general, the research planned under the HPCCI will address the technology areas needed to lay the foundation for a world-class high performance computing and communications infrastructure.  However, CSPP believes, in addition to broadening the vision for the HPCCI as described on the previous pages, the following shifts in current priorities will maximize the relevance of the program to both the government and the private sector, thereby increasing the likelihood that the program's overall goals will be successfully achieved in the near future. </p>
 
<p>First, the focus of the HPCCI research should include research on multiple high performance hardware and software configurations, across a broad performance range.  In other words, the program should balance research on massively parallel architectures with development and application of other high performance computing tools including open, scaleable platforms and systems, from high performance workstations to parallel vector, heterogeneous and massively parallel systems. </p>
 
<p>Second, the proposed budget, especially the Advanced Software Technology and Algorithms subcomponent, includes relatively large expenditures on equipment and facilities in addition to software research activities.  CSPP recommends that the Administration investigate whether the proportion of funds allocated to software research can be increased, perhaps by using or improving existing facilities. </p>
 
<p>Third, CSPP considers the activities planned under the Basic Research and Human Resources (BRHR) component crucial to the success of the HPCCI.  OMB and the participating agencies must ensure these activities are also given high priority.  Without trained personnel and a basic research infrastructure, none of the advances made in the other three program components can be successfully implemented or used. </p>
 
<p>Finally, successfully achieving the goals of the HPCCI will require a balance between advancing key technologies and applying those technologies to solve complex problems affecting our society.  These problems cannot be solved, nor the benefits distributed, without leaps in a broad range of technologies.  However, planned HPCCI activities seem to focus on advancing key computer technologies, while applying and disseminating the technologies to solve critical problems is given a a secondary role.  CSPP recommends balancing these two goals to ensure both are adequately addressed.</p>

<h2 align=center>
PERSPECTIVES ON U.S. TECHNOLOGY POLICY, PART II:<br>
INCREASING INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT<br>

February 26, 1991</h2>
<hr>

<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></p>

<p>The following paper is designed as an update on the CSPP technology policy effort.  Since issuing our initial technology assessment in July, 1990, we have continued to analyze, study and evaluate the challenges confronting our industry. </p>
 
<p>We have concluded that the cooperative R&D investments by the private sector and governments worldwide demand a new level of cooperation between industry and government in the United States. </p>
 
<p>CSPP has established CEO-level working groups to develop specific plans that will improve the economic return on the national R&D investment by:</p>
<ul>
1. Improving federal R&D budget review mechanisms through industry input;<br><br>

2. Implementing the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative; and<br><br>

3. Increasing the interaction between industry and the federal laboratories.
</ul>
<p>We urge other industries that depend on research and technology advancements to conduct their own internal technology assessments.  Further, we encourage them to work to improve their own competitive positions by increasing their involvement in federal R&D priority-setting. </p>
 
<p>At the same time, the Administration and Congress should begin working with a wide range of industries, both individually and through cross industry efforts such as the Council on Competitiveness' National Technology Priorities Project, to increase the focus of government-funded R&D on critical pre-competitive, generic technologies. </p>
 <hr>
<p align=center><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
 
<p><i>The Computer Systems Industry </i></p>
 
<p>Computer systems technologies and products increase productivity in a variety of sectors.  In fact, it is difficult to think of significant technical advances over the past two decades that have not relied on computer systems.  The computer systems industry is, clearly, a building block for other high technology industries. </p>
 
<p>Computer systems products are necessary and critical components of virtually all modern manufacturing and service industries, from communications systems and business equipment to medical and scientific instrumentation and consumer electronics.  In addition, development and operation of most of the sophisticated weapons systems in the U.S. arsenal would be impossible without computer systems and electronic components. </p>
 
<p><i>The Initial CSPP Technology Assessment </i></p>
 
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) began its technology policy work over a year ago with a detailed, internal assessment.  For the first time, the industry's chief technologists worked together to examine how the industry could best define and address the technology issues and public policy areas that affect our success.  We began by answering three crucial questions: what are the technologies that are critical to the competitiveness of the U.S. computer systems industry?; what is the relative U.S. position in these technologies compared to our foreign competitors?; and what is the future prognosis for these technologies in the U.S.? </p>
 
<p>The result of our assessment was mixed.  In our report entitled <i>Perspectives: Success Factors in Critical Technologies</i>, which was released in July 1990, we identified 16 technologies critical to the success of the computer industry, and concluded that the U.S. still leads the world in half (mostly software-related technologies).  We also concluded, however, that the U.S. lags the rest of the world in the other half (mostly capital-intensive technologies). </p>
 
<p>Our chief technologists then projected the U.S. position in these technologies five years into the future, and concluded that the performance of U.S. industry in all sixteen technologies will erode without positive action.  As a result, we took our analysis one step further and identified 15 factors upon which success in these technologies depends - the levers which could, if improved, reverse the trend toward erosion of our competitive strength. </p>
 
<p>For each technology, we identified which of the 15 factors could help improve performance in that technology.  This correlation between success factors and critical technologies indicated three of the success factors -- skilled personnel, the general business environment, and research and development -- cut across a majority of the technologies and, if improved, could significantly increase the U.S. competitive position in the broadest possible range of the critical technologies. </p>
 
<p><i>Developing the CSPP Agenda </i></p>
 
<p>In recent years, private industry has addressed skilled personnel, business environment and R&D policy issues.  Of the three, its efforts in the area of R&D policy have been somewhat less focused.  Therefore, CSPP has concentrated its initial technology policy strategy on R&D policy -- specifically, on improving the U.S. research and development investment. </p>
 
<p>Nevertheless, skilled personnel and business environment issues are critical to the success of the computer industry and most other technology industries.  In fact, without a well-educated work force and a business environment conducive to investment, industries like ours cannot undertake the research and development efforts needed to make the technological advancements that will prevent further erosion of our technology base, let alone improve our position. </p>
 
<p>Acknowledging this, CSPP member companies are devoting substantial attention and resources to increasing the pool of skilled personnel and improving the U.S. economic climate, both independently and through our industry trade associations.  We wholeheartedly support and actively join the efforts of other associations in advocating policy changes that would improve these areas.  Statements of principles in support of ongoing activities which CSPP endorses appear in Appendices 1 and 2. </p>
 
<p>It is important to note that fully addressing the technological challenges facing the computer systems and other industries will require policy improvements in more areas than R&D, human resources and the business environment.  In fact, these are only a few of the pieces of a much bigger puzzle.  Accordingly, CSPP members have begun, and will continue, to take independent steps within our individual companies to improve our competitive position by improving quality and increasing efficiency.  In addition, using our critical technology assessment as a guide, CSPP member companies have undertaken independent, internal efforts to improve U.S. performance in each of the sixteen technologies, independent of government-industry activities.  Further, CSPP will continue to explore ways in which the industry can work together to strengthen its position in critical technologies.</p>
<hr>

<p align=center> <b>INCREASED INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT COOPERATION: </b><br>
A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
THE FEDERAL R&D INVESTMENT</p>

<p>As we began the search for solutions to the technological challenges confronting our industry, we reviewed the role of government investment in R&D in the U.S. and other countries.  Our assessment of global R&D spending patterns, presented in Part I of this report, <i>The Federal R&D Investment</i>, provided a useful starting point for developing our policy recommendations. </p>
 
<p>It was clear from our analysis that while the total amount of federal R&D spending is substantial, its bias toward defense development leaves limited funds and focus available for pre-competitive, generic technology R&D.  This bias is particularly noteworthy when compared with the R&D spending of the Japanese and European Community governments.  In order to improve the nation's ability to compete in the technologies essential to its future economic and military security, we believe the focus of U.S. federal R&D must address these global realities.  CSPP believes the first step toward this objective is to expand the role of the private sector in setting priorities for government R&D investment. </p>
 
<p><i>A Good Beginning </i></p>
 
<p>Last fall, the Administration issued a report on U.S. Technology Policy which was a first and welcome step in the right direction.  The report, signaling an evolution in position, acknowledges a role for the government in technology policy, stating that the Administration is prepared to work with industry on critical, pre-competitive, generic technologies.  More recently, President Bush called for increased investments in research and development in high technology in his State of the Union Address.  The Administration's Fiscal Year 1992 budget proposal reflects this shift in priorities by increasing spending on applied R&D by $1.5 billion, or ten percent, including funds for a high performance computing and communications network, the Department of Commerce's Advanced Technology Program, new initiatives in advanced materials R&D and continued support for SEMATECH. </p>
 
<p>CSPP is ready and willing to work with the federal government to maximize the return on the nation's investment in these and other technology research efforts.  Specifically, CSPP recommends that the government and the computer systems industry take the following steps together to improve the effectiveness of the nation's R&D investment:</p>
<ul>
1. Improve the mechanisms for reviewing federal R&D spending, including increased industry input in setting federal R&D priorities;<br><br>

2. Implement the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative, including a national network capable of bringing the benefits of computing to every household and school in the nation; and<br><br>

3. Increase the interaction between industry and the federal laboratories, including private sector advice on laboratory R&D priorities, aimed at improving the economic return on the national R&D investment.
</ul>
<i>A Cooperative Strategy for Success</i>

<p>By working together, U.S. industry and government can improve the effectiveness of the federal R&D investment by re-focusing spending on those pre-competitive, generic technologies with known commercial relevance.  To increase industry input, CSPP specifically recommends a cooperative government-industry strategy to:</p>
<ul>
<b>Improve R&D Budget Review Mechanisms Through Industry Input </b>-- The Administration and Congress must develop a better sense of how its $76 billion investment in R&D is being spent.  As a starting point, CSPP urges the Administration and Congress to develop a comprehensive summary of the federal R&D budget, including detailed summaries -- budget crosscuts -- of agency efforts on initiatives related to developing generic technologies.  This would provide a means by which the private sector and the government could review and adjust spending priorities to meet the nation's changing research needs.<br><br>

CSPP is pleased that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is providing budget summaries that cut across agencies in several key areas, including high performance computing, and is considering developing similar information for other research areas, including materials research.  CSPP recommends that crosscuts be done for other important technology areas as well, including electronics and information technologies.<br><br>

By including industry perspectives, the effectiveness and usefulness of these budget summaries can be improved.  We urge the Administration and Congress to ensure that industry is a partner not only as the crosscuts are developed, but also as they are evaluated.  Once crosscuts are available, strategies can be developed, with industry participation, to bolster investment in certain areas or to shift priorities where necessary within the parameters of current spending levels.  This should be an on process, not a one-time event.<br><br>

To facilitate this, CSPP has established a working group, including CSPP CEOs, company technologists and policy experts, willing to work with Administration representatives to develop and refine the materials summary.<br><br>

Further, we have established a CEO-level working group to investigate the legal and regulatory barriers that may impede or inhibit the private sector participation needed to make the federal R&D priority-setting process more effective.  We will report the results of our analysis, including recommendations for any necessary changes, later this year.<br><br>

<b>2. Implement the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative </b>- CSPP recommends fully funding the Administration's High Performance Computing and
Communications (HPCC) Initiative, including implementing, in conjunction with academia and the private sector, a National Research and Education Network.  This effort is critical to provide the research infrastructure required to maintain our nation's leadership in basic research, and to expand our capability to perform the applied research which moves basic science closer to commercial use.  In addition, the HPCC will be instrumental in helping achieve the national education and work force training goals established for the 21st century.<br><br>

CSPP will support this effort through a long-term project to identify possible future applications of a network that will enhance the quality of life and economic competitiveness of the nation.  Computer and networking technology can help solve problems and realize opportunities in American homes, factories, universities, workplaces and classrooms.  We have established a CEO working group to identify innovative network applications, the technological advances needed to accomplish them, and the best ways to describe the applications' benefits to the public.<br><br>

Further, CSPP has committed to work with the Administration to review the HPCC budget crosscut and examine the relevance to the computer industry of the research being conducted as part of this initiative.  Later this year, CSPP will provide recommendations to improve federal spending under the initiative.<br><br>

<b>3. Increase Industry Laboratory Interaction </b>- The Federal government spends billions each year on R&D in federal labs, three-fifths of which goes to defense programs.  Much of that R&D, properly focused, could be substantially more useful to the computer industry than ft is today.  CSPP believes that the nation's return on the federal lab investment can be enhanced by increasing private sector input into lab activities and shifting some labs' research priorities to include generic technologies that have commercial potential.<br><br>

Implementing these shifts will require a long-term joint effort by the government and industry.  CSPP recommends that OMB begin working with the private sector to develop ways to include industry input in laboratory R&D priority-setting and in ongoing laboratory research activities.<br><br>

CSPP has established a CEO-level working group to recommend ways to improve the federal laboratories' contributions to the national R&D effort, including developing funding mechanisms for joint industry-lab projects of interest to the private sector; identifying potential and current laboratory research projects and research areas that could benefit the computer industry; and identifying research areas that lend themselves to budget crosscut analysis.  The results of that work, along with recommendations, will be issued later this year.</ul>
<hr>
<p align=center><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>

<p>Improving U.S. technology policy is a long-term process that cannot be addressed by any one organization or any single set of recommendations.  It is, nonetheless, an essential process given the cooperative R&D investments by the private sector and governments worldwide. </p>
 
<p>Improving U.S. technology policy requires a long-term commitment and a series of changes by industry and government over time.  Whether as independent CEOs or as an industry, the members of the Computer Systems Policy Project are committed and involved.  We hope our perspectives and those of other high technology industries will help to strengthen U.S. technological leadership now and in the future.</p>

<p><b>APPENDIX 1
</b></p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b>CSPP STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES:<br>
SKILLED PERSONNEL</b></p>

<p>The computer industry depends on technically proficient workers to design and develop new products, to manufacture quality products, and to design, install and use applications for computer technologies.  Without an adequate supply of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, the computer industry, its suppliers, and its users cannot develop or implement the technological advances we need to ensure our economic and military security. </p>
 
<p>Recent studies confirm that the United States is not producing enough technically proficient workers to meet the future needs of U.S. industry, including the computer industry.  In "Workforce 2000," the Hudson Institute projects a shortfall of 400,000 B.S. graduates by the year 2000.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there will be 1.2 million new positions in programming available by the year 2000, but only 1.7% of college freshmen are currently majoring in technical subjects.  The number of Americans receiving engineering degrees has been dropping since 1986, while the number of engineering jobs is growing 25% per year. </p>
 
<p>While a skilled workforce is critical to the success of the computer industry, the challenges facing the U.S. educational system are far greater than any single organization can combat alone.  Rather than proposing new education programs to address the projected shortfall, CSPP will concentrate its resources in support of ongoing efforts. </p>
 
<p>First and foremost, CSPP supports the six national education goals adopted by the President and the fifty state governors in February, 1990, and private sector efforts to achieve those goals, such as the Business Roundtable and the National Center on Education and the Economy. </p>
 
<p>CSPP, as a group and through its member companies, will build upon existing efforts and programs to complement the efforts of other groups in providing the means to meet the President's national education goals by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing and expanding individual CSPP member companies' training and education efforts;

<li>Participating in and establishing innovative programs to attract young people to careers in math, science and engineering;

<li>Supporting increases in the numbers of federally-funded predoctoral science and engineering fellowships and traineeships; and

<li>Issuing interim reports as appropriate to inform the government and other interested parties of the needs for skilled personnel, as well as potential means for meeting those needs.
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>APPENDIX 2</b></p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b>CSPP STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES:<br>
THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT</b></p>

<p>The cost and patience of capital and the structure of the U.S. business environment play an important role in determining the extent to which the U.S. computer industry can make the investments it needs to maintain its long-term viability.  Developing new technologies, and bringing new products that use them to the market, requires high levels of funding and long-term management time horizons.  These conditions are more readily justified both when the comparative cost of capital is low enough to help offset the long payback periods, and when investors are willing to endure the short-term variations in earnings that may occur while long-term R&D efforts mature. </p>
 
<p>The twin goals of cheaper and more patient capital will be achieved in an economic environment that is both pro-saving and pro-investment.  Pro-saving policies are those that expand the pool of funds available for investments; pro-investment policies -properly structured -- help to direct those funds toward longer-term investments in R&D and manufacturing. </p>
 
<p>In addition, U.S. companies are often unable to take advantage of economies of scale, interrelated technologies, flexible manufacturing options, product integration, and other benefits of  joint manufacturing to which their vertically integrated competitors have access.  Pooling plant and capital enables companies to share risks in expensive projects. </p>
 
<p>CSPP supports federal economic policies that will increase the national saving rate, reduce the tax-affected cost of capital and permit sharing manufacturing risks.  Specifically, CSPP supports: </p>
 
<p>Sound fiscal management by the U.S. government to reduce the budget deficit, which would reduce the cost of capital for all American companies and improve the climate for investment, regardless of country to country differences in capital costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the budget deficit through spending cuts;

<li>Consumption taxes, if new taxes are necessary, to encourage saving and investment;

<li>Increasing the patience of capital through indexing the capital gains rate to encourage longer holding periods for investments;

<li>Reducing the cost of performing complex R&D, by making permanent the R&D tax credit, permanently revising the allocation rules for attributing domestic R&D expenditures to foreign income, and permitting total R&D equipment costs to be expensed in the year of purchase; and

<li>Extending the 1984 National Cooperative Research Act to include joint manufacturing.

<h2 align=center>
PERSPECTIVES ON U.S.  TECHNOLOGY POLICY, PART 1:<br>
THE FEDERAL R&D INVESTMENT<br>

February 26, 1991
</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

Since its creation in 1989, the CEOs, chief technologists and policy experts of CSPP's member companies have devoted significant time to studying and evaluating the technology challenges that face the computer systems industry.  With the help of Bain & Company, this effort included preparation of the following charts and graphs which describe current R&D investment trends and practices in the United States and other countries.  One specific goal in compiling this information was to identify how the U.S. federal R&D investment affects technologies critical to the computer systems industry and to compare that with how R&D investments in other countries affect computer related technologies.

We found that the U.S. federal investment in R&D is significant but that the return on this investment could be enhanced by refocusing the federal government's research priorities to include pre-competitive, generic technologies with commercial relevance.  The U.S. government allocates a greater percentage of its R&D investment to defense research than do the governments of our competitors.

Further, we found that the federal government's research priorities do not match the priorities of the private sector at a time when the private sector now drives technology advances in this country.  Consider, for example, that while the computer industry conducts more R&D than any other industrial sector (21% of the total U.S. private sector investment), the government allocates only a small fraction (2% of the total federal R&D investment) of its investment to computer-related technologies.

This information is particularly significant when compared to the R&D funding practices of our international competitors.  Computer-related technologies are a focus, through direct funding or other means, of the governments of technologically competitive nations.

Based on this data, we have outlined an initial set of technology policy recommendations in <i>Perspectives on U.S. Technology Policy, Part II: Increasing industry Involvement</i>.  In short, CSPP's recommendations provide a strategy for better focusing the federal R&D investment in pre-competitive, generic technologies that will help industry meet international competitive challenges by increasing industry involvement in federal R&D priority setting.  By working together, industry and government can improve the nation's return on the total R&D investment and help meet the international challenge to this country's technological strength.

<hr>

<p align=center><b><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></b></p>

<p>The complex process of designing and building today's information processing systems is dependent on two very intricate sets of relationships. </p>
 
<p>The first set of relationships exists among and within a diverse group of industries.  These include: computer systems, software, tool and test equipment, semiconductor manufacturing and peripherals and components. </p>
 
<p>The second is an intricate set of interrelationships among a number of complex technologies. </p>
 
<p>Weakness in one or more industries or technologies can materially affect the strength of the computer systems industry - and of many other industries that today are increasingly dependent on computers and computer-related technologies. </p>
 
<p>The purpose of this study is twofold:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To identify the critical "success factors" which profoundly affect the ability of the U.S. computer systems industry to compete in the development of innovative technologies well into the 21st century; and

	<li>To examine and report on the strength of the technologies that the U.S. computer systems industry has identified as critical to its health.
</ul>

<p>The CEOs initiated this ground-breaking report on technology public policy recognizing that the industry itself must take action to meet many of the challenges posed in the report.  By the end of 1990, CSPP expects to complete an analysis of public policies that will have a major impact on the critical success factors and the critical technologies.  At that time, CSPP will offer specific recommendations on the role of industry and government to the Administration and Congress. </p>
 
<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project, which was organized in 1989, is an affiliation of eleven CEOs from the computer systems industry.  CSPP's long-term objective is to inform policy makers of the critical concerns facing the computer systems industry and to provide ongoing information and data to help illuminate public policy issues over the next few years.</p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><a name="hist">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</a></b></p>

<p>For 30 years the United States has led the world computer systems industry in output, investment, employment, R&D, innovation and new product development.  The industry is a vital component of America's economy, directly employing more than half a million people.  Virtually every other sector of the U.S. economy, including defense, is dependent on its products.  In 1989, the computer industry:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shipped $164 billion in hardware, software and services;
	<li>Employed 587,000 workers in the U.S. and a similar number abroad in the production of hardware, software and in the provision of services; and
	<li>Exported $22.4 billion in computer equipment, six percent of total U.S.
exports,
</ul>
<p>Even these statistics understate how deeply American computers have penetrated the world economy.  Few aspects of business or industry remain untouched by the "computer revolution." Computer systems are far more than productivity engines. They are automating, expanding and reshaping virtually every aspect of business and altering the fundamental nature of work. </p>
 
<p>Although U.S. companies continue to dominate the world computer equipment and software markets, they find themselves in an intensely competitive environment.  While American companies' share of world computer system sales fell from 81% to 61% between 1983 and 1989, Japan's s share rose from 8% to 22% and Europe's share grew from 10% to 15%. </p>
 
<p>U.S. computer systems manufacturers have maintained worldwide market leadership in vital industry sectors, including networking, software and supercomputers, to a considerable degree because of their ability to develop innovative technologies.  Continued leadership in emerging technologies is especially important today because these technologies will provide the basis for the world's manufacturing and service industries well into the next century.  And foreign competitors are vigorously pursuing extensive R&D efforts in every key technology. </p>
 
<p>The overall vigor of the industry also depends on factors other than technology.  These include ease of use, marketing strength, quality of field support and the installed customer base.  In all of these, the U.S. continues to excel.</p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><a name="cspp1">CSPP'S TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT</a></b></p>

<p>CSPP has produced a carefully researched report on what the best technology minds in the industry - its chief technologists - believe to be essential to the future.  The technologists have identified "levers" (or catalysts) which will enhance U.S. performance in many technologies. </p>
 
<p>These technologists have identified fifteen "critical success factors" that profoundly affect the U.S. computer industry's ability to compete successfully in key technologies.  In addition, the technologists identified 16 "critical technologies" upon which America's computer industry will depend into the next century. </p>
 
<p>The technologists reported that the United States is maintaining its competitive lead in the technologies that stress creativity and human factors and are less capital intensive.  These include software engineering, applications technologies and computer (processor) architectures. </p>
 
<p>The technologists also concluded that the U.S. lags in capital-intensive technologies such as ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) fabrication equipment and facilities, microelectronics and manufacturing.  However, they were optimistic that the U.S. has the ability to significantly improve its current performance in the key technologies. </p>
 
<p>The technologists found a very strong correlation between certain technologies and certain of the success factors.  Critical success factors that cut across a number of important technologies include capital investment, state-of-art manufacturing, quality, applied research and development, basic research and skilled personnel. </p>
 
<p>By the end of the year, CSPP expects to propose to the Administration and the Congress a public policy agenda to address the success factors have the greatest impact on the technologies critical to the U.S. computer systems industry. </p>
 
<p>On a preliminary basis, however, CSPP's technologists reported a clear correlation between certain public policies and a number of key success factors.  High-impact public policy sectors include: cost of capital and tax strategies; education; federal research, development and manufacturing policies and support. </p>
 
<p>CSPP will work with other business and industry groups to develop a broad consensus that cuts across technology and industry lines.  For example, the Council on Competitiveness will apply a methodology similar to CSPP's in its current examination of the competitive viability of nine key U.S. industries, including computers.</p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><a name="cspp2">CSPP'S TEAM OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGISTS</a></b></p>

<p>Massive investments in the multi-billion dollar range are made in new technology every year by the eleven U.S. computer manufacturers whose CEOs make up CSPP.  Each enterprise's technology investment decision relies extensively on the judgment of its chief technologist. Collectively, the technologists comprise America's best thinking regarding the direction of technology and its effect on the computer industry.  These technologist include: </p>
 
<p>Larry Tesler, Vice President Advanced Products, Apple; Christopher J. Gintz, Director of Technology, Planning and Development, Compaq; Don Powers, Vice President and General Manager, Control Data; Jim Sundet, Chief Logic Design Engineer, Cray Research; Dr. Samuel H. Fuller, Vice President, Corporate Research, Digital; Dr. Frank Carrubba, Director of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Hewlett-Packard; Dr. John A. Armstrong, Vice President for Science and Technology, IBM; Lowell Deckard, Assistant Vice President of Technology, NCR; William Joy, Vice President, Research and Development, Sun Microsystems; Steve Wierenga, Director, VLSI Technology, Tandem; and John Wise, Vice President & Chief Technical Officer, Unisys.</p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><a name="cspp3">CSPP'S METHODOLOGY</a></b></p>

<p>The chief technologists met in Palo Alto, California and Houston, Texas.  At these meetings the technologists identified the most relevant "success factors" which will determine how effectively the U.S. can compete in technologies that are essential to the development and production of future generations of competitive computer systems.  From a wide range of technologies, the technologists then isolated those which are most critical to the future competitiveness of the industry. </p>
 
<p>The technologists utilized a procedure known as Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to correlate the relationships between technologies and critical success factors.  They also evaluated the importance of each technology and summarized their evaluations in terms of a numerical value on a pre-determined, ordinal scale. </p>
 
<p>The resulting data were tallied and all technologies above a predetermined value were defined as critical to the industry's competitiveness.  Additional analysis further isolated 8 of the 16 that were re-examined to validate the overall numerical results. </p>
 
<p>As the charts in this report show, the chief technologists assessed the U.S. computer industry's present competitive position versus the rest of the world.  Then, for each technology, they also agreed on where the U.S. industry is headed against its offshore competition under 1) current course and speed and 2) under optimal circumstances.  The technologists were in consensus that in every technology, the U.S. continues to have the ability to significantly improve its current competitive position. </p>
 
<p>CSPP's chief executive officers met in June, 1990 and unanimously endorsed the findings of the chief technologists.  The findings presently are being examined by an independent group of highly-respected experts in the technology industry.</p>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><a name="crit1">CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS: DEFINITIONS</a></b></p>

<p>The critical success factors were grouped in three categories: business environment research and development; and people and culture.  Seven of the factors were identified as especially important.  These appear in boldface at the beginning of each category:</p>

<p><i>Business Environment</i>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Capital Investment</b>: The availability of long-term capital resources necessary to build and sustain the infrastructure required to research, develop and produce competitive products.

	<li><b>Critical Mass</b>: The large scale and structure required to research, develop and produce competitive products.

	<li><b>Large Market Size</b>: The significant market size required to sell these exceedingly complex products at a profit.

	<li><b>Intellectual Property Protection</b>: The worldwide system of laws that protects proprietary interests in all forms of intellectual property, including inventions, works of authorship, trademarks and trade secrets.

	<li><b>Standardization and Standards</b>: Common specifications that simplify compatibility of products and services.

	<li><b>Reduced Risk for Large Emerging Markets</b>: Availability of early, sheltered markets - such as government procurements -- in which emerging technologies can be tested before they are demonstrably viable in the competitive marketplace.  This may be required because of immaturity of the technology or a current lack of cost effectiveness.  Establishment of these markets sometimes requires participation by multiple companies and government in demonstration projects.
</ul>
<p><i>Research Development and Manufacturing</i>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>State-of-the-art Manufacturing</b>: Manufacturing facilities that include the most advanced tools and techniques, including CAD, CIM, flexible manufacturing and robotics.

	<li><b>Applied Research and Development</b>: Research and development focused toward
specific commercial product areas, systems and applications.

	<li><b>Basic Research</b>: Exploration of fundamental scientific phenomena not directly related to direct product development.
</ul>
<p><i>People and Culture</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quality</b>: Excellence that pervades every aspect of the business process, including research, development, manufacturing, sales, administration, delivery, installation and service.  This results in world-class competitive products.

	<li><b>Exceptional People/Skilled Personnel</b>: Availability of high-quality, well-trained personnel at all levels.

	<li><b>Research, Development and Manufacturing Linkages</b>: Concurrent involvement in the product development process by research, development and manufacturing specialists leading to timely and cost-effective commercialization and incremental product improvement.

	<li><b>Cooperation by Business, Academia and Government</b>: Joint activities that focus, draw upon and combine the uniquely individual resources and strengths of each sector.

	<li><b>Private Sector Cooperation</b>: Joint activities within industry that enable sharing of resources and risk.

	<li><b>Cultural Characteristics</b>: A wide range of factors contributing to sub-optimal performance of American industry, such as close-in investment horizons, quarter-to-quarter financial perspectives, disdain of manufacturing and the declining quality of education.
</ul>

	<li>A list of the critical success factors that impact the technology; and
	<li>The competitive position of the U.S. computer systems industry:
<ul>
		<li>Versus foreign competitors today in implementing the 16 critical technologies: ahead; lead rapidly diminishing; behind; losing;

			<li>In five years measured against the same competitors if the U.S. industry and its competitors both continue at current course and speed; and

			<li>In five years under optimum conditions.  This will require maximum possible development of the technologies by the U.S. and assumes the critical success factors and public policies are optimized.

<p align=center><b><a name="summ">SUMMARY</a></b></p>

<p>CSPP has completed the first phase of its ground-breaking report on U.S. technology.  It has identified 15 critical "success factors" that will determine whether the U.S. computer industry can retain or regain a lead in 16 "critical technologies" essential to the future success of the industry. </p>
 
<p>The U.S. currently leads the world in highly creative technologies such as software engineering, applications technologies and computer architectures.  It is lagging other countries in capital-intensive technologies such as ultra-large-scale fabrication equipment and facilities, microelectronics and manufacturing. </p>
 
<p>Although the overall competitiveness of the U.S. computer industry depends on many factors, the key success factors are especially relevant to the U.S. leadership in the critical technologies.  These factors include:</p>
<ul>
<b>Business environment</b>: Capital investment; critical mass; large market size;
and intellectual property protection;<br><br>

<b>Research, development and Manufacturing</b>: State-of-the-art manufacturing; applied research and development; basic research; and linkages among research, development and manufacturing;<br><br>

<b>People and Culture</b>: Skilled personnel; quality; and cooperation among business, academia and government.<br><br>
</ul>
<p>The next phase of CSPP's technology project is to identify public policies that will most directly strengthen the "success factors," thus the critical technologies, into the 21st century.  CSPP expects to complete this phase of the project by the end of 1990.  At that time it plans to propose its public policy agenda to the Administration and Congress,

<p><b><i>Policy Proposals on Trade:<br>
Market Access and Antidumping Law Reform</i></b></p>

<p><i><a name="trade">TRADE POLICY OVERVIEW</a></i></p>

<p>The Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) has identified two interrelated public policy areas as top priorities for our focus: trade and technology.  This paper is the first in a series of CSPP public policy proposals regarding trade and technology. </p>
 
<p>Computer systems producers and other high-technology companies are highly integrated into the global trading system.  Perhaps no other sector of the U.S. economy contributes so much to, and depends so heavily on, America's ability to compete internationally.  This sector therefore has a substantial stake in the growth and openness of world markets and in the effectiveness and fairness of international rules of trade. </p>
 
<p>These objectives can be best achieved by the negotiation of comprehensive and substantive agreements in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.  Such agreements must be promptly and effectively implemented by a strengthened GATT and by the United States and other GATT members.  CSPP also supports progress in a wide range of other international initiatives: reform of the export control system, resolution of international monetary and debt problems, the evolution of the European Community's Single Market, expanded trade and investment with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and tax policies that promote international competitiveness. </p>
 
<p>CSPP has selected market access and antidumping law reform as two trade policy issues that require particular attention now.  This paper addresses each of these issues in turn. </p>
 <hr>
<p>MARKET ACCESS </p>
 
<p>Computer systems producers recognize that we may need, on occasion, bilateral government-negotiated market-access agreements.  Such agreements may be necessary to supplement our own competitive efforts and the more open markets that result from an effective multilateral system.  Because of the increased use of Section 301 and Super 301, CSPP has a special interest to ensure the development and implementation of an approach to market access that is effective and properly balanced. </p>
 
<p>CSPP proposes a dynamic market-access approach that uses specific criteria and contextual factors to define goals and that adjusts those goals as conditions change.  Our four-step process (i) identifies those markets that require bilateral market-opening initiatives, (ii) establishes, through bilateral negotiations, specific actions to be taken to achieve an open market by a date certain, (iii) periodically applies measures of progress, and (iv) uses government imposed sanctions carefully when necessary.  We oppose a government guarantee of market share.  We advocate, instead, steady and measurable progress toward open markets. </p>
 
<p>ANTIDUMPING LAW REFORM </p>
 
<p>Computer systems producers also have a special interest in antidumping law reform.  Antidumping laws are being applied increasingly here and abroad to high-technology products.  This increased application has highlighted a number of problem areas for computer systems producers and other high-technology companies.  These and other issues related to the use of antidumping laws are receiving significant attention in the Uruguay Round. </p>
 
<p>The prime objective of antidumping law reform must be the adaptation of the laws to the global trade realities of the 1990s.  Such adaptation means, on the one hand, enhancing the capacity of the laws to deter multiple offenses and circumvention and, on the other hand, sharpening the focus of the laws on pricing practices that are both unfair and injurious.  The four parts of CSPP's approach are: (i) realistic cost calculations to determine whether there is unfair pricing, (ii) deterrence of injuriously unfair pricing, (iii) measures to combat circumvention of antidumping relief, and (iv) recognition of marketplace realities.  CSPP believes that these antidumping law reforms, which build on the reforms enacted in 1988, would enhance the international competitiveness of American systems producers and other high-technology industries.</p>
<hr>
<a name="market2"><p align=center>CSPP Policy Proposal Summary<br>
MARKET ACCESS</p></a>

<p>Market Access for High-Technology Industries Must be a Prime U.S. Trade Policy Objective. </p>
 
<p>A More Effective Multilateral System is the Most Important Instrument for Achieving Open Markets. </p>
 
<p>The Time has Come for a Fresh, More Effective Bilateral Approach to Complement Multilateral Market-Access Efforts. </p>
 
<p>The New Approach Must Emphasize Results, Not Promises. </p>
 
<p>Market Access Must Mean Greater Opportunities for Competitive Products, Not Managed Trade. </p>
 
<p>A Dynamic Four-Step Process, Using Specified Criteria and Contextual Factors, Is Critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify Markets in which Multilateral Efforts Have Failed to Provide Real Opportunities for Competitive Products.

<li>Establish, through Bilateral Agreement, Specific Actions to Achieve Open Market by Specific Date.

<li>Measure Progress toward Open Market by Periodically Reassessing, Under the Then Current Circumstances, the Opportunities for Competitive Products in the Market.

<li>To Spur Progress, Use Government Imposed Sanctions that are Carefully Designed to Achieve Maximum Effect in Closed Market and Minimum Damage to U.S. Industries.
</ul>
<hr>
<a name="market3"><p align=center>CSPP Policy Proposal<br>
MARKET ACCESS</p></a>

<p>Open foreign markets are crucial to the competitiveness of the American high-technology industries: the makers and marketers of computer systems, semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing and testing equipment, peripherals, and software.  High-technology companies cannot earn the returns needed to sustain capital investment and research and development if they are foreclosed from reaching customers in major markets of the world.  CSPP therefore strongly supports market access as a prime objective of U.S. trade policy. </p>
 
<p><i>The most important step that the United States can take to improve market access worldwide is to strengthen the GATT</i>, for open markets are one of the principal benefits of an effective multilateral system.  Bilateral market-access initiatives are a mechanism to resolve particular bilateral problems.  Such initiatives must be viewed as discretionary supplements, not mandatory alternatives, to multilateral efforts.  When the U.S. Government and the American business community do need to resort to bilateral initiatives, they should fashion an approach to opening markets that complements the GATT.  Within this multilateral context, the time has come for both government and business to take a fresh look at bilateral market-access initiatives. </p>
 
<p><i>Basic to CSPP's approach to bilateral market-access is our emphasis on results</i>.  Results are not "expectations" or commitments or sanctions.  Results are sales made, market shares gained, and revenues received.  The market access approach that we propose is one that can achieve results. </p>
 
<p>We are firm in our emphasis on results, but <i>we are also firm in our opposition to managed trade</i>.  We neither need nor want government guarantees of market share.  What we need and want are opportunities to compete.  CSPP's policy proposal on market access is intended to focus bilateral efforts on making opportunities to compete a reality for America's high-technology industries. </p>
 
<p>CSPP's approach to bilateral market-access initiatives departs sharply from static approaches in which the market-access goal is established at the outset as a fixed numerical target.  CSPP advocates, instead, a dynamic process that refocuses the market-opening initiative as products, technologies, and markets change.  By defining goals in dynamic terms and by continually reassessing the conditions that promote or retard access to a particular market, CSPP's approach can be an effective complement to multilateral efforts. </p>
 
<p>Specifically, <i>CSPP proposes a four-step process that, in turn</i>, (i) identifies markets in which multilateral efforts have failed to provide real opportunities for competitive products, (ii) establishes, through bilateral negotiations, specific actions to be taken in order to achieve an open market by a date certain, (iii) measures progress toward an open market at regular intervals, and (iv) applies government imposed sanctions if necessary to secure results.  Although the goals, actions, measures of progress, and sanctions would differ from one market-access initiative to another, the process would be consistently followed.  This process would apply to all markets that are believed to foreclose competitive opportunities for foreign businesses and that remain closed despite multilateral efforts. </p>
 
<p><i>The first step of the process is to identify markets that require a bilateral market access initiative</i>.  CSPP recommends that the U.S. Government, in consultation with relevant industries and other interested parties, establish specific criteria at the outset to assess whether a given foreign market is closed.  The criteria would be used to measure deviations from an open market and the contextual factors would be used to adjust any such measured deviations according to changing product, technological, or market conditions. </p>
 
<p>Examples of possible criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between the share that U.S. electronics companies have achieved in the public sector market of a given country and their market share in that country's commercial sector;

	<li>the difference between the market share that U.S. electronics companies have achieved in a given country and their share in other countries of comparable technological or economic development; and 

	<li>the difference between gross sales levels or gross sales increases that U.S. electronics companies have achieved in a given country with a given sales effort and the levels or increases they have achieved in countries with similar markets that have had similar sales efforts.
</ul>

<p>Examples of possible contextual factors are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the U.S. industry's sales effort in the foreign market;
	<li>the competitiveness of U.S. products in the foreign market in terms of availability, specifications, performance, and quality;

	<li>the state of the global economy and of the foreign market's economy; and

<li>occurrence of strikes or other extraordinary disruptions in the foreign market or in other markets used for comparisons.
</ul>
<p><i>If the criteria and contextual factors, taken together, indicate that the particular foreign market is not open to competitive products, then, as a second step, a market opening initiative is launched.  </i>The U.S. Government would negotiate a bilateral agreement with the foreign government to achieve an open market by an agreed date.  The agreement would set forth specific actions to be undertaken by the governments and industries involved to open the foreign market on schedule.  The agreement would also clearly articulate the criteria and contextual factors that the U.S. </p>
 
<p>Govermment used to determine that the foreign market is closed and that it would use periodically to measure progress during the term of the agreement. </p>
 
<p><i>The third step is to measure progress toward an open market at regular intervals</i>.  Ordinarily, progress should be measured by undertaking anew the analysis that underlay the original decision that the market was closed.  For example, the U.S. Government, in consultation with its foreign counterpart and with domestic industries and interested parties, might annually calculate gross sales levels and increases, market shares, and other criteria and compare the range of these results with those of the previous year.  Both the extent of the differential, if any, and the trend in that differential could then be used to assess progress, taking into account such contextual factors as U.S. sales efforts, quality of product offerings, and other market developments. </p>
 
<p>The analysis may find that, because of the introduction of a new U.S. product since the market-opening initiative began, the U.S. share of an open market would be higher than had originally been expected; or, the analysis may find that a worldwide recession accounts for the lack of an increase in gross sales in the foreign market in question.  In any event, progress would be measured not by fixed milestones nor by straight-line interpolations between beginning and ending points.  Rather, the process would respond dynamically to changes in products, markets, and technologies that enhance or detract from U.S. competitiveness in the market in question. </p>
 
<p><i>If the periodic measures of progress show that inadequate progress is being made, theta as a fourth step, government imposed sanctions should be considered to secure results</i>.  Sanctions must be carefully tailored to achieve maximum leverage on the closed market with minimum disruption of American businesses.  In designing sanctions, the U.S. Government should confer with domestic interested parties and should avoid sanctions that undermine the competitiveness of the very industries to which the foreign market is closed. </p>
 
<p>CSPP believes that this dynamic four-step process can result in more effective market-opening initiatives.  By identifying closed markets, establishing specific courses of action, measuring progress toward open markets, resorting if necessary to carefully crafted government imposed sanctions, and adapting the market-access initiative to changing circumstances, the CSPP process can achieve greater access for the competitive products of America's high-technology industries. </p>
 
<p>We welcome the active support of the U.S. Government in launching this process.  The U.S. Government has a critical and constructive role to play in initiating the assessment that identifies market-opening needs, in negotiating effective bilateral agreements, in timely and fairly measuring progress, and in applying sanctions if progress is not forthcoming.  CSPP strongly believes, however, that the U.S. Government should be the guarantor only of the fairness and transparency of the process itself-, the results must be the work of the American business community.  If accorded real opportunities to compete, we are confident that the results will reaffirm the vigorous competitiveness of America's high-technology industries.</p>

<a name="anti1"><p align=center>CSPP Policy Proposal Summary<br>
ANTIDUMPING LAW REFORM</p></a>

<p>The Antidumping Laws Constitute a Powerful Weapon in the Trade Policy Arsenal. </p>
 
<p>CSPP Supports Strong Antidumping Laws that are Effective Remedies for Injuriously Unfair Pricing, No More and No Less. </p>
 
<p>To be Effective, the Laws Must Reflect the Commercial Realities Facing America's High-Technology Industries. </p>
 
<p>In Particular, CSPP Proposes Four Antidumping Law Reforms to Recognize Four Commercial Realities:</p>

<p>1. Proposal for Realistic Cost Calculations:</p>
<ul><li>High-Technology Industries are Characterized by High Capital investment, Rapid Product Introduction, and Short Product Life-Cycles.

	<li>Antidumping Cost Calculations Should Take Account of the Forward Pricing that Results from These Characteristics.
</ul>
<p>2. Proposal for Enhanced Deterrence:</p>
<ul><li>Dumping, Properly Defined, is Becoming a More Common Practice in Certain Foreign High-Technology Sectors.

<li>Multiple Offenders, Carefully Defined, Should Face More Stringent Remedies.
</ul>
<p>3. Proposal to Combat Circumvention:</p>
<ul><li>As More Countries Gain the Capability to Assemble High-Technology Components, More Companies Can Circumvent Application of Antidumping Relief by Relocating Assembly Operations.
<li>Provisions to Combat Circumvention Should be Strengthened.
</ul>
<p>4. Proposal to Recognize Marketplace Realities:</p>
	<ul><li>Decisiomnakers in Antidumping Cases Need Better Information and Standards in Applying the Antidumping Laws to High-Technology Industries.

<li>Revised Definitions of like Product, Suspension of Duties in Cases of Shortage, and Participation of Industrial Users in Antidumping Cases Would Better Reflect Marketplace Realities.
</ul>

<a name="anti2"><p align=center>CSPP Policy Proposal<br>
ANTIDUMPING LAW REFORM</p></a>

<p><i>Reform of the antidumping laws is a major trade policy issue</i>.  As the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations enters the home stretch, the debate over reform of the GATT Antidumping Code and of the corresponding national antidumping laws has become intense.  Proposals have been made by the EC, the Nordic countries, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Canada, and the United States.  Within the United States, several major business groups, including AEA, SIA, and ECAT, have taken positions on the reform of the antidumping laws.  Furthermore, the implementation of the antidumping provisions of the Semiconductor Trade Arrangement has focused attention on the effect of the antidumping laws on high-technology companies. </p>
 
<p>For CSPP, reform of the antidumping laws is a high priority for two reasons.  First, CSPP members are highly integrated into the global trading system, sourcing from and selling into every major market in the world.  Our businesses may be significantly affected by changes in the antidumping laws of the United States and of foreign countries.  Second, effective antidumping laws are one element of the business environment necessary to nurture a healthy U.S. high-technology sector.  CSPP therefore has a substantial stake in the current debate over the antidumping laws. </p>
 
<p><i>The CSPP position on antidumping law reform is rooted in the principle that the antidumping laws should be effective remedies for injuriously unfair pricing, no more and no less</i>.  Therefore, antidumping law reform should above all be balanced.  It should enhance the deterrent capability of the laws and prevent circumvention of antidumping relief. But reform should also sharpen the focus of the antidumping laws, so that they do not impair ordinary business practices, particularly practices common to the high-technology sector.  The antidumping laws should encourage fair competition, not stifle it. </p>
 
<p><i>CSPP's recommendations for antidumping law reform include four elements </i>that together constitute a balanced approach.  The four elements are: (1) realistic cost calculations to determine whether there is unfair pricing; (2) deterrence of injuriously unfair pricing; (3) measures to combat circumvention of antidumping orders, and (4) recognition of marketplace realities.  These four elements are interrelated and together constitute an integrated approach.  CSPP does not support any one of these elements without the others.  The four elements are:</p>
<ul>
1. Realistic Cost Calculations to Determine Whether There is Unfair Pricing:<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Revise GATT Antidumping Code and U.S. Laws;

<li>Expressly Permit Pricing Below Average Unit Costs during Introductory Period;

<li>Expressly Permit Allocation of Capital and R&D Costs over Product Life Cycle; and

<li>Require Product-Specific Determination of Introductory Period and Life Cycle.
</ul></ul>
<p>An essential element of every U.S. antidumping case is the Commerce Department's determination whether a product is being priced below "fair value" -whether, in short, it is being dumped.  In some cases, "fair value" is calculated according to the prices at which the product is sold in its home market.  But when the Commerce Department finds that the product in question is being sold "below cost" in the home market, it constructs a value for the product based on certain required minimum levels of costs and profit and deems that value to be the "fair value" for the product.  If a product is priced at less than this "fair value" in the United States, the Commerce Department concludes that dumping is occurring. </p>
 
<p>This procedure for constructing value can pose problems for high-technology companies.  Among the defining characteristics of a high-technology product are the high level of capital investment and research and development that the product embodies and the necessity to bring the product to market at the earliest possible moment, even if in some cases full-scale commercial production and yield cannot immediately be achieved.  The burden of high initial costs. and the pace of technological competition combine to create a distinctive pricing pattern for high-technology products, including semiconductors. </p>
 
<p>It is commonplace in a competitive market for the manufacturers of such products to offer a new product, for an introductory but not a sustained period, at a price below average unit costs.  As commercial levels of production and yield are attained, both costs and prices fall rapidly, with prices finding a market acceptance at a level above average unit costs.  Then the margin of price above cost enables the producer to recover not only manufacturing costs but also research and development costs and capital costs.  This pricing practice, which anticipates higher volume and lower unit costs over a product's life cycle, is known as "forward pricing." </p>
 
 
<p><i>The ability to engage in forward pricing is crucial if high-technology companies are to take advantage of product innovation</i>.  If introductory prices had to cover all costs - especially those initial unit costs associated with product introduction -- then new products would often be too expensive to gain the market acceptance that, successively builds demand, drives production, lowers unit costs, and thereby makes possible the recovery of costs and the generation of funds for further innovation.  Much of the competitive advantage of "being there first" would be lost because of inflated introductory prices.  Particularly handicapped would be those very U.S. firms - in such high-technology fields as logic chips and computers -- that currently have technological advantages over foreign competitors.  Therefore, it is crucial that the treatment of costs for purposes of determining whether dumping is occurring be such as to permit forward pricing, where that is the relevant industry's normal business practice. </p>
 
 
<p><i>Currently, realistic cost calculations are not assured</i>.  Although U.S. antidumping regulations permit recovery of costs over "a reasonable period of time," the Commerce Department exercises considerable discretion in defining that period.  The Commerce Department also exercises discretion in determining which costs are allocable over an entire product life cycle and which are allocated to a shorter period, and in determining how to allocate non-product-specific R&D.  Furthermore, the Commerce Department often ignores the reality that the full cost of bringing a new product to market cannot be done during initial production periods, when low production levels and product yields are common.  The GATT Antidumping Code does not specifically address the forward pricing and cost allocation issues. </p>
 
<p><i>To make cost calculations realistic, revision of the U.S. antidumping laws and of the GATT Antidumping Code is necessary</i>. </p>
 
<ul><li>The laws and Code provisions on cost calculation should expressly permit pricing below average unit costs during an introductory period of low yield and production. 
 
<li>Furthermore, they should expressly permit allocation of capital and R&D costs over the life cycle of the product.
 
<li>Whenever a product is subject to an antidumping investigation, the investigating agency should make a product-specific determination of the appropriate introductory period and life cycle. </ul>
 </ul>
<p>In this manner, the recognition that forward pricing is an ordinary, and not unfair, business practice can be integrated into the determination whether dumping is occurring.</p>
<ul>
2. Deterrence of Injuriously Unfair Pricing:
<br><br><ul>
	<li>Sharply Define "Multiple Offender."
	<li>Expedite Antidumping Investigations of All Multiple Offenders.
	<li>For Second Offense, Assess Antidumping Duties Back to Date of Initiation of Investigation.
	<li>For Third Offense, Assess Antidumping Duties Back to as Much as Two Years Before Date of Initiation, with Foreign Producers Liable for Pre-Initiation Duties.
	<li>Revise GATT Antidumping Code Accordingly.
</ul></ul>

<p>One of the principal complaints about the existing antidumping laws is that their remedies are too little and too late.  The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act did provide for abbreviated procedures in cases involving short-life-cycle products that have been subject to repeated dumping violations by the same firm -- a so-called "multiple offender." But more can be done to strengthen deterrence, provided there is a realistic cost calculation to determine whether there is dumping. </p>
 
<p>First, the notion of "multiple offender" should be more sharply defined. violations in the same country within an eight-year period involving dumping margins of 50 percent or more with respect to related products by a firm's parent, its subsidiaries, and any affiliates over which the corporate family exercises effective control, should all be criteria to determine whether a firm is a "multiple offenders" Related products would be those produced by similar processes under similar circumstances for similar end-uses; there would be a rebuttable presumption that products within the same four digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule classification are related. </p>
 
<p>Second, antidumping investigations should be expedited when multiple offenders are involved, regardless of the life cycle of the product imported. </p>
 
<p>Third, in the case of certain multiple offenders (two offenses), antidumping duties should be assessed back to the date on which the antidumping investigation was commenced; somewhat more limited retroactivity is currently permitted only upon a showing of "critical circumstances" -- a surge of injurious imports and either a history of dumping of the product in question or knowledge by the importer that dumping was occurring. </p>
 
<p>Fourth, in the case of certain other multiple offenders (three or more offenses), antidumping duties should be assessed retroactively for up to two years prior to the filing of the petition, with foreign exporters rather than U.S. importers being responsible for payment of any duties for the period before the antidumping investigation commenced. </p>
 
<p>It is critical that the concept of "multiple offender" be carefully defined.  Foreign countries often look to U.S. antidumping laws as a model, and an overly expansive or vague U.S. concept of "multiple offender" may be adopted by foreign countries whose antidumping laws do not offer the transparency and due process of U.S. law.  Ideally, the foregoing measures to enhance deterrence should be incorporated in a revised GATT Antidumping Code so that multilateral rules on deterrence are consistent.</p>
<ul>
3. Measures to Combat Circumvention of Antidumping Relief:
<br><br><ul>
	<li>Monitor Effectiveness of Present U.S. Law.

	<li>Add to GATT Antidumping Code Anti-Circumvention Measures on Parts and Components.

	<li>Add to GATT Antidumping Code Measures against Third Country Dumping.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The increasing internationalization of sourcing and production can facilitate circumvention of antidumping relief For example, when a finished product is subject to an antidumping duty, the product's components may be imported instead, with minor assembly operations shifted to the country imposing the antidumping duties.  The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act authorized the Commerce Department to extend an existing antidumping order on a finished product to that product's parts and components assembled in the United States or third countries; it also authorized the International Trade Commission ("ITC") to monitor imports of downstream products.</p>

<p><i>Several additional steps should be taken both in the United States and at the GATT</i>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The effectiveness of the current law on parts and components should be monitored and, if necessary, enhanced to ensure that slight modifications of a product or a shift of minor assembly operations cannot circumvent the law.

	<li>Anti-circumvention measures relating to parts and components should be included in a revised GATT Antidumping Code.

	<li>Third countries should be encouraged, through the GATT Antidumping Code, to enforce their own antidumping laws against firms that use those countries as dumping grounds for components, which are then assembled and exported.
</ul>

<p>The details of all of these anti-circumvention measures must be carefully considered and articulated, lest the cure be worse than the disease.  For example, anti-circumvention efforts should not go so far as to permit countries to impose local content requirements as a condition of settling antidumping cases.</p>
<ul>
4. Recognition of Marketplace Realities:
<br><br><ul>
	<li>Define "Like Product" So That Antidumping Relief Cannot be Imposed on Imported Product for which There is No Competitive Domestic Product.

	<li>Permit Deferral or Prompt Suspension of Antidumping Duties on Products in Short Supply, with Resumption of Duties Once Domestic Supplies Become Adequate.

<li>Accord Industrial Users the Right to Participate in Antidumping Proceedings and Comment on Those Legal and Factual Questions of which They have Particular Knowledge and Interest.
</ul></ul>

<p>Often the realities of the U.S. marketplace that are of particular concern and familiarity to U.S. industrial users are overlooked or misunderstood in antidumping proceedings.  For example, adequate recognition of the availability and quality of supplies should be an integral part of every antidumping investigation but that is not always the case. </p>
 
<p>Recognition of marketplace realities should be enhanced in three ways.  <i>First, the definition of like product" should include consideration of the availability, specifications, performance, and quality of the domestic product </i>that is "like" the imported product: if no domestic product is truly competitive in these respects, then there is no "like product" and no antidumping relief is warranted. </p>
 
<p><i>Second, the antidumping laws should permit the deferral or prompt suspension of antidumping duties in cases of domestic supply shortages</i>, with the duties re-imposed as soon as adequate domestic supplies resume. </p>
 
<p><i>Third, industrial users should have the right to participate </i>in antidumping proceedings and comment on those legal and factual questions on which they have particular knowledge and interest, such as the scope of the investigation, the definition of like product, and the existence of short supplies.</p>


<a name="conc"><p><b>Conclusion</b></p></a>

<p>The use of bilateral market-access initiatives and the reform of the antidumping laws may enhance or undermine the international competitiveness of America's high-technology industries.  CSPP's proposals in these two areas of trade policy would contribute positively to America's ability to compete at home and abroad.  CSPP's market access approach leverages rather than ignores the dynamics of international trade, thereby promising more realistic and effective U.S. efforts to open foreign markets to U.S. high-technology products.  CSPP's proposed antidumping reforms adapt the rules of fair trade to the complex realities of sourcing, manufacturing, and marketing high-technology worldwide today.  Together, these two initial CSPP proposals on trade reflect our conviction that American high-technology industries will compete -- and compete successfully -- in an open and fair global trading system.</p>

<dd>Since assuming overall responsibility in 1991 for directing Compaq's corporate strategies and operations worldwide, Pfeiffer has led the company through a highly successful turnaround and revitalization that Fortune magazine called "a classic case of corporate comeback."  In the space of four years, he has transformed Compaq from the No. 5 to the No. 1 rank in worldwide PC industry marketshare, and from a PC company to a Fortune 100 global computer company focused on the enterprise and the home.  Over the same period, Pfeiffer has led Compaq from annual sales of $3 billion to more than $14 billion, based on Compaq's third quarter 1995 annualized run rate.
<dd>In acknowledgment, Forbes magazine, in its January 1, 1996 issue, named Pfeiffer to its "Short List of 1995's Best Performers," a list of 12 chief executive officers who lead major U.S. companies that have turned in exceptional records over the past five years.  Additionally, CNBC named Pfeiffer "CEO of the Year" for 1994.  Computer Reseller News, which each year ranks the computer industry's top 25 executives, gave him No. 1 billing in 1994.  Pfeiffer also received the InfoWorld 1994 Industry Achievement Award.  Recently, Fortune wrote that "CEO Pfeiffer is now taking on new risks that are bound to shake up the global computer business."
<dd>Before becoming CEO, Pfeiffer served as Compaq's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for all day-to-day operational functions such as worldwide sales, marketing, and manufacturing.  Prior to that, he was President, Compaq Europe and International.  After joining Compaq in 1983 as Vice President, Europe, he established Compaq's presence and wholly-owned subsidiaries throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America.
<dd>Under his leadership, Compaq became the No. 2 PC supplier in Europe, and in 1990, Compaq's international operations accounted for 54 percent of the company's overall revenue.

The Global Information Infrastructure (GII) holds out the promise of a world-wide, interactive communications and information system, through which a Global Digital Common Market may be created.  However, this potential can be achieved only if laws and regulations seek to foster, rather than inhibit, the growth of the GII.  The most significant today are in five key areas:
<P></P>

<OL>
<LI>Trade and Market Entry Restrictions.  National laws that have the effect of preventing the delivery of services via the GII or that restrict local consumers' choice of networks, technologies or products will distort the GII's development.  Commercial practices that differ substantially from international norms also can act as barriers to global business and limit a country's integration into the GII.
<P></P>
<LI>Security.  Users of the GII -- whether engaged in commerce or other personal or professional transactions -- will require mechanisms to validate the source and authenticity of communications, and to prevent unwarranted intrusions into confidential exchanges and to safeguard electronic financial transactions.  Encryption technology offers solutions to many of these concerns, but international use of this technology is limited by national security laws.  Failure to meet consumers' needs for encryption technology will defeat the GII and digital common market.
<P></P>
<LI>Privacy.  Security concerns are particularly acute in the case of confidential data.  There is no common understanding between countries regarding what data may be collected and distributed by third parties, how data should be protected, how it can or should be shared across borders, or how individuals can act to prevent the spread of unauthorized or inaccurate personal information.  These questions are pivotal for global enterprises and for citizens.
<P></P>
<LI>Copyright Protection.  Copyright -- the primary means of defining and protecting original expressions of information -- is critical to the economic use of the GII.  The GII will flourish only if proprietors can use it as a distribution channel without risking loss of their goods.  There is a need for clear legal protections related to copyrighted material transmitted on the GII.  Also, mechanisms, including encryption, which limit the risk of unauthorized reception need to be evaluated.  At the same time, attempts to protect copyright that focus on technologies, rather than on acts of infringement, are inherently risky. The responsibility for implementing and enforcing copyright protections cannot be placed solely on the manufacturers of information technology products.
<P></P>
<LI>Interoperability.  The GII, and the global digital common market, require that the multiple networks within countries, and a myriad of alternative digital appliances are able to  connect and operate seamlessly.  Industry and the open marketplace can accomplish this  but governments must enable industry to do so through pro-competitive public policies.

<p><b>INTEROPERABILITY</b> is the ability of two or more given systems (for the purposes of this paper, "systems" includes devices, databases, networks, or technologies) to interact in concert with one another in accordance with a prescribed method in order to achieve a predictable result. </p>
<p>Interoperability allows diverse systems made by different vendors to communicate with each other so users do not have to make major adjustments to account for differences in products or services. </p>
<p>lnteroperability implies compatibility among systems at specified levels of interaction, including the physical.  This compatibility is achieved through specifications for the interfaces between systems.</p>

<p>KEY TERMS</p>
<hr>
<p>An <b>INTERFACE</b> is a connection between two systems that is specified in physical (electrical or mechanical) and/or logical (message format and exchange procedure) terms.  The interface specification provides the information and technical parameters for how systems communicate with each other, but should be limited to that information necessary to enable communications between the systems, leaving the expression of implementations and the remaining product design to the creative abilities of competitive suppliers. </p>
<p>Some examples of common interfaces include the interfaces between the electric power system in the home and a television power cord; televisions and videocassette recorders (VCRs); standard-size nuts and bolts; telephone jacks and telephones; and computers and modems. </p>
<p>Equipment which meets the interface specifications should be able to interconnect and interoperate across the interface.  For example, a videocassette recorder can interoperate with any U.S. television sold today and the electrical source in the residence, and a fully interoperable remote control will work with both the VCR and the television.</p>

<p>KEY TERMS </p>
 <hr>
<p>Interfaces can be <b>OPEN OR CLOSED</b>.  An interface is physically and logically open if its specifications are readily available to all vendors, service providers and users, and if such specifications are not revised without timely notice or public process.  Interfaces critical to the interoperability of the Nil should allow manufacturers or vendors to provide, in compliance with reasonable licensing terms and conditions, if any, equipment or software to meet the interface specifications. </p>
<p>For instance, if the specification for the interface between a 35mm camera and film is open, manufacturers can build products that are compatible with both sides of the interface.  For example, film manufacturers such as Kodak and Fuji can both produce film that works with any brand of camera, and camera manufacturers can make cameras that can accept any brand of film. </p>
<p>In tne Nil, open multimedia standards, for example, will permit content providers and applications publishers to create programs that work together on one side of lie multimedia standard interfaces, as well as permit hardware manufacturers to produce multimedia engines on the other side of the interface to display that content and work with the applications.  While open interfaces at critical points in the Nil are important for enabling interoperability, it is also important to maintain the intellectual property rights of expressions of implementations as a key incentive for industry to develop advanced technologies and applications.</p>

<p>KEY TERMS </p>
 <hr>
<p>An open interface may or may not be a STANDARD interface.  Standard interfaces are those which are formally recognized by a national, regional, or international standards body. </p>
<p>Many interfaces, both open and closed, are not formally recognized as standards, but may be widely used and adopted by an industry.  These are known as "de facto" standards.  Thus, open interfaces may involve proprietary or nonproprietary technologies, and may or may not be formally standardized. </p>
<p>When an interface is formally standardized, strong public participation in the evolution of the standard is essential.  The standard specification must be published, controlled, and supported in terms of changes to the relevant documentation by an independent organization. </p>
<p>Other factors that </p>
<p>contribute to the success of standards are that their specifications are well written and multi-vendor, and promote portability, scalability, and interoperability.</p>

<title>Goals and Benefits</title>
<h2>Goals and Benefits</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>GOAL</b>: Open interfaces between information appliances for NII applications and NII local access provider networks to help ensure that users can plug any information appliance of their choice into any local access provider's network. </p>
 
 <p><b>BENEFIT</b>: If these interfaces are open, users and providers of information services will be able to connect the information appliances of their choice to any access network, resulting in greater competition among information appliance vendors, i.e., greater choice in products, more innovation, reduced prices, and an easier to use, more convenient system.  For example, a user will be able to plug any type of information appliance -television, computer, telephone or other appliance that combines the capabilities of all three -- into the outlet provided by the chosen local access provider and use the appliance to access any of the types of services that the provider offers.</p>

<h2>Goals and Benefits</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>GOAL:</b> Open interfaces between different implementations of NII information systems/services/ applications that allow the systems, services, and applications to "communicate" with each other so users can generate and receive information in various formats and media without having to make special adjustments to translate between different implementations. </p>
<p><b>BENEFIT: </b>Open interfaces between NII systems, services, and applications will enable users to take advantage of the NII's resources without having to make major adjustments when communicating with different systems.  Users will be able to send electronic messages in various formats to others, regardless of system and service differences, retrieve and interpret documents that appear exactly as composed by the author, and send queries to a variety of different databases containing information in different formats voice, text, video, multimedia without having to tailor the search request to each database or format.  For example, users on different systems will be able to conduct a multimedia videoconference to jointly revise a draft document.  They could then send the document to a publisher, who would receive it in exactly the same format as it was drafted.</p>

<p><b>BENEFIT:</b> Open interfaces at the above points will allow different network service providers to interconnect and interoperate with each other so that users will have the greatest flexibility in choosing and accessing services and applications available through the Nil.  Similarly, information service providers will be able to reach any user, regardless of the local access provider the user or the information provider uses.  For example, a user who chooses a telephone company to provide local access service will be able to communicate -- in a variety of formats -- with a friend who obtains local service from a cable company.  They in turn will be able to communicate just as easily with friends who use competitive access providers or wireless systems.</p>

<h2>Total R&D Spending - United States</h2>
<hr>
<p>The overall level of R&D spending in the United States is substantial -- about $135 billion (1989) a year, split almost evenly between industry and government.  In 199, the U.S. private sector spent $70 billion on R&D, while the federal government's investment was $65.8 billion.</p>

<h2>U.S. Federal Government R&D Funding Trend (Defense Versus Non-Defense)</h2>
<hr>
<p>While U.S. government spending on R&D has increased significantly in absolute levels over the last 25 years, defense R&D (largely development) has shifted from a historical share of 50% of total R&D spending to a high of about 70% in 1987.  It has remained at about two-thirds of federal R&D spending since then.</p>

<h3><font color="#FFFF00"><em>Strathcona recognises and encourages the qualities required of tomorrow's leaders - 
competence, confidence and compassion.</em></font></h3>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Welcome to Strathcona - A Complete Education</font></h3></center>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona is dedicated to education for girls. We view education not as a narrow, exclusively intellectual experience but as a 
continual seeking of wisdom. Cultivation of the mind is crucial to this process but is incomplete without a simultaneous 
cultivation of spirit, expressed in qualities of compassion, co-operation, generosity and service.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We aim to enable each student to discover her abilities, to develop them and to use them creatively for others. Students know 
themselves to be highly valued and learn to appreciate others through the close, personal interaction between staff members 
and girls. Our highly qualified and dedicated staff are committed to ensuring that each girl reaches her potential, both academic 
and personal. It is the spiritual dimension, with emphasis on the value of the person and the joy of learning, that gives 
Strathcona its special and important character.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Participation is a feature of the school. From the earliest years to VCE, students are encouraged to work and play together, 
make responsible choices and reflect on their actions. An environment of trust develops understanding, enthusiasm, tolerance 
and respect for one another.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Since its establishment in 1924, Strathcona's sense of community and quality of care have been constantly demonstrated 
through an outstanding pastoral care program. The school's size and diverse range of activities present opportunities for 
leadership not available in large schools. To this end every student receives leadership training and intellectual curiosity is 
nourished through innovative learning experiences.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We want our girls to develop a passion for learning and acquire its disciplines, too. Our broad curriculum challenges students 
to think critically and creatively, identify and solve problems and communicate effectively. Scholarship in academic work is 
prized from the earliest years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Our young women are tomorrow's leaders. They are articulate and poised, with an extraordinary positive self-image which 
derives from the knowledge that they are equipped to take their place in the rapidly changing world.</font></p><center>

<img src="title.gif">

<img src="tc.gif"><br>
<h2 align=left><font color="#FFFF80">Our School</font></h2>
</center>
<p align=center><font color="#FFFFFF"><em><strong>Seventy years ago, Mrs Livingstone and Miss Hughes established Strathcona -<br>
&quot;a school of the highest quality&quot;. That description remains true today.</strong></em></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The quality of our school can be seen in its students, who are the heart of the school. The school's 
value system recognises the individual worth of each person. It is our belief that we can most 
effectively affirm this in a school of the present size.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Education is a life-long process involving meaningful and caring relationships, scholarship, career 
and personal fulfilment. In that process, physical amenities, curricula and programmes are 
important, but their real value lies in the capacity to enhance the opportunities and achievements of 
all girls at Strathcona.</font></p>

<h2><font color="#FFFF00">Our Commitment</font></h2> <p><font
color="#FFFF00"></font>&nbsp;</h1> <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><I><B><center>As ongoing
funding from governments is uncertain, financial independence is crucial to
the future of Strathcona. High standards  can be maintained only when we
all commit ourselves to supporting our school.</font></I></B></center></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF">Contributions may be made in the following ways:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">1. <strong>Cash Gifts</strong></font></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF">THE STRATHCONA BUILDING &amp; MAINTENANCE FUND</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This fund provides for the maintenance and
refurbishment of existing buildings and for the construction of new
facilities.  Donations to the Strathcona Building and Maintenance Fund are
<strong>fully tax deductible</strong>.</font></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF">LIBRARY FUND</font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Gifts to
this fund are directed towards the purchase of books, periodicals,
audio-visual and library equipment. Donations to  this fund are also
<strong>fully tax deductible</strong>.</font></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF"><strong><a href="bequests.html">2. Bequests</A></strong></font></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF">Bequests are a most effective way of providing benefits for
future Strathcona students. Assets left by a will may be either a  share of
an estate, an amount of money, items of personal property, real estate or
the residual value of an annuity.</font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">3.
<strong>Deferred Giving</strong></font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">An
insurance policy (on life or on maturity) is an excellent way of making a
<strong>tax deductible gift</strong> to the school.</font></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF">4.<strong>Assignment of Right of Income</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This allows income from either capital, shares or
real estate to be donated for a nominated period while retaining ownership
of  these assets. The capital invested <strong>does not attract
tax</strong> normally associated with income from interest.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">5. <strong>Gifts of Assets or
Property</strong></font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">There are many
practical and worthwhile gifts, e.g. real estate, shares in public
companies, personal effects like jewellery and  works of art, collectables,
furniture, motor cars, etc.</font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">6.
<strong>Annual Giving</strong></font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This
involves a commitment of regular annual donations, perhaps to a specially
designated project, e.g. Music, Sport,  Computers or Languages.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">7. <strong>Friends of Tay
Creggan</strong></font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Donations in support
of Tay Creggan are <strong>tax deductible </strong>when made payable to The
Strathcona Building and Maintenance  Fund.</font></p> <p><font
color="#FFFFFF"></font>&nbsp;</p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">We ask that each
member of the Strathcona family consider the ways in which they can assist
us to realise our vision</font></p> <p><font color="#FFFFFF">For further
details, please contact the Director of Development, Jack Moshakis, on (03)
9836 1611.</font></p>


<h2><font color="#FFFF80">Our Vision</font></h2>
<p align=center><font color="#FFFFFF"><em><strong>Our vision for the 90's and beyond is to pursue a policy of dynamic excellence in the 
education of the whole person within a distinctively Christian framework.</strong></em></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In recent years, advances in educational technology have been unprecedented, sporting and 
co-curricular activities have diversified, and curricular offerings have increased. Whilst being proud 
of our beautiful grounds and fine facilities, we recognise the challenge to provide resources of the 
highest calibre to support all the educational programmes at Strathcona.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Four major areas of development have been identified by the School Council, to take us to the year 
2000.</font></p><P> <B><I> Please select the headings below for additional information.</I></B><P>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="humanit.html">1. Humanities Centre</a></font></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This features an exciting and comprehensive learning centre incorporating a 130 person lecture 
theatre, a chapel, an archive room, administrative facilities, technologically equipped classrooms 
and a rooftop garden. The Humanities Centre was completed in 1994.</font> </blockquote></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="sci.html">2.	Science &amp; Technology Centre</a></font></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Changes in emphasis and in teaching methodology require access to more 
sophisticated equipment. Modern, attractive and functional laboratories are 
essential in retaining and encouraging a love of science and mathematics. In recognition of this, the school is currently constructing a new $2 million facility which will be opened mid 1997. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="boat.html">3.	Boating Facilities</a></font></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona is fortunate in being one of a few schools in Australia with a river 
frontage. A jetty is being built at Tay Creggan so that our girls can participate in a 
broader range of physical and recreational activities, including rowing.</font></blockquote></p>
<p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">4.	Tay Creggan Restoration</font></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This magnificent property requires major plumbing work, extensive work on the garden terraces and renewed furnishings. The aim is to restore the buildings and gardens during this decade.

<h2>Nurturing tall poppies....</h2>
<p>
<i>"Tall poppies need a chance to grow"</i> was a headline in the Brisbane Courier-Mail in January.  The article continued, <i>"Australia has long prided itself on its egalitarianism.  This attitude, while working against the development of an unwelcome class system, has also tended to hold back many with the potential to achieve excellence.  If Australia is allowed to make its mark on the world it needs to promote and create opportunities for its best and brightest.  This is particularly important when those people are young..."</I>
<p>For the overwhelming majority of young people, education is the key to their future.  Two main  ingredients are required - access to the best instruction and motivation to reach their personal best.  I am delighted that our Year 10 students are undertaking one VCE unit this year and over three-quarters of Year 11 are studying a Unit 3/4.  Strathcona girls have  access to the best instruction  and the majority have a determination to succeed.  This is reflected in the 1995 VCE results of which we are very proud.<br>
As has often been the case in the past, our top students proved again that it is possible to complement  outstanding achievement with the fullest participation in school life.  They accepted leadership responsibilities and provided fine role models for younger students.  We congratulate every member of the Class of '95.<br>

<h2>Sowing the seeds.....</h2>

<h3>Career education</h3><P>
<center>
<img src="career.gif><br>
<b><i>Mrs Catherine Symons and Mrs Merrill Buller helping  Georgina Anderson (Yr11) in the careers Room. </b></i>
</center><br>
Given the nature of today's job market, career education is increasingly important.  Students are faced with complex decisions about tertiary courses, career paths and future employment.<br>
Mrs Catherine Symons is Strathcona's VCE Coordinator and Careers Counsellor.  Mrs Symons' dual role allows her to work alongside students as they explore ideas about careers and select VCE courses of study.    She believes that career pathways should be developed alongside academic programs.  She says,"There will be little unskilled work in the twenty-first century.  Today's students will need to be excellent communicators  and great team players.  They will need broadly based  education that enables them to be flexible enough to cope with continuing  workplace change."<br>
While university courses are the destination of most of our students, Mrs Symons believes that  there are many other interesting options.  She says, " There are now vocational links into many degree courses.  There are opportunities for work placements, and TAFE options provide a broad skill base for employment."<br>
Technology is playing a significant  role in career education.  Computer programs such as  Job and Course Explorer (JAC) have been used for some years.  Tertiary institutions  have introduced hot lines to provide information on courses.  The Internet is also becoming a source of career data.  It is being  used by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) to provide information for students.<br>
At Strathcona the careers framework encourages students to focus on their personal interests.  Compiling a resume, undertaking work experience, listening to visiting speakers and attending interview evenings are some of the activities persued by students in years 9 to 12.  A great deal of personal development occurs during these years and students are encouraged to view the future with confidence and optimism.<br>
The VCE Australian Studies Course in year 10 is taken by all students.  All students complete a research project about a career, course or business that interests them.   In addition, each student in year 10 completes a work experience placement.  As part of this task they are required to write letters of application and phone prospective employers, under the guidance of the Careers Secretary, Mrs Merrill Buller.  Mrs Buller says, "The girls are very excited  when they are offered a placement.  It gives them tremendous self confidence."<br>
Mrs Symons notes that in recent years significant  emphasis has been placed on the skills that will be needed beyond school.  She says, "Excellent communication skills, leadership, enthusiastic teamwork and responsibility and part of Strathcona's ethos.  We set out to develop self esteem, a willingness to contribute to the wider world and a love of learning.  We are also working very hard to develop creativity, independence and the belief that every strathcona student can be a tall poppy in Australia's future."<P>

<p>
<h3>Skills for the future</H3><br>
<b>Enterprise and teamwork are skills that are highly valued in the workforce.  There are many ways of developing these skills beyond the careers program.</b><br>
In March, 22  Strathcona students from Years 8-11 were Australian role models for an international project on teenagers organized by the <i>National Council for Education Technology</i> in the UK.<br>
Our students worked from 7.30am to 8.30pm  with 200 students located British Telecom's training headquarters in Stone, Staffordshire.  Their task was to produce a multimedia project on <i>Teenage girls - past, present and future.</i><br>
Stephanie Mills said,"We wanted to emphasise that girls are innovative leaders, creative users of technology and confident about Australia's future.  It was a great opportnity!"<p>

competence, confidence and compassion.</em></font></h3>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Welcome to Strathcona - A Complete Education</font></h3></center>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona is dedicated to education for girls. We view education not as a narrow, exclusively intellectual experience but as a 
continual seeking of wisdom. Cultivation of the mind is crucial to this process but is incomplete without a simultaneous 
cultivation of spirit, expressed in qualities of compassion, co-operation, generosity and service.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We aim to enable each student to discover her abilities, to develop them and to use them creatively for others. Students know 
themselves to be highly valued and learn to appreciate others through the close, personal interaction between staff members 
and girls. Our highly qualified and dedicated staff are committed to ensuring that each girl reaches her potential, both academic 
and personal. It is the spiritual dimension, with emphasis on the value of the person and the joy of learning, that gives 
Strathcona its special and important character.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Participation is a feature of the school. From the earliest years to VCE, students are encouraged to work and play together, 
make responsible choices and reflect on their actions. An environment of trust develops understanding, enthusiasm, tolerance 
and respect for one another.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Since its establishment in 1924, Strathcona's sense of community and quality of care have been constantly demonstrated 
through an outstanding pastoral care program. The school's size and diverse range of activities present opportunities for 
leadership not available in large schools. To this end every student receives leadership training and intellectual curiosity is 
nourished through innovative learning experiences.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We want our girls to develop a passion for learning and acquire its disciplines, too. Our broad curriculum challenges students 
to think critically and creatively, identify and solve problems and communicate effectively. Scholarship in academic work is 
prized from the earliest years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Our young women are tomorrow's leaders. They are articulate and poised, with an extraordinary positive self-image which 
derives from the knowledge that they are equipped to take their place in the rapidly changing world.</font></p><center>

<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Stretching the Limits</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Maximum participation, enjoyment and the realisation of potential are the key aims of sport at Strathcona, and our excellent 
facilities ensure that students are provided with optimum opportunity to achieve them. Participation is encouraged for its 
contribution to self-esteem, confidence, social interaction and the development of a healthy lifestyle.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Sport</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The sporting program at Form, House and Inter-school levels caters for a wide spectrum of talents and interests. Sports 
offered include athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, cross-country, diving, hockey, netball, rhythmic gymnastics, 
lifesaving, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball. Strathcona is also represented in downhill and freestyle skiing and by 
rowing teams.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Outdoor Activities</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Outdoor experiences are introduced in Year 3 and offered subsequently in an exciting and varied program designed to match 
students' increasing abilities. These include camps, which are allied to aspects of the curriculum and complementary to them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Duke of Edinburgh program, bushwalking, canoeing, rafting, cross-country skiing, initiative and navigation activities and 
abseiling encourage girls to gain a greater understanding of themselves and an appreciation of the outdoors.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Clubs, such as the SPAM outdoor adventure club, are popular with students in Years 10 to 12 who thrive on the challenges 
offered during weekends and holidays. Horseriding, ski camps and the Kakadu Safari are always enthusiastically patronised.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FFFF00"><em>Education at Strathcona is centred on, and celebrates, the uniqueness of the individual.</em></font></h3>
<P><img src="icons/music.gif"><P>
</center>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">VCE and Beyond</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona girls have consistently achieved excellent results. Their outstanding performances in the Victorian Certificate of 
Education reflect the commitment, enthusiasm and hard work of both students and their teachers. A 100% pass rate has been 
repeatedly achieved, with more than 99% of students in recent years continuing on to higher study.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Recent graduates have been awarded Premier's Awards, Australian Students Prizes (given by the Prime Minister to students 
with the highest results in Australia) and major engineering prizes. This continues a long tradition of excellence.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Enhancing the Education Experience</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In keeping with Strathcona's philosophy of education being an experience designed to prepare the individual for the future in 
all facets of life, our co-curricular program is rich in its scope.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Debating and Public Speaking</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">From Year 1, speech lessons are available. Participation of students in assemblies, concerts and competitions is encouraged, 
and debating is held at both Inter-House and Inter-School levels.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Drama and Dance</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Drama and Dance is available in many forms in the co-curricular program. Inter-house Drama productions are held twice 
yearly. They are written and produced by senior students and include girls from Year 7 upwards. The annual play and musical 
are highly professional productions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Music</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona has a strong instrumental and choral tradition. From Year 3, when violin is part of the core curriculum, every 
student is offered an opportunity to participate in the broad and varied program. A wide range of groups - from the large 
orchestras, bands, ensembles and choirs to smaller, more intimate quartets, trios, madrigals and instrumental ensembles - 
ensures that girls acquire the skills needed to express their creativity while performing in public with assurance and poise.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Composer Club offers girls in Years 9 to 12 an international forum to compose and communicate world-wide with other 
students using the latest music technology.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Cultural</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Global perspective is increased through student exchange programs with sister schools in New Zealand, Asia and Europe.</font></p>

<center><I><B>
<font color="#FFFF00"><em>Learning takes on many innovative forms at Strathcona, such as the use of interactive 
multimedia.</em></font></center></i></b>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">A Curriculum Focused on Excellence</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We know that students learn best when programs cater for their individual needs and talents. Strathcona's curriculum 
emphasises a rich and diverse range of learning strategies so that our students become adaptable, multi-skilled and 
independent. It encourages students to think critically and creatively, to develop global awareness and to work co-operatively 
to establish the skills needed for life-long learning. From the earliest years through to graduation, girls are encouraged to strive 
for excellence and to plan for the future.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In Mellor House, the core curriculum is extensive with major emphasis on literacy and numeracy. &quot;Hands on&quot; science activities 
foster a lasting enthusiasm for science, and our LOTE program, which begins at Prep, encourages awareness of other cultures 
including French, Italian and Korean.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Middle School curriculum is designed so that subject specialisation is deferred as long as possible. All girls study Art, 
Christian Education, Drama, English, French, History, Geography, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Science, 
Technology and Life Skills. Students may also select Italian or Korean in Year 8. There are extension and special assistance 
programs and a unique FOCUS program. These challenge and support students at either end of the learning scale.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In Year 9, students need to develop independence and explore ideas, and new subjects such as Design using computers, 
Music Technology and Horticulture are introduced. General studies, which is held on one day each week, has an international 
reputation for its innovative learning strategies, including the development of multimedia authoring. The skills acquired during 
this unique experience provide a stimulating basis for senior years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In Years 10 to 12, girls begin their preparation for VCE and life beyond school. Over 10 VCE units are offered: all Year 10 
girls take at least one, many Year 11 girls take units 3 and 4 and there are opportunities to study first year university 
enhancement subjects in Year 12.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The academic program is supported by careers counselling, visiting speakers and seminars and an excellent career 
planning/work experience program.</font></p>

<B><I><font color="#FFFF00"><em>Proud of its past, and active in embracing the future, Strathcona offers students the best of both 
worlds.</em></font></i></b></center>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There are modern classrooms, fully equipped science, technology and language laboratories, a light-filled creative arts centre 
with specialist studios which have computers and an excellent gallery for display of student work. State-of-the-art computer 
technology has helped to establish the school's reputation for innovation in the areas of multimedia and communications, and 
three information centres combine library, computer and audio visual facilities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">An indoor physical education centre incorporating a gymnasium with full-size basketball court and a heated swimming pool is 
used throughout the year. Sports facilities on each campus include an oval and netball, tennis and basketball courts. An 
adventure playground in the Junior School, together with specialist outdoor areas for preparatory children, caters for those 
beginning school.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The situation of the Junior School within the main campus allows even our youngest the opportunity to make extensive use of 
all these outstanding facilities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In recognition of the importance of Year 9 as a time of growth, exploration and developing autonomy, Strathcona's Year 9 
students attend a separate campus, Tay Creggan in Hawthorn.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tay Creggan, on the banks of the Yarra River, is a marvellous blend of tradition and change. It features beautiful historic 
buildings set in extensive grounds which are classified by the Australian Heritage Commission. Its elegant hall has an open 
fireplace, which provides a welcoming place for girls to gather.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The grounds at the main school and the magnificent Tay Creggan campus both feature tranquil gardens.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mellor House, Strathcona's Junior School, offers a warm, friendly and purposeful environment for students from 
Pre-Preparatory to Year 6. Small class sizes, individual attention and opportunities for each person to participate in all aspects 
of the program are distinctive features of our school. After school care is provided until 6 p.m. on weekdays, and there are 
holiday programs.</font></p>

<B><I><center><font color="#FFFF00"><em>Strathcona develops girls and gives them the motivation to achieve their goals with courage 
and commitment.</em></font></B></i></center><body>

<h3><font color="#FFFF00">The Foundations of our Success</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">At Strathcona, we place absolute importance on the uniqueness and worth of each person. It is this focus which many believe 
to be the single most important characteristic of a Strathcona education. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Pastoral Care is integral to creating a learning environment in which individuals feel happiest and most comfortable. Our 
program, both innovative and comprehensive, builds self-esteem and assurance, develops leadership skills and encourages 
commitment to service in the wider community.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona challenges young people to develop strong personal values. Girls are encouraged to develop responsibility and to 
explore individual conscience through an understanding of the Christian faith, together with the promotion of respect for one 
another and for different cultures and beliefs.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Open communication and understanding between students and teachers are vital to the establishment and maintenance of a 
successful learning environment. Regular contact between the chaplain, counsellors and pastoral teachers fosters 
understanding and concern for each individual. This ensures that support is given whenever there is a need, and strengthens the 
culture that sets Strathcona apart.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Visitors to the School frequently comment on the happy atmosphere. Interaction between students is promoted through 
programs such as &quot;Big Sister Little Sister&quot; which matches girls from the Junior School with older girls. Such programs assist 
further in building rapport between students of different levels and cultivating a sense of care and concern for others.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Strathcona's close-knit community and caring, supportive staff help girls to become assured, thoughtful young women, with an 
intelligent awareness of the world and an appreciation of their part in it.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">An Educational Environment in which to Thrive</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Extensive facilities, covering more than 5 hectares over two campuses, offer girls a superb opportunity for personal growth 
and development. They allow us to provide a diverse range of cultural, sporting, vocational and outdoor activities.</font></p>

<h1><font color="#FFFF00">THE STRATHCONA BEQUEST 
PROGRAMME</font></h1>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00"><em>Benefiting the School by your Will</em></font></h3>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">What is a Bequest?</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">A Bequest is a gift in a Will in which the person making the Will leaves an asset to a charity, an 
individual or an organisation like the Strathcona Foundation.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Why Bequests?</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">All independent schools are seeking ways of raising money to maintain and improve their financial 
independence in the face of declining and uncertain Government support. In Australia, the United 
States of America and the United Kingdom, some 80% of private funding to independent schools 
comes from Bequests. Bequests also provide a very effective way for people to support Strathcona 
in a way in which they cannot do so from their present income.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Bequests to the Strathcona Foundation</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">By making a Bequest to the Foundation, rather than the School, the money is managed so that 
there will be little or no effect on government funding. In addition, Bequests to the Foundation are 
currently free from Federal and State probate and gift duty.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Bequest Advisory Service</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">It is important that professional and legal advice is taken regarding the establishment of any benefit 
for Strathcona, particularly where a Will maker would prefer to leave real estate or other assets to 
the School. Strathcona is pleased to offer a free, confidential, no obligation advisory service. In 
addition, our Bequest Service can make or amend Wills without charge where Strathcona is to be 
made a beneficiary.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Strathcona's Legacy and the Future</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The memories that former students have of Strathcona are inevitably linked with an era of the 
School's history, fellow students, a Principal or staff.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">It is the role of the Foundation to ensure that the School continues to thrive as a vibrant educational 
institution. It is committed to providing opportunities to girls through a reasonable fee structure 
which keeps the school as accessible as possible. To maintain our fine traditions and to ensure the 
future financial independence of our School, the Foundation is seeking the support of the 
Strathcona Community.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">While many people are able to support Strathcona during their lifetime, others may find it easier to 
support the School through their Will.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Should you wish to remember Strathcona in your Will, we suggest you consider the many ways in 
which a Bequest can be made:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">1. A gift of a specific sum of money.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">2. A gift of real estate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">3. A percentage of your estate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">4. A gift of assets including shares, life insurance policy, jewellery, works of art, antiques and other 
collectables.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">5. Establishment of a scholarship, bursary or prize.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">6. Gifts for the School can be either for the general purposes of the School or for specifically 
nominated projects, e.g. buildings, music, science, the arts, information technology or professional 
development for staff.</font></p>

<title>History of Susanville</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1 align=center>History<em> </em>of Susanville</h1>
<h1 align=center><em>&quot;Honey Lake&quot;</em></h1>
<h2 align=center><tt>Geological</tt></h2>
<p>Honey Lake lies in the southeastern corner of Lassen County about ten miles west of the present 
California-Nevada line at an elevation of 3,950 feet. It occupies an elevated basin formed by a 
great uplifted fault block adjacent to the Sierra. The entire basin was once submerged beneath a 
northwestern arm of the ancient post glacial Lake Lahontan, a great in land sea formed more than 
two thousand years ago. At its height, about 100 A. D. Lahonton covered an area of 8,000 
square miles in the Great Basin. With its final subsidence it left seven vestigial pools along its 
western extremity -- Honey Lake, Pyramid and its neighbor Winnemucca, Humbolt Sink, North 
and South Carson sinks, and Walker Lake. All of these lakes, or playas, are fed by mountain 
streams; they have no outlets; their waters are alkaline; and they show either a steady shrinkage in 
area or extreme fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its alkalinity, its landlocked waters, and its environment bare hillocks and broken, sage-covered 
plains in the east and wooded mountains in the west -- make Honey Lake a typical Basin playa. 
So do its startling fluctuations. It is fed chiefly by the Susan River, but it changes in level have 
often seemed to be independent of any visible intake. At present it is little more than a mudhole; 
when full as it was when Lassen and Bruff first saw it and when Roop and Lassen settled in its 
valley, it was all of fifteen miles in length and nine in width. In 1859 and in 1863 it was completely 
dry; in 1867 it covered an area of 90 square miles; and in the following year a sudden and record 
rise of waters threatened to inundate bordering farm lands. Its maximum depth in 1877 was 
eighteen inches; in 1882, four feet. Despite its generally shallow waters, however, it has been a 
hazard on windy days, and people have managed to drawn in it from time to time.</p>
<h2 align=center><tt>The California Gold Rush</tt></h2>
<p>During the Gold Rush, emigrants in wagon trains began toiling past Honey Lake along the &quot;Horn 
Route,&quot; a more direct drive toward Sacramento. The trail went through bad Indian country, and 
the emigrants stopped only briefly, to feed and water stock. Settlers, seasoned Californians, 
arrived in1854. The first to arrive was Isaac N. Roop, a widower of thirty-two, who had 
migrated to California from Ohio in 1850. His prosperous mercantile establishment in Shasta City 
had recently burned, and with it most of his capital stock. A more practical man might have tried 
to re-establish himself in the settlements. Roop, however, was impulsive and imaginative by 
nature, and trade seems to have been a secondary motive with him. At any rate, when he moved 
in, in May 1854, with his brother Emphraim and a small party from Shasta, Roop's first act was 
to record to himself a lush land claim along the Susan river (a stream which he named after his 
daughter, then in the East).</p>
<p>In the following year Peter Lassen himself returned to the valley which he had first seen in 1850. 
Old Pete had sold his Deer Creek holdings at a loss and was already searching for another 
Promised Land. He brought five or six men with him, including Isadore Meyerowitz, a former 
member of the Lassen-Bruff Gold Lake expedition.</p>
<p>For a decade the curious history of Honey Lake was largely the history of the two first settlers, 
Roop and Lassen. Neither they nor the followers knew exactly which they were when they 
settled in the valley, and their uncertainty accounted for much of the long seriocomic drama which 
followed their arrival. It was hard to tell whether this strange country belonged to California or to 
Utah Territory. But the anomalies of the place did not lessen its attractions. For Roop, with his 
recent crushing misfortune, and for Old Pete, with his simple Utopian dreams, the spacious lake 
plain was the Happy Valley, the end of the long trail.</p>
<p>Roop and Lassen found the valley and the fickle lake much as they were in 1850. the mountains 
on the western side were heavily timbered, and the low northern and southern hills were dotted 
with occasional clumps of scrub juniper. Game abounded in the hills -- deer, antelope, bear, 
puma, and mountain sheep. In the brush thousands of rabbits mingled with flocks of sage hen, 
and great flights of water fowl wheeled over the lake or settled, screaming, on the water. Apart 
from its ever-present Indian signs, this was a hospitable and burgeon-deposit brought down upon 
the plain from the mountain gorges. Wherever water reached it, it was covered with rich bunch 
grass, or with acres of waving rye, sometimes taller than a horse. Before the delicate balance of 
Nature was disturbed by prodigal lumbering and careless diversions of water, the porous alluvial 
earth produced without cultivation and apparently without limit. Men simply turned their animals 
out in the tall rye and let them fend for themselves; and even in winter the thick clumps of dried 
fodder showed everywhere above the snow.</p>
<p>Getting a living from the soil was so easy here that the settlers who followed Roop and Lassen 
soon acquired an undeserved reputation for indolence. In northern California and in western Utah 
Territory they were known as the &quot;Never-Sweats,&quot; a term that persisted until well into the sixties. 
The Humbolt Register for April 30, 1864, published a sneering anecdote to justify this sobriquet. 
A &quot;help-wanted&quot; advertiser, said the Register, once interviewed three applicants for a job. When 
he discovered that the men where Honey Lakers, he stalked off in a rage, muttering darkly, 
&quot;Honey Lake be damned! I want men to work! Honey Lake!&quot;</p>
<p>But the Never-Sweats of the fifties had earned their ease, if they ever really had any. Many of 
them had drifted into the valley in the wake of the Gold Lake excitement and had seen much of 
the hard and dangerous life along the Yuba and Feather. Men like Pelio Trutters, Comanche 
George Lawrence, Sylvenus Conkey, Dolphin Inman, and Ireton Warp had &quot;seen the elephant&quot; 
long before. Weather-beaten and sinewy, they had survived the perilous illusions of the gold rush, 
and they yearned to put down stakes. If the rich hay grew wild and the deer waxed fat, they 
deserved the fruits. After all, unlike the fledgling and the impressionable gold seekers, they had 
the fortitude it takes to settle down.</p>
<p>By 1856 scores had settled in the valley, and 36,000 acres in land claims had been recorded by 
OOP. Honey Lake had become one of the main gateways to the Sacramento Valley, and the 
daily emigrant trains with their great herds of stock brought a pleasant surface excitement to the 
place and at the same time emphasized the satisfying stability of the homesteaders' lives. Between 
August and December, 278 men, 69 women and 89 children came over the Noble road in 88 
wagons, with 323 horses, 22 mules, 4,515 head of cattle, and 3,700 sheep. Roop's house, the 
first one built in the valley and the nucleus of present Susanville, was the only emigrant station and 
the nerve center of all activities in the valley.</p>
<p>Roop himself was a busy man. He kept the register, lent money to the down and out, acted as 
land recorder, gave advice, greeted newcomers in the name of the valley and functioned as an 
all-around arbiter, indispensable to settlers and emigrants alike. he seemed to have a kindly hand 
in everything, and with his eager and sanguine nature he made little money out of anything. Old 
Pete Lassen stood solidly in the background, a sort of elder statesman. Like Roop, he had 
immense prestige among the settlers, and, like Roop, he had little material gain to show for it. 
Lassen had discovered gold at last, along and above the little creek where he had settled, but 
others were doing the actual mining and reaping the rewards.</p>
<p>With all its seasonal emigrant traffic the valley seemed completely detached from the rest of the 
world. As a direct result of the Gold Lake excitement two counties had been formally established 
south of Honey Lake -- Sierra in 1852 and Plumas in 1854. But Quincy, the county seat of 
Plumas and the settlement nearest the valley, lay beyond a spur of the mountain range and was 
cut off from al communication for at least four months of the year. Genoa, the chief settlement of 
Carson Valley lay sixty air-line miles away in a southerly direction and could be reached only by 
two days' travel over rugged and dangerous country. Directly east lay the Bad Lands above 
Pyramid Lake, unsettled by whites; no man who entered them alone lived long. </p>
<p>The valley was hemmed in on three sides by Indian country. The thieving and treacherous 
Washoe ranged south of the lake north of it the extremely hostile Pit River and Modoc tribes, and 
east of it the large and loose federation of the Paiute. There were also internal dangers. By 1856 
the influx of settlers had brought with it a certain number of dubious frontier characters who 
wanted a hide-out--gamblers, road agents, professional gunmen, and rustlers.</p>
<p>It took an unusual amount of personal stamina and social solidarity to cope with these hazards. 
No other community of early California or Nevada more closely resembled, on the surface, the 
motion-picture conception of the Wild West; on the other hand, no early community showed less 
of the picturesque shiftlessness and moronic rusticity which the world has come to accept as the 
chief ingredient on the American frontier. The Honey Lakers wore six guns and bowie knives as 
necessary daily accouterments, just as they wore boots and shirts; and no man rode out of the 
valley, or even far into his own fields, without toting a rifle. But this self reliance merely reinforced 
a desire for stability and order. In the daily presence of danger it put the well-educated and 
shrewd, slow-moving illiterate upon an equal footing, and in the tight little valley community a man 
could put his trust in his neighbor without fear of losing his life, his purse, or his self-respect.</p>

<h1 align=center>The Journey of Hope</h1>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><i>There is a place for the families and loved ones of those suffering from severe 
mental illnesses.&#160; A place to share and grow.&#160; A place to learn. </i></font></p>
<p><font size=4><i>We offer answers to individuals and family members asking for understanding, 
information or just sincere support.&#160; These answers come from others who have 
walked the same path before us.</i> </font></p>
<h1 align=center><font size=4>Ten Principles of Support</font></h1>
<ol>
<li><font size=4>We acknowledge and accept the fact that someone we love has a mental 
illness. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We accept that we have no control over this illness or the individual with 
the illness.&#160; We have control only over our own actions and thoughts. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We release all feeling of guilt concerning this mental illness for we are not to 
blame for the illness or its effects. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We understand and acknowledge that the mental illness has had an impact 
on all of our relationships. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We forgive ourselves for the mistakes we have made and we forgive others 
for wrongs we feel have been committed against us. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We choose to be happy and healthy.&#160; We choose to return to a healthy focus 
on ourselves. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We keep our expectations for ourselves and for our mentally ill loved one at 
realistic levels. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We believe that we have inner resources which will help us with our own 
growth and will sustain us through crisis. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We acknowledge the strength and value of this support system and we 
commit ourselves to sustaining it for our benefit and the benefit of other 
families. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>We acknowledge that there is a higher power to whom we will turn to 
nurture and strengthen our ability to release those things we cannot control. </font></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><font size=4>The Journey of Hope...</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4>Research studies indicate that 40-65% of adults with severe and persistent mental 
illness either reside with their families or receive primary care-management from 
their families.&#160; The ability of family members to provide a benign, 
understanding, and predictable environment for their ill relative is a key factor in 
the capacity of the ill family member to stabilize and remain in the community.&#160; 
The <i>Journey of Hope</i> not only provides education and skill training for families 
who must cope with the difficulties of their ill relatives, it also gives them the 
practical and emotional support to sustain themselves in the role as primary 
caretakers in the community mental health system. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>There are two components to the <i>Journey of Hope</i> - an education element and a 
support group element.&#160; Together they provide maximum benefit to the family 
member.&#160; Families are strongly encouraged to take advantage of both. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The <i>Journey of Hope</i> family education program is a 12-week course for relatives 
and friends of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.&#160; Those 
attending need not be AMI members, but are encouraged to join a local affiliate.&#160; 
The curriculum focuses on three major psychiatric illnesses: schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, and major depression.&#160; It emphasizes the clinical treatment of 
these illnesses and teaches the knowledge and skills family members need to 
cope more effectively with the ill relative.&#160; The courses are taught by trained 
AMI family member volunteers in a team teaching approach. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The <i>Journey of Hope</i> support group program is an on-going support structure 
for families and friends.&#160; Again, family members are trained to facilitate these 
groups.&#160; They provide family members with an opportunity to reinforce coping 
skills and to seek emotional support and practical help from other family 
members.&#160; Based on Ten Principles of Support, the groups guide efforts of 
individuals to help themselves and each other.&#160; In this family-to-family support 
group, families learn they are not alone; that there is hope; that there is 
information; and that individual family member experience is a powerful tool for 
help when shared with others. </font></p>

<hr>
<p><font size=4>Class and Support Group Information</font></p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><font size=4>The <i>Journey of Hope</i> programs are currently offered throughout California. 
Training sessions are conducted yearly for volunteers who are willing to 
teach the 12-week education classes or facilitate a support group for two 
years.&#160; Affiliates or communities who want to offer the <i>Journey of Hope</i> in 
Oregon can send trainees free of charge. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>The implementation of the <i>Journey of Hope</i> education classes in a local 
affiliate involves an intensive 22 hour weekend training of two-person 
teams from at least four affiliates.&#160; These family teams are then prepared to 
offer the program in their own community.&#160; The course can be offered to a 
group of 15 to 20 family members. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>Training is also provided for support group facilitators.&#160; The education 
classes can self-select facilitators, or volunteers can be recruited from other 
members of the local affiliate.&#160; The intensive training for the facilitators is 17 
hours. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>Communities now offering support groups are invited to send volunteers to 
the <i>Journey of Hope</i> facilitator training.&#160; The training includes the skills and 
principles that help family members and friends cope with the mental illness 
of a loved one. </font></li>
<li><font size=4>The nationwide <i>Journey of Hope</i> began as a joint effort between the 
Alliance for the Mentally Ill organizations in Louisianna and Vermont.&#160; 
Donna Mayeaux and Behavioral Health, Inc.&#160; from Baton Rouge, Louisiana 
provided the support group model.&#160; Joyce Burland, Ph.D., a clinical 
psychologist and family member from Vermont, compiled and wrote the 
material for the 12-week education classes.&#160; Donna and Joyce also conduct 
training sessions for state-wide trainers of facilitators and family educators 
on a yearly basis. </font></li>

<h2><tt>October Mental Illness Awareness Week Theme is <i>is "Open your Mind, Mental Illnesses are Brain Disorders"</i>
</tt></h2>

<tt>
<p>Planning is currently underway for AMI-SCCs participation in Mental Illness Awareness Week 1996 (MIAW) which will be observed nationally, starting Sunday October 6, 1996. We want to increase awareness that mental illnesses are physical illnesses and (with access to treatment and adequate in-community support) that people with brain disorders can live productive lives, at much lower total cost to families and the community. We have a packages of NAMIs MIAW how to information, artwork, and handout materials, with suggested themes for each day. AMI-SCC also has much free material giving the facts of mental illness care and offering direct practical help for families and clients.</p>

<p>To get public attention on MIAW in the first full week in October, AMI-SCC needs many more volunteers, starting now to: 1) Prepare and send out news releases to Newspapers and letters to local organizations, 2) Distribute AMI material to libraries, schools, health centers and other local public places, 3) Contact radio and television stations, offering 30 second announcements, personal interviews, etc. and 4) make follow up phone calls  and presentations to receptive organizations.</p>

<p>If you can help, please call the AMI-SCC Office, 408-280-7264, or in North Santa Clara County, call Ann Sloan, 415-85 </p>

<h3><tt>COUNSELORS AND CONSUMERS DESCRIBE PEER COUNSELING AND SUPPORT GROUPS EXPERIENCES
 AT AMI GENERAL MEETING HELD JUNE ll, l996 <i> By Cole Buxbaum </i></tt></h3>
<tt>
<p>The main message from all presenters was that consumers can play a significant role in helping themselves and each other to cope with their problems, to acquire skills and to get into work or other meaningful activities, through peer counseling and self help support groups.</p>
<p>Fred Vater, a volunteer counselor with the County ACCESS program described his support group. Vater started the group this year with the mission of getting clients together to interchange information dealing with the job market and related problems.  To be in his group people must be working, going to school, or actively seeking work. They cannot have a substance abuse problem, and must be identified as a client of the county or of a contract team.</p>

<p>Subjects such as interviewing techniques, working hours, bureaucratic impediments to be conquered, and issues of confidentiality between co-workers, including medication, are all addressed in weekly meetings, with the group setting its own agenda.  At present, there are seven members who meet at the County Central Mental Health Center near Valley Medical Center at 6:30-8:00 P.M. on Mondays, and they are seeking additional people.  "Looking for work is tough", explained Vater and our people can use as much help as they can get in getting job opportunities and work related coping skills. For more information, call Mr. Fred Vater at 408-885-6229.</p>
<p>Alice Washington, Peer Counselor, and Paul Ernst, Coordinator of Volunteers at Miramonte Mental Health Services, discussed their program and its accomplishments. Paul Ernst, explained that Miramonte is a private non-profit mental health agency in Palo Alto helping mentally ill clients in North Santa Clara County, including parts of San Jose. He has been with Miramonte for seven years, working with volunteers for five years, starting with volunteer peer counselors, fifty-five years or older, who are trained to work with clients sixty or older. To date, he has trained over l00 peer counselors who can go into a clients home for weekly one hour visits.  Forty are still active.</p>
<p>In addition to the above Senior Peer Counselors, there are Adult Peer Counselors, who are younger people like Alice Washington, who have experienced emotional difficulties and are interested in helping others with similar concerns.  Washington began by saying that initially she didnt think she would be able to perform the task, but after one year she was doing it and training others with great satisfaction. She learned the skills of active listening. Her self esteem and knowledge of  the therapeutic relationship has increased.</p>
<p>She now teaches a class to other clients seeking the same rewards in helping others.  To date she has taught eight trainees and looks forward to more.  To get this peer counseling training, one must be a client of Miramonte.  In answer to a question, Washington explained that she interacts with the vocational program at Miramonte that helps clients find and keep jobs.  She is also the co-editor  of the "Community Alliance Times" published bi-monthly at Miramonte, discussing  all issues of interest to consumers, ranging from available activities, womens and mens group issues, coping strategies and insurance coverage and legislation.</p>
<p>Paul Ernst said their Peer Counseling is done at the Miramonte Discovery Center, l429 Grant Road, Mountain View, 4l5-6l7-l769.  He meets with the counselors on a weekly basis.  There is no training fee charged  to the volunteers in either the Senior or Adult Peer Counselor group, with the proviso that they volunteer to help others for at least one year for Senior group and six months for the Adult group.</p>
<p>Linda Bell, Director of the Mental Health Association (MHA) came with seven clients to relate their support group and life experiences in frank and vivid terms, with their striving to achieve and maintain an active life. Linda Bell said MHA is a non-profit agency like AMI, but with no member dues funding.</p>
<p>Bell is celebrating her tenth anniversary this month, offering support and guidance to individuals primarily with bipolar disorders and major depressions, and a few with a schizo-affective diagnosis.  Patients come alone or with family members to her the Mood Disorder Groups at Stanford and in San Jose.</p>

<p>Marguita began by explaining that she entered  a deep depressive state after losing a close relative. She was hospitalized three times, when there was a concern about self mutilation or of harming others.  Her husband loyally visited her twice a day, and offered strong support.  They have just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.  She joined Linda Bells group five years ago and has been very grateful for their acceptance and caring.</p>
<p>Jody was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder eleven years ago, going through four manic-depressive psychosis and "lots of depression". Three generations of  her family has had individuals with bipolar illness.  It was very difficult for her to accept her own diagnosis, leading to periods of abstinence from medication and relapse. Unfortunately she observed that people in the medical profession, and she is a nurse, have a particularly difficult time with acceptance. Linda Bells group is a place where she can open up and laugh, without the necessity of hiding, and can make real lasting relationships.</p>
<p>Barbara, after fifteen years of therapy and groups, was finally diagnosed with a bipolar II disorder.  Her perception had been that she was different from others and felt isolated, despite the fact that she got college degrees and worked.  She took herself off medication and had suicidal impulses and ideation.  Linda Bells group has given her a chance to participate in learning how to manage the condition through medication and sharing. She now has recovery but still no cure.</p>
<p>David was essentially untreated for five years from l962 on. Prior to that, he obtained degrees in biochemistry and computer work. Two years ago he discovered that he had bipolar illness.  His brother suffers from a schizoaffective disorder, and his wife has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Coming to the group there is  the "wonderful sense that we are not alone", with hope that a cure will still be found. </p>
<p>Carolyn, had her first psychotic episode at age 28 and then diagnosis of manic depression. Carolyns younger sister was first diagnosed as schizophrenic and then re-evaluated to bi-polar.  Several members in her family suffer from these illnesses, including her mother.  Carolyn became a nurse at age 20 in an attempt to understand why "Her world fell apart" begining with her first episode.  Linda Bell helped her, she says, as one would "pick up a piece of something floating on the ocean".</p>
<p>Beth deals most of the time with major depression; however, "some medications trigger a switch in her mood into a manic state and alternating rapidly between the two".  Her diagnosis was major depression ten years ago, altered to bipolar seven years ago. She has been hospitalized about seven times with three sessions of Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT), that have been very effective and probably saved her life from suicidal impulses".  She is trained as a scientist and does part time writing assignments. She is grateful  to have places like the Mental Health Associations groups.</p>

<p>Karin had a suicidal and alcoholic mother; with two sisters on lithium.  "It was hell living in that house".  But she attended college, obtained an electrical engineering degree and worked for over ten years before she then became uncontrolled and diagnosed with a bipolar disorder.  The Stanford Mood Disorder Group was accepting, and not judgmental. Karin said, "without Linda there would be no group, and without a group there would not be some of us".
</p>
Note:	The monthly schedule for the Mood Disorder Groups and other client self help groups can be found each month in the AMI Newsletter on page one, towards the bottom of the left hand column. For further regarding AMI's Mood Disorder Groups and other client self help groups, please call Linda Bell at 408.294.4991.

<h2><tt>Update: Jail Diversion</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>by Erika Toth, AMI Vice President</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>
	Our County Board of Supervisors approved by a unanimous vote a $241,000 budget addition for FY 1996-97 for a Mental Health Jail Diversion Program. This will fund a one year pilot program. It will cover only key central areas of our County: Downtown San Jose, East San Jose and the McKinley area of San Jose. These have been identified as target areas of high incident rates for potential diversion in law enforcement encounters.
	A new Mobile Mental Health Crisis (MMHC) Team will be created under Jo Gampon, Director of Adult MH Services. The staff are being recruited now and the MMHC Team is expected to be operational sometime in October 1996. The San Jose City Sobering Station will be enlarged to allow for a "cool-down" period for persons in crisis, to hopefully avoid being booked into jail. Also, a daytime drop-in program will be made available for the homeless mentally ill in Downtown San Jose.
	The above represents only a start.  Supervisor Bealls Steering Committee will continue to meet and monitor the Jail Diversion Program. The Program must demonstrate success and cost effectiveness in order to get renewed (or increased) funding next year. Because our ultimate goal is a County-wide Program to include juveniles as well as adults, the committee is also beginning to assess the catastrophic lack of services available to juveniles with mental illness in Juvenile Hall.
	I will keep you updated on our progress.

<h2><tt>StarFires URIEL House is Open     <i>by Michael Whitney</i>
</tt></h2>
<p><tt>
The new StarFire program supports those with mental illnesses, as they recover from substance abuse. Their mental illness is stabilized through work with a MH  Service Team case manager and doctor. They concurrently learn techniques to control substance abuse.  StarFires Uriel House, to provide a dual diagnosis, sober living environment, opened June 1, 1996. The first client was a female, who moved in on the Fourth of July.  Other clients in the San Jose State area were invited to a Bar B Que, where they met and had hot dogs and hamburgers.  At this writing, there is still one more female bed space and five male bed spaces available.  Then a waiting list will be formed and maintained.
	The main support in helping to open Uriel House has come from individual AMI members, the AMI-SCC Organization, local clergy and interested mental health staff.  Thanks very much for all the donations of time, money and furnishings. All we need now is some on-going assistance, bedding, sheets and two single beds to become fully operational.  <b>To help out or to interview for placement, call 408.279.1003.</b>

<h2><tt>New Adult Mental Health Programs to be discussed at 
AMI&#146;s November General Meeting</tt></h2>
<p><tt>Three special new Service Teams and a second ACCESS operation will be 
discussed at. AMI&#146;S Monthly General Meeting. November 12 at the Hewlett 
Packard Auditorium, 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd. in the City of Santa Clara. The 
Meeting is open to the public. We open at </tt><strong><tt>7:00 PM</tt></strong><tt>, with everyone sharing 
information and welcoming new-comers. At </tt><strong><tt>7:30</tt></strong><tt> President Erv Dean will chair a 
short information discussion on AMI affairs, mental health services and Local, 
State or Federal news. The program begins at </tt><strong><tt>8:00</tt></strong><tt> </tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>Mobile Mental Health Team: Lewis Pollard</tt></strong><tt>, Health Services Supervisor. This 
specialty team (previously known as the Jail Diversion Team) will be comprised 
of 5 mental health professionals who will work in concert with the San Jose 
Police Department to find alternatives to incarceration for mentally ill 
individuals. The primary goal is to link mentally ill individuals who are in 
crisis or at risk of incarceration to the mental health system of care, 
including both residential and outpatient programs. This pilot project is only 
funded through June 1997 and for the high need downtown San Jose area.</tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>Young Adult Transitional Outpatient Service Team:</tt></strong><tt> Kim Flatmo, Health Services 
Supervisor. The Young Adult Transitional Service Team was developed to address 
the special needs of the mentally ill young adult transitioning from youth 
services to adult services. Transitional youth between the ages of 17-24 have 
been identified as an under-served population that requires resources and 
treatment philosophies from both the youth and adult mental health systems. 
The team is located at the Fairoaks Mental Health Center site.</tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>ACCESS II:</tt></strong><tt> Meg Paris, Health Services Supervisor. This program provides 
telephone screening and referral for Alcohol and Drug Services, as well as 
Mental Health Information and Referral. This is a joint venture between the 
Department of Drug and Alcohol (</tt><strong><tt>D A</tt></strong><tt>) and Mental Health (</tt><strong><tt>M H</tt></strong><tt>) Departments. The 
program provides a D A and M H central 24-hour telephone information and 
referral service to simplify consumers&#146; efforts to obtain information 
regarding available County resources.</tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>Homeless Service Team:</tt></strong><tt> Kitty Palmer, Health Services Supervisor. The Homeless 
Service Team is comprised of interdepartmental staff from Mental Health, Drug 
and Alcohol, Public Health, and Social Services Agency, coordinating services 
from these and other County departments to provide comprehensive aid to 
homeless mentally ill clients. This is a three year grant awarded to Santa 
Clara County from HUD. The team is located at the Downtown Mental Health 
Center site.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>President's Corner</tt></h2>
<p><strong><tt>Supervisors Race:</tt></strong><tt> the competing four candidates in the November County 
Supervisor elections, two for District 3 (now Supv. Gonzales) and two for 
District 5 (now Supv. McKenna) were all invited to speak at our October AMI 
General meeting. </tt><strong><tt>Barbara Koppel</tt></strong><tt> indicated six weeks before the October General 
meeting that her schedule would not permit her to speak at the Meeting and 
there was no aid who could appear for her (lack of interest?). On the day of 
the Meeting </tt><strong><tt>Patricia Sausedo</tt></strong><tt> called to say she was not feeling well and could 
not attend.</tt></p>
<p><tt>This left us with </tt><strong><tt>Joe Simitian</tt></strong><tt> and </tt><strong><tt>Peter McHugh</tt></strong><tt>, who came at considerable 
personal effort on their part. Simitian and McHugh each talked to us for about 
45 minutes, taking questions and showing real compassion for AMI families and 
clients coping with mental illness and County services. Each indicated a 
knowledge of County M H and wanted to know AMI-SCC member&#146;s experience and 
concerns. McHugh said he would support having a M H paid Family Advocate or 
Ombudsman.</tt></p>
<p><tt>If you favor a candidate for Supervisor, please contact him or her as an AMI 
member. They all need to know about our personal experience coping with family 
members or close friends who are receiving County services related to mental 
illness. AMI members, who can establish a personal supportive relationship 
with a candidate, can help him or her to get elected. Then you can continue to 
help them be a good Supervisor for M H.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Ericka Toth also announced at the Meeting that </tt><strong><tt>Eugene Hyman</tt></strong><tt> has been very 
helpful to the Jail Diversion effort and is worthy of your support for 
Superior Court Judge.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>Health Merger Put on Hold</tt></h3>
<p><tt>The proposed merging of the Alcohol and Drug Dept. with the Mental Health 
Dept. into a Behavioral Health Services Dept. per a March letter from then 
Dept. Directors (Bob Martinez and Robert Garner) was put on hold Sept. 25, 
1996 by a letter from Robert Sillen, Executive Director, Santa Clara Valley 
Health and Hospital System.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A recent review by Soleng Tom and Robert Garner indicated that: 1. There was 
no outside mandate driving the merger., 2. There are significant differences 
in their service systems, in their funding, mandates and client populations. 
3. The shared dual diagnosed populations are a fairly small percentage of the 
total and a number of joint service projects between the Departments have been 
developed for those dual diagnosed. 4. With both Departments , as well as the 
Hospital, initiating comprehensive managed care systems, there is at present 
not enough time or staff resources to plan and develop a new department. </tt></p>
<p><tt>Sillen&#146;s letter concludes &#147;We will develop and monitor those services which 
address the dual diagnosed and we will watch with interest the development and 
operation of two or three behavioral health organizations created by mergers 
between private mental health and drug and alcohol providers.&#148;</tt></p>
<p><tt>With the merger set aside, Sillen will now proceed to recruit and appoint a 
permanent M H Director.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>FDA Approves Olanzapine (Zyprexa)</tt></h3>
<p><tt>The Food and Drug Administration&#146;s approval on Oct. 1, 1996 of Eli Lilly &amp; 
Co.&#146;s Olanzapine under its brand name Zyprexa could help patients with 
schizophrenia who haven&#146;t responded well to existing medications. Dr. Alan 
Schatzberg of Stanford has high hopes for Zyprexa since it is chemically 
similar to Clozapine (Clozaril) but is expected to have less side effects. 
&#147;It&#146;s a potential breakthrough of tremendous magnitude.&#148; said Schatzberg, 
although he cautions that Zyprexa has not yet been adequately compared in 
testing with existing medications</tt></p>
<p><tt>Lilly has shipped Zyprexa to wholesalers and some pharmacies should now have 
supplies. The wholesale price for a 60-day supply has been quoted at $387. Dr. 
Gary Viale, head of the County&#146;s Psychiatric Pharmacy, said he is waiting for 
more test data on the drug before stocking it.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>Marty Craig, AMI Treasurer, Moving to Monterey</tt></h3>
<p><tt>Marty Craig can no longer continue doing her excellent volunteer work as our 
AMI Treasurer. She does our accounts using Quicken on her home IBM type 
computer (also on our AMI Office computer). It can also be done by hand in a 
ledger and takes about 6 to 8 hours work a month either way, per Marty and 
Jack Birnbaum, the prior treasurer. Any volunteers?</tt></p>

<h2><tt>INFORMATION ON SCHIZOPHRENIA AND CURRENT TREATMENT 
RESEARCH WAS PRESENTED AT AMI SCC GENERAL MEETING 
HELD SEPTEMBER, l996 </tt></h2>
<p align=center><em><tt>By Cole Buxbaum </tt></em></p>
<p><tt>Dr. John Brooks, M.D. and Ph. D., senior resident psychiatrist in the 
department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stanford University School 
of medicine, working for Dr. Ira Glick, has been conducting a number of 
research studies on new antipsychotic medications. In his talk Dr. Brooks 
described Schizophrenia and the early antipsychotic medications, comparing 
them to the more recent Clozapine and Risperidone, and then discussed the 
newest medications close to approval for use by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Dr. Brooks described schizophrenia is a chronic illness that is usually marked 
by bizarre delusions and auditory hallucinations, referred to as positive 
symptoms, and decreased social interaction and flattening of affect or lack of 
expression, known as negative symptoms. Schizoaffective disorders involve some 
of these, with a mood component as well. Prior to 1952, the only treatment 
available was long term institutionalization and physical restraint.</tt></p>
<p><tt>With the approval of Thorazine in 1952, some medical treatment was possible 
for delusions and auditory hallucinations, making it possible to reduce the 
period of institutionalization in many cases. Unfortunately, the drug was 
marked by a number of undesirable side effects, including movement disorders, 
making it difficult to convince patients to comply. In addition, it did 
nothing to treat the negative symptoms, making them worse in some cases. The 
mechanism for action of this and other later antipsychotics for a number of 
years, was primarily to block one of the neurotransmitter receptors; D2 - 
Dopamine.</tt></p>
<p><tt>In the late 1980&#146;s a newer atypical drug, Clozaril, was approved in the US, 
which targeted (in addition to the Dopamine receptor) the Seratonin 5HT2 
receptor. It has been remarkably effective for many patients, but had the 
unfortunate side effect in about one percent of patients of a sudden marked 
decrease in their white blood cell count, (agranulocytosis) affecting their 
immune system adversely. This currently requires weekly blood testing to 
continuously monitor all patients, increasing the difficulty and cost of use. 
Drooling and constipation are some of the other frequent side effects of the 
drug, making it more difficult for patients to comply. Researchers then began 
to work on substances that model the benefits of Clozaril without some of it&#146;s 
undesirable side effects. This resulted in the release in 1993 of the drug 
Risperidone made by Janssen Pharmaceutical. Risperidone, in addition to 
treating the positive symptoms, produced a marked improvement in negative 
symptoms, in some patients, as does Clozaril, but without the risk of 
agranulocytosis and weekly blood tests. This, as well as a lower price, 
results in a lower total cost for the medication, but still well above that of 
the older more typical antipsychotics, such as Thorazine and Haldol. There is 
also some incidence of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness on standing up) and 
of sedation, but a much lower risk of Parkinsonian like symptoms than 
Thorazine, except in higher doses.</tt></p>
<p><tt>In answer to a question regarding the number of patients that have gone 
successfully from Clozaril to Risperidone, Dr. Brooks explained that this 
would &#147;in some ways be an unfair trial,&#148; since, in general, Clozaril has been 
reserved for patients who are even more refractory to treatment, because of 
its side effect profile requiring blood testing.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A new antipsychotic, Olanzapine (Zyprexa - released by the US FDA on Oct. 1, 
1996 after this presentation) is modeled after Risperidone in that it targets 
both Seratonin and Dopamine neurotransmitter receptors. Olanzapine has been 
proven as effective as Haldol, but with very little evidence of movement 
disorders, such as Parkinsonian like rigidity, or akethesia (restlessness). 
Patients who have previously had movement disorders appear to improve with 
Olanzapine. Dry mouth, drowsiness and occasional anxiety are some side 
effects.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A Seratonin imbalance is often associated with depression, according to Dr. 
Brooks, and selective Seratonin re-uptake inhibitors such as Prozac and Paxil 
also relieve this. However, some seratinergic receptors feed into Dopamine 
receptors; so by blocking the seratinergic pathways you also block Dopamine. 
He explained that by blocking Dopamine through the seratinergic pathways you 
leave fewer side effects than in direct blockage, as by Thorazine.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Seroquel (Quetiapine) is another new drug, similar to Clozapine, that has a 
high affinity for seratinergic receptors but a mild affinity for dopaminergic 
receptors. It has fewer side effects and a lower incidence of movement 
disorders than conventional antipsychotics. There is only a moderate 
improvement in negative symptoms as compared to Risperidone and Clozaril, but 
appears to have a lower incidence of movement disorders than does Risperidone, 
when the latter is given at higher doses of 16 mg per day. Agitation, 
somnolence and mild constipation are some side effects.</tt></p>
<p><tt>The last new drug discussed was Sertindole, where FDA approval is also 
pending. It also targets seratinergic and dopaminergic receptors, but has a 
very low incidence of constipation and dry mouth. It has a long half life, and 
can be given once a day, making for better compliance on the part of the 
patient. There have been no observed movement disorder side effects. There is 
some increased heart rate and slight weight gain.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A question was raised that even though in the short term these newer drugs 
haven&#146;t shown a significant incidence of movement disorders, such as tardive 
dyskinesia , how do we know that they won&#146;t appear with long term use? Dr. 
Brooks explained that we can&#146;t be sure. However he feels that at higher doses 
Risperidone may give rise to movement disorders with a greater incidence than 
Seraquel or Olanzapine.</tt></p>
<p><tt>The direction that research seems to be going, according to Dr. Brooks, is to 
target dopamine through seratonergic pathways to decrease side effects, 
increasing compliance and consequently reduced hospitalization. </tt></p>
<p><tt>In answer to a question regarding akathesia or drug related restlessness, with 
Risperidone as compared to the other drugs discussed, Dr. Brooks said that it 
is lower in all of the newer drugs, including Risperidone, except in some 
patients at higher doses. There are a few who experience it even at low doses, 
however.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Regarding a question on the duration of a patient trial on one of the new 
drugs, Dr. Brooks felt that generally results should appear within 6 weeks of 
achieving a therapeutic dose, although it could take somewhat longer in 
certain cases.</tt></p>

<h2><tt>November 1 &amp; 2 CAMI Conference Was a Big Success</tt></h2>
<p><tt>Well over 500 people attended the annual statewide CAMI Conference held this year at the San 
Francisco Marriott Hotel next to the Bay just South of the S. F. Airport. Over 30 AMI-SCC 
members were at the Conference plus 30 County Spanish speakers attended a three hour Spanish 
language workshop. All attendees were able to get much new and helpful information</tt></p>
<p><tt>Among the major presentations given the first morning in the Grand Ballroom was an hour 
presentation by Samuel Keith, MD, Chairman, Dept. of Psychiatry, University of New Mexico, 
entitled: Schizophrenia Treatment and Pathophysiology: Our Past , Present and Future. Dr. 
Keith stressed the results of the last decade of brain research, leading to the development of 
much better medications, large scale patient testing and the demonstration of their 
effectiveness in the control of delusions, psychosis and other symptoms.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A second hour presentation was by Terence A. Ketter, MD, Chief of the Bipolar Disorder Clinic, 
Stanford University School of Medicine. His informative talk was entitled: Recent Research in 
Brain Imaging and Treatment of Mood Disorders. We hope to have him speak at a monthly General 
meeting early in 1997, so you can hear him directly. </tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>Lori Schiller</tt></strong><tt> is the author of the book, &#147;</tt><strong><tt>The Quiet Room</tt></strong><tt>&#148; about her experiences, suffering 
from the disease called Schizophrenia. Many felt she gave an inspiring hour and a half 
presentation in the Grand Ballroom entitled: With Hope Comes Miracles. She eloquently 
described how she came back to reality after hitting rock bottom, being very delusional and 
hearing voices. With a change to the medication Closaril and through suppressing/ignoring the 
residual symptoms, she has become a productive, essentially normal functioning person again.	
The final speaker the second day in the Grand Ballroom was </tt><strong><tt>E. Fuller Torrey, MD</tt></strong><tt>, Clinical and 
Research Psychiatrist, Washington, D. C. Dr. Torrey, the author of best seller &#147;</tt><strong><tt>Surviving 
Schizophrenia, A Family Manual</tt></strong><tt>&#148; has a new book just published entitled: </tt><strong><tt>&quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;</tt></strong><tt>. 
He gave a rousing closing speech where he urged all of us to: (1)Work hard toward eliminating 
the public misinformation about Neurobiological Brain Disorders (NBD)., (2) Achieve parity for 
private and public treatment of NBD equal to that for other long term illness, and (3) 
Increase funding for continued research, more low cost housing and disability rehabilitation 
toward fuller employment.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>First CAMI Conference Spanish Language Workshop</tt></h3>
<p><strong><tt>Alejandro Kopelowicz</tt></strong><tt>, Mental Health Director, at San Fernando Mental Health Center, Mission 
Hills, California, was the main speaker in the Spanish Language Work Shop at the CAMI 
Conference. </tt><strong><tt>Arturo Uribe</tt></strong><tt> and </tt><strong><tt>Maria Gil</tt></strong><tt>, Mental Health Specialists, from Community Companions, 
San Jose, were also speakers. </tt></p>
<p><tt>Thirty persons from Santa Clara Co. departed from the Community Companions parking lot. 
Transportation was provided by Santa Clara Co. Mental Health Dept.. Organizations represented 
from our county were Community Companions, Centro de Bien Estar (Gardner Clinic), Avenues to 
Mental Health, Guadalupe Support Group and AMI-SCC.	</tt></p>
<p><tt>Coordinating this first CAMI Conference all Spanish language workshop on mental illness 
information for Santa Clara Co. Latinos, were Soleng Tom, MD, and Maria Fuentes from the SCC 
Mental Health Dept.; Rebecca Woolis and Arturo Uribe from Community Companions; and Eleanor 
Reza and Luisa Perez, members of AMI-SCC. </tt></p>
<p><tt>A total of fifty-five persons were present, coming from four AMI Affiliates: San Bernardino, 
Sonora, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>President's Corner with Erv Dean</tt></h2>
<p><strong><tt>Santa Clara Co. Supervisors Race:</tt></strong><tt> Good News! </tt><strong><tt>Peter McHugh</tt></strong><tt>, for District 3 (to replace Supv. 
Gonzales) and </tt><strong><tt>Joe Simitian</tt></strong><tt>, for District 5 (to replace Supv. McKenna) were both elected in the 
November election. Both came to speak at our October AMI General meeting and showed real 
compassion for AMI families and clients coping with mental illness and County services. They 
both indicated a knowledge of County Mental Health and wanted to know more about AMI-SCC 
member&#146;s experience and problems. McHugh said he would support having a M H paid Family 
Advocate or Ombudsman to represent clients and their families to County service providers.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Supv. </tt><strong><tt>Mike Honda</tt></strong><tt>, was also elected to the State Assembly. His replacement as Supervisor has 
not yet been determined. This will mean that three of the five County Supervisors will be new 
starting in 1997, a year with expected major changes in M H services.</tt></p>
<p><tt>They will all need to know more about our personal good and bad experiences coping with family 
members or close friends who are receiving County services related to mental illness and what 
can be done to make County services even better. We have a Complements/Complaints Form in the 
Office to use to communicate with M H Management and their bosses.</tt></p>
<p><tt>AMI members, who have (or can establish) a personal relationship with their Supervisor, can 
help him or her be a more informed and effective Supervisor. Please call the AMI-SCC Office if 
you are interested in coordinating your efforts with other AMI members</tt></p>
<p><tt>Ericka Toth also announced at the General Meeting that </tt><strong><tt>Eugene Hyman</tt></strong><tt> has been very helpful to 
the Jail Diversion effort and is worthy of your support for Superior Court Judge. We are 
pleased that he was also elected.</tt></p>

schedule a presentation at your church, club, coffee klatch, or work 
place. If you have contact with a group which could benefit from a 5 to 
30 minute information session, please call Grace Johnston at 415.968.9337 
or Herb Slavin at 408.531.0932.</tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>The AMI-SCC Office hours have been reduced to 10AM-2PM, work days.</tt></strong></p>
<p><tt>Diana Trawinski, the main stay of our office, had a minor stroke in mid 
August, affecting her ability to speak and swallow. She is recovering at 
the Court Yard Care skilled nursing facility, 340 Northlake Dr., San Jose 
(Near Winchester &amp; Saratoga). Call there at 408.249.0344 for more 
information.</tt></p>
<p><tt>We are looking for an AMI member to be a part-time paid replacement for 
Diana as our Office Manager and Volunteer Coordinator until she recovers. 
Please call Florence Rosen at 408.266.8646 or Erv Dean at 415.494.0347, 
if you know someone who would be interested in filling the position or 
who could help as a temporary transition volunteer at the office.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>President's Corner</tt></h2>
<p align=left><strong><tt>County Supervisors:</tt></strong><tt> Both District 3 (Supv. Gonzales leaving) and District 
5 (Supv. McKenna leaving) have two candidates for election in November 
(our speakers at the October General Meeting -Page 1). Please contact the 
candidates for your district as an AMI member to let them know of your 
experience with the mentally ill. Try to assure that they and their staff 
know how the County Mental Health (M H) Program is working and how it 
could be even better for the whole county.</tt></p>
<p align=left><tt>You can get AMI information brochures and a Resource Handbook covering 
how County M H services are currently provided from the AMI Office. 
Anti-Stigma fact packs are available from our committee (Page 1). A 
personal working relationship with a candidate can help them be fully 
informed about family M H care and help them to get elected. </tt><tt><u>Remember 
County Supervisors have direct authority over County M H treatment, 
especially in their own district and a continuing relationship can be 
helpful to all parties.</u></tt></p>
<p align=center><strong><tt>Collaboration between M H and Religious Organizations</tt></strong></p>
<p align=center><em><tt>by Cole Buxbaum</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>In the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal of Boston, Jeff Walters, MD and 
Bernard Neugeboren, PhD, describe the important role that religious 
institutions can have in helping those &#147;who are struggling to cope with 
the devastating isolation of mental illness&#148;. &#147;Successful collaboration 
between consumers, churches, synagogues and M H providers can achieve 
such patient benefits as expanded services, increased client 
normalization, facilitated discharge, and decreased stigmatization,&#148; 
according to the authors. They say that consumer social clubs linked with 
religious institutions and mental health agencies, addressing the needs 
of mental health consumers living in a community, have been very 
effective.</tt></p>
<p><tt>&#147;There are often regularly scheduled weekly meetings for the activity 
group or club at the church or synagogue facilities. The congregation&#146;s 
minister, priest or rabbi frequently serves as a co-leader with an out 
patient staff member and trained volunteers.&#148; A club of this type can 
provide social support for family members and consumers, who also receive 
clinical treatment from community-based mental health services.</tt></p>
<p><tt>The authors say that barriers to implementing such partnerships are 
numerous but not insurmountable and &#147;care needs to be taken to identify 
shared goals and overcome difficulties&#148; in the different organizational

<p><strong><tt>Editors Note</tt></strong><tt>- Three examples of monthly group meetings at churches in 
Santa Clara Co. are given on our page 1. They are the two AMI Caring 
Groups, one at the Foothills Congregational Church in Los Altos and one 
at the Catholic Guadalupe Church in East San Jose (which families and 
consumers attend) and the Mood Disorder Group at Christ Episcopal in Los 
Altos. There are also a few urban ministry operations in the County. So 
it can be done!</tt></p>
<p><tt>With one out of five County families directly affected by someone with a 
serious brain disorder, why do you suppose there are not more religious 
groups providing some M H help in a County of 1.6 million people? The 
CAMI Journal on Religious Outreach, 1992 Volume 3 number 4 is available 
at the AMI Office. It provides an overview of the subject, pointing out 
that Religious Organizations are second only to public schools in 
educational activities, have family/individual outreach and help as an 
important objective, but are often way behind the times on mental 
illness. Perhaps their leaders and membership do not realize they have 
AMI members in the organization.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Could it be they seldom hear from one of the members of their 
congregation on the latest facts on brain disorders and how to 
collaborate with service providers in their community? Here is a place 
where you can make a difference. See if you can arrange with your 
religious organization for one of our 20 Anti Stigma volunteer speakers 
to meet with your outreach leader or group in October or November (See 
page one for where to start.)</tt></p>

<h2><tt>How Family and Friends Can Help Someone Who 
Resists Taking Medications</tt></h2>
<p align=center><em><tt>By Ronald J. Diamond, M.D.</tt></em></p>
<p align=center><em><tt>Reprinted from</tt></em><tt> </tt><strong><tt>Relapse</tt></strong><tt>, </tt><em><tt>a Yale University magazine</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>The concept of &#147;treatment-resistance&#148; (i.e. won&#146;t take medications) 
assumes that a psychiatrist&#146;s decision about what is good for a patient 
is correct and that there is something wrong with a patient who resists 
the help offered.</tt></p>
<p><tt>It is equally likely, however, that something is wrong with the treatment 
being resisted: Treatment resistance may mean that we want to sell 
something that our patient does not want to buy.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Studies have shown that patients more readily comply with treatment and 
have an improved outcome when they form a collaborative therapeutic 
alliance with their family and therapists. To foster this alliance, both 
need to show more interest in the person&#146;s aspirations and discuss how 
taking neuroleptic medication may help them to meet their own goals. A 
good place to start is by seriously listening to what they say that they 
want for their lives rather than starting by telling them what they 
should do.</tt></p>
<p><tt>It is important to take seriously what a specific client wants, no matter 
how unreasonable it may initially seem. For example, if a patient wants 
to be an astronaut, I can tell him that&#146;s ridiculous or we can discuss 
steps he might take toward attaining this goal. The first strategy closes 
off conversation, while the second opens doors to further 
communication.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Although becoming an astronaut may be an unrealistic goal for someone 
with mental illness, discussing it can help promote intermediate steps 
like taking meds.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Forming a collaboration is not easy. It can take time. I had one patient, 
for example, who refused to talk and refused medication. When I asked her 
what she wanted, she said, &#147;to eat.&#148; So every few weeks we went out to 
lunch. She accused me of trying to bribe her to talk. I acknowledged that 
we both got something out of the lunches..she got to eat and I got her to 
talk. Over the next year she agreed to take her meds and has been doing 
so ever since. We collaborated. Lunch every few weeks was less costly and 
time-consuming than traditional approaches.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Patients will be more likely to take meds if they believe it will improve 
their quality of life. Side effects may deter people from taking meds if 
they see no hope for ever living independently, even with meds.</tt></p>
<p><tt>If a patient believes that meds will allow one to hold a job or socialize 
with friends, they may find the side effects worth tolerating.</tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>Ten tips to reach people resisting medicine </tt></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>1. Put treatment in the context of the patients&#146; lives. Be 
concrete about what they will gain by taking meds.</tt></p>
<p><tt>2. Start with the patient&#146;s own agenda. Take seriously what 
they say they want for their lives.</tt></p>
<p><tt>3. Be concerned about whether patients follow through with 
agreed-on treatment plans. Ask specific questions designed to 
open up dialogue rather than put them on the defensive.</tt></p>
<p><tt>4. Involve patients as much as possible in decisions about 
their treatment. Provide information about treatment options 
and resources that patients can use to solve problems and 
enhance their lives.</tt></p>
<p><tt>5. Make sure patients, their families and involved agencies are 
kept informed about the treatment options and plans. Be 
sensitive to the agendas and prejudices of these people and try 
to work with them.</tt></p>
<p><tt>6. Try to involve friends, families, landlords, clergy and 
others as confidentiality allows and as it fits into the 
patient&#146;s own goals and agendas. People in support systems 
exert considerable influence in patient&#146;s decisions.</tt></p>
<p><tt>7. Be willing to be tenacious when necessary. Be flexible about 
how you can engage patients. If they decline meds, focus on 
&#147;safe&#148; topics first.</tt></p>
<p><tt>8. If warranted, connect medication compliance with continued 
community involvement. If necessary, try linking medication use 
with activities the patient needs such as obtaining spending 
money.</tt></p>
<p><tt>9. Accept the fact that some patients refuse treatment or parts 
of treatment despite all efforts. Offer what you can--be it 
bowling or lunch. Patients may be more willing to comply with 
treatment once a relationship is established.</tt></p>
<p><tt>10. Plan for anticipated crises. Use them to build trust. 
Following through on promises will strengthen the therapeutic 
alliance.</tt></p>

<h2><tt>President's Corner</tt></h2>
<p><tt>Immediate County Mental Health Concerns: As discussed in the May AMI Newsletter, there are two 
immediate Santa Clara County Mental Health (M H) concerns: (1) The County annual Fiscal Year 
Budget is to be approved in June for implementation July 1, 1996 and (2) Two County Supervisor 
positions are up for election in November.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Budget: The current County Mental Health (M H) budget proposal now includes a net reduction of $2 
million from this year&#146;s budget and is under review by higher County Administration for 
submission to the County Supervisors. Acting M H Director, Dr. Soleng Tom, was asked last month 
to prioritize all M H programs for possible additional M H cuts. At the same time he was asked to 
indicate where extra funds would be used if they were available. The Supervisors recently asked a 
formal Request for Proposal be prepared for a private provider to bid to provide Alcohol And Drug 
services. We feel that these actions indicate the County Supervisors are concerned with further 
possible budget reductions at the State and Federal levels plus the impact of mandated Managed 
Care of all health services. These concerns may be making them considerably more flexible about 
services and program performance/ outcome oriented. AMI Members need to keep informed about plans 
and progress in these areas and not bashful in letting their district&#146;s supervisor know how their 
constituents want them to vote.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Supervisors: In the November General election two new County Supervisors will be elected. Both 
District 3 (Supv. Gonzales vacating) and District 5 (Supv. McKenna vacating) each have two 
candidates vying for election. As indicated in the March AMI Newsletter, we feel all these four 
remaining candidates could be effective County Supervisors.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Each AMI member in these two districts needs to let both of their candidates know as soon as 
possible of our hard earned knowledge and experience with the mentally ill. We want to be assured 
that they know how the County M H Program is working and what it would take to make it even 
better.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A good AMI working relationship with each candidate can help them be fully informed about family 
M H care, help them be elected and assure they are an effective Supervisor when elected. To 
coordinate your Supervisor contact efforts with other AMI members, please call the AMI Office or 
Rod Pence (408) 779-7477, Chairman of our legislative committee. Remember County Supervisors have 
direct control over what County M H treatment is available anywhere at any time in the County.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Further changes in Interim M H Administration: </tt></p>
<p><tt>In an April 30 letter to all M H Providers, Soling Tom, Interim Director of the M H Dept. 
announced the interim appointment of two people to additional responsibilities. Josie Romero was 
given the additional responsibility of managing all ten of the Contract Adult Service Teams. 
While this adds to the Older Adult service teams she continues to manage, the letter said the 
change was not to be an expansion of the Older Adult Division, but was an attempt to have a more 
equitable distribution of Dept. work loads. Nancy Pena, Ph.D. (in addition to continuing as the 
Director of the Family &amp; Children&#146;s Services Division) is now also the Interim Deputy Director of 
the entire M H Dept., directly under. Soleng Tom, MD. Nancy will delegate some of her F &amp; C 
Division tasks to other F &amp; C staff to balance her workload. The interim appointments will be in 
place until further decisions concerning the implementation of the System Redesign Concept and 
the proposed Drug/Alcohol and M H merger are made.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Federal Health Care Reform Bill S. 1028: This very important health legislation passed 100 to 
zero in the U. S. Senate with the Domenici-Wellstone amendment to end discrimination against all 
M H treatment in private insurance nationwide included. The House passed similar legislation 
without the M H amendment. Both are now re-numbered to HR 3103 and both Senate/House appointees 
to a conference are being selected to resolve the differences.</tt></p>
<p><tt>NAMI and all AMI levels including individual AMI members are being very active in continuing to 
support passage of the amended legislation. A form letter was passed out at our last general 
meeting for attendees to sign and mail. Please send them in.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Many in the misguided Insurance and Business community are now stepping up their opposition to 
the Bill and its M H amendment, claiming estimates of additional costs from bygone years will 
ruin them.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Current national estimates of mandating parity for total M H care show a 4.0 percent premium 
increase at maximum. For brain disorder care alone, the national estimates are far lower--2.5 
percent or less. In states that have recently ended insurance discrimination, basically against 
brain disorder care only, such as Texas, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, actual per month M H 
costs have been between 30 cents and $2.47 per person. None of these monthly insurance costs 
consider the expected offsetting community savings by individual families, businesses or other 
community support or law enforcement groups, incurred when M H is not included in health 
insurance. Doing the right thing has only a minimal overall cost if any!</tt></p>
<p><tt>Please contact as soon as possible your House and Senate representatives (or the presumptive 
Presidential candidates) any way you know how, to let them know a constituent strongly supports 
this bill and its M H amendment and ask them to personally help get it passed.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Contact the AMI Office if you need more information.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>Good Samaritan Health Systems Foundation Funds</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>by Erika Toth, AMI Vice President</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>Due to the recent purchase of the non-profit Good Samaritan Hospital by the for-profit Columbia 
Health System Corporation, a portion of the assets (acquired through the prior non-profit status) 
has been required to be reserved for public health financing. This has resulted in Columbia 
creating a non-profit Good Samaritan Health Systems (GSHS) Foundation to control and distribute 
the money for public health needs.</tt></p>
<p><tt>On May 14, 1996, I attended the first of several public hearings planned to be held by the GSHS 
Foundation and the County Supervisors on what should be done with the estimated 56 to 72 billion 
dollars available in the Foundation.. I spoke (as only one of two Mental Health advocates) at the 
meeting, representing both AMI-SCC and the County Mental Health Board. I pleaded that our County 
Supervisors gain control and assure distribution of needed money within our Public Health System 
for Mental Health (M H) services.</tt></p>
<p><tt>At the meeting there seemed to be an emerging public lack of trust and public information on how 
much Foundation money there actually was and whether it would be spent on public health care 
needs. There are some indications that the Foundation plans to use the fund only to supplement 
some of the programs of the Columbia Health Systems Corp.. The Foundation seemed less than 
forthcoming on both the total money available and their plans AMI Members need to attend the 
upcoming public hearings, shown in the box below, especially those held in their own Supervisor&#146;s 
area, to advocate for preserving as much of the existing minimal M H services as possible through 
the next fiscal year. The next 1996-1997 FY County M H proposed budget now shows a cut of $2 
million below this year and does not include further cuts being discussed at the State and 
Federal levels. These cuts could severely reduce M H community supports and case management 
services for our loved ones. We should advocate for the use of GSHS Foundation funds in the near 
term as needed to compensate for these cuts and maintain these essential services until County 
revenues improve.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Letters to the California State Attorney General, urging him to see that the Foundation complies 
with all non-profit fund conversion legal requirements, would also be most helpful. You can write 
to him as follows: Daniel Lungren, 1515 K St. No. 511, Sacramento, CA 95814</tt></p>
<h2><tt>FLASH! FLASH!</tt></h2>
<p><tt>Public Invited to Tuesday Evening, May 28, Meeting in San Jose on Mental Health Jail Diversion 
Recommendations.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Supervisor Jim Beal and the Santa Clara County Mental Health Jail Diversion Steering Committee 
are pleased to Announce their &#147;policy recommendations&#148; at a May 28 open community meeting. The 
meeting will be held at the Public Health Center Auditorium, 2220 Moorpark Ave (at the North/West 
corner of Moorpark and Bascom) in San Jose, from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. The goal of the diverse 
21 member leadership Committee is to develop a comprehensive County/City system to divert the 
mentally ill from jail for minor offenses by creating a plan that is both fiscally and morally 
responsible. After numerous meetings, researching issues and conducting an intensive public input 
process, policy recommendations have been developed by the Committee. These recommendations will 
be presented to an open meeting of the County Board of Supervisors in the month of June. The 
prior public input has been incorporated into the recommendations, however, your additional 
feedback is needed at both meetings.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Refreshments will be served during the evening meeting. Please RSVP for the evening meeting by 
calling 408-299-3924.</tt></p>
<p><tt>(Editor&#146;s Note: The above actions are even more important now that the current AMI sponsored 
State legislation on diversion of the mentally ill from jail for minor offenses is apparently 
stalled indefinitely due to prosecuting attorney&#146;s disagreements with the bill&#146;s definition of 
&#147;minor offenses&#148; and pleas for local flexibility.</tt></p>
<p><tt>It is our understanding that one of the Committee&#146;s recommendations is to consider a pilot M H 
Crisis Response team (based on a successful Berkeley team model) in the Downtown and East side 
areas of San Jose. This has been sorely needed for several years, both for direct response 
assistance to police and sheriff personnel in crisis cases but also for better training of 
personnel likely to be involved with the mentally ill.)</tt></p>
<h2><tt>PLEASE CONTINUE SENDING IN LUCKY &amp; LONG&#146;S RECEIPTS</tt></h2>
<p><tt>Jean Pence, AMI-SCC Fund Raising Chairperson, recently reported that AMI members have turned in 
over $4,000 in Lucky and Long&#146;s store sales receipts. Please continue to send in these receipts 
to the AMI Office, and encourage friends and neighbors to save or collect them for you for us. 
Final remuneration by points for profit will be awarded to AMI at the end of the year. We will 
report our total fund raising results at that time.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>Support Services Available for Mental Health Clients at 
Community Colleges and San Jose State University</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>by Diana Trawinski</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>Now is the time for your loved one to consider fall enrollment in a recreational or skills 
building class at local public schools. The seven community colleges in Santa Clara County and 
San Jose State University provide services for mental health clients in their extra service, 
student disability programs. These include priority registration, alternative test taking 
arrangements, smaller group instruction, tutoring, liaison with faculty, etc. Tuition is waived 
at the community colleges for adult consumers with annual incomes below $7600.</tt></p>
<p><tt>AMI-SCC can provide personal support for clients interested in returning to school. The AMI 
Office has volunteers who will visit a campus with clients and assist them in applying for 
admission and registering for their selected classes in the school of their choice. The 
volunteers can assist in applying for tuition waivers and federal grants. They can also connect 
students to school Disability Program Counselors for help in selecting classes and other 
services.</tt></p>
<p><tt>In the past year, twenty clients have contacted the AMI office for assistance and/or information 
about school attendance. We have assisted them in registering for classes at DeAnza, Evergreen, 
Mission, San Jose City College, West Valley, and San Jose State University. The student&#145;s 
results, including student job placement assistance, have been excellent. Arrangements should be 
made soon for attendance this fall.</tt></p>
<p><tt>(Note: AMI Members wanting to assist consumers in this program should call Diana at the AMI 
Office.)</tt></p>
<h2><tt>ANTI-STIGMA COMMITTEE NEEDS HELP</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>By Ann Sloan</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>Your AMI&#146;s newly formed committee to publicize NAMI&#146;s Campaign to Remove the Stigma October &#145;96, 
needs your help. We need volunteers to present informative M H talks and written materials to 
their business, fraternal, religious group; union affiliations, trade affiliations, etc.--any 
group with which you may be associated. We need your group information to be able to supply 
prepared material for running in your organization&#146;s published newsletters to educate their 
members. We are obtaining/preparing videos for TV spots for all the local stations and tapes for 
radio broadcasts for all the radio stations. We also have an energized group of member/consumer 
volunteers who will help in the distribution of posters and flyers to all libraries, police 
departments, medical centers and hospitals. Our Hispanic members are planning events at senior 
centers and for the Sept. 16, Mexico&#146;s Independence Day Celebrations.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Please join us. We are an energized group and would appreciate your ideas, your help. Our next 
meeting is May 28 at 4:30 PM. Call Ann Sloan for details and if you can help in any way. (415) 
851 2825 (eves., Sat. - Mon.) We are going to erase the stigma of mental illness which is a 
neurobiological illness of the brain. Those afflicted are deserving of all the compassion and 
benefits afforded those with any other illness.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>HOUSING NEEDED FOR CONSUMERS</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>By Elizabeth Seaman</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>An urgent housing need now exists for four women who are in their thirties to fifties, sharing a 
four-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment in northern Mountain View. The length of their residency 
in this apartment ranges from 2 to 8 years, a very stable group who would like to stay together. </tt></p>
<p><tt>Last year, when the rent was raised to $1500 in February, 1995, Miramonte M H Services absorbed 
the increase, as the women were already each paying half or more of their monthly SSI payments 
($626) for rent. Now the rent is being raised an additional $500 on 30 days notice. Miramonte is 
generously paying the additional amount for one month, so they will have to find a new home by 
June 30. </tt></p>
<p><tt>They can afford to pay together no more than $1300 for rent without a subsidy. Can the members of 
this family find a home that will accommodate all of them or do they have to break up? Their 
relatives help them in whatever ways they can but that does not bridge the gap between their 
income and needs.</tt></p>
<p><tt>If you have any suggestions or offers of below-market-rate housing, or tax deductible direct 
contributions or pledges to Miramonte Mental Health Services to supplement the rent of these 
women and others like them, please contact Karen Wine at Miramonte, (415) 617 1754.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>NEW DUAL DIAGNOSIS PROGRAM IS BEGINNING</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>by Michael Whitney</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>The StarFire Dual Diagnosis Program is a new Program for clients who have a diagnosis of both 
mental illness and substance abuse. The StarFire group will develop a Dual Community with their 
own dual 12 step meetings, Dual Sponsors and supportive housing. Clients, family members and 
staff, who support dual diagnosis work are invited to help generate the program. A licensed 
boarding house will be the first residential project. Donations of household goods, furniture and 
your expertise are needed. Call Michael Whitney at (408) 294-9347 to help out. Consumers can get 
on the established waiting list now.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A Stanford Dept. of Psychiatry SEROQUEL Study needs patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder for an open, randomized comparison of the investigational antipsychotic 
drug SEROQUEL with usual-care drugs for 52 weeks to determine relative effectiveness. The 
medication will be furnished. All other medical services, hospital care, etc. will be at the 
client&#146;s or carrier&#146;s cost. Call Joy Knapp, study coordinator at (415) 723-6678 for more 
information.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>Advocates for Consumer Legal Rights and for Traumatic Brain 
Injury Improved Care Spoke at AMI April Meeting</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>By Cole Buxbaum</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>Kyra Kazantzis, Directing Attorney for Mental Health Advocacy Project in San Jose, and Terry 
Stimpson, MS, Rehabilitation Counselor for the Traumatic Brain Injury Advocacy Project in San 
Jose, discussed their programs at the April l996 AMI General Meeting.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Kyra Kazantzis described the Mental Health Advocacy Project (PHAP) as one of four programs of the 
Santa Clara County Law Foundation. As shown in a brochure distributed by Kazantzis, their goal is 
to &#147;empower people identified as mentally or developmentally disabled to live more independent, 
secure and satisfying lives through the enforcement of their legal rights and the advancement of 
their social and economic well-being&#148;. They are an independent state mandated organization. Her 
group, &#147;Patient&#146;s Rights Advocates&#148;, within the Project has five attorneys and a total staff of 
ten, who represent people firstly in civil commitment hearings, when the clients are held 
involuntarily. (The Public Defender handles such cases when criminal action is involved.)</tt></p>
<p><tt>In instances where a person refuses medication, the MHAP represents them before an administrative 
law judge. In all cases, probable cause of rights violation must be found for the MHAP to 
continue to advocate for the person. A second role is that of advocating for a patient or for a 
group of patients in a care facility, if there is evidence of rights violation as found by a MHAP 
attorney. A report is written describing the violations, the law involved, and the measures to 
correct them. A copy is sent to the local mental health director and the state office of 
patients&#146; rights.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Kazantzis distributed a copy of a patients rights information sheet, listing those rights that 
cannot be denied in general and those when hospitalized. Although the right to privacy is 
required for all mental health consumers, it can be compromised, in fact, when the patient is 
hospitalized, when there is good cause. Theoretically a right should be abridged only in the 
least restrictive way. For instance, if a patient is displaying potentially violent behavior 
toward a parent, the care givers may restrict all visits by that parent but permit others to see 
him or her. In answer to a listener&#146;s question, the MHAP is not normally notified of rights 
violations unless a consumer or significant other requests them to investigate.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Housing and benefits are two other areas in which the MHAP can become involved. For instance, 
when SSI has been denied they will handle the appeal. They also do a significant number of 
eviction defense actions in the housing area. In closing, Kazantzis emphasized that, where 
appropriate, they will initiate an action where the consumer is not in a position to call them. </tt></p>
<p><tt>Each year more than 373,000 Americans are hospitalized as a result of traumatic brain injury with 
about l00,000 of these ending with long term injuries profoundly affecting their social and 
business lives. </tt></p>
<p><tt>Terry Stimpson of the Traumatic Brain Injury Advocacy Project began her presentation by asking 
for a show of hands of those who are or have been involved with a person who received a traumatic 
brain injury and five held up their hands. She explained that injuries due to anoxia or brain 
tumor are not included in this class, although the results are frequently similar. A trauma is 
from an external force or blow normally occurring as a result of an accident.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Unfortunately according to Stimpson there has been very little funding allocated in regional 
centers to address this widespread problem. Brain injury results in a wide variety of 
consequences as described in a &#147;Fact Sheet&#148; distributed to the audience, including cognitive, 
physical, and emotional brain disorders. Although there are many problems in common with those of 
the mentally ill, there are no specific public policies to govern the care of the traumatically 
brain injured. When such an injured person displays psychiatric type problems, he or she may find 
access to some public support via the mental health services route. The Kyra&#146;s Mental Health 
Advocacy Project has been a source of some assistance in this area. </tt></p>
<p><tt>The California Head Injury Foundation, a consumer organization affiliated with the National Head 
Injury Foundation, has been in existence since l980. It was founded by family members with a 
board composed of survivors, professionals and family members. Brain injury can range from mild 
to severe, resulting in patients that have many kinds of needs and problems including substance 
abuse. Their aim is to link up with existing resources on the basis of disability. They sit in 
various task forces including the Department of Rehabilitation Task Force and the Mental Health 
Master Plan Council.Santa Clara County alone has over 22 new brain injuries per year. They may 
result in short or long term memory loss, spatial orientation loss, seizures, vision impairment , 
anxiety and depression, mood swings, and other manifestations. Attention and concentration 
problems make it difficult to hold a job. A loving, caring family, social relationships, and good 
care are all important. Although 80% of all brain injuries are not major, they almost all result 
in some long term neurological alteration affecting performance.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Stimpson pointed out that Medi-Cal does not cover brain injured patients and some of the 
resources available to the mentally ill are normally not appropriate to the brain injured. She 
asked that AMI members welcome these brain disabled people, who are not adequately supported 
elsewhere and collaborate with their organizations.(Note: Copies of materials handed out by 
Program Speakers are usually available afterward at the AMI Office.)</tt></p>

<h2>Please Join or Renew Your Annual AMI-SCC Membership 
Now!</h2>
<p>Our major 1997 goals are: 1. To give you and the public more information on coping with brain disorders, 
2. To reach more people like you who should participate with us as members, and 3. To enhance public 
and private community M H services, including housing. To accomplish movement towards these goals, we 
need more volunteers and more funds for one part time AMI Office and Community Outreach 
Coordinator. AMI-SCC is a volunteer California Non-profit Corporation with a volunteer Board.</p>
<p>Almost all of AMI-SCC, CAMI and NAMI operating funds come from annual local AMI dues and 
donations. If you have not become a new AMI-SCC member (or renewed) after the month of September 
1996, please join or renew now, so that we do not have to go to the trouble and expense of a special 
mailing to you. You can use the convenient form on the back page of this newsletter and help AMI, CAMI 
and NAMI continue working for you all through 1997.</p>
<p>Also please consider making AMI-SCC your designated charity for your donations at work or consider a 
direct donation on our form to help AMI-SCC do more to reduce the suffering of families and ill relatives 
like yours.</p>
<h2>Special Recognition for AMI-SCC Volunteers'</h2>
<p>Special thanks to the following volunteers in the AMI Office:</p>
<p><u>Phone Answerers:</u> Edwina Adoradio, Teddy Avakoff, Ann Barclay, Betty Pfister, Mary Lou Filice and 
Ann Youngman.</p>
<p><u>AMI Newsletter preparation and mailing:</u> Dave Barclay, Delsie Mc Grath, and Pearl Owen. </p>
<p><u>Data Entry:</u> Helen Knisely and Donna Mechanic.And last but not least, the <u>Office Committee Chairperson:</u> 
Florence Rosen. All their efforts are essential to keeping AMI in operation, responding to members and the 
public&#146;s need for information on coping with Neurological Brain Disorders (NBD). Citizenship Required 
for SSI Recipients by August 1997. </p>
<p>Although the Federal Welfare Reform Act was passed to create a new &#147;welfare to work&#148; mandate, the 
largest impact of the legislation--both human and fiscal--will be on recipients of SSI, the federal assistance 
program which helps the aged, blind or disabled. By August 1997, virtually all legal permanent residents, 
who are non-citizens, may be terminated from SSI. In California 41% of SSI recipients are non-citizens. </p>
<p>A special interest of ours are those with NBD who are living in board and cares, since SSI pays for their 
tenancy. Additionally, as Medi-Cal is tied into SSI, it may also be canceled for these folks, if Gov. Wilson 
chooses that option.</p>
<p>Obtaining citizenship normally requires a minimum of 6 months. It is imperative that a concerted effort be 
made to gain citizenship as soon as possible for all non-citizens with NBD. Otherwise more Californians 
with mental illness will be deserted to our streets and jails at great cost to our counties and our overall 
system.</p>
<p>Thanks to Carla Jacobs, CAMI Board Member for this information. Our AMI Office has a copy of her 
Getting Citizenship package by attorneys at Protection and Advocacy.</p>

<h2>Planned Lifetime Assistance Network (PLAN)</h2>
<p>Ask Yourself:</p>
<p>[] Could you use a break, a vacation from worry?</p>
<p>[] Is it difficult for you to spend as much time as</p>
<p>[] you would like with your ill family member?</p>
<p>[] Does he or she need more social contact?</p>
<p>[] Would you like to see your loved one get out more?</p>
<p>Have something meaningful to do?</p>
<p>Find a better place to live?</p>
<p>If you checked any of the above, help is available now.</p>
<p>The PLAN M H Service Provider for Santa Clara and Alameda County clients was changed from the San 
Mateo Lodge to two existing Santa Clara Co. M H Contract Agencies in October 1996. These Agencies 
were consolidated January 1, 1997 into the Alliance for Community Care (ACC).</p>
<p>PLAN and ACC, can provide services to all families who want paid supplemental M H services. ACC 
offers a wider choice of supplemental M H services to better fit individual family / client needs. Their 
services are priced to fit the varying difficulty and time needed for ACC to achieve each family&#146;s near term 
or long term objectives in each situation.</p>
<p>The PLAN Office in Los Angeles, assisted in Santa Clara County by AMI-SCC, will oversee ACC 
PLAN services in six month contract intervals. PLAN is also prepared to help with information on a model 
longer term California Special Needs Trust and to provide Trustee services in accord with a family will and 
trust. For pay as you go services under PLAN with AMI oversight information, call Erv Dean at 
415-494-0347.</p>
<p>Professional, privately paid, short term, supplemental ACC services (prior to signing up for longer term 
services under PLAN) are also available and can be very helpful to families unable to cope with a family 
member&#146;s mental illness. ACC can assist in quickly assessing the short term need and benefits to a family 
by obtaining supplemental at-home services or in-community services beyond the public or private services 
they may or may not have. Brief phone contacts and a visit with Linda Wohlsen at ACC can often identify 
ways to overcome existing roadblocks to getting more effective private or County M H services. For 
further information, phone Linda Wohlsen at 415.617.1751</p>
<h2>Research on Brain Leads to Designer Drugs&#148;</h2>
<p><em>By Daniel Goleman</em></p>
<p><em>Summarized from the New York Times of 11/19/96 by Cole Buxbaum</em></p>
<p>Daniel Goleman, staff writer for the New York Times, wrote a vivid and informative article dealing with the 
latest advances in research and development of psychiatric medications. According to Goleman, many new 
medications may now be found because of progress in neuroscience research, &#147;the fruit of the much 
vaunted 1990 &#147;Decade of the Brain, an initiative by the National Institute of Mental Health.&#148; Until recently 
neuroscientists had thought that there were just one or two variations of each type of brain receptor, the 
proteins in and on brain cells that receive chemical messages, affecting our emotions and thoughts. Now 
they realize there may be a hundred or more variations of a given receptor.</p>
<p>Fifteen different receptors have now been found for seratonin, a neurotransmitter involved in depression; 
five for dopamine implicated in symptoms of schizophrenia; six kinds for norepinephrine, etc.. (Buxbaum 
Note: Neurotransmitters and chemicals are released by nerve cells or neurons to communicate with each 
other. When a neurotransmitter is released, it attaches itself or binds to a receptor in the wall of a nearby 
cell.)</p>
<p>Present psychiatric medications lessen or increase activity of all the receptors for a class of neurotransmitter 
like seratonin indiscriminately and cause unwanted side effects, Goleman said. The next breed of drugs may 
target a specific carrier for a symptom in question and so will offer greater results with fewer side 
effects.</p>
<p>The greatest enthusiasm comes from neuroscientists at pharmaceutical companies, according to Goleman. 
Dr. Steven Paul, head of neuroscience research at Eli Lilly and Company (previously with the National 
Institute for Mental Health) says, &#147;The coming generation of psychiatric medications will be ten times better 
than we have now.&#148;</p>
<p>Goleman says that others are more cautious, such as Dr. Hyman, director of the Mental Health Agency 
who believes, &#147;it&#146;s not just a matter of discovering new receptors to yield new medications but that there is 
lots of basic research to do before we can best use discoveries (such as what circuits they connect with 
and what behavior they regulate) to yield new medications.&#148;</p>
<p>Dr. Edward Bradley, senior vice president for clinical research at Sanofir-Winthrop, Inc., indicates that 
they are already &#147;betting on this strategy.&#148; They have medications specific for seratonin receptors and will 
start testing them in the U. S. by the end of the year.&#148;</p>
<p>Goleman explains that with molecular biology offering the first precise map of receptors, new automated 
methods in chemistry allow production of an array of molecules, systematically adding small pieces to 
concoct huge numbers of subtly different compounds. Rapid fire testing of hundreds of thousands of 
compounds to find any that have a desired effect on target receptors can shrink development time from 
years to months.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Wienberg, a neuroscientist at the University of North Carolina, however, says that 
&#147;discovering that seratonin has fifteen receptors instead of just two or three is a bit like having a fuse box 
containing fifteen fuses with just two or three labeled, the next step is to determine what circuits all those 
unmarked fuses control.&#148;</p>
<p>The problem, according to Goleman, is that current psychiatric medications are crude in their action. Even 
the most recently introduced drugs such as the new class of psychiatric medications that include Risperdol, 
Olanzapine and Sertindole, &#147;are the last of the older generation because they act at many sites,&#148; said Dr. 
John Tallman, scientific director of Neurogen. For example, Prozac, which reduces depression by 
interfering with the ability of receptors to reabsorb the neurotransmitter seratonin, acts on all the seratonin 
receptors, such as those affecting sexual desire and digestion. </p>
<p>&#147;Wouldn&#146;t it be better,&#148; Dr. Hyman asked, &#147;to target just those seratonin receptors that regulate mood and 
leave alone those for other things like sexual activity?&#148;</p>
<p>Goleman ends his article by saying that the potential use of genetic testing may make it possible to identify 
people with brain patterns most susceptible to a given mental illness long before the disease begins.</p>
<p>In another article is the same issue, Goleman reports that Neurogen Corporation in conjunction with 
Shering-Plough is testing a compound that affects only the dopamine D4 receptor which is thought to be 
involved in cognitive aspects of schizophrenia. In addition Merck Corporation is testing compounds for 
treating depression that target a specific seratonin-2 receptor that is thought to have a role in psychotic 
hallucinations.</p>
<h2>EARL CALKINS MEMORIAL FUND ESTABLISHED</h2>
<p>Earl Calkins, a long time AMI-SCC volunteer and contributor, died peacefully at home on November 23, 
1996, after a long illness. A gentle, kind spirit, he devoted many years of support to the mentally ill and 
their families. He is survived by his wife, Carole (former head of Perma Housing); son William; daughters; 
Dennie, Callie, Marel and grandchildren; Kyle, Karlie, Elizabeth and Phoebe, who will all miss him very 
much.</p>
<p>In lieu of a memorial service, friends were invited on December 5th to a dedication ceremony for a new 
Leo Tolstoy Library established at Community Companions by Carole and a reception. Many 
contributions were made to her Earl Calkins Endowment Fund For the Mentally Ill.. Additional Memorial 
Gifts to the Fund may be sent to the Alliance for Community Care, 2001 The Alameda, San Jose, CA 
95126 or to The Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 1060 Minnesota Ave. San Jose, CA 95125.</p>
<p>Among many other contributions, Earl served with distinction on the AMI-SCC Board as Treasurer from 
December 1985 until March 1991.</p>

<h2><tt>Evidence Mounting for Role of Fetal Damage
in Schizophrenia
</tt></h2>

<p><tt>The New York Times, May 28, 1996, carried the above head line on pg. 28 and went on to cite several research studies indicating that in half or more cases of later diagnosed schizophrenia, the seeds of the disorder may actually be sown in the second trimester of a pregnancy.  The research explains why neuroscientists now believe several factors, such as a flu or other viruses, or malnutrition, and/or genetic predisposition can produce abnormalities in fetal brain growth and development in the second trimester.
	Another article in the Los Angeles Times of April 29, 1996 cited research by sibling Meggin Hollister, which showed that a difference in the mothers and the fetuss blood type can also produce this result during pregnancy, when the mother produces allergic antibodies harmful to her fetus.  In this case if the blood type difference is known early, the mother can be given medication to prevent antibody development, preventing the damage.
	Some question these findings saying no symptoms of schizophrenia appear for almost two decades after birth.  A British 43 year study has found subtle childhood differences in those who later developed the disease.  There were no gross abnormalities, but a lifelong delayed maturation of a couple weeks to a few months in their brain function in sitting up or later hand movements, suggest subtle abnormalities in neural development in the cortex..  Autopsies of patients brains also confirm wayward cell development in the cortex, which takes place almost entirely during the second trimester.
</tt></p>
<h2><tt>President's Corner</tt></h2>
<p><tt><b>County Budget:</b> The County Mental Health (M H) proposed budget still included a net reduction of $2 million from this years programs at the time this newsletter went to press on June 16.  Supervisor public budget hearings were to be held the next week.  They were to consider adding about $400 thousand for a one year pilot Jail Diversion project (See below.)
</tt></p>
<p><tt><b>County Supervisors:</b> As you know two new County Supervisors will be elected this November.  One in District 3 (now Supv. Gonzales) and one in District 5 (now Supv. McKenna).  This is the time AMI members in all districts should contact their incumbents and candidates to let them know of your concerns with care for the Countys mentally ill and dual diagnosed.  Assure yourself that they know how the County M H Program is working and what it takes to make it even better.  We can help them be fully informed about effective family M H care.  Please call the AMI Office to let us know of Supervisor contacts and results.  It is often best to visit them with other AMI members.  Please work together and with the AMI Office.
Remember, County Supervisors have direct management control over all County health treatment services in the County.
</tt></p>
<h2><tt>Update: Jail Diversion</tt></h2>
<p><em><tt>by Erika Toth, AMI Vice President</tt></em></p>
<p><tt>On May 28, 1996, the County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved Supervisor Jim Bealls Steering Committees plan for diverting mentally ill persons from jail when minor, non-violent crimes might be charged.  On June 18th, the Board will hold a public hearing and vote on the additional budget allocations required for one year funding of the proposed Jail Diversion Plan.  AMI members were asked at the AMI General Meeting to attend and support approval.

	Supervisor Bealls Steering Committee proposed a one year pilot project that would cover Downtown San Jose, East San Jose and the McKinley area as being a limited, concentrated area of high need.  The Areas Sobering Station would be expanded and a new Mobile Crisis Response Team would be created to assist the Police in evaluating and redirecting minor offenders in crisis to other community programs or placements.  Thus, hopefully, saving the County money by keeping harmless mentally ill people out of jail and providing a better treatment oriented alternative for our loved ones.

	We are most grateful to Supervisor Beall for his leadership and to all the members of his committee for their work and support in developing this plan.  We are also greatly appreciative of the community support we received from KBAY Radio Station and the San Jose Mercury News.  Especially, we thank Melody Peterson, Donna Alvarado and Jim Trotter for their dedicated and compassionate reporting.  And, especially, we thank the Editor.  When we needed it and asked for Editorial support, we received it (June 7, 1996).  We are truly grateful to everyone who helped get this done.

<h2><tt>Erase the Stigma Committee </tt></h2>
<p><tt>Discrimination in insurance coverage, housing, employment and access to services will not end until we work together to make discrimination socially unacceptable.  Your AMI October 96 Campaign to Erase the Stigma of Mental Illness Committee needs your help NOW! Respond vocally and in writing to every media item you see that unfairly or unrealistically portrays disorders of the brain.  Write letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines, expressing your criticism or approval of their handling of a brain disorder issue. Please send a copy to the AMI Office.  We will see the Northern California Coordinator for the October campaign receives a copy to forward to other AMIs and to NAMI.  If we are successful in this, there are two large donors who will pay the expenses for this national campaign. But they must be able to see the articles in the media that have been generated by the AMIs or individuals who are fighting to end the stigma and discrimination against peoples with disorders of the brain.  Open Your Mind--Mental illnesses are brain disorders that can be successfully treated is the theme.</tt></p>

<h2><tt>Update on Santa Clara County Mental Health
Medications and Associated Client Services 
</tt></h2>
<p><tt>
Mechling also visits the various public and private psychiatric care facilities, including Napa State Hospital to evaluate and coordinate their programs.  Clozapine and Respiridone, being atypical antipsychotics, are more constrained budgetwise than the less costly more typical ones.  Because of this and general County financial considerations, Mechling said that each program has been directed by the Board of Supervisors to develop newer cost and treatment outcome data.
	In closing Dr. Viale reminded us that bipolar illnesses, affect some one percent of the general population and accounts for a very high percentage of suicides.  The average patient doesnt get diagnosed for eight years.  There is hope that some newer anticonvulsant medications will be effective to supplement the present drugs.  Schizophrenia also has a lifetime prevalence of about one percent.  The suicide rate is ten times that of  the general population, a fact that should be made well known.
	Note: We must all lobby to increase the use of these cost effective medications and associated community supports, both to reduce overall County costs and to reduce suffering.

</tt>
<h2><tt>Back to School on Coping With SeriousMental Illness</tt></h2>
<tt>
<p><b>"Recovering From Psychosis: A Wellness Approach"</b> is a 12 session Mary Moller course on coping with Schizophrenia, Major Depression, and Bipolar disorders which will be taught on Thursday evenings by Phyllis M. Connolly, Ph.D., RN starting Sept. 12, 1996.  Complete details and a sign up form are included in this issue's insert flyer sheet.  It is highly recommended for professionals, family members and consumers.</p>
<p><b>A one day seminar on "Surviving & Thriving Despite Serious Mental Illness"</b> will be given by Christopher S. Amenson, Ph.D. on Friday, October 4, 1996 in Pleasant Hill.  Deadline for pre-registration is Sept. 15,1996.  Dr. Amenson is a highly respected presenter of effective coping with serious mental illness.  Again, complete details and a registration form are included on the back of the insert flyer.  (Note: if more than one registration is wanted, please use your nearest copy machine.)</p>
<p><b>Mark your calendars now to save Nov. 1 & 2 for the CAMI Conference at the S. F. Airport Marriot Hotel.</b>  The best two day seminar you'll ever find anywhere!
</p>
<p><b>Please note the change in AMI-SCC Office hours to 10AM-2PM.</b>  Diana Trawinski, the main stay of our office every work day, has suddenly become ill and is in Kaiser's Santa Teresa Hospital.  Despite our best wishes and prayers, she is not expected to be able to return soon.  She is sorely missed by us all.</p>
</tt>
<h2><tt>President's Corner</tt></h2>
<tt><p><b>Thanks to all of you</b> for what you have been doing to keep yourselves informed and for your work in helping to inform others.  You have helped to make our County's Mental Health care what it is, one of the best informed and most cost effective services anywhere.  Perhaps by lighting this corner of the world, we are doing more than we know to overcome these illnesses. </p>
<p><b>On County Supervisors:</b> As noted in our March and later Newsletters, two new County Supervisors are to be elected this November.  Patricia Sausedo and Peter McHugh are in a runoff in District 3 (now Supv. Gonzales).  Barbara Koppel and Joe Simitian are in a runoff in District 5 (now Supv. McKenna).  See the March issue or call for more candidate information. <u>Remember, elected County Supervisors have direct management control over all County health and welfare services in the County. </u></p>
<p><b>AMI-SCC members should call or write their Supervisor</b> to thank them (as a resident of their supervisor district) for their interest in improving services for the County's mentally ill and dual diagnosed.  We should offer help to keep them informed about effective family M H care. It is best. if you can,  to schedule a visit in September with them or their staff along with other AMI members from your district.  Please try to work together and with the AMI SCC Officers.  The AMI office has member information and useful fact sheets you can use. </p>
<p>A Supervisor action we can thank them for occurred earlier this year, when the they all approved a major County wide five year effort to move toward Comprehensive Performance Management (CPM) with the objective of budgeting measurable County service performance (results) in all departments, rather than for just staff position placement throughout the County.  Several CPM Committees have been set up to document best practices which could enhance performance.  Longer term we may be able to judge the County's Executive/Administration performance by how much of future County annual budgets are based on program dollars with quantifiable results each year. 	</p>
<p>Along with CPM the Supv.'s are also increasing the use of Requests For Proposals (RFP's) as a move toward competitive performance where possible.  In that regard, I hear their RFP, which resulted in the complete transfer of all patients from East Valley Pavilion to Crestwood, has been largely an improvement, based on patient's improved care and treatment results, even with reduced total costs.  Please let me and your District Supervisors and Candidates know what your experience indicates on this and also what you believe would further improve County and Contractor Mental Health care performance. </p>
<p><b>The November General Election is just two months away, and AMI efforts at State and Federal legislation for parity in public and private mental health care after some initial committee success have all recently failed.</b>  Please assure yourselves that your vote goes only to representatives who will support legislation for State and Federal parity in both public and private M H care.  Getting such legislation passed would do more to eliminate discrimination and end stigma than any thing else we could do.

<h2><tt>PERMAHOUSING AND COMMUNITY COMPANIONS NEW JOINT ORGANIZATION WAS DESCRIBED BY THEIR DIRECTORS AT THE AMI SCC JULY GENERAL MEETING</tt></h2>
<i>By Cole Buxbaum</i>
<tt><p>Mary Williams, Executive Director of Community Companions, and Carole Calkins, Director of its Permahousing Division, spoke at the AMI SCC July General Meeting.  "This is a wonderful time to be involved in the mental health community," said Calkins, referring to the recent merger of Permahousing into Community Companions.  There have been some internal organizational changes as well as some moves into new quarters.  The larger combined agency will afford backup support for each member and improvements in meeting all the needs of all clients.  Permahousing will still have some clinical services, their key housing services, an intern program in collaboration with San Jose State University, plus Crossroads and Zoe House licensed board and cares.</p>
<p>With Community Companions, they are gaining involvement in employment services, day rehabilitation, case management, a club house, a volunteer jobs program, partial hospitalization, and service teams.  The new combined organization is now a full service entity.  The main office is located at Community Companions, 200l The Alameda, San Jose, CA 95l26, phone number: 408-26l-7777.  The Permahousing Day Program, therapy and counseling will continue at l080 Minnesota, San Jose, CA 95l25.</p>
<p>Mary Williams began by saying that Calkins had initiated the merger by recognizing the benefits of collaboration that would allow Permahousing to concentrate more on housing and related special programs, while strengthening Community Companions capabilities in family services.  "The merger has been very successful as a result of the commitment of all people on both staffs." she stated.</p>
<p>By January, l997 Avenues to Mental Health and Miramonte Mental Health Services will also merge with Community Companions.  She noted that, " The un-named new organization will then be the largest non-profit mental health provider in Santa Clara County.  It will be stronger and will be able to provide leadership to further the values we all hold, while enhancing patient capability and reducing costs."  Also there were over twenty non-profit agencies that contracted with Santa Clara County to provide mental health services.  County administration, wants to reduce the number of contractors, while improving their responsiveness and lowering costs.</p>

<p>Williams emphasized that this collaboration and merger, working closely with the County should strengthen our community mental health system, benefiting the clients and making it less probable that more portions of the system may be contracted to private for-profit corporations.  "We all must be pro-active and informed as we move into managed care", she said, "to make sure that the client's needs are met."</p>

<p>The Permahousing and Community Companions merger was l8 months in the making.  Miramonte Mental Health Services and Avenues to Mental Health have also been working for a year towards their merger.  Seven people selected from each of these organizations are acting as a temporary board of directors, to report to a Chief Executive Officer, still to be selected .  Lynn Farr, Executive Director of Miramonte Mental Health Services, Glen Robertson, Director of Avenues to Mental Health, and Mary Williams are competing to be the new CEO.  They all are committed to the success of the new organization.  Rod Pence of AMI SCC and three other community individuals will be contacted to give input to the CEO selection process.	They are now soliciting ideas for the name of the new entity.  Williams recommended that "behavioral health" should not be the choice, although it seems that many regions of the country are using that as a title for an integrated mental health -substance abuse organization.  AMI members should write to Robert Sillen, Director of Health and Hospital Systems, 2220 Moorpark Ave., San Jose, CA 95l28, making their feelings known on the objectionable aspects of such a name substitute for Mental Health.  Calkins agreed, and added that the term can imply negative intent rather than a biological manifestation.</p>
<p>In answer to a question regarding the possibility of their contracting with Kaiser or other HMO's to supply some outpatient mental health care services.  William's indicated that  Kaiser has already begun a pilot program for outpatient intensive day care with Community Companions initiated by Sharon Roth..  She explained that the new joint entity of Community Companions and Permahousing will be open to additional contracts with other payees, as well as to an expansion of programs from Kaiser.</p>

<p>As the County moves toward integrating Drug and Alcohol Programs with Mental Health (which Sillen seems intent on doing) there will be the opportunity to look at the whole patient, since a large population falls into both categories.  Williams favors this collaboration, provided that certain resources and advocacy for  the mentally ill are preserved.  One process that would be better served is the Jail Diversion Program, which overlaps both categories.  It is important, she said that AMI members become involved in all these changes because "People hear family voices differently from those of paid providers" and they frequently carry more weight.</p>
<p>Mary Williams described the major parts of the combined organization to be as follows:  (l) Five service teams, including psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, case managers, and therapists to provide treatment and support 24 hours per day for mentally ill clients.  (A van permits a psychiatrist to go into the field.)  The total case load of all teams is now eleven hundred clients.  (2) Partial hospitalization; including intensive day therapy supported by Medicare funds, to minimize hospitalization.  (3) Day rehabilitation services to promote social and personal skills; Club House, Nikki"s Place, and Crossroads.  (4) Housing (under Carole Calkins) Zoe House and Crossroads Village and six facilities for independent living, plus individual apartments and several board and care homes for interim support.  (5) Housing coordinator (under Carole Calkins and staff) to develop additional housing resources.  (6) Volunteer program; to train clients to help others, and work within Community Companions on various programs.  (7) Employment; Mission Valley Employment (working with the State Department of Rehabilitation) places and trains clients for work and collaborates with Miramonte Mental Health Services, Avenues to Mental Health, and Focus for Work.</p>
<p>If someone needs to be connected with one of the above programs, or wants more information, please call Community Companions at 408.261.7777, or come to a monthly Community Companions, Family Information Night.

<h1><tt>New Alliance Offers Full Range of 
Community Care As County Contractor 
and To Private Fee Clients</tt></h1>
<p><tt>On January 1, 1997 three previously independent and diversified County 
Mental Health Contractors will have been consolidated into one larger, 
non-profit organization, the Alliance for Community Care. Through the 
consolidation of Community Companions, Avenues to Mental Health and 
Miramonte Mental Health Services, the Alliance will serve approximately 
5,000 local residents, offering a broader and deeper range of programs 
and services to the mentally ill and their families. The new non-profit 
Alliance, headed by Mary Williams, will have an annual budget of $20 
million, a staff of 430, and 15 residential or outpatient treatment 
facilities. Alliance&#146;s goal is to provide all services needed by clients 
to develop and maintain their ability to live and work successfully in 
the community.</tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>Lyn Farr, Alliance Director of <br>
Clinical Services and Linda Wohlsen, <br>
Supervisor of fee-for-service, will discuss <br>
a broad range of available Alliance <br>
family and client services from 8:00 to <br>
9:00 PM at our Jan. 14 Monthly AMI <br>
Meeting. </tt></strong><tt>They will give examples of how<br>
different services for families / clients could benefit them: All the way 
from crisis intervention to diagnosis and initial treatment plans, to 
PLAN proxy-parenting care for County clients through pay-as-you-go, now 
or by trust after you are gone. (See more about PLAN on page 2.)<br>
Lyn Farr headed Miramonte for several years. Linda Wohlsen has served as 
Miramonte&#146;s vocational counselor and county rehabilitation specialist. 
Wohlsen has a masters degree from San Francisco State University in 
Marriage, Family and Child Counseling, and. was responsible for starting 
Miramonte&#146;s fee-for-service department and recently providing PLAN 
Services.<br>
</tt><strong><tt>The AMI General Meeting doors will open at 7:00 PM at the Hewlett Packard 
Auditorium, at 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd.</tt></strong><tt> in the City of Santa Clara, as 
shown above. A half hour presentation of AMI-SCC news will precede the 
Farr and Wohlsen program presentation.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>Please Renew Your Annual AMI-SCC Membership Now!</tt></h3>
<p><tt>Our major 1997 goals are: 1. To give you and the public more information 
on coping with brain disorders, 2. To reach more people like you who 
should participate with us as members, and 3. To enhance public and 
private community M H services, including housing. To accomplish movement 
towards these goals, we need more volunteers and more funds for a part 
time AMI Office and Community Outreach Coordinator. AMI-SCC is a 
volunteer California Non-profit Corporation with volunteer Board. Almost 
all of AMI-SCC, CAMI and NAMI operating funds come from shared local AMI 
dues and donations. If you have not become a member (or renewed) within 
the last quarter of 1997, please renew now. Please use the member form on 
the back page of this newsletter and help AMI, CAMI and NAMI continue 
working for you all through 1997.<br>
Also please consider establishing AMI-SCC as your charity for donations 
at work or on the form to help all of us do more to reduce the suffering 
of families and clients like yours.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>Planned Lifetime Assistance Network (PLAN)</tt></h3>
<p><tt>The pay-as-you-go PLAN Service Provider for Santa Clara and Alameda 
County clients was changed from The San Mateo Lodge to Santa Clara Co. M 
H Contract Agencies in October 1996. These Agencies have now consolidated 
into the Alliance for Community Care as described on the front page.<br>
PLAN and the new Alliance, starting January 1, 1997 will continue to 
provide PLAN services but with a wider choice of services to better fit 
individual family / client needs and priced to fit the varying difficulty 
and time needed for better results in each situation. Prior and on-going 
PLAN participants were all mailed a letter on December 10, 1996 detailing 
the new service options and payments required to continue to receive PLAN 
services under the new arrangement.<br>
The PLAN Office in Los Angeles, helped locally by AMI-SCC, can oversee 
Alliance implementation of pay as you go PLAN services in six month 
intervals. PLAN is also prepared to help with information on longer term 
California Special Needs Trusts and to provide Trustee services in accord 
with a Will.<br>
Privately paid, Alliance services can also be very helpful to family 
members in assessing their need for other at-home services or 
in-community services. These initial contacts with Alliance can often 
find ways to overcome existing roadblocks to getting more effective 
private or County M H services.<br>
For further information on short term family paid Alliance services, call 
Linda Wohlsen at 415.617.1751. For more pay as you go PLAN or AMI 
oversight information, call the AMI-SCC Office at 408.280.7264 or Erv 
Dean at 415.494.0347.</tt></p>
<h3><tt>Update on After Hours / Weekend / Holiday Service Team 
Coverage by Laurel Mechling</tt></h3>
<p><tt>After regular working hours emergency service (weekdays 5:00 PM -8:00 AM 
and 24 hours on weekends and holidays) is available to all clients 
receiving treatment in Santa Clara County from an Adult or Senior Mental 
Health Service Team. The goal of having after hours services available is 
to provide the appropriate level of care to service team connected 
clients around the clock, 24 hours a day, 365 days each year.<br>
Individuals who are currently receiving services from a Service Team can 
access after hours staff in the following ways:<br>
(1) If an individual is connected to a COUNTY Service Team the 
instructions are to call the ACCESS program at (408) 299-5800. ACCESS 
staff will page the on-call County staff person, who will in turn, assess 
the situation and provide the appropriate level of care or intervention 
deemed to be clinically appropriate.<br>
(2) If the individual is connected to a CONTRACT AGENCY Service Team, the 
individual is directed to call the contract agency&#146;s direct after hours 
service phone line.<br>
(3) If the individual or someone concerned about the individual doesn&#146;t 
know the after hours phone number, call ACCESS to get services or 
referral to a CONTRACTOR after hours number.<br>
Any inquiries / comments / problems relating to any of these services 
should be directed to Laurel Mechling, Mental Health Adult Service 
Division Administration at (408) 885-7575. The AMI-SCC Office also has a 
complements / complaints form for member written service experiences, 
which would let AMI know what is happening. We can forward the signed 
form to Laurel or to Jo Gampon the Adult Services Director, if requested.</tt></p>
<h2><tt>OPPOSITION TO PARITY FOR MENTAL ILLNESS 
TREATMENT IS BASED ON MISINFORMATION</tt></h2>
<h3><tt>Mental Illness Myths Dispelled - 1996 NAMI Fact sheet:</tt></h3>
<p><tt>Myth: Mental illnesses do not affect the average person.<br>
Fact: No one is immune to mental illness. The National Institute of 
Mental Health&#146;s statistics show that five million adults and 7.5 million 
children in America have some form of mental illness in any given year.<br>
<br>
Myth: The cause of mental illness is either poor parenting or poor 
character.<br>
Fact: Mental illnesses like major depression, manic depression, 
schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are 
no-fault brain diseases, and can strike in any family.<br>
<br>
Myth: A person experiencing mental illness is possessed by an evil 
spirit.<br>
Fact: Mental illnesses are caused by physical disorders or chemical 
imbalances, not by supernatural forces.<br>
<br>
Myth: There is no effective treatment for mental illness.<br>
Fact: Mental illnesses are brain disorders. Brain disorders can be 
successfully treated, allowing victims of this condition to lead normal 
productive lives.<br>
<br>
Myth: People with mental illnesses cannot work or contribute to society.<br>
Fact: People with brain disorders find effective treatment through 
medicine, therapy, or both. Treatment that works allows people with brain 
disorders to contribute to society. It is the stigma of mental illness 
that prevents people with brain disorders from seeking employment.<br>
<br>
Myth: Mental illness is the same as mental retardation.<br>
Fact : Mental retardation is an intellectual deficit at birth, or a 
result of illness or injury during infancy or childhood. Mental illnesses 
are brain diseases, physical disorders that often strike between the ages 
of 16 and 25.<br>
<br>
Myth: People who have a mental illness are dangerous.<br>
Fact: Most people who have a mental illness are no more violent than 
someone suffering from cancer, diabetes, or any other serious illness. </tt></p>
<h3><tt>More often, they are the victims of violence.<br>
More From the 1996 NAMI Anti Stigma Brochure:</tt></h3>
<p><tt>Yours may be the one out of every five families in the United States that 
is or will be directly affected by a serious brain disorder. Such 
families face an unfair system that still treats them as &#147;less than,&#148; 
&#147;not as important as,&#148; or &#147;not equal to&#148; the rest of Americans. All 
Americans must help end the stigma and discrimination that lingers 
despite the scientific proof that makes them groundless.<br>
<br>
Discrimination against people with brain disorders makes no sense - No 
scientific sense - No economic sense - No political sense. Stigma is 
everywhere, but NAMI (and your local AMI) intends to end it. We have 
launched a five-year effort to challenge negative stereotypes, educate 
the public, confront discrimination and demand fair public policies from 
informed elected officials and policy makers.<br>
<br>
&#147;Doesn&#146;t it cost too much to pay for equal treatment for brain 
disorders?&#148; The better question is, &#147;Doesn&#146;t it cost too much to NOT 
treat them?&#148;<br>
<br>
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, &#147;Estimates based on 
studies of current coverage and utilization suggest that for an 
additional annual cost of $6.5 billion...annual savings in indirect costs 
and general medical services would amount to $8.7 billion. This would 
represent an estimated net economic benefit for the nation of $2.2 
Billion annually.<br>
<br>
For less than the price of a cup of coffee, one can buy a month of mental 
illness insurance benefits equal to those for other medical illnesses.<br>
<br>
AMI&#146;s five year campaign to End Discrimination will close the gaps 
between science and policy. We will demand equal access and treatment for 
a group of people who have been denied their inalienable rights simply 
because they have schizophrenia instead of epilepsy, bipolar disorder 
instead of Alzheimer&#146;s, or major depression instead of Parkinson&#146;s 
disease.<br>

<h2><tt>Recovering From Psychosis: A Wellness Approach 
Class</tt></h2>
<p><tt>This unique 12 week course will begin again on Wednesdays, February 12 
from 3:30- 6:30 PM, and continuing until April 30 at the Alliance for 
Community Care (was Community Companions), 2001 The Alameda, San Jose. 
There is a $45 fee for the required text/manual. Fees per session 
attended are based on a sliding scale ($1-$25 per session), for 
non-professionals according to need and ability to pay. Professionals 
attending for credit will be given 36 contact hours for completion of all 
12 sessions and will be charged $30 per session. Call Nikki Winovich at 
408-261-7777 for registration and additional information.<br>
The 12 week course empowers persons diagnosed with a psychiatric illness 
and their families through an increased understanding of the illness, 
relapses, recovery and rehabilitation. Because the course includes 
individuals with psychiatric illness, families, mental health 
professionals and mental health service providers, an optimal and 
effective learning environment is created. Outcome research, based on a 
large sample of participants involved in the course in the state of 
Washington, indicated a 93.5% decrease in hospitalization needs. 
Satisfaction surveys from participants of the course here in Santa Clara 
County indicate immediate and long term satisfaction and similar positive 
outcomes.<br>
Dr. Phyllis M. Connolly, a certified clinical specialist in adult 
psychiatric/mental health nursing and a professor at San Jose State

AMI-SCC Office Changes<br>
AMI Office Coordinator<br>
As most of you know, Diana Trawinski had a stroke last August after the 
AMI picnic. It affected her speaking and swallowing abilities . With 
rehabilitation she is making some improvement and is able to live at 
home. It is not expected now that she will be able, any time soon, to 
resume her nearly half time or more work as the AMI-SCC Office 
Coordinator.<br>
She performed her work at the AMI Office so well and with so much 
dedication that we were hoping that she might be able to return and still 
do. However we have had to come to the realization that there is little 
chance that will happen. So we must seriously seek a replacement for her 
as described in the column to the right. If you or any one you know could 
do the job as described please call and send in a resume&#146;.<br>
<br>
AMI-SCC Treasurer<br>
Marty Craig our very capable Treasurer has transferred from San Jose to a 
better job in Santa Cruz and is in the process of buying a home in 
Pacific grove. Last year she set up our books on an IBM personal computer 
using the financial program Quicken and before that was the Board 
Secretary. All good things come to an end, they say. All we can say is 
</tt><strong><tt>THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARTY FOR ALL YOUR HELP!</tt></strong><tt><br>
Fortunately, Herb Slavin has computer skills and has agreed to be our new 
Treasurer for the remainder of our fiscal year. Welcome aboard Herb.</tt></p>

<h2><tt>New County Mental Health Programs Described at 
November, 1996, General Meeting of AMI-SCC</tt></h2>
<p><tt>By Cole Buxbaum<br>
<br>
Three exciting new Santa Clara Department of Mental Health Service Teams 
and a behavioral Gateway Program have been started to improve problem 
Mental Health (M H) services, according to Pablo Garcia, Adult M H 
Services Manager, who led the speakers at the November, 1996, AMI General 
Meeting.<br>
Kitty Palmer, Health Services Supervisor in the Downtown M H Center 
specializes in problems of the County&#146;s homeless mentally ill. She wrote 
a grant proposal to H.U.D. last year requesting $2.4 million to begin a 
multi-service Homeless Team.. It was approved and will provide a full 
array of needed services focused on homeless disabled individuals in the 
County with Mental Health as the lead agency. The M H Team will promote 
more collaborative homeless efforts with Drug and Alcohol, and Public 
Health Departments, plus Social Services and the Veterans Administration. 
More rental subsidies and a post hospitalization component are included 
in the funding.<br>
The Team will service the homeless population who live on the streets or 
other inappropriate places and those staying in emergency shelters, who 
are disabled, mentally ill, have alcohol and drug abuse problems or the 
dual diagnosis of mental illness and substance abuse, or AIDS, or Post 
Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br>
Transitional Housing now has rental subsidies for 28 beds, with residents 
paying up to one third of their income. Emergency Housing Consortium has 
given the Homeless Team 25 additional bed spaces and Julian Street Inn, 
35 more.<br>
A new post-hospitalization shelter will offer a clean, safe environment 
for homeless individuals requiring on-going care after release from 
emergency rooms or a hospital. The plan is for a two-week stay. A public 
health nurse has been assigned.<br>
The Homeless Team will have a total of 11 members, including a public 
health nurse, a rehab counselor, a social worker from adult protective 
and social services, and a part time physician, plus 2.5 positions 
contracted through the VA.<br>
Referrals to the Homeless Team are through the emergency shelters or by 
contacting the Homeless Team Supervisor, Kitty Palmer, 408-299-8657.<br>
Lewis Pollard, recently the Supervisor of the East Valley Mental Health 
Department, is now Supervisor of the new Mobile M H Team at ACCESS. His 
new Team is a pilot project to help divert mentally ill people with minor 
offenses away from incarceration in the jail system in collaboration with 
City of San Jose police. The target group consists of those who have 
committed a minor offense or nuisance misdemeanor, such as trespassing, 
disturbing the peace, or not paying for public services. The Mobile M H 
Team is funded until July first for three people per day (one during the 
day and two on the evening shift) seven days a week. The team will be 
staffed by social workers with masters degrees, licensed clinical social 
works or MFCC&#146;s. The organization will be operated by the County Mental 
Health Department as a unit of their ACCESS (Acute Crisis Care and 
Entrance to System Services) program.<br>
In answer to questions, Pollard said, &#147;The Mobile M H Team will attempt 
to contact family members or others in the clients&#146; support system as 
needed and as appropriate,&#148; Also regarding location, he said, &#147;The team 
will spend most of its time with police radio contact cruising Central 
and East San Jose streets. It remains to be seen whether they will have 
time for inside work as well.&#148;<br>
Pollard observed that it would be impractical to relate at first to all 
of the County&#146;s police districts so they are beginning in San Jose&#146;s 
highest need areas and will try to set up procedures to work with the 
local police, street people and the public there.<br>
As to the number of people who potentially could be diverted from jail, 
he estimates that from 500 recent arrests made in a three day period, 
including approximately 60 misdemeanor arrests, about 34 could have been 
diverted. These are people whose behavior would usually lead to an arrest 
but if linked with Mental Health could avoid jail. Pollard&#146;s number is 
408-885-6210 for more information exchange if needed.<br>
The traditional M H approach in dealing with younger clients consists of 
separating those under 18 years of age from adults (18 or over). The two 
groups have very different guidelines for M H services. Young adults 
frequently need something in between. A committee was set up two years 
ago to study transitional M H services under the co-chairmanship of Jo 
Gampon, Adult Services Director, and Nancy Pe&ntilde;a, Ph.D., Family and 
Children&#146;s Director, including contract and other agencies serving the 
population. Their work has resulted in forming a new group, called The 
Young Adult Transition Team (YATS) which will be led by Kim Flatmo, 
Health Services Supervisor, at the Fair Oaks M H Center, 408-733-2760.<br>
Along with Kim Flatmo as Supervisor, YATS has a staff of five 
professionals. Key characteristics required of the team members are 
understanding young persons&#146; problems and enjoying working with them. The 
team&#146;s goals are to, &#147;Stick by you to help you think about your options 
about medications, friendships, recreations and leisure, money benefits, 
health, housing, school work and family.&#148; A young person would not be 
included in YATS unless he or she has no connected family, has housing 
problems and no resources. <br>
Garcia added that the YATS has been talking to the Social Security 
Administration about addressing the problem of transition coverage for 
young people going from the hospital or jail to the community. He 
contacted Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for help and hopes that AMI will help 
here as well.<br>
The Department of Alcohol and Drug Services has been moving to a managed 
care model to maximize its resources and render broader behavioral care. 
Meg Paris, Ph.D., Health Services Supervisor, described a new program 
which will be a collaborative effort between M H and Drug and Alcohol to 
provide a single point of entry into the managed health care system for 
adults with behavioral problems who need help. It will be called the 
Gateway Program. </tt></p>
<p><strong><tt>The Gateway Program under Julianna Brooks, MSW</tt></strong><tt> has been established to 
provide Chemical Dependency telephone information on County services and 
screening for referral to County resources for drug and alcohol treatment 
and education. It will also serve as a central data collection unit of 
callers seeking such information and treatment.<br>
</tt><strong><tt>The Chemical Dependency Screening and Referrals will operate five working 
days a week, from 8 AM to 10 PM and can be reached at (408) 885-5790. 
</tt></strong><tt>Case Managers will handle the most difficult cases. Four clinical 
positions are funded, with one being a transferee from the ACCESS 
program.</tt></p>
<p><tt>All the staff will be Alcohol and Drug people, where the funding comes 
from, rather than Mental Health.<br>
</tt><strong><tt>General Chemical Dependency information collection and services 
information will operate on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week and can be 
reached at (800) 488-9919</tt></strong><tt> with roll over to ACCESS 24 hour services 
between 10 PM and 8 AM or on holidays and weekends.</tt></p>

<p>These needles are made in the USA of a natural finish wood 
(maple or birch). The more you use them, the more 
&quot;conditioned&quot; they will become! The natural oils from wool, and 
also from your skin, will help create a soft finish over time. 
Keep them behind your ear (like a pencil) between cable twists 
to help the finish even more. </p>

    <h3>&quot;Unless they become significantly more frugal, many
    members of the Baby Boom generation will be forced to accept
    dramatically lower standards of living during retirement, or
    else forego retirement altogether. </h3>
    <p>&quot;In the worst case scenarios, Baby Boomers are saving
    less than one-tenth of what is required to avoid a
    potentially precipitous decline in their standard of living
    after retirement. </p>
    <p>&quot;Realistic assumptions about the fiscal outlook for
    the twenty-first century imply the savings crisis is far

<hr>

<p><b><i>WHETHER YOU HAVE</i></b> a retirement plan or not,
chances are you've given some thought lately to the subject of
retirement ... given all the talk, who can avoid it? </p>

<p>We're thinking about it, too. And we're doing something about
it. </p>

<p>Too many of today's retirement plans simply don't meet the
needs of business owners and their employees. Investment choices
are limited or perform poorly. Service is often spotty.
Information is hard to come by. Regulations are confusing and
constantly proliferating. </p>

<p>With obstacles like these, it's no wonder employees aren't
saving more. </p>

<p align="center">And that's where our real concern comes in.
None of us is getting younger. And in matters of investment... </p>

<h3 align="center">...time is of the essence.</h3>

<p>Creating a retirement nest egg takes time. And time is rapidly
running out for a significant portion of our population. For all
these reasons we've designed WealthTrack to precisely address the
shortfalls of so many retirement plans in place today. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>INVESTMENTS THAT PERFORM</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Face it. With a BEWILDERING number of investment options in
the marketplace today, employers and participants are paralyzed
by too many choices. We've made it elegantly simple. WealthTrack
offers two smart and simple choices: </p>

<ul>
    <li>You can choose from among the top retirement plan money
        managers in the nation, carefully screened and monitored
        by WealthTrack's senior investment professionals. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>OR</b> </p>

<ul>
    <li>You can select from a list of no-load mutual funds
        defined by Morningstar as the nation's most consistent
        top long-term performers. </li>
</ul>

<p>We reduced a staggering array of choices to those few money
managers who are among the best on the planet. We work with you
to tailor the mix of funds to fit your plan's specific investment
objectives. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>EMPLOYEE EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>We get the employee's attention by introducing them to
financial realism. Our education materials get right to the point
seeking to motivate employees to take personal responsibility for
their financial futures--NOW. </p>

<p>We begin our education process with pre-enrollment materials
that include work sheets to help employees determine how much
money they'll need to retire. We build on this information in our
employee enrollment meetings conducted by our marketing
representatives in your work place. </p>

<p>And our quarterly newsletters reinforce three main messages:
it takes TIME, MONEY, and MANAGED RISK to achieve retirement goals. </p>

<p>We know that employees are more likely to maximize their
retirement investments if they are kept well informed about their
accounts. That's why we've designed our quarterly participant
statement to summarize investment activity and the performance of
each investment choice. </p>

<p>We also offer a 24-hour voice response system that will
provide full on demand account information to your employees. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>OPERATIONAL SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>We know it's not easy to move a retirement plan. But
WealthTrack makes it both economically worthwhile and easy. Our
extensive use of technology markedly reduces administrative time.
And because it's available to your third-party record keeper, it
can reduce their bills to you as well. </p>

<p>You and all plan participants have 24 hour-a-day electronic
access to updated data on every plan account and all plan assets.
Quarterly, simple-to-read, statements for, participants break out
all participant investments by fund and also show a current asset
allocation profile of their entire retirement account. </p>

<p>WealthTrack's proprietary payroll deduction software automates
the tracking of all employee contributions and investment
elections, a huge reduction in labor for your office. And to
bring WealthTrack to your firm, we field a dedicated and able
team of administrative, operational and marketing staff to work
with your people to make the transfer as flawless as possible. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Where there are pension plans, there are details--and usually
lots of them. We handle them with ease. Be they custody,
administrative or trustee services, you get the support and
results you expect from a top line firm. </p>

<p>Through TrustMark, we give your third-party administrator easy
access to the information needed to complete all regulatory tests
and reports. And we've seen to it that our educational programs
and investment choices meet 404(c) requirements. </p>

<p>We deliver these services with a strong knowledge of your
legal and fiduciary responsibilities so you can be assured your
pension plan is in compliance with current and evolving
government standards. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>AFFORDABILITY</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The WealthTrack program is affordably priced in accord with
the size of your plan. All WealthTrack clients receive our
comprehensive package of services including: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Plan Management &amp; Consultation Services. </li>
    <li>Investment Management Services. </li>
    <li>Employee Education &amp; Communications Programs. </li>
    <li>Daily Account Valuation Services. </li>
    <li>Custody &amp; Trustee Services. </li>
</ul>

<p>Everything you and your plan need in one experienced team,
supported by the best technology in the business and focused
aggressively on ensuring that your employees get the support they
need to prepare financially for a successful retirement. </p>

<h3>Master Custody and Trustee Services</h3>

<p><img src="images/pookline.gif" width="722" height="13"> </p>

<p>Copper Mountain Trust Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Copper Mountain Financial Group, has grown from an asset
base of only $119 million to over $4 billion in eight years
because it provides the very highest quality custody, trustee and
administrative services available in the Northwest. Copper
Mountain Trust Corporation is a boutique and we are in this
business to stay. We feel strongly that the decision to employ a
particular master custodian/trustee should be based upon the
custodians commitment to service, depth and experience,
responsiveness, and innovation. </p>

<p>Copper Mountain is known for: </p>

<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Focus</strong></em><strong>.</strong>
        Providing trustee and custody services for all types of
        retirement plans is our only business. We are not forced
        to contend with sharp cuts in manpower and budgets
        because of poor decisions made elsewhere in the
        organization&#151;an inherent problem with our bank
        competition. All our capital and human resource talent is
        focused on providing the best available service. </li>
    <li><em><strong>Depth and Experience</strong></em>. Our
        administrative team has over 70 years of combined ERISA
        and Taft-Hartley experience, including years in
        Washington, DC working with the IRS and DOL on retirement
        plan issues. Operationally, our systems are state-of-the-art.
        Our ability to handle complex transactions is equal or
        superior to our competition. </li>
    <li><em><strong>Flexibility</strong></em>. We conform to the
        needs of our clients. For instance, should you require a
        special report prepared, or a wire sent in one day, you
        will find us responsive and the need taken care of
        quickly. </li>
    <li><em><strong>Innovative and Proactive</strong></em>. Our
        work on the establishment of strategic relationships
        which bring our clients world class services, such as the
        Bank of New York Security Lending Program, is an example
        of the creative ways we assist our clients. We use advanced
        information technology, including the Internet, to
        provide a high level of service. </li>
</ul>

<p>It is interesting to note what has happened to custody
services within the banking community. The October 18, 1993 issue
of Pension and Investments quotes Michael Costa, principal of
master trust consultants, MLC Associates, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;There&#146;s been a general decline in the quality
    of administrative services provided to sponsors in the market
    and clients are perceiving it.&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article further states that Mr. Costa...</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;...has helped sponsors in a number of searches for
    new custodians this year. Many decided to retain their
    present service provider not because they really like the
    service they&#146;re getting, but after looking at the market
    they don&#146;t see anything much better.&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fed up with the decline of your Banks service level? Going
through another Bank merger? Things are different at Copper
Mountain. Copper Mountain Trust Corporation is committed to the
master custody and trustee business. It is our only business. All
our capital and human resource talent is focused on providing the
best available service. We must and do excel. </p>

<h3>IMPORTANT NOTES:</h3>

<p>(1) Performance on all funds in existance as of January 1,
1996. </p>

<p>Performance data quoted on the commingled trust funds is
historical and includes changes in unit/share price and
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains (if any). Data quoted
represents past performance and does not guarantee future
results. Future returns and principal value may fluctuate so that
an investor's units/shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or
less than the original cost. No investment in any of the funds is
insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government including the FDIC.
Ownership of these commingled trust funds is limited to
tax-exempt retirement accounts of Copper Mountain Trust
Corporation. </p>

<p>Because account fees can vary, performance of the commingled
funds does not reflect management fees and expenses that are paid directly
by accounts invested in the Fund. The Stable Asset, Fixed Income,
Money Market, International, and S&amp;P 500 Funds have invested,
at the discretion of the advisor (Copper Mountain Trust
Corporation), in other commingled trust or mutual funds that have
the same investment objective as commingled trust fund. During
periods that Copper Mountain's commingled trust fund invests in
other funds, the performance data shown represents the
performance of the underlying funds and reflects all fees and
expenses of that fund. </p>

-----------
This question and answer list is given in the hope that it is useful, but with no
express or implied warranty for accuracy, usefulness, up-to-date-ness, or 
anything else.  Use the information contained in this list at your own risk.  
Before investing in any mutual fund, be sure to read the latest prospectus for
the fund in its entirety.  This FAQ should NOT be used in place of competent 
advice from investment, accounting and legal professionals.  This FAQ applies
to mutual funds in the USA - most things are likely to differ elsewhere.
...........................................................................
1:  What is a mutual fund?

A:  A mutual fund, or investment company, is a corporation or partnership
    which makes investments and passes gains, losses, and taxability
    through to its shareholders or partners.

2:  Why do people use mutual funds?

A:  (1) Mutual funds provide diversification, since a fund typically
        owns a few dozen to hundreds of securities.
    (2) Mutual funds, by pooling funds from many investors, can hire
        investment managers less expensively, since it does not cost
        twice as much (in research, brokerage fees, etc.) to run a
        fund that is twice as large.
    (3) Mutual fund investment managers are subject to frequent reviews
	by various publications.  This means that information useful
        for selecting a mutual fund is easier to find than information
	useful for selecting one's own investment manager.

3:  Are there any disadvantages to using a mutual fund?

A:  (1) All mutual funds charge management, brokerage, and marketing
	expenses.  These expenses vary from fund to fund.
    (2) Buying mutual fund shares at the wrong time can subject the
	buyer to earlier than normal payment of taxes.

4:  What is a &quot;closed-end fund&quot; vs. an &quot;open-end fund&quot;?

A:  A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares outstanding and is
    traded just like other stocks on an exchange or over the counter.
    The more common open-end funds sell and redeem shares at any time
    directly to shareholders.  Sales and redemption prices of open-end
    funds are fixed by the sponsor based on the fund's net asset value;
    closed-end funds may trade a discount (usually) or premium to
    net asset value.

5:  What is &quot;net asset value&quot;?

A:  The net asset value (NAV) is the value of the fund's underlying
    securities.  It is calculated at the end of the trading day.
    Any open-end fund buy or sell order received on that day is traded
    based on the net asset value calculated at the end of the day.
    A few funds calculate net asset value at more frequent intervals
    and process trades at those values.

6:  A fund is &quot;closed&quot;.  Is that the same as a closed-end fund?

A:  No.  Some open-end funds are closed to new investors because the
    fund manager feels that it cannot be as effective with a very
    large amount of money.  This typically happens with funds that
    invest in small companies.  The open-end format remains the same,
    but investments are not accepted from those who do not already
    have accounts.

7:  What expenses are there for a mutual fund?

A:  (1) Closed-end funds charge annual expenses for research and
	trading expenses.  To buy and sell closed-end fund shares,
	the investor must usually pay additional brokerage fees, unless
	the investor finds someone to buy from or sell to directly.
    (2) Open-end funds charge annual expenses for research and trading
	expenses.  In addition, they sometimes charge the following:
	(a) A front end load or sales charge.  These vary from 1% to
	    8.5% subtracted from the amount paid and are usually used
            to pay commissions to brokers and financial advisors who
            sell the funds.  Very large investors can sometimes get
            discounts on the front end loads.  Currently, fund sponsors
            determine loads, but the SEC is proposing a rule to allow
            brokers and other salespeople to discount loads.
	(b) A redemption fee, deferred sales charge, or back end load.
	    These work the same way as front end loads, but are charged
	    when you redeem shares.  In many cases, they decline or
            disappear after a long enough holding period.
	(c) A Rule 12b-1 fee.  Used to pay marketing expenses, which
	    means either commissions or advertising expenses.  This is
	    a fee that adds to the annual expenses; it may be as large
	    as 1.25% per year.  Declining back end loads are common
            in funds with large 12b-1 fees.
	A mutual fund that has neither (a) nor (b) is generally referred
	to as a no-load fund.  No-load funds are generally not sold
	through brokers or financial advisors, but are sold directly to
	investors.  Many advertise in business and financial periodicals.
	All of the above expenses for open-end funds are described on
	the first or second page of the prospectus in a standardized
	form.  Brokerage fees paid by the fund in its trading activity
        are _not_ normally included in such expense tables as they are
        usually accounted for in the cost of securities bought.

8:  What are typical expenses of a mutual fund?

A:  Stock funds tend to be the most expensive, with annual expenses
    ranging from 0.2% to 3.0% with most between 1.0% and 1.5%.  Small
    company and international funds tend to be more expensive.  Bond
    fund expenses range from 0.2% to 2.0%, with most around 1.0%.  Money
    market funds tend to be the least expensive, ranging from about
    0.2% to 1.0%.  See a later answer for a more detailed description
    of these funds.  Note that some funds, particularly money market
    funds, waive expenses for a limited time to boost yield (and make
    good ad copy).  About one half of stock and bond funds have loads
    (front or back end), but money market funds do not normally have
    loads, though some have 12b-1 fees.

9:  Can mutual fund performance be guaranteed?

A:  No.  As many funds state, past performance is no guarantee of
    future results, and the fund shares are not backed or guaranteed
    by the FDIC or other government agency.  Note that while some
    funds buy government backed securities, that is not the same as
    backing the market value of the fund shares.

10: What is a &quot;prospectus&quot;?

A:  It is a document which an open-end fund, or newly issued closed-end
    fund, is required to provide to investors.  Funds say that investors
    should read it carefully before investing or sending money.  A
    prospectus contains descriptions of:

    (1)  fees, in a standardized format
    (2)  investment objective
    (3)  some financial data
    (4)  investment methods, risk description
    (5)  investment manager and compensation
    (6)  how to buy shares
    (7)  how to sell shares, including signature guarantee requirements
    (8)  dividend and capital gain distributions
    (9)  other services

11: What is a &quot;statement of additional information&quot;?

A:  It is a document that is designed to be read along with the
    prospectus; however, it is not required to be given to investors
    before or after they invest (i.e. investors have to ask for it).
    It contains information such as brokerage selection, description
    of the fund's investment adviser, etc.

12: What is a &quot;signature guarantee&quot;?

A:  It is a guarantee by a financial institution that your signature
    is genuine and the financial institution accepts liability for any
    forgery.  It is typically required for large or unusual redemptions
    of open-end mutual funds, though some funds require it for all
    redemptions.  At many funds, the guarantor must be a commercial
    bank or NYSE member brokerage firm; some funds accept savings and
    loan associations or credit unions (be careful, some savings and
    loan associations have bank-like names).

13: What are &quot;dividend distributions&quot;?

A:  A mutual fund may receive dividend or interest income from the
    securities it owns; it is required to pay out this income to its
    investors.  Most open-end funds offer an option to purchase
    additional shares with the distributions.  Dividend distributions
    are often made monthly or quarterly, though many funds make
    distributions only yearly.

14: What are &quot;capital gain distributions&quot;?

A:  A mutual fund may, in the process of trading, realize capital
    gains.  These must be distributed to investors.  As with dividends,
    there is usually the option to reinvest in additional fund shares.
    Capital gain distributions generally occur late in the year, but
    some funds make additional distributions at other times.  Funds
    with high turnover of securities often make significant capital
    gain distributions every year, while funds with low turnover of
    securities may accumulate unrealized gains for several years before
    making a large capital gain distribution.  Also, funds that are
    increasing in size tend to make smaller capital gain distributions
    because they buy more than they sell, while funds decreasing in size
    tend to make larger capital gain distributions because they sell
    more than they buy.

15: What else is there to know about distributions?

A:  A distribution lowers the net asset value of the fund by the
    amount of the distribution.  The shareholder does not actually
    lose money because of the distribution, since s/he gets cash or
    additional shares to compensate for the lower net asset value.
    Distributions have important tax consequences as detailed later.

16: What is the difference between yield and return?

A:  Do not confuse the two terms.
    Return is sometimes called total return.  The formula for total return
    (ignoring any taxes paid on gains and income during the holding period) is:
	TR=((Ending Market Value)/(Beginning Market Value))-1

    Yield is a very different number --- it is prospective
    not retrospective.  It is a measure of income not
    capital gains.  It is usually associated with debt not
    equity.  For instance, the yield quoted on a bond will almost never
    be the same as the total return realized after the bond
    matures or is sold.

17: What do mutual funds invest in?

A:  Almost anything.  There are funds that invest in almost anything
    an investor could want to invest in.  The most common types are
    described below.

    (1) Money market funds:  these try to maintain a constant (usually
    $1) NAV per share (though they cannot guarantee that), while
	yielding dividends from their investments in short term debt
	securities.  They offer very low risk, but usually low long
	term return.  Most restrict investments to the top two (out
	of four) Moody's and Standard and Poor ratings for short term
	debt; some (including national government only funds) restrict
	themselves to only the top rating, providing a bit of extra
	credit safety, usually at a slightly lower yield.  Most also
	invest in repurchase agreements (repos) collateralized by short
	term debt securities; these are subject to credit or fraud risk
	of the other party in the repo (regardless of the credit risk
	of the securities being repoed).  Their market value is NOT
	insured by the FDIC or other government agency.  Enough defaults
	in the fund's securities can cause it to be unable to maintain
	its constant NAV.

	(a) Regular funds:  invest in short term debt of all types.
	(b) Government funds:  invest only in national government or
	    government agency debt or repos involving such debt.
	    Slightly lower credit risk than regular funds.
	(c) Treasury funds:  invest only in direct obligations of the
	    national government or repos involving these securities.
	    Lowest credit risk and dividend distributions are exempt
	    from state income taxes in most states.
	(d) Municipal funds:  invest only in debt of state or local
	    governments.  For most individuals, dividend distributions
	    are exempt from national income taxes.
	(e) Single state municipal funds:  invest only in debt of
	    one state or its political subdivisions.  For most individuals,
	    dividend distributions are exempt from national income
	    taxes and that state's income taxes.  Note that a single
	    state fund is usually less diversified than a regular municipal
	    fund and might be considered riskier for this reason.

    (2) Bond funds.  These invest in longer term debt securities.
	Thus the short term risk is greater than the infinitesimal
	risk of the money market.  But returns are usually higher.
	Their NAVs may fluctuate due to both interest rate risk and
	defaults.  Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not
	mature; they trade to maintain their stated future maturity.
	The types of debt are similar to those of money funds (but
	longer term); however, futures and options are sometimes used
	for hedging purposes.  The other classifications are described
	below:

	Time to maturity, interest rate risk:

	(a) Short term:  usually less than 5 years maturity.  Interest
	    rate risk is low.
	(b) Long term:  up to 30 year average maturity.  Interest rate
	    risk is high.
	(c) Mortgage backed securities:  have some unusual interest rate risks.
	    When interest rates rise, they lose value like other bonds.
	    When interest rates fall, homebuyers refinance, causing them
	    to prepay old mortgages, which in turn causes bonds backed
	    by these mortgages to be called.  In addition, when rates rise,
	    the MBSs extend due to slower prepayments --- thus
	    their duration goes up with interest rates and the bonds lose
	    money at an accelerating rate.  When rates fall the prepayments
	    speed up and the bond gains money at an ever slower rate.  This
	    property is called Negative Convexity.  It is also a gross
	    over-simplification.  There are MBSs with positive convexity.
	    A 14 year old 13% MBS's prepayments are functionally independent
	    of rate moves for example, also prepayment risk is shuffled all
	    over the place in CMOs.

	    The compensation paid to MBS holders for the negative convexity
	    is in higher yield.  Basically the buyer of a mainstream MBS is
	    betting that rates will not change too much (that interest rate
	    volatility will be lower than the volatility implicit in the
	    price).  Over time this is true.  MBS indices have outperformed
	    Treasuries in all but a couple of the last 12 years.
	(d) Adjustable rate:  this type of fund is like other mortgage
	    backed funds, but it invests in adjustable rate mortgages.
	    Therefore, the two sided interest rate risk faced by fixed
	    rate mortgage backed bonds in considerably reduced.  However,
	    the interest income will fluctuate widely, even though the
	    principal value is more stable.  Since most adjustable rate
	    mortgages have caps on how high the rate can go (typical
	    limits are a 2% increase during a year and 6% increase during
	    the life of the loan), risk increases if interest rates
	    increase quickly or by a large amount.
	(e) Target maturity:  the few funds in this category buy only
	    bonds of the given maturity date.  Thus one can actually
	    hold these to maturity.

	Credit risk:

	(a) Investment grade:  restricted only to bonds with low to
	    medium-low credit risk (national government bonds are
	    usually considered lowest risk).  This generally means the
	    fourth highest Standard and Poor's or Moody's rating
	    (S&amp;P BBB or Moody's Baa).  Some funds have higher standards.
	(b) High yield or junk:  buys bonds of any credit rating,
	    seeking maximum interest yield at a greater risk of default.

    (3) Stock funds.  These invest in common and/or preferred stocks.
	Stocks usually have higher short term risk than bonds, but
        have historically produced the best long term returns.
	Stock funds often hold small amounts of money market investments
	to meet redemptions; some hold larger amounts of money market
	investments when they cannot find any stock worth investing in
	or if they believe the market is about to head downward.
	Some of the possible investment goals are described below.
	They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

	(a) Growth.  These funds seek maximum growth of earnings and
	    share price, with little regard for dividends.  Usually
	    tend to be volatile.
	(b) Aggressive growth.  Similar to growth funds, but even more
	    aggressive; tend to be the most volatile.
	(c) Equity income.  These funds are more conservative and seek
	    maximum dividends.
	(d) Growth and income.  In between growth funds and income funds,
	    they seek both growth and a reasonable amount of income.
	(e) Small company.  Focuses on smaller companies.  Usually of the
	    growth or aggressive growth variety, since smaller companies
	    usually don't pay much dividends.
	(f) International.  Focuses on stocks outside the USA, generally
	    investing in many nations' companies.
	(g) Country or regional funds.  These funds buy stocks primarily
	    in the designated country or region.
	(h) Index funds.  These funds do no management, but just buy some
	    index, like the Standard and Poor 500.  Some index funds,
	    particularly those emulating indices with large numbers of
	    stocks such as the Wilshire 4500 or Russell 2000, emulate
	    the index by buying a subset with similar industry mix,
	    capitalization, price/earnings ratio, etc.  Expenses are
	    usually very low.
	(i) Sector funds.  These funds buy stocks only in one industry.
    	    Usually considered among the riskiest stock funds, though
	    different sectors tend to have different levels and types
	    of risk.

    (4) Balanced funds.  By mixing stocks and bonds (and sometimes other
	types of assets) a balanced fund is likely to give a return
	between the return of stocks and bonds, usually at a lower
	risk than investing in either alone, since different types of
	assets rise and fall at different times.  An investor can create
	his/her own balanced fund by buying shares of his/her favorite
	stock fund(s) and his/her favorite bond fund(s) (and other funds,
	if desired) in the desired allocation.
        (a) Regular balanced funds:  These funds usually hold a fixed
	    or rarely changed allocation between stocks and bonds.
	(b) Asset allocation funds:  These funds may switch to any
	    allocation, usually based on market timing to some degree.
    (5) Multifunds.  These funds buy primarily other mutual funds.
	They choose other funds based on one or more of the investment
	goals outlined above.
	(a) No-management funds:  These funds hold fixed proportions
	    of other funds.  They are offered by fund companies as
	    cheap balanced funds -- the underlying funds are other
	    funds managed by the same company.  There are generally
	    little or no expenses other than those of the underlying
	    funds.
	(b) Managed funds:  In these funds, a manager picks which other
	    funds s/he believes are managed well.  Sometimes these
	    funds are market timing funds which prefer to leave the
	    stock picking to other managers.  These funds have
	    expenses above and beyond those of the underlying funds.

18: What is a &quot;socially responsible&quot; fund?

A:  In addition to the usual investment goals, these funds restrict
    their investments to whatever they define as socially responsible.
    Such criteria can include:  avoiding military, alcohol, tobacco,
    and gambling industries, preferring companies
    that treat their employees and the environment well.  Different
    funds have different social and investment criteria.

19: Where can I get comparative information on mutual funds?

A:  Brokers and financial advisors offer information, but they
    usually give information only on load funds.  However, many
    periodicals have regular mutual fund review issues:

	Barron's (quarterly)
	Money Magazine (Nov.)
	Business Week (Feb.)
	Forbes (Sept.)
	Fortune (fall)
	Consumer Reports
	Wall Street Journal
	Investors Business Daily
	Morningstar Mutual Fund Report

    In addition, there are many books available on
    mutual fund investing.  Different periodicals and books use
    different criteria to rate funds.  These periodicals and books
    usually have phone numbers which you can call to get the fund's
    prospectus and other information.  Note that some ratings account
    for loads, while others do not.  Past performance is no guarantee
    of future results of either the fund or the securities markets
    in general.

20: How does buying funds directly compare with buying through a broker?

A:  A load fund usually costs the same whether bought directly or
    through a broker.  A no-load fund can be bought directly at no
    charge; most brokers will charge a commission to buy a no-load
    fund.  Some discount brokers now offer some no-load funds at no
    transaction fees; normally, they receive a portion of the funds'
    annual expenses instead.  Holding funds in a broker may make it
    easier to trade from one fund to another, however.  Closed-end
    funds usually need to be traded through a broker, like regular
    stocks, though some have dividend reinvestment plans.

21: What does family of funds do compared to a single fund?

A:  Families of funds sometimes offer additional services, such as
    telephone switching from one fund to another within the family.
    With load fund families, switching from one load fund to another
    is sometimes allowed without paying a second load.  Some families
    may make bookkeeping easier by listing all of an investor's
    different funds on one statement.  Others reduce expenses by
    sharing services which realize economies of scale.  Note, however,
    that the good advertised performance of one fund in a family
    may or may not be shared by others.

22: What are the tax implications of mutual funds for individuals?

A:  Like shares of any stock, selling mutual fund shares may cause you to
    realize a capital gain or loss.  Mutual funds also distribute dividends
    received and their own realized capital gains, usually at the end
    of the year; these distributions, whether taken in cash or reinvested,
    are taxable (note that the nontaxability of municipal bond funds
    applies only to dividend distributions; capital gain distributions
    are always taxable).  Thus it is often a bad idea to buy a mutual
    fund just before the distribution date, since part of your investment
    will be immediately returned to you as a taxable distribution, resulting
    in you paying taxes much earlier than if you bought just after the
    distribution.  Although the distribution lowers the net asset value
    of your shares, allowing you to &quot;deduct&quot; it when you sell the shares,
    paying taxes sooner rather than later prevents you from gaining
    investment income on the amount that is taxed.  Note that reinvesting
    is considered identical to taking the distribution in cash and
    sending the same amount into the fund as a new investment, so don't
    forget about it when calculating the basis in your account.  When
    selling, it is best to know the different methods of calculating
    the basis of shares sold ahead of time, since some methods require
    that you designate which shares are to be sold.  For more information,
    call 1-800-TAX-FORM and ask for publications 544, 550, and 564, and
    schedules B and D, but note that tax rules can change since the last
    tax year.

23: What dates are important when investing in mutual funds?

A:  There are several important distribution related dates to be aware of
    when buying and selling mutual fund shares.

    * Declaration date:
	This is the date on which the distribution is declared, followed by...
    * Ex-dividend date:
	This is the date the shares trade without the dividend.
    * Record date:
	Shareholders who own shares on this date will receive the
	distribution on the ....
    * Payment date:
	This is the date on which the dividend is actually paid out.

24: How do I put mutual funds in an IRA?

A:  Most funds have a bank or trust company arranged to be an IRA custodian
    for any IRA shareholders.  If you buy the fund directly, using this
    custodian, you must use a different application available from the fund
    company.  The custodian usually charges $10 to $15 per fund account
    per year.  This is a significant expense for small accounts, not too
    significant for larger accounts.  Alternatively, you can open a
    brokerage account IRA and purchase mutual funds within that.  This
    would be similar to using a broker to buy funds normally, but incurs
    a single IRA custodian fee (usually $25 to $50).  Custodian fees,
    but not loads or commissions, may be paid separately from the
    contribution, and may be separately tax deductible.  Call 1-800-TAX-FORM
    and ask for publication 590 and form 8606 for general IRS information
    about IRAs (but note that tax rules can change since the last tax year).
    Note that the tax issues of distributions as detailed previously don't
    affect IRA accounts.

25: What are the various forms of mutual fund account registration?

A: The way in which your mutual fund account is registered is an important
   factor in estate planning.  The disposition of property or assets after
   the death of an individual is often governed by the way that
   property or account is titled.  Listed below are descriptions
   for three common forms of mutual fund account registration.
   THESE DESCRIPTIONS ARE FOR GENERAL REFERENCE ONLY.
   SEEK COMPETENT LEGAL ADVICE FOR YOUR LOCALE AND CIRCUMSTANCES!

   Sole Ownership:
   Individual registration is the simplest form of ownership because
   one person has absolute control of the property.  Owner must plan for
   transfer of the account when he/she dies; commonly done with a will.
   Otherwise state rules of succession and state inheritance laws dictate
   disposition of account upon death.

   Joint Tenant:
   Most common form of ownership involving 2 or more individuals.  Each person
   owns an individual interest in the entire account.  Consequently, income
   generated from the account is owned equally by all of the parties involved in
   the joint tenancy.  Right of survivorship dictates that upon the death of a
   joint tenant, the account immediately and automatically passes to the
   surviving owner(s).  Joint tenants do not have to be related individuals.

   Tenants In Common:
   Differs from joint tenancy in several ways.  Tenants in common each own a
   specific portion of the account.  If no specific allocation is made
   (e.g. two-thirds/one-third or one-half/one-half), the account is said to be
   equally divided among all of the tenants.  Income earned on the account
   is divided based upon the specific allocation of ownership.  As in joint
   tenancy, tenants in common do not have to be related individuals.

   There are no survivorship rights for assets held in tenancy in common.  Upon
   the death of one of the tenants, the assets will pass to whomever the
   decedent names in a will.

   Note:
   Community property is a specific form of registration that is only
   available in certain states.  The following states are community
   property states:

	Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas,
	Washington and Wisconsin

   In community property states it may be advantageous
   to have title held as community property (when that
   is appropriate) rather than joint tenants or tenants in common
   because the basis (cost) of the inherited half is set to the
   value of the property at the time one spouse dies.  It is my understanding
   that this basis adjustment does not occur with the other forms of title.
   Get the final word on tax and estate implications regarding specific
   forms of registration from a competent tax or legal professional.

<h3 align="center">Understanding Diversification In A World
Economy</h3>

<p>Many investors are interested in further diversifying their
investments beyond U.S. stocks and bonds. To answer commonly
asked questions about international investing, Copper Mountain
recently interviewed Marcel Houtzager from the Wanger Asset
Management Group. Marcel is the manager of Acorn International
Fund which is one of the funds owned by Copper Mountain's
Commingled International Fund. Here are some of the highlights of
that interview: </p>

<p><strong>Copper Mountain:</strong> Why should an investor
consider international investing? </p>

<p><strong>Wanger Asset Management: </strong>We believe that
compared to 50 to 100 years ago, the U.S. can now be categorized
as a mature economy. That means it is growing more slowly than
many other countries which make up today's emerging markets. We
see more potential for high growth overseas. </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> What does a mature vs. emerging market
economy mean to international investing? </p>

<p><strong>WAM: </strong>The U S. currently represents one-third
of the entire world's economic market, and international markets
represent the remaining two-thirds. Taking into account that many
foreign economies are growing taster than the U.S., their share
of the pie should increase in the coming years. For an investor,
this means that a larger portion of growth investment
opportunities could actually be outside the U.S. Therefore, a
portfolio that is diversified to include domestic and
international markets could be well positioned to take advantage
of growth in both of these markets when it occurs. </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> What is the relationship between U.S. and
International markets? </p>

<p><strong>WAM:</strong> To a certain extent there is a time warp
between what happens in The markets of the U.S. and the rest of
the world. The performance of U.S. and foreign markets are not
synchronized: while some rise, others fall. And U.S. trends don't
show up overseas for a while. By understanding U.S. markets,
we're better prepared to capture opportunities when they appear
overseas. </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> But isn't international investing more
risky? </p>

<p><strong>WAM:</strong> The perception is that international
investing is risky. Actually. we believe that putting all your
investments in just U.S. companies is risky. America's purchasing
power has decreased because the value of the U.S. dollar has
fallen by half against the Japanese Yen. That's why Japanese cars
are more expensive than American cars. We do agree that getting
information about international investments can be more
difficult. That's why it's important to choose a money management
firm that spends time in the countries that they invest in,
getting to know the management and financial situation of those
companies. </p>

<p>There are several ways that an investor can diversify their
portfolio through international exposure. These might include: a
company 401(k) plan investment option, directly through a mutual
fund, or, via an IRA. A good idea is to begin learning more about
how the markets work. On a daily basis you can read your local
newspaper or Wall Street Journal, or watch &quot;The Nightly
Business Report&quot; on TV. Other good sources are the
&quot;Wall Street Week&quot; TV program and financial magazines
like <em>Barron's, The Economist </em>and <em>Money</em>. </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> Thank you Marcel. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/pookline.gif" width="722"
height="13"> </p>

<h3 align="center">Dollar-Cost Averaging. Or, the next best thing
to buying low and selling high.</h3>

<p>The sure-fire way to make money in your investments is to buy
low and sell high Unfortunately, that's easier said than done.
Because no one can predict with 100% certainty when a security is
headed up or down. </p>

<p>However, there is a way to take advantage of market
fluctuations. It's called dollar-cost averaging. </p>

<p>The key to this strategy is to make regular investments, which
is what you currently do in your retirement plan For example. by
contributing $100 a month, your contribution is used to purchase
securities. If the security happens to be at a low price, you'll
buy more shares than when it's at a high price. The benefit of
&quot;buying&quot; a little each month is that at the end of the
year, you will have made your investments at various highs or
lows in the market. Your average investment cost can be lower
than the average price of your entire investment. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/pookline.gif" width="722"
height="13"> </p>

<h3 align="center">Investment Tip</h3>

<p>The more money you contribute to your retirement fund the
faster your fund will grow. The trick is finding ways to make
larger monthly contributions. One way is as close as your garage:
your car. </p>

<p>Instead of buying a new car as soon as your old one is paid
off, consider driving it a few more years and investing that same
amount into your retirement plan. Or consider buying a less
expensive vehicle. </p>

<h3 align="center">Conservative Growth Provides Success</h3>

<p><em>There are many successful methods to managing investments.
One of these is known as a growth style. The following article
was written by George Cohen of Cohen, Klingenstein &amp; Marks,
Copper Mountain's Large Cap Growth Style fund sub-advisor.</em> </p>

<p>Investments can be made in a variety of ways: stocks, bonds,
real estate and many more. Each type has distinctive
characteristics. Stocks and bonds are the two most commonly used
for retirement saving and they are very different from one
another. Bonds promise to pay interest each year, but do not
increase in value over time. Stocks do not promise to pay
anything each year (although most do pay dividends), but the
value of stocks increases over time as the companies behind them
grow. The year-to-year increase in stock prices cannot be
predicted, but historically they have done substantially better
than bonds. Over time the market rewards investors who are willing
to trade short-term uncertainty for superior long-term returns. </p>

<p>And not all stocks are the same &quot;Growth Stocks&quot; are
stocks that have greater potential for high returns than does the
average stock. Along with that goes more short-term uncertainty.
They can be expected to achieve higher returns amid bigger swings
in their prices. But, higher returns are very important for
long-term investing. The power comes from compound interest. A
dollar invested with a 9% return for twenty years grows to $5.60.
A dollar invested at 11% grows to $8.06. To say those returns are
each about 10% would miss something obvious. A little extra
return makes a big difference. And historically, growth stocks
have reliably delivered that little extra return. </p>

<p>And now is a particularly good time for growth stocks, because
the next couple of decades should be a period of above average
growth in America. These factors lead to that conclusion: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The &quot;baby boom&quot; generation that represents the
        biggest group in our population is at the age when they
        are most productive as workers. </li>
    <li>The Cold War is over, so resources are being redirected
        toward economic growth. </li>
    <li>Foreign economies are growing, offering opportunity for
        U.S. exports. </li>
    <li>U.S. businesses are managing themselves with more concern
        for efficiency. </li>
    <li>Government is increasingly concerned with encouraging
        economic growth. </li>
    <li>Technology keeps advancing faster and faster. </li>
</ul>

<p>If there ever was a time to bet on growth stocks, now is it. </p>

<p>Even so, we are not about to put all our money in any one
place. Most of us own a mix of asset types. We think that should
include growth stocks. As you might guess, there is more than one
way to invest in growth stocks. Our approach to growth is the
most conservative. We buy very large, stable, established
companies with growth character-istics. When the price is right,
we buy such companies as: Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Intel,
McDonald's, Bristol-Myers and Campbell Soup. We do not buy small
new firms with untested products. Instead, we buy diversified
companies that should benefit from overall growth in the economy. </p>

<h3>Market Comments</h3>

<p>During the third quarter, both stocks and bonds rose nicely.
July was an ugly month, with stocks down almost 5%, but
persistent worries about accelerating inflation gave way to a
belief that the economy was slowing enough to control prices
without hindering corporate profits. Year to date, the S&amp;P
500 has advanced 13.5%, and the bond market has increased 0.61%.
During the month of September alone, the bond market increased a
whopping (for the bond market) 1.74%. </p>

<p>The bears who were arguing for a return of inflation were
disappointed by evidence that the economy is slowing. However,
that would be a natural consequence of the jump in interest rates
that started in February and peaked in July. </p>

<p>The governmental instrument for controlling growth in the
economy is the Federal Reserve. The Fed wants a slowdown, though
not necessarily a recession, to keep inflation in check. Under
the guidance of Chairman Alan Greenspan, the board's policy is
based on the premise that an economy that grows faster than about
2.25% a year raises the danger of accelerating inflation. They
will keep that target in mind and increase or decrease rates
accordingly. </p>

<p>Our fixed income sub~advisor, Pacific Investment Management
Company (PIMCO), has been arguing throughout the year that the
United States is in the midst of a period of disinflation, and
interest rates are in a secular trend downward because of
pressure on wages, high consumer debt, and weak foreign
economies. As an aside, PIMCO is a great bond manager that has
continually beat the bond index, even when their interest rate
calls were wrong, by using sophisticated trading strategies.
PIMCO is the type of sub-advisor that we hire at Copper Mountain
- the best of the best. </p>

<p>As the economy shows signs of slowing, concern about profit
margins and earnings will likely mount. This just goes to show
that there is no such thing as a worry-free rising market. </p>

<p>We at Copper Mountain share the same concerns as the rest of
you. Our personal retirement assets are invested right beside
yours. We wonder if the stock market is too high, why
international stocks have lagged their U.S. counterparts for the
past two years, and which direction interest rates are going.
Some of us even worry about who will win the elections in
November. But through it all we remain convinced that the most
successful long-term investors are those that allocate their
portfolios among different asset classes and styles, don't try to
time the market, and invest with proven managers with superior
track records over time. </p>

        worked together for many years before founding the firm
        in 1981, George Cohen and Richard Marks met at M.I.T. in
        1961 and later worked together on a number of analytical
        projects using their quantitative skills. <p>Initially,
        Cohen, Klingenstein &amp; Marks developed and marketed
        comprehensive investment management software for money
        managers and consulted on a broad range of projects
        including international asset allocation, options
        valuation, oil price analysis, multi-currency accounting
        and performance measurement. In 1987, the firm began
        managing money which is now its sole business. </p>
        <p>Cohen, Klingenstein &amp; Marks is a
        large-capitalization, growth stock manager with a
        disciplined three-step investment approach. First, a
        top-down economic view is developed, defining the
        character of the portfolio. Second, proprietary
        quantitative screens are run to produce candidates for
        inclusion in the portfolio. Third, traditional
        fundamental analysis is applied to that short list to
        determine the selected stock holdings. </p>
        <p>Cohen, Klingenstein &amp; Marks believes that the next
        couple of decades will favor growth stock investing. Some
        factors leading to that conclusion are the maturing of
        the baby boomers, a group which will be forced to save
        more for their retirement needs; the end of the Cold War,
        which will favorably redirect resources; the opening of
        new financial markets globally; and the acceleration of
        technological and other productivity advances. </p>

        <td>Global Asset Management, Inc. is an international
        equity and bond investment firm. Since its founding in
        1983, it has provided money management and investment
        opportunities for investors worldwide who seek long-term capital
        appreciation. <p>The investment approach of Global Asset
        Management focuses on investing at least 65% of its
        portfolio in equity securities in a minimum of three
        foreign countries, excluding the United States. These
        investments are diversified among countries to reduce the
        effect of downturns in any single country or company. It
        may invest a substantial portion of assets in debt
        securities, but no more than 5% of these debt securities
        will be rated below investment grade. </p>
        <p>Using a top-down, macro economic approach this fund
        manager identifies value in markets, sectors and stocks. By
        first developing a broad analysis of various countries
        and their interest rates and growth, industry sectors are then
        selected that are projected to benefit from economic
        trends. This provides the framework in which to identify specific
        stocks for the portfolio. Stock positions are generally
        held for nine months to two years. </p>
        <p>The diversification that this Fund provides by
        investing in foreign markets offers excellent
        opportunities for growth. Global investing may improve a
        portfolio's return without increasing the risk by gaining
        exposure to markets with higher returns, while reducing
        the effects of any single country's market downturn. </p>
        <p>The Fund managers concentrate on managing assets and
        are strategically located in nine locations worldwide, allowing
        them to conduct ongoing on-site company evaluations. </p>

        <td>Based in Minneapolis, Kopp Investment Advisors is an
        independent money management firm. Utilizing two key operating
        philosophies, Kopp believes it is possible to achieve
        superior results by investing in assets in domestically
        based emerging company growth stocks. These growth stocks
        are defined as having small to medium market
        capitalization and significant potential for accelerated
        earnings growth. Kopp methodically adheres to the basics
        of sound money management - investing in companies, not
        in the stock market - to guide them through their
        five-step analysis and selection process. <p>By employing
        a bottom up quantitative approach, Kopp reviews over 120
        companies that are undervalued in their current business,
        industry sector or historical standards. The fundamental
        analysis for each company selection includes: earnings
        growth, price/earnings ratio, price/sales ratio, and
        R&amp;D spending. Ultimately, the portfolio will consist
        of approximately 30 - 40 stocks. An investment associated
        with this style of management results in stock selections
        that may trade more infrequently because of their smaller
        market capitalization and may therefore have more limited
        public float. Therefore, such an investment may incur
        greater volatility and stock illiquidity than the market
        as a whole. </p>

        <td>Since 1982, Morley Capital Management has pioneered
        the use of managed stable asset portfolios, developing
        the first stable value pooled fund approved by the U.S.
        Comptroller of the Currency. The principal objectives of
        this stable value management style are to provide
        participants with predictable income, capital
        preservation, and low risk to market price volatility.
        Morley achieves these objectives by investing in
        fixed-term investment or insurance contracts issued by
        life insurance companies, banks and other financial
        institutions, and in cash and cash equivalents. <p>To
        achieve stability of asset values, Morley has negotiated
        agreements with all issuers to its commingled funds which
        permit participant transfers or withdrawals to be taken
        at contract value, with no penalties or market-value adjustments.
        Thus, a participant's interest in the find will normally
        be carried at contract value plus accrued interest. </p>
        <p>In addition to reviewing all investment decisions made
        by the institutions to ensure the integrity of the
        investments, Morley utilizes rigorous research, credit
        analysis and diversification programs to minimize and
        spread risk. If rated, investments or issuers must have a
        rating of &quot;A&quot; or better by Moody's, Standard
        &amp; Poor's, or Duff &amp; Phelps at the time of
        purchase. The current average credit quality 6f Morley's
        commingled funds is AA+. </p>

        <td>Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) is a
        leading institutional fixed income money manager. Established
        in 1971 as a subsidiary of Pacific Mutual, PIMCO offers
        investment management of employee benefit plans,
        endowments and foundations. <p>PIMCO's investment
        philosophy relies on following a portfolio strategy that
        is driven by longer-term sector trends and by avoiding
        extreme swings in maturity/duration of the portfolio. The
        Total Return Fund is an intermediate maturity bond
        portfolio with the objective of maximizing total return
        and minimizing volatility. The Fund has an average
        duration ranging between three and six years and is
        actively managed to seek returns exceeding the bond
        market as a whole. Investments are made in fixed income
        securities and can include obligations of the U.S.
        Government, corporate debt securities, mortgage and other
        asset-backed securities, and money market instruments. </p>
        <p>PIMCO's consistent results stem from their investment
        philosophy and process. With a portfolio consisting of a mixture
        of long and short bonds, and bond quality ranging from A
        to Aa, the performance returns are more steady and the
        volatility factor is greatly reduced.</p>

        incorporating social and environmental values into
        financially sound decisions. It is one of the fastest

        <td>Crabbe Huson is a value-oriented, disciplined
        contrarian money manager. Since their founding in 1980,
        they have consistently followed this highly successful
        investment style. Contrarian investing can be described
        as looking for the most attractive investment
        opportunities in quality companies that have temporarily
        fallen out of favor with the general market. So while
        most money managers view an asset that is rising in price
        as being attractive, Crabbe Huson looks for the asset
        that is declining in price as a potentially attractive
        buying opportunity. <p>Crabbe Huson's experienced
        investment team attentively watches for such
        opportunities. Their objective is to buy securities just
        before they hit their lows and then ride them back up to
        predetermined sell points. This philosophy is applied
        successfully to both large and small-cap equities. </p>

        <td>The Acorn International Fund, founded in 1992 and
        managed by Wanger Asset Management, L.P., is located in Chicago,
        Illinois. This fund seeks long-term capital growth
        through investments in small to medium-sized international companies. <p>The
        managers of this international fund invest at least 75%
        of assets in foreign securities but may invest in corporate
        or government obligations or hold cash or cash
        equivalents. Selected investments are chosen based on
        superior growth potential, financial strength and
        stability, strong management and fundamental value. </p>
        <p>Using a top down approach, the fund looks for
        companies that will benefit from favorable long-term
        social, economic or political trends. The foreign
        securities may be traded in either mature or emerging
        markets and are held for a longer time horizon, at least
        3 to 5 years, to maximize return potential. The portfolio
        is well diversified in a minimum of three countries and
        no one country takes up more than 11% of the investments. </p>
        <p>The diversification that this Fund provides by
        investing in foreign markets offers excellent
        opportunities for growth. Global investing may improve a
        portfolio's return without increasing the risk by gaining
        exposure to markets with higher returns, while reducing
        the effects of any single country's market downturn. </p>

sure it continues to fit your situation. All examples are

    diversification than they could get allocating money on their
    own. Some of these funds keep the proportions allocated
    between different sectors relatively constant, while others
    alter the mix as market conditions change.</p>
</blockquote>

    usually the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. The market's
    beta is always 1.0; a beta higher than 1.0 indicates that, on
    average, when the market rises, the stock will rise to a greater
    extent and when the market falls, the stock will fall to a
    greater extent. A beta lower than 1.0 indicates that, on
    verage, the stock will move to a lesser extent than the

<p>
<font size=2>(TUZLA, FEBRUARY 17)&#151;More than 200 troops of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment, Airborne Battalion Combat Team headed home on Saturday (Feb 17) by helicopter and convoy. They headed for Taszar, Hungary, en route to their home base in Vicenza, Italy. They were the first American combat troops to arrive in Bosnia last year and are also the first to leave.
<p>
They are part of the Southern European Task Force. The remaining 400 troops that arrived here Dec. 18 will leave over the next three days.
<p>
"We were the initial insertion force to provide security to Tuzla Air Base area while the remainder of the heavy forces flowed into the country and could get established," said the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Mike Scaparrotti, 39, of Logan, Ohio. "We did our mission and we did it quite well ... so far without any casualties ... Were ready to go."
<p>
The troops said they were glad to be leaving the cold, snow and boredom to return to their wives, children and girlfriends.
<p>
Were a little bit excited about getting back," said Staff Sgt. Sean Kelly, 28, of Scranton, Pennsylvania. "Am I going to miss it? No, I dont think so. It gets monotonous being away and being on a mission like this where the activity is limited to watching." 
<p>
Kelly said he was buoyed by the gratitude of some Bosnians, who suffered four years of war before the arrival of 17,000 American peacekeepers, scheduled to remain until December. "Some of them seem happy that we came here and that theyve got an opportunity to try and get back on track," he said.
<p>
Staff Sgt. Jose Pizarro, 31, of Ponce, Puerto Rico, also was eager to return home, to his wife, Susu, and two children, Christopher, 5, and Kevin, 2, from whom he was separated during Christmas. The mission was a success, he said, and the troops distinguished themselves.

Johnathan Thornton captured some of the most compelling images of the War by traveling with combat units. His images earned Thornton a Pulitzer Prize nomination, but he was wounded several times and once given no hope for survival. Thornton's photographs document the battles of the Posavina Corridor in northern Bosnia where Serbs pushing toward Sarajevo, engaged in brutal fighting.</p>

<p>
what modern-day gym rat wouldnt get off seeing his pecs plastered across some government temple. get rendered forty feet high in marble, anatomically correct, too. or flex his biceps on his nations postage stamp  knowing millions will flip him over and lick. propaganda. what a rush. 

<p>
it is a dangerous dance they do, the fascist and the eroticist. usually, the boys wind up dead meat  drafted as soldiers into a losing war. or, like the eroticists in hitlers sa, assassinated or ordered into carrying out some viciously dirty work. giving ungrounded boyz lots of power and sexy uniforms can sometimes make em go nuts.

<img src="d_f.gif" width=31 height=33 align=left vspace=3 border=0 hspace=0>ascist regimes cross masculinity with totalitarianism to produce a hybrid of brutal eroticism. god knows what the dictators dudes were up to between the sheets  but the posters, statues and paintings they inspired have given these men a kind of immortality rich in innuendo.
<p>
in <u>the art of the third reich,</u> peter adam writes, they are pin-ups of sexual fantasies. it is surprising that a puritanical regime, which put homosexuals into concentration camps, would celebrate the nude male body to such an extent. this was but one of the many contradictions of the national socialist aesthetic.

<p>
<a href="d_boyz.html"><img src="d_boyz_sm.jpg" width=350 height=145 align=bottom vspace=0 border=0 hspace=0></a>

<p>
in <u>male fantasies,</u> klaus theweleit elaborates on the dictators double-bind: thou shalt love men, but thou shalt not be homosexual. his book examines scores of related topics including the early 20th century german cults which advocated a homoerotic male society  and what became of them as the nazis used, then destroyed the movement.

<p>
yeah, i love a man in a u-ni-form, says the song. and what would tom of finland have drawn had not those fascist boys blown through helsinki in the 40s? but watch it, buddy, next time an aspiring dictator starts recruiting you and your pals. just look at the american military. isnt <u>dont ask, dont tell</u> as much a double bind as the nazis found themselves in?

if youve come this far,<br>youve got the fetish, dude</b><br><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#B3B8A5" size=2><b>
so what is an underwear fetish? is it a bad thing? 
<br><br>
a fetish is defined by psychologists as a form of sexual deviance involving erotic attachment to an inanimate object. in anthropology, a fetish is a magic charm packed with spiritual powers and used in tribal cultures as well as so-called civilized societies. sigmund freud wrote about the fetish in which the savage sees the embodiment of his god. well said, ziggy. 
<br><br>
the phenomenon occurs almost exclusively among men, and the most common fetishes are articles of clothing  most often shoes and underwear.
<br><br>
david sebringsil, at his web site <a href="http://members.aol.com/sebringsil/sex.htm">understanding male sexuality</a>, writes . . .<br><br>
<blockquote>
those with underwear fetishes appear to be about equally divided between those who have a preference for briefs, bikinis and thongs, and those who have a preference for boxer shorts. the group interested in boxer style shorts seem disinterested in other underwear styles, and vice versa. 
<br><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#00BB65" size=4><b>straight, gay or what?</b><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#B3B8A5" size=2><b>
based on internet sites and newsgroup activity, it may appear that underwear fetishes are largely a gay activity, but straights engage in these activities as well. i have visited with very happily married men whose wives not only know about the underwear fetish, but help their husbands pick out underwear that is particularly arousing to them  the underwear is simply part of the overall sexual chemistry between man and wife. 
<br><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#00BB65" size=4><b>trading briefs</b><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#B3B8A5" size=2><b>
one unique activity engaged in my many men with underwear fetishes is underwear trading. this activity appears to take on a particular importance in gay society. the newsgroups are filled with requests by gay men to trade underwear, jock-straps or other similar garments. though there may be straight men who also engage in this activity, i have yet to hear from one. 
<br><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#00BB65" size=4><b>collecting underwear</b><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#B3B8A5" size=2><b>
among underwear traders are specialists. some prefer trading underwear or jockstraps that are new and still in the original packaging, much as someone might collect coins or model trains. they may catalog their collection in detail for other participants to read.  other men, gays primarily, are interested in trading underwear, jockstraps or swimwear that are used. a number of men have admitted to stealing (they call it liberating) these kinds of items from laundry rooms or lockerrooms when they are left unattended. 
<br><br>
</blockquote>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#00BB65" size=4><b>doing the underwear dance</b><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#B3B8A5" size=2><b>
many gay bars have underwear nights in which men dress only in underwear  its the lockerroom gag all over again, but with cool music and a club full of men who share a specific preference.
<br><br>
but whos got time to be judgemental? the underwear fetish is one of those few erotic experiences that all men, straight or gay, share. if youre one, enjoy it. its part of what makes you an individual. and theres lots of other guys out there whove got it too, and dig it  big time.

from fig leaves to spandex, man has been engaged in a coverup ever since adam. styles have changed, but the concept remains the same, whether a codpiece, posing strap, thong, jock or briefs. 
<p>
it began with the loincloth which gave us endless men-in-their-underwear movies  from tarzan to rapa nui. <a href="jungleboy.html">
<img src="jungleboy_sm.jpg" width=115 height=165
align=right vspace=3 border=0 hspace=0 alt=""></a>the loincloth morphed into a skirt in ancient egypt and the western pacific. but out in indonesia, indigenous dudes still tie on a gourd. the bigger the better. 
<p>
<a href="durer.html">
<img src="durer_sm.jpg" width=178 height=76

flash forward to flash gordon and men in tights, reviving the tradition of the codpiece, a middle ages version of a fly for tights that became outrageously elaborate before zippers came along. and, are there flys in batman and robins heavy-duty latex?
<p>

its been a long haul for a simple cloth gadget invented in the name of modesty and comfort. but along the way, mens underwear has evolved into the most provocative piece of clothing in a mans wardrobe. a symbol of secret autoeroticism lurking in the pants of every man. 
<p>
technology has been good to men, providing designers with stretchy new fabrics to get the fit just (ugggh) right and to produce visual effects once available only to the imagination.
<p>
<a href="brief2.html">
<img src="brief2_sm.jpg" width=99 height=161
align=right vspace=0 border=0 hspace=0 alt=""></a>
underwear has always been about high contrast: naked, except for one thing. vulnerable, but muscled to the teeth. being caught with your pants down isnt the bad thing it was once cracked up to be. and by itself, underwear is a worthy costume for modern primal males  whether stalking jungle with boy or stalking underwear party in manhattan with boy. 
<p>
<a href="blinds.html">
<img src="blinds_sm.jpg" width=235 height=155
align=left vspace=3 border=0 hspace=0 alt=""></a>
the underwear fetish is upon us again  but its always been nearby, celebrated throughout the ages in sculpture, photography, movies, illustration and in the current explosion of mens understuff that has grown into a five billion dollar industry.
<p>
from tom cruise dancing in his briefs in risky business to marky mark, snug in his calvins, the underwear fetish is a special flavor of male eroticism.</td>

i have been all over the place when it comes to underwear.
ive tried them all, and i still cant manage to stick to just one kind.  
<br><br>
i originally started, as i think almost all males did, with the standard
hanes and fruit of the loom whitie tighties. i never gave them much thought
until i got into high school, and i realized that they had a few problems:

<ul>
<li>skids were hard to hide.
<spacer type=vertical size=3><font color="#8ba8bd">
<li>they tended to shrink over time.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>the leg hole elastic always lost the crotch battle.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>when you sweat, they stayed sweaty.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>they gave you the most ungodly underwear lines.</ul></td>

<td valign=bottom width=350 align=left>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size=2 color="#AD819F"><b>
it was about 10th grade when i decided that i would begin an undergarment
hunt.  i tried a few different brands and styles.  i think i tried out
a pair of loose cotton boxers, a 3 pack of jockey bikini briefs, several
previously untried types of whities, including a pair of ribbed ones, and
a set of skin on jeans.  
<p>
heres what i learned early on:
<ul>
<li>whitie tighties suck, no matter <i>who</i> <font color="#AD819F">makes them.
<spacer type=vertical size=3><font color="#AD819F">
<li>cotton boxers provide <i>no</i><font color="#AD819F"> support whatsoever. my boys need a home.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>boxers typically fall into the uncomfortable region between just
longer than and just shorter than long enough, and really suck for people 
who arent built like tennis rackets.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>your wee wee tends to fall out through the hole in boxers.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>ribbed whities feel funny on your behind when you walk in loose pants.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>never <i><u>ever</u></i> <font color="#AD819F">wear zipper jeans without skivvies.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>button fly jeans require <i>delicate</i> <font color="#AD819F">handling when closing up.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>denim does not like butt sweat.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>make sure your bikini briefs are <i>your</i> <font color="#AD819F">size. you lose sensation to body parts when theyve been pinched in the elastic of too-tight bikinis.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>cotton bikinis have some of the undesirable sweat properties of whities, but they tend to dry out a bit faster.
<spacer type=vertical size=3>
<li>bikini underwear comes in cool colors and patterns, and they have guys with socks stuffed in their drawers on the box.

i ended up with only jockey bikini briefs after that. i stuck to just cotton at first. nothing too flashy. i became fascinated by the myriad of colors and patterns after a while though. i think it started with the 3 pack of tiger stripes i bought. white, red, blue, with black stripes. i moved into polka dots, waves, and yes, even little fishies. im still rather fond of fishies on my skivvies...
<p>
anyways, during one trip home from college, i found myself once again at the jockey  display. the mannequin had on a pair of the <i>coolest</i> <font color="#55A887">blue and black alligator pattern briefs! i spent the next 10 minutes scavanging through the display to find a tube that contained a pair. 
<p>
i finally found my size in the back of the small section, only to find that they were not all cotton, but were some sort of lycra-polyester mix. what to do? i had never strayed from the 100% cotton sticker before. they were just too cool, so i bought them. never regretted it either. they were very comfortable, held up well, and breathed like a healthy gorilla.
<p>
i began experimenting with the new boxer/briefs. these were cool. the breathability i wanted, the support i need, and the freedom of movement i never had! woo hoo! needless to say, i was hooked.
<p>
these days im a 5 to 6 day-a-week boxer brief wearer. i still like my obnoxious 50-50 jockeys though. i have finally found the freedom women have had all along  the freedom to wear underwear that suits your mood. i have long bbs, short bbs, tight bbs, loose bbs, black, white, gray... too bad they dont come in obnoxious colors and patterns.</td></table>

i loved my new job, but my transfer from downstate to chicago had made for a very stressful year. as christmas approached, i promised myself to do something different for the holidays. rather than remain in the frigid north, i had planned two weeks in a tropical paradise.
<br><br>
i arrived to find most of my stereotypes of the island to be true. the people were friendly, the food was spicy, and the weather was hospitable. but my purpose, at least for the first few days, was to escape the hustle of civilization and enjoy my own company.
<br><br>
i had rented a small house on a secluded stretch of beach on the northern side of the island. at least here, i didn't have to worry about tourist moms and dads squawking about me exposing too much skin in front of their kids. i had this place all to myself. 
<br><br>
as soon as i entered through the beach-house door, i proceeded to strip and then slip into a maroon, skin-tight, high-cut bikini. my crotch grew warm as the silky fabric cocooned my cock and balls. i caressed them gently through the pouch, sending a tingle of excitement all over my body. my instinct told me to release my animal tension, but reason told me that after a few hours in the sun, anything i did later would feel even better.
<br><br>
i rambled out the door and wandered up the beach. it was about two o'clock when i found the perfect spot for my towel. no one was in sight, and the only sounds came from the gulls, the bubbling surf and a radio playing reggae music somewhere in the distance. perhaps i left the radio on in the beach house. i didn't really care. i leaned back, fondled my cock for a while, then let every other muscle in my body relax.
<br><br>
as i lay soaking up the sun, the music seemed to grow louder. that wasn't coming from my place, i though. i opened my eyes to see joe tourist wearing a hawaiian shirt and an oversized hat strolling down the beach with a boom box as big as a small trunk on his shoulder. 
<br><br>
dammit! exactly the kind of thing i wanted to get away from.  i glared at the approaching figure. his pace slowed for a moment. i wanted the invader to feel the arrows that i imagined shooting through his heart. no luck.  he renewed his trek spreading his own towel not more than 30 feet from my own! of all the beaches, why did this joker have to choose mine!
<br><br>
i slumped back in disgust, closed my eyes, and hoped that the intruder would be ripped to shreds by a surf shark.... within moments, i felt the sun's rays being blocked.  opening my eyes, it wasn't a cloud, but the stranger's shadow passing over my face. he crouched down beside me and let the sun pass through again.
<br><br>
i squinted. light brown hair fell onto a golden tan. his body which was once hidden by hibiscus and bermuda shorts was lean and muscular. i could have easily imagined this man on a college swimming team clad in speedos, but instead, he wore a blue, string bikini.
<br><br>
in an instant, my anger turned into lust.  i felt blood rush to my cock, making it swell the fabric of my skimpy pouch. i raised my knee slightly so as not to make my growing hard-on obvious. im sorry, he said. did i
bother you? no, i lied.... the rhythm of his words were slightly colored with an accent. would you happen to have any suntan oil? i forgot mine. sure, i smiled as i handed him a bottle of coconut oil. the idea of sharing the beach was growing more and more appealing.</td>

<TD valign=top width=280 align=left>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size=2 color="#869780"><b><p align=left>
i watched him smooth the oil over his chest and rippled abdomen. his slickened muscles glistened in the sunlight. he smiled sheepishly, would you mind putting some on my back? i hesitated for just an instant. no. i don't mind. this time, i didn't lie. i motioned him over to my towel. 
<br><br>
he lay chest down with his face turned away from me.  kneeling down beside him, i poured the sun-warmed oil into the palm of my hand, massaging the slippery liquid onto his athletic frame. i could feel myself tremble with excitement.
<br><br>
your swim suit is very sexy on you, he began. i'm glad there are men with bodies like yours who arent afraid to show others what they've got. i blushed, feeling the blood boil hotter inside of me. i wondered whether he noticed the hard outline that was straining through my clingy swimsuit. 
<br><br>
he purred as he rolled over onto his side and stared into my eyes for a heartbeat too long. i glanced at his tight, blue bikini to find that it couldn't conceal his fully erect manhood. mesmerized i gazed back at him
 drawing closer by the second.
<br><br>
our oil-covered bodies entwined and slid against each other like greek wrestlers. still partially covered in swimgear, our stiff rods were grinding into each other. my hands meandered down his taught flesh and
caressed his smooth, round backside. my fingers slid under the waistband of his slinky bikini, drawing it down past his thighs. i lowered my face into his crotch and inhaled its steamy musk. 
<br><br>
i buried my nose into his groin and felt his body tense with excitement. my tongue worked around his
razor-smooth balls and up the shaft until it reached the drops of sweet precum oozing out of the head. i licked the sticky beads and continued to probe, test and tease every area of his crotch with my tongue. 
<br><br>
my lips
closed around his throbbing cock and he gently thrust down my longing throat. his grip tightened over my shoulders as his entire body stiffened. he withdrew his spurting cock, but not without filling my mouth with cream. i closed my eyes, savoring and then swallowing his thick wad.
<br><br>
his hands were now fondling my balls, and soon my own bikini was being pulled to my knees. his firm, oil-slicked hand milked my penis while his lips wrapped over it's head. his tongue toyed with the piss slit and made me squirm in blissful agony. i felt familiar pulses from deep within me and knew that i was about to cum. he could tell, too, but only tightened his grip to block the immanent gush of semen. he worked my dick head more intensely, licking and slurping. 
<br><br>
i writhed in the glorious sensation trying to push him away. my cock and balls ached. let go. i moaned. as he freed me i could hear my semen squirting the roof of his mouth. i gasped with pleasure while he gulped down each spurt. 
<br><br>
i pulled out of his mouth letting the last few contractions spray cum on my chest and abdomen. are you
trying to drown me? he grinned, wiping the few escaping drops of cum from his lips back into his mouth. i was too exhausted from the intensity of my ejaculation to answer. i could only raise my head to watch him slowly lick the remaining drops to semen from my torso and feel his tongue dance around my nipples.
<br><br>
cum breath, i groaned. we both laughed. do you have any plans for tonight? he asked. i lied for a second time, telling him no. the beach barbecue at the clubhouse could wait. as we went to gather our things, a bottle of tanning oil dropped from his shorts. he gave me a mischievous grin. i put my arm around his shoulders and walked with him to his cottage.

<FONT face="arial, helvetica" SIZE=2 color="#C3B873"><b>when structure, the clothing chain, held its second annual underwear model contest, thousands entered. most were not models, mind you. they were college guys, corporate worker bees, blue collar men. the message: beef is hotter than ever, but this time around, its not bodybuilders or erotic dancers in the spotlight. now, after a couple of years of showin a peek of the boxers above their baggy jeans, ordinary guyz are becoming eroticized.
<p>
<a href="sex3.html"><img src="sex3_sm.jpg" width=100 height=157
align=left vspace=5 hspace=3 border=0></a>
the writing has been on the wall, and calvin kleins billboards, for years. connect the dots: jim palmer in his jockeys, chippendales dudes, marky mark, real firemen calendars. suddenly, the image snaps into sharp focus, like the montage of men in their underwear shown above, just an average november in <u>gq</u> magazine, hardly the voice of sexual liberation.
<p>
<a href="sex5.html"><img src="sex5_sm.jpg" width=175 height=111
align=right vspace=5 hspace=3 border=0></a>
a couple of years ago, a concerned dude wrote the <u>playboy</u> advisor to ask about how best to show cock in spandex workout wear. up or down? in total seriousness, the magazine replied that down was best. in fact, wrote the advisor, it is a style called the australian. (go figure, mate!)
<p>
<a href="sex2.html"><img src="sex2_sm.jpg" width=100 height=208
align=right vspace=5 hspace=3 border=0></a>
what seems to be happening is a sea change in sexual attitude by heterosexual males. after eons of making sex objects of women, after decades of nagging by girlfriends and helpful fashion tips from gays, our buddy the hetrosapien seems to be reveling in the discovery that real men can be sex objects, and not just on oprah. 
<p>
<a href="sex10.html"><img src="sex10_sm.jpg" width=100 height=93
align=left vspace=5 hspace=3 border=0></a>
what sexual implications lie buried in this phenomenon? depends on the individual, of course, but women are applauding madly. about time, guys! they say.<a href="sex7.html"><img src="sex7_sm.jpg" width=100 height=154
align=right vspace=5 hspace=3 border=0></a> homos agree, theyve been there all along. but the eroticization of the ordinary guy is beyond straight or gay  it is body language  and these days the boy next door seems to have an awful lot to say.

coley cochran is ninteen and hung. he is also a voodoo warlock heavy into black magic sex. a pansexual porn star narcissus with an i.q. of 150. he has hair an anchorwoman would kill for, and he is a devout exhibitionist.
<p>
for five years, los angeles artist john blackburn has inked the adventures of the studboy who sprang from his brain. i had been looking for him for years, says blackburn, who grew up in statesboro and atlanta, georgia  big time bible belt country. 
<p>
he isnt anybody, he isnt me. though if i were nineteen, hunky and blond, i would certainly want to be as outrageous as coley. outrageous is a conservative word for it. keep your hero in trouble, goes the writers mantra, and, in three major story cycles and a couple of limited edition series, coley rivals the marquis de sade in sexcapades. 
<p>
coley is forever gettin nekkid and doin it in public. he is addicted to a weird love potion that turns him into, well, a sex god. hes been crucified, fishhooked and run the gamut of the s&m encyclopedia. he romances men and women, offering himself to priests, sadistic prison guards and very boyish-looking men.  
<p>
so john, we asked, with all the political correctness in the air, arent you the worst enemy of the self-proclaimed right? im comfortable with that, blackburn laughs.
<p>
i think of coley as a kind of looney tunes character, or like the three stooges. they get mutilated, but always pop back. theres a lot of scarey things in the real world and it takes a lot to equal, in a comic, things that happen in real life. in my work, the scary parts are scarier, the sexy parts are sexier. like, way.</td>

<br><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size=2><b>coley lives in the world of alternative comix where his creator has abolished aids and where extreme sex leaves no permanent scars. this aint the duck brothers, dudes  were talking x-rated. 
<p>
but coleys adventures are perhaps the deepest, richest, storytelling in the comix world thanks to their complex characters and situations. the pages are beautifully crafted and blackburns illustration is unique. it is erotic comix art from a thoughtful artist and writer who challenges his hero, and our perceptions of sexuality, with his pen.</td>

<p>
his classical influences include michangelo, tintoreto and caravaggio. among his heroes of today are tom of finland, etienne, brad parker and the hun. his stippled work draws from the techniques of new yorks rex.

you can see the effects of all these artists on teddys stuff, but he adds his own brand of high-octane sexuality.
<p>

teddys work is widely seen in europe. some of his best crotch stuff is here, though hes also adept at hardcore scenes. teddy has been published extensively in <u>gai pied hebdo</u>, <u>s magazine</u>, <u>rebell</u>, <u>exit le journal</u>, <u>dialogai</u>, <u>stroke</u> and <u>manifest reader</u>.</b></td>

<img src="belle_m.gif" width=54 height=32 align=left vspace=0 hspace=0 border=0>ichael labelle has been moving around a lot. los angeles, las vegas, and now back to his native qubec  in laval, in the laurentian mountain countryside near montreal. the men drawn by michael labelle have been moving around, too. into orbit, across the bay on battle manoeuvers, and out buying underwear at jockworld, a store that represents a total breakthrough in retailing, to say the least.
<br><br>
fans of michael labelle will understand. for five years, labelle has been creating hot cowboys, athletes, muscle-mad robots, construction dudes and more under his belle iconix studio banner. now, he turns them loose in a world of their own in his most recent work, a 44-page comic labelle calls <u>utopolis,</u> <font color="#B860B7">his first work in linear storytelling. 
<br><br>
<font color="#D07831">
<img src="belle_f.gif" width=21 height=43 align=left vspace=0 hspace=2 border=0>or comix fans, putting the labelle men into stories, and hearing them speak  well its the biggest thing since garbo talked. in episode one, you approach <u>utopolis</u> from low orbit where a lone, buzzcut, jockstrapped astronaut is teleconferencing with an buddy on the planet below. 
<br><br>
i'm ready for bedtime stories, says the stud, whats going on down there where everything always is what is appears to be? hold your orbit, space brother, replies his pal, as he uploads an adventure feed from the surface.
<br><br>
a panorama of life on <u>utopolis</u> begins to unfold. a young married couple at the artificial insemination clinic of dr. rock t. launcher. a trip to an underwear store with some hard-to-fit big boyz. a military conflict resolved with sheer musclepower. even the commercials on <u>utopolis</u> are cool. 
<br><br>

hey duncan, an off-camera announcer calls to a star quarterback getting his tit stroked by a big-boobed babe sitting on the jocks prize car, you just won the chicks and vette contest. what are you going to do next? take my buddy for a spin, replies duncan. ah, <u>utopolis.</u> beam me up, duncan. 
<br><br>
<font color="#52AFB7">
<img src="belle_l.gif" width=17 height=43 align=left vspace=0 hspace=0 border=0>abelle is currently developing a sequel that includes the backstory of utopolis while studying 3d animation at icari, in old montreal, where the software program softimage was created.
<br><br>
i've always been an artist, i knew that from day one, says labelle in accent qubec. i studied architecture at the university of montreal, then moved into fine art and graphic art at concordia university in montreal. 
<br><br>
labelle spent several years studying body culture in los angeles while painting those billboard-size blow-ups of album covers seen plastered all over tower records. but it was l.a.s traffic patterns that labelle was studing in detail.
<br><br>
my first art was an obsession with freeways and urban design which i saw as a puzzle. that's what brought me to l.a., it was the first city in our time to be built specifically to accomodate traffic grids.</td>

we think about sex a lot, yet we discuss it openly and frankly very little. thats strange, considering how much sex swirls around us. 
<p>
yet between the extremes of clinical journals and porno, theres not much serious coverage of sexuality  how we use it, how it works us over, why it is so compelling.
<p>
this webzine was created to map the erotic landscape and to provide a meeting ground for like-minded guys we encounter on our journey.   
<p>
our starting point is men in their underwear  the border crossing between everyday reality and our sex lives. our guides are gifted artists, photographers, writers and performers who capture new insights into eroticism as they reveal its stunning aesthetic.  
<p>
jump into the dialogue, share your art, or just get lost in the pages. were here to explore the urge that so deeply colors our humanity.<p align="right">

dude! email your photo, preferably as a .jpg file set for high quality, at least 300 pixels tall, 75dpi resolution. colors groovy. we may tint black and white shots. mac guyz: use uuencode if youre using eudora. 
<br><br>
sorry, we dont display branded pix  photos with text on em  whether email addresses or web sites.
crotch shots arent as cool as seeing the total man, but you don't have to show your face if youre a shy boy.
