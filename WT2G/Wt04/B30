<b> m.   Date Stamped: </b> November 25, 1994 <p>
<b> 2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
 In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with chlortetracycline.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed).  Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR 558.550.  Chlortetracycline is codified under 21 CFR 558.128.  The
combination of salinomycin sodium and chlortetracycline is codified under 21
CFR 558.550(a) and (b)(1)(xvi).<p>
<b> 3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>a.   Tolerances and Safe Concentrations for the Marker Residue</b><p>
    The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product.  The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
    Tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are established at 1.0 ppm in the
uncooked muscle, liver, fat, and skin and 4.0 ppm in uncooked kidney of broiler
chickens (21 CFR 556.150).<p>
<b>b.   Withdrawal Time</b><p>
Based on the information in 21 CFR 558.550(b)(1)(xvi), a 24 hour withdrawal
time is required for the combination of salinomycin and chlortetracycline. 
<p>
<b>c.   Regulatory Method</b><p>
Under NADA 128-686 a regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because
residue levels in all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were
significantly below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
The regulatory analytical method for the determination of residue of
chlortetracycline is a microbiological test using <i>Bacillus cereus</i>&#160; var.
<i>mycoides</i>&#160; (ATCC 11778).  The method is published by the Food and Drug
Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal
Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols", revised October 1968, Reprinted
December 1974.<p>
<b> 4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of 512(n) of the Act and demonstrates
that the combination of salinomycin sodium and chlortetracycline calcium
complex when used under the proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective
for its labeled indications.<p>

 <b>I.  General Information:  </b><p>
<b> NADA Number:</b>        140-810  <p>
<b> Sponsor:</b><p>         Biomed Laboratories <br>
                        438 W. Arrow Highway, Unit 30 <br>
                        San Dimas, CA  91773  <p>
 <b>Generic Name:</b><p>        Nystatin, neomycin sulfate,   
                        thiostrepton, triamcinolone  
                        acetonide ointment  <p>
 <b>Trade Name:</b>      Panavet Ointment  <p>
 <b>Marketing Status:</b>   Prescription (Rx)  <p>
 <b>Date of Summary:</b>  February 3, 1989<p>
 <b>II.  Indications for Use:</b>  <p>
 Panavet Ointment (nystatin, neomycin sulfate, thiostrepton, triamcinolone
acetonide ointment) is particularly useful in the treatment of acute and
chronic otitis of varied etiologies, in interdigital cysts in cats and dogs,
and in anal gland infections in dogs.  <p>
 The preparation is also indicated in the management of dermatologic
disorders characterized by inflammation and dry or exudative dermatitis,
particularly those caused, complicated, or threatened by bacterial or candidal
(<i>Candida albicans</i>&#160;) infections. It is also of value in eczematous dermatitis,
contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis, and as an adjunct in the
treatment of dermatitis due to parasitic infestation.  <p>
 <b>III.  Dosage Form(s), Route of Administration(s), and Recommended
Dosage(s):  </b><p>
 The active ingredients are formulated in an ointment base.  <p>
 Panavet Ointment is indicated for topical administration.  <p>
 Frequency of administration is dependent on the severity of the condition.
For mild inflammations, application may range from once daily to once a week;
for severe conditions Panavet Ointment may be applied as often as two or three
times daily, if necessary. Frequency of treatment may be decreased as
improvement occurs.  <p>
   
 <b>Otitis</b> <p>
 Clean ear canal of impacted cerumen.  Inspect canal and remove any foreign
bodies such as grass awns, ticks, etc.  Instill three to five drops of Panavet
Ointment.  <p>
 Prelimary use of a local anesthetic may be advisable.  <p>
   
 <b>Infected Anal Glands, Cystic Areas, etc. </b> <p>
 Drain gland or cyst and then fill with Panavet Ointment.  <p>
   
 <b>Other Dermatologic Disorders  </b><p>
 Clean affected areas, removing any encrusted discharge or exudate. Apply
Panavet Ointment sparingly in a thin film.  <p>
   
 <b>IV.  Effectiveness  </b><p>
 Panavet Ointment and the pre-1962 pioneer product (Panalog Ointment - NADA
12-258, Solvay Veterinary, Inc., formerly E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc.)
contain the same active ingredients.  Both products contain nystatin 100,00
units, neomycin sulfate 2.5 mg, thiostrepton, 2,500 units, and triamcinolone
acetonide 1.0 mg. The pioneer product, Panalog, was the subject of a review by
the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug
Efficacy Study Group.  NAS/NRC determined Panalog Ointment to be "probably
effective" and recommended labeling changes. Subsequently, the product was
determined to be "effective" by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) when
the application was supplemented by providing the required label revisions.
This was published in a Federal Register Notice, Volume 35, No. 166, Wednesday,
August 26, 1970.  It was also codified in 21 CFR 524.1600a.  <p>
 This product is chemically equivalent to the approved product, it bears the
same claims, it is topically applied and is for local therapeutic effect.
Therefore, as provided under 21 CFR 320.22, the Center for Veterinary Medicine
waived the requirement for submission of evidence of in vivo bioavailability
and bioequivalency.  <p>
 <b>V.  Animal Safety  </b><p>
 Reference is again made to the NAS/NRC review of Panalog Ointment. The
Council determined the product was safe and "probably effective" with labeling
changes.  The safety of the product was increased by changing its marketing
status from over-the-counter (OTC) to prescription (Rx).  In addition, the
Panavet Ointment labeling included the safety information required by CVM in
the Federal Register announcement of December 13, 1984 covering drug products
containing a steroid.  <p>
 <b>VI.  Human Safety  </b><p>
 <b>Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption: </b> <p>
 Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA.  This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only on cats and dogs, which are non-food
animals.  <p>
 <b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b>  <p>
 Labeling contains an adequate caution statement.  <p>
 Dosage and Administration section of the package insert states: "Wear
gloves during the administration of the ointment or wash hands immediately
after application."  <p>
 <b>VII.  Agency Conclusions </b> <p>
 This is a generic NADA.  The pre-1962 pioneer prototype is Panalog Ointment
(NADA 12-258).  In accordance with 21 CFR 320.22, CVM waived the requirement
for bioequivalency data for this topical product.  This application provides
labeling revisions recommended by the NAS/NRC efficacy panel and required by
the Agency to establish safety and effectiveness.  Approval is based on the
chemical equivalency of this generic drug and the pre-1962 pioneer
product.  <p>
 Panavet Ointment, when used under its approved conditions of use, is safe
and effective for the treatment of acute and chronic otitis of varied
etiologies, for interdigital cysts in cats and dogs, for anal gland infections
in dogs, and for the management of moist or dry dermatologic disorders
characterized by inflammation: bacterial, candidal (<i>Candida albicans</i>&#160;), contact,
eczematous, and seborrheic dermatitis; and as an adjunct in the treatment of
dermatitis due to parasitic infestation.  <p>
 The labeling for this product contains the veterinary prescription legend
because the expertise of a veterinarian is necessary for diagnoses of the
etiologies of the conditions for which the product is indicated, for proper
preparation of the animals for drug administration (otitis &amp; anal glands),
for the administration of the drug (anal glands), and for supervision of the
progress of the animals to reduce the potential of adverse side effects such
as:  SAP and SGPT (ALT) enzyme elevations, polydypsia/polyuria, vomiting,
diarrhea (occasionally bloody), Cushing's syndrome, and deafness. <p>

<b>3. Dosage:</b><P>

<b>Form:</b> A ready-to-use solution containing 5 mg of ivermectin per ml.<P>

<b>Route:</b><P>

The formulation should be applied along the topline in a narrow strip extending
from the withers to the tailhead.<P>

<b>Recommended dosage:</b><P>

1 ml per 22 lb of body weight to supply 500 mcg of ivermectin per kg.<P>

<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><P>

Ivermectin is currently approved for use in cattle as an injectable formulation
(NADA 128-409, approved by Final Rule in Federal Register 49:30, pp 5343-4;
February 13, 1984), and as a paste formulation (NADA 137-006, approved by Final
Rule in Federal Register 51:237, pp 44449; December 10, 1986). Trials conducted
for approval of these two formulations provided efficacy data for a variety of
both internal and external parasites of cattle.  In addition to data from
previously cited NADA's, efficacy studies were conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the pour-on formulation against the dose-limiting parasites.
The aforementioned NADAs, plus the NADA that is the subject of this summary,
provide acceptable efficacy data for the parasites on the labeling.<P>

Trial 11258 was conducted to determine the effective dose to control nematodes.
Cattle were randomly allocated to treatments. Necropsies for worm counts were
done 14-16 days after treatment. Doses of ivermectin were 200, 500 and 1000
mcg/kg. The data show significantly (p&#60;0.05) less reduction in parasite
counts at 200 mcg/kg compared to higher levels for several parasites, but no
significant difference between 500 and 1000 mcg/kg.<P>

Eight trials (11076, 11258, 11383, 11384, 11498, 11506, 11759, 12543) were
conducted to test the efficacy of IVOMEC Pour-On against nematodes in cattle.
Animals were randomized between control and treatment group in each trial and
the appropriate amount of the formulation was applied (1 ml per 22 lb). After a
suitable period,
depending on the parasite, the animals were necropsied for parasite recovery.
The results of each trial are shown in the corresponding trial summary.<P>

Trial 11261 was conducted to evaluate the effect of IVOMEC Pour-On on
<i>Hypoderma&nbsp;</i>spp. in cattle. Animals with grubs in the second and third
stages were randomized between control and treatment groups. The dose given was
500 mcg/kg. Animals were examined for grub emergence in the spring. Data were
statistically analyzed and the results showed that there was a significant
(p&#60;0.05) reduction in the proportion of animals with emerging grubs in the
ivermectin-treated animals.<P>

Three trials (11260, 11267, 11503) were conducted to evaluate the effect of
IVOMEC Pour-On (500 mcg/kg) against lice on cattle. Both biting and sucking
lice were present. The animals were randomly assigned among control and
treatment groups. The trials lasted 49 to 56 days with animals examined every 7
to 14 days throughout the trials. The lice were counted in selected areas and
the data were statistically analyzed. The results showed that both biting lice
and sucking lice were significantly (p&#60;0.05) reduced on treated animals.<P>

Two trials were conducted to investigate the effect of IVOMEC Pour-On on
<i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>&nbsp;var. <i>bovis&nbsp;</i>in cattle. In Trial 11202, mites
were not completely controlled in all animals at 1 ml/22 lb (500 mcg/kg) due to
interference with absorption of ivermectin when the formulation was applied to
skin damaged by mites. Care was taken in Trial 11774 to apply the drug only to
clinically healthy skin. Live mites were recovered from only on treated animals
on one occasion from Day 21 to 56 after treatment.<P>

Six trials (11616, 11704, 11943, 11944, 12100 and 12244) evaluated the efficacy
of IVOMEC Pour-On in controlling extant infestations of horn flies
(<i>Haematobia irritans</i>) and reducing the numbers acquired by
reinfestation. The results indicate that ivermectin applied topically at 500
mcg/kg effectively controls horn flies on cattle for up to 28 days.<P>

<b>Sunshine:</b><P>

Trials 11383 and 11498 were conducted to determine if exposing cattle treated
with IVOMEC Pour-On to sunshine results in any loss of efficacy. Cattle were
treated with IVOMEC Pour-On at 1 ml/22 lb and housed inside or kept outside in
sunshine. Animals in each trial were randomly allocated among treatments. There
was no significant (p&gt;0.10) difference in the reduction of parasite burden
between treated cattle housed inside and those left out or maintained in the
sunshine.<P>

<b>Grooming:</b><P>

In Trial 11503, a 56-day pasture trial, cattle were maintained in outdoor
paddocks. There were five paddocks in each of two treatments with cattle and
paddocks randomly assigned to treatment. One treatment group was unmedicated
and the other was given IVOMEC Pour-On at 1 ml/22 lb. Louse burdens were
reduced on the cattle treated with IVOMEC Pour-On as were the number of
nematode parasite eggs shed.<P>

<B>5. Safety</B><P>

<b>Animal Safety:</b><P>

Three trials were conducted to investigate the safety and acceptability of
applying IVOMEC Pour-On to cattle. .<P>

Trial 11824 was a tolerance study to examine the effects of 2 ml/22 lb, 5 ml/22
lb and 10 ml/22 lb (2X, 5X and 10X recommended dose, respectively) on cattle
and compare the effects to those in a control group. There were four randomly
selected animals per group. Animals were examined daily for 14 days after
dosing. Minor signs of irritation (skin flaking) at the application sites were
seen in all groups, including the vehicle control. No treatment-related effects
on feed intake or body temperature were observed.<P>

Trial 11753 was conducted to examine the effects on skin. Sixteen animals were
given IVOMEC Pour-On (1 ml/22 lb) on Day 0 of the trial. Four animals were
randomly selected for collection of skin samples on each of Days 7, 14, 28 and
42 after dosing. Skin sections were examined histologically. The epidermis,
dermis, subcutaneous tissue and
underlying muscle at the application site appeared normal at all four time
periods. The histopathologic effects were minimal degrees of dermal
perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, esinophils and plasma
cells. The lesions ranged from none to mild degrees of acathosis,
hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in the control and application site skin.
These histologic lesions reflect mild site irritation and are biologically
insignificant.<P>

Trial 11663 was conducted to determine the effects of accidental application of
the formulation to the eye of the cattle. Four randomly selected steers were
assigned to each of the four treatments; saline, 1.0 ml; IVOMEC Pour-On, 0.25
ml; IVOMEC Pour-On, 0.5 ml; IVOMEC Pour-On, 1.0 ml, each instilled into the
lower conjunctival fornix.
The animals were observed for seven days after treatment. There was a slight
increase in Ocular Lesion Scores (Draize Method) on Days 1 and 3 after dosing
in the 0.5 and 1.0 groups. These subsided by Day 7. No increased lacrimation
was seen nor did the animals show signs of ocular irritation or discomfort
other than that at the time the formulation was given.<P>

<b>Breeding Animal Safety:</b><P>

Safety in breeding animals was determined by comparison with IVOMEC Injection
for cattle. Data were previously presented to show that the subcutaneous
administration of ivermectin at 400 mcg/kg had no adverse effects on breeding
cattle. To evaluate if topical application of ivermectin posed any risk to
breeding animals, a comparative bioavailability trial was conducted. IVOMEC
Injection was given to eight animals at 2 ml/110 lb (400 mcg/kg) and eight
animals were given IVOMEC Pour-On at 1 ml/22 lb (500 mcg/kg). The levels of
ivermectin in the plasma of the two groups of animals were compared. The groups
given ivermectin topically had a significantly (p&#60;0.01) lower area under the
curve and a significantly (p&#60;0.01) lower peak plasma level than did the
group given ivermectin subcutaneously. Ivermectin given subcutaneously has well
documented safety in breeding animals and the data presented here show that
ivermectin applied topically will also be safe in these animals.<P>

<b>Summary:</b><P>

Instilling the topical formulation into the conjunctival fornix produced mild
conjunctival vascular congestion with mild chemises. The conjunctival edema did
not involve the nictitating membrane. One animal had a mild discharge during
the first day. There were no effects on the cornea or iris detected by
pupillary light reaction, corneal fluorescein staining or fundoscopic
examination. There was a slight increase in Ocular Lesion Scores (Draize
Method) on days 1 and 3 after dosing in the 0.5 ml and 1.0 ml groups. These
subsided by day 7. No increased lacrimation was seen nor did the animals show
signs of ocular irritation or discomfort other than at the time the formulation
was given.<P>

<b>Summary:</b><P>

Application sites remained clinically normal until necropsy (7, 14, 28 or 42
days after dosing). No treatment-related adverse reactions were observed. At
necropsy the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous tissue and underlying muscle at
the application site appeared normal at all four time periods. The
histopathologic effects were minimal degrees of dermal perivascular cuffing of
mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells. The lesions
ranged from none to mild degrees of acanthosis, hyperkeratosis and
parakaratosis in the control and application site skin. The peak effects were
seen at 14 days after treatment when two animals had mild acanthosis and one of
the two also had mild perivascular cuffing. These histologic lesions reflect
mild site irritation and are biologically insignificant.<P>

<b>g. Summary of Metabolism Studies:</b><P>

In liver, the tissue with highest residue, the averaged unaltered parent drug
(H2B1a and H2B1b) accounts for about 67%, 62%, and 52% of the total radioactive
residue at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively, after dosing. In fat, the tissue
with the second highest residue, the unaltered drug accounts for about 86%,
78%, 65%, and 42% of the total radioactive residue at 7, 14, 28, and 42 days
after dosing.<P>

The 14 and 28 days cattle liver were used for study of metabolites. In these
samples, unaltered drug accounted for about 53% to 57% of the radioactivity.
Metabolites were separated into the polar group (2% of the total
radioactivity), drug like group (5% of the total radioactivity), and non-polar
group (0.5 to 2% of the total radioactivity). The major polar metabolite was
identified as 24-hydroxy-H2Bla. Overall, between 85 to 91% of the liver residue
in the 14 and 28 days samples were identified either as the unaltered drug or
as the 24-OH-H2B1a.<P>

In fat tissue of a 28 days post dose steer, the unaltered drug and a group of
non-polar metabolites accounted for 70%and 18% of the total radioactivity,
respectively. The non-polar metabolites were identified as the acyl esters of
24-OH-H2B1a.<P>

As discussed in the FOI Summary for NADA 128-409, IVOMEC (ivermectin) Injection
for Cattle, these same metabolites occur in the liver and fat of cattle treated
with the parenteral formulation of ivermectin.<P>

Comparative metabolism studies indicate that the metabolism of ivermectin in
cattle and rat, the toxicity test species, is qualitatively similar. In both
species, the unaltered drug is the major residue. The HPLC profiles of the
radioactive residue in the liver and qualitatively similar. The major
metabolite in cattle and rat liver is 24-OH-H2B1a. Thus, the test species is
exposed to the major drug residue components known to be present in cattle
tissues.<P>

<b>4. Tolerance for the marker residue:</b><P>

For reasons enumerated in the FOI Summary for NADA 128-409, IVOMEC (ivermectin)
Injection for Cattle, liver was selected as target tissue, parent drug
component H2B1a was selected as marker residue, and the tolerance for H2B1a in
liver was calculated to be 15 ppb.<P>

The residue date contained in Study CA-218 confirm that, for the topical route
of administration, 15 ppb is a valid tolerance for ivermectin H2B1a as the
marker residue in liver tissue of cattle.<P>

The regulatory method of analysis has a limit of detection of 1-2 ppb and a
limit of reliable measurement of 10 ppb.<P>

<b>f. Statistical method used to calculate the withdrawal period</b><P>

Based on the tolerance for ivermectin of 15 ppb in cattle liver, a

section 512 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and demonstrate that ivermectin
(IVOMEC&#174; Pour-On) when administered to cattle topically at one milliliter
per 22 lbs. of body weight is safe and effective for the indications stated on
the product labeling.<P>

Ivermectin is currently regulated by (a) Injection: 21CFR522.1192 for use
subcutaneously in cattle, reindeer and swine, and intramuscularly in horses;
(b) Oral: 21CFR520.1192 for use as a paste in horses and cattle; 21CFR520.1193
for use as tablets in dogs; 21CFR520.1194 for use as a drench in sheep, and
21CFR520.1195 for use as a liquid in horses.<P>

The residue data confirm that for the topical route of administration 15 ppb is
the tolerance for ivermectin H2B1a as the marker residue in liver tissue of
cattle. Based on the tolerance, a withdrawal time of 48 days was determined.<P>

Under section 512 (c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act [21
U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)], this approval qualifies for three years of marketing
exclusivity because new clinical, field investigations and human food safety
data were required for its approval.<P>

The agency concludes that adequate directions for over the counter lay use have
been written for the proposed conditions of topical use of ivermectin in
cattle. Diagnosis of the infections can be made with a degree of certainty by
the layman. The conditions described on the labeling are likely to be carried
out in practice. Approved products containing ivermectin for the same claims
are marketed over the counter and the agency is not aware of any reason this
topical product would require the marketing status to be changed.<P>

<B>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY </B><p>           
<B>GENERAL INFORMATION:</B><p>
<B>NADA # 140-874</B><p>
Sponsor:<p>
Wildlife Laboratories<br>
Incorporated 1401 Duff Drive, Suite 600<br>
Fort Collins, Colorado 80534<p> 
Generic Name: Yohimbine hydrochloride<p> 
Tradename: Antagonil<p>
Marketing Status: "RX"<p>
Date of Summary Feb. 3, 1993<p>
<B>2)INDICATIONS FOR USE:</B><p>
  For the antagonism of xylazine sedation in 
free-ranging and confined members of the family Cervidae (deer and 
elk).<p>
<B>3)DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</B><p>
 The product is supplied as a sterile solution for intravenous 
administration at a dose rate of	0.20 to 0.30 mg/kg body weight.<p>
<B>4)	EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>
 Due to the nature of the species in which the 
efficacy of yohimbine HCL to reverse xylazine sedation was to be demonstrated, 
and humane concerns for the safety and welfare of these animals as well 
as the fact that these animals are wild and free-ranging and under the 
jurisdiction of federal and state wildlife agencies, or, in the case of the 
exotic members of the family Cervidae in zoos under the jurisdiction of 
either state or municipal entities, it was deemed inappropriate and 
inhumane to immobilize deer with xylazine and leave them unreversed by 
yohimbine as controls in these trials.<p>
Immobilization of deer with xylazine without reversal puts them at risk 
to complications common to ruminants after xylazine sedation such as 
bloat, regurgitation of rumen contents and aspiration into the lungs, and 
selfinduced trauma as a result of incoordination during the recovery 
phases. Furthermore, the published, peer-reviewed scientific literature 
contains sufficient controlled studies documenting the recovery times of 
deer following xylazine sedation. It was determined that this scientific 
base of information could be relied upon to adequately establish control 
values and that these trials could be conducted without putting 
additional animals at unnecessary and inhumane risk as control animals 
in these trials to establish efficacy of yohimbine HCL to reverse xylazine 
sedation in the deer family.<p>
In these efficacy trials, over 400 members of the family Cervidae, 
represented by seven different species were administered yohimbine HCL 
following xylazine sedation. Following yohimbine HCL administration, the 
recumbency time was reduced to 4.37 +/- 0.13 (SE) minutes. The 
expected recumbency times established in well controlled trials in the 
scientific literature for these animals would have been in excess of 100 
minutes. In accordance with 21 CFR 514.111(a)(5)(ii), the effectiveness 
of yohimbine HCL as an antagonist to xylazine in Cervidae is conclusively 
established by the alternative procedure utilized in the clinical field 
trials. Therefore a waiver of the criteria defining control trials was 
granted.<p>
The following parameters were recorded in these studies: 1 ) dosage of 
xylazine, 2) time to sternal and/or lateral recumbency after treatment 
with xylazine, 3) time between xylazine administration and yohimbine HCL administration, 4) 
dosage of yohimbine HCL, 5) time to initial effect and time to standing 
after treatment with yohimbine HCL and 6) adverse effects.
a) The pivotal efficacy study was conducted in elk demonstrating the 
efficacy of yohimbine HCL to reverse xylazine sedation in elk (Cervus 
elaphus) as a representative of the family Cervidae.<p>

body weight<p>
 H)      Parameters Measured:<p>
1)Dosage of Xylazine in mg/kg <br>
2)Time to Immobilization<br>
3)Interval Between Xylazine Administration and Yohimbine HCL 
Administration<br>
 4)Amount of Yohimbine HCL in mg/kg<br>
5)Time to Recovery<br>
6)Adverse Effects<p>
4)      Results: Sedation was produced in these elk by an average 
intramuscular dose rate of 3.85 mg/kg of xylazine. The average time 
between the administration of xylazine and the administration of 
yohimbine HCL in 25 elk was 33 minutes, with a range of 16-54 
minutes. Total recumbency time was 36.5 minutes. The xylazine was 
effectively reversed with an average of 0.22
mg/kg intravenous yohimbine HCL administration that resulted in an 
average standing time of 3 and one-half minutes. The recovery time of 
elk from xylazine sedation documented in well controlled studies 
published in the scientific literature is in excess of 100 minutes (10, 
11, 13).<p>
5) Statistical Analysis: None<p>
6)  Conclusion: Yohimbine HCL administered to these elk within the 0.2 
to 0.3 mg/kg dose range was effective in reversing xylazine sedation 
in these elk in less than six minutes after yohimbine HCL 
administration.<p>
7) Adverse Reactions: None was observed.<p>
8) Special Issues: A waiver of the criteria defining adequate and well 
controlled trials in accordance with provisions of 514.111 (a)(5)(ii) 
has been granted.<p>
b) First corroborative study demonstrating the efficacy of yohimbine 
HCL in reversing the effects of xylazine in elk as a representative 
member of the family Cervidae.<p>

3) Amount of Yohimbine HCL 
in mg/kg <br>
4)Time to Recovery<br>
5) Adverse Effects<p>
4) Results: In 17 immobilizations the elk had an average time to effect 
of less than one minute. The time to standing after administration of 
yohimbine HCL averaged nine minutes. Two of the 17 gave a first 
effect response in two and five minutes but did not stand until 60 
minutes after yohimbine HCL administration.<p>
5) Statistical Analysis: None<p>
6) Conclusion: The field efficacy study conducted by Dr. Cranfield 
provides data that supports the efficacy of yohimbine HCL at an 
average dose rate of 0.15 mg/kg, but that resulted in an average 
standing time of 9 minutes. The recovery time of elk from xylazine 
sedation documented in well controlled studies published in the 
scientific literature is in excess of 100 minutes (10, 11, 13).<p>

6) Conclusion: This field efficacy study demonstrates the efficacy of 
yohimbine HCL at a dose rate 0.15 mg/kg to produce reversal of 
xylazine sedation in elk four minutes following yohimbine HCL 
administration. The recovery time of elk from xylazine sedation 
documented in well controlled studies published in the scientific 
literature studies is in excess of 100 minutes (10, 11, 13).<p>
7) Adverse Reactions: None was observed.<p>
8) Special Issues: A waiver of the criteria defining adequate and well 
controlled trials was granted under 514.111 (a)(5)(ii).<p>
d) Additional Corroborative Studies in Elk:<p>
1) Summary: Nine additional investigators reversed xylazine sedation 
in 39 elk at various locations throughout the United States and 
Canada with yohimbine HCL. The elk were sedated with intramuscular 
xylazine dose rates ranging from 0.7 to 3.9 mg/kg body weight. The 
effective levels of yohimbine HCL administered ranged from 0.12 to 
0.4 mg/kg body weight. All elk in these studies had an average time to 
standing of nine minutes or less. These additional studies 
substantiate the wide range of efficacy of yohimbine HCL to reverse 
xylazine sedation in elk.<p>

i) Additional Corroborative Studies in Other Members of Cervidae: <p>
1) Summary: Data from six additional species in the family Cervidae were 
collected under field conditions. These were Caribou (16), Sika deer 
(7), Fallow deer (1), Axis deer (1) and Muntjac (1).<p>
2) Caribou: Four investigators immobilized a total of 16 caribou with 
an average body weight from 102 to 133 kg. The average dose of 
xylazine ranged from 0.2 to 2.21 mg/kg body weight. Lateral 
recumbency was achieved within an average of less than 11 minutes in 
these animals. The response of these 16 caribou to yohimbine HCL 
antagonism of xylazine sedation at intravenous dose rates of 0.1 to 
0.25 mg/kg was similar to the data in other Cervidae. 
The data from these investigators are summarized on the following table.<p>

3) Sika Deer: Two investigators immobilized seven sika deer in zoological 
collections with an average dose rate of 2.9 and 3.0 mg/kg body 
weight. Times to lateral recumbency were within two minutes or 
less. Yohimbine HCL at doses ranging from 0.15 to 0.34 mg/kg body 
weight, produced a time to standing in these individuals averaging 
four minutes or less. The results indicate that sika deer have a 
response to yohimbine HCL antagonism of xylazine sedation similar to 
other members of the family Cervidae. These results are summarized 
in the following table.<p>

2) Test Animals:<p>
A) Species: Elk (Cervus elaphus)<p>
B) Number per Group: 13 Control, 
34 Treated<p>
3) Study Design:<p>

A) The study was well controlled. The type of control was a non-
treated control (xylazine sedation with no reversal).<p>
B) Dose Form: Sterile injectable liquid at dose rates of 0.625 mg/kg to 
0.25 mg/kg. Two unsedated elk received 1.0 mg/kg intravenously.<p>
4) Other Relevant Information: The publication cited refers to Cervus 
elaphus as deer as they commonly are termed in New Zealand. Genus 
and species is the same as North American elk.<p>
5) Results and Conclusions: Trials were conducted to test the ability 
of yohimbine HCL, 4-aminopyridine and doxapram given by intravenous 
injection to antagonize xylazine sedation in red deer (Cervus elaphus). 
Yohimbine HCL produced the best and most consistent results. The 
mean time taken for 34 animals to stand spontaneously after receiving 
yohimbine HCL at a dose rate of 0.2 to 0.25 mg/kg was 2.50 minutes. 
This occurred on an average of 34 minutes after the initial dose of 
xylazine. Control animals took 67 and 147 minutes on average, to 
standing after receiving intravenous (0.64 to 0.96 mg/kg) and 
intramuscular (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg) injection of xylazine respectively. 
Two deer given high intravenous doses of yohimbine HCL (1.0 mg/kg) 
became mildly nervous and anxious, but returned to normal within one 
hour. The authors concluded that yohimbine HCL administered by 
intravenous injection at a dose rate of  0.2 to 0.25 mg/kg appears to be 
a safe and reliable drug for the reversal of xylazine sedation in deer 
(elk)(10).<p>

<B>5) ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><p> 
Conventional safety studies were not conducted 
with yohimbine HCL due to the nature of the target species. Since 
these animals are not confined and are governed by state or municipal 
entities,  it was not necessary or reasonable to conduct 
conventional/classical pre-clinical laboratory toxicity studies in this 
family of animals. Nevertheless, under actual use conditions, dose 
rates for yohimbine HCL approached six to 10 times the recommended 
level in deer without causing adverse reactions or side effects.
Over 400 members of the family Cervidae were administered 
yohimbine HCL at the approximate recommended dose with individual 
animals receiving higher doses, with no report of toxicity or adverse 
reactions. Additionally, the published literature contains studies 
which further substantiate the safety of this product.
The effects of yohimbine HCL in reversing xylazine have been examined 
in several species and reports of its effects have been published for 
cats (4, 5), cattle (9, 17), deer (6, 7, 8, 12, 14) and dogs ( 1, 2, 3). In 
these studies the effects of yohimbine HCL on mean arousal time, mean 
standing time and mean walking time were recorded and compared to 
control animals that received xylazine alone.<p>
The rationale for developing the drug for use in Cervidae is based on 
the fact that if left in a position of prolonged lateral recumbency 
following immobilization, members of the family Cervidae like other 
ruminants would be highly susceptible to bloat and/or aspiration 
pneumonia. The use of yohimbine HCL allows the effects of xylazine to 
be rapidly reversed, thus enabling the animals to rapidly and safely 
return to their natural environment.<p>
The data filed in support of the product include field data gathered 
under actual conditions of use under free-ranging conditions, in zoos 
or in wildlife parks. Members of the family Cervidae for which data 
have been provided include several species of deer, elk, and caribou.
The following parameters were recorded in these studies: 1) time to 
sternal and/or lateral recumbency after treatment with xylazine, 2) 
time to initial effect and time to standing after treatment with 
yohimbine HCL and, 3) adverse reactions.<p>
The field trials in members of the deer family (Cervidae) referenced in 
the 
efficacy trials contain individual animals which received doses higher 
than the recommended dose range. Additionally, the published 
scientific literature contains studies that further substantiate the 
safety of this product.<p>

f)	Data from published scientific literature to support safety of 
yohimbine HCL in Cervidae (deer):<p>
1 ) Data from the published referenced literature supports the safety 
of yohimbine HCL in the family Cervidae. In a study to compare the 
efficacy of yohimbine HCL with that of 4-aminopyridine and doxapram 
for the antagonism of xylazine, deer (Cervus elaphus) (North American 
elk) were given an intravenous dose of yohimbine HCL at a rate of 1.0 
mg/kg. The only reaction was that these deer became mildly nervous 
and anxious, but returned to normal with one hour. These deer HAD NOT 
been treated with xylazine previously. This demonstrates the safety of 
yohimbine HCL, even without presedation with xylazine, at greater 
than 3 times the highest recommended dose level( 1 C)).<p>
2)	In a study to evaluate yohimbine HCL administration to 
reverse 
xylazine sedation in white-tailed deer and mule deer, six deer were 
given yohimbine HCL at an intramuscular dose rate up to 1.5 mg/kg 
body weight. Researchers noted that following the administration of 
yohimbine HCL, the deer remained calm but alert during one to two 
hours of remote observation. No adverse reactions were observed in 
any animal in this study(16).<p>
<B>6) HUMAN SAFETY:</B><p>
Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:<p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in 
food, were not required for approval of this NADA. This product is 
labeled as a prescription drug not for use in domestic animals or 
animals to be consumed for food. Use of this drug is also prohibited 30 
days before or during a legal hunting season in free-ranging animals.<p>

Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:
Labeling contains adequate caution and warning statements.<p>
<B>7) AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the 
requirements of Section 513 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the 
implementing regulations. The data demonstrated that Antagonil 
(yohimbine hydrochloride) Injection when used under the labeled 
conditions of use is safe and effective.<p>

Under Section 512(C)(2)(F)(ii) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent 
Term Restoration Act of 1988, this New Animal Drug Application 
qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity because yohimbine 
hydrochloride is a previously approved drug for use in dogs and new 
clinical or field Investigations were required for this NADA to provide 
for use in freeranging or confined members of the family (Cervidae 
(deer, elk)).<p>
The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed 
veterinarian because professional expertise is required to monitor 
critical signs of xylazine sedation, determine when the antidote 
yohimbine is indicated, and to then properly administer the drug 
intravenously.<p>

<B>WAIVER OF WELL-CONTROLLED STUDIES AS REQUIRED BY 
514.111(a)(5)(ii)</B><p>
A waiver of the requirements to perform adequate and well-controlled 
field investigations to demonstrate efficacy of this product for use as 
an antagonist to xylazine sedation in members of the family Cervidae 
(deer family) is granted.  The waiver is based upon the following 
reasons:<p>
1.	The extensive length of sedation and recumbency produced by 
xylazine 
in members of the deer family is well documented in the scientific 
peerreviewed literature.  Studies of xylazine sedation in 49 white-
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) resulted in a mean recovery time of 
197.9 +/- 101.5 (SD) minutes following intramuscular xylazine doses of 
+/- 1.91 mg/kg +/-  0.76 (SO) (Roughton, R.D. 1975. JAVMA 167(7):574-
576). Studies of intramuscular xylazine sedation in 102 black-tailed 
deer (Odocoileus hemionus) demonstrated a mean duration of 
recumbency of 144 +/-  9.3 minutes (Jacobson, N.K. 1983. J Wild Manage 
47:252-255).  Studies in elk (Cervus elaphus) have documented recovery 
times in 13 elk sedated with xylazine at dose range of .10 to 3.03 
mg/kg to have a mean recumbency time of 504 +/-  208 (SD) minutes 
(Fletcher, J. 1974.  Vet Rec 94:85-86).  Eight adult elk (4 males, 4 
females) sedated with 1.19 +/-  0.23 mg/kg (males) and 0.68 +/-  0.02 
mg/kg (females) xylazine and recumbency times of 232.6 +/-  55.1 and 
270 +/- 18.2 minutes respectively (Renecker, L.A. and C.D. Olsen. 1986.  
J Wildl Dis 22(1):91-96). Ten elk (Cervus elaphus) sedated by 1.0 to	1.5 
mg/kg xylazine had average times to standing of 104 minutes 
(MacKintosh, C.G. and G. Van Reenan.  1984.  NZ Vet J 32(11):181-184).  
The data adequately and scientifically documents the prolonged 
sedation resulting from use of xylazine in the family Cervidae (deer).<p>
2.	The welfare and humane treatment of all the animals in these 
field 
investigations were considered a priority.  The hazards of xylazine 
sedation and prolonged recumbency in Cervidae are considerable and put 
the animal at risk.  Each cited study describes post sedation bloat, 
aspiration of rumen contents, and self-induced trauma due to 
incoordination during recovery as common complications.  Based upon 
these previously referenced studies, it is inappropriate and inhumane to 
require untreated
control groups in the field investigations and to unnecessarily subject 
additional animals to this risk.  Furthermore, the animals in these 
investigations are, by law, subject to federal, state and municipal 
regulations regarding their handling, and cannot be put unnecessarily at 
risk.<p>
3.      Substantial evidence of drug efficacy was obtained in clinical 
field trials involving 240 members of the family Cervidae (225 deer, 25 
elk).  The total recovery time was 20.5 (deer) and 36.5 (elk) minutes 
when yohimbine was administered following xylazine versus an 
expected recovery time of 100 to 200 minutes for xylazine alone.  The 
recumbency time after administration of yohimbine was +/- 5 minutes.  
The reduction in recumbency time attributable to yohimbine is clearly 
demonstrated.  Therefore, the effectiveness of yohimbine hydrochloride 
as an antagonist to xylazine sedation in Cervidae is conclusively 
established by the alternative methodology used in the clinical field 
trials.<p>
Additionally there is currently no other antagonist approved to reverse 
the agonist effects of xylazine in the family Cervidae.
Based on the above criteria, the request is considered valid, and the 
waiver of adequate and well-controlled field investigations is granted.<p>

<b>Trade Name:</b>  Tylan&#174;<p> 
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p> 
<b>Date of Summary:</b> August 6, 1990<p> 
<b>II.  Indications for Use:</b><p> 
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter.<p> 
<b>III.  Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p> 
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Feed<p> 
<b>Route of Administration:  </b>Oral<p> 
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><ul><p>
    <li>melengestrol acetate - 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
    <li>lasalocid sodium - 10 to 30 g/ton of air dried complete feed<br>
    <li>tylosin phosphate - 8 to 10 g/ton of air dried complete feed (to provide 90
mg/hd/day)</ul><p> 
    Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate (MGA)
per head per day in combination     with 10 to 30 g lasalocid per ton of air dried
complete feed and 8 to 10 g tylosin per ton of air dried complete   feed (to
provide 90 mg/hd/day) when each additive is provided via separate supplements
or a supplement     containing melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with a
complete feed containing lasalocid and tylosin.<p> 
    The supplement containing melengestrol acetate provided at a rate of 0.5 to
2.0 pounds per head may be top-dressed onto or mixed with the feed containing
lasalocid and tylosin.<p> 
    This clearance does not provide for the mixing of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin premixes together     in a common supplement or in a
complete ration offered for sale by the feed manufacturer.<p> 

<b>IV.  Effectiveness:  (In compliance with combination approval claims)</b><p> 
The efficacy of melengestrol acetate for increased rate of weight gain,
improved feed efficiency and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter is well documented and approved  (21CFR 558.342).
Further, the effectiveness of lasalocid for improved feed efficiency and
increased rate of weight gain of feedlot  cattle is established and approved
(21CFR 558.311) as is the effectiveness of tylosin for reduction of liver
abscesses in the same class of cattle (21CFR 558.625).  For these applications,
the efficacy of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin when
co-administered was established by conducting a series of field trials under a
common protocol.  These trials were designed to evaluate the performance of
feedlot heifers fed each drug separately and in combination.<p> 

<b>A.  Pivotal Study</b><p> 
A feedlot heifer study consisting of field trials at nine locations with three
replications per location was conducted to generate animal performance data on
the combination of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin.  Results of
each study are reported as well as a summary and statistical analysis of the
pooled data from all nine field investigations.<p>

<b>3.  General design of each field investigation</b><p>
    <b>a.  Purpose of the field investigation:</b><p>  To evaluate the effect of
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid sodium and          tylosin phosphate on the
performance of feedlot heifers when fed singly and in combination.<p> 
   <b> b.  Test animals</b><ul><p>
        <li>(1)  Species:  Bovine<br>
        Number/group:  The number of heifers per treatment group varied from location
to location, and ranged from        6 to 14 animals per pen (Table 1).<p> 
        <li>(2)  Subgroup Identity:  Heifers used in the field studies were non-pregnant
yearlings and the breeds were       typical of those commonly found in commercial
feedlots.  The average initial weights ranged from 674 to       826 pounds (Table
1).</ul><p> 
    <b>c.  Control groups</b><p>
        Groups of heifers fed melengestrol acetate, or lasalocid or tylosin alone, or
lasalocid and tylosin in            combination served as controls.  Pairwise,
comparisons were made to groups of heifers for the 3 drugs in
combination.<p>
    <b>d.  Diagnosis:</b>  Not applicable.<p> 
   <b> e.  Dosage form:</b><p>
        (1)  Medicated feed:  Feed was medicated using melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid or tylosin premixes.  Final       feeds were prepared using intermediate
premixes which were either mixed into or top-dressed onto the bulk of       the
ration.<p> 
    <b>f.  Route of drug administration:  </b> 
        (1)  Oral<p> 
   <b> g.  Dosages: </b><p> The dosages used in the field study were: melengestrol acetate,
0.5 mg/head/day; lasalocid, 30      gm/ton of air dried feed; tylosin, 10 gm/ton
of air dried feed.<p> 
   <b> h.  Days on test: </b><p> The cattle were fed for a minimum of 90 days, the actual
day of trial termination being left up      to the investigator's judgement as to
when the cattle had reached market weight and condition.  The days on       test by
location are listed on Table 1.<p>

The melengestrol acetate + lasalocid + tylosin combination was justified since
the contribution of lasalocid   significantly enhanced feed efficiency
(P=0.00531).  In this combination, melengestrol acetate was effective for
estrus suppression (P=0.000012), feed efficiency (P=0.00001), and average daily
gain (P=0.000005).  Tylosin     was also effective in reducing the incidence of
liver abscesses (P=0.00021) in this 3-way combination (Table 7).<p> 
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
    The data generated by the nine location field study demonstrated that the
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid, tylosin    combination is justified for its
effect on estrus suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased rate of
weight  gain and reduction of liver abscesses.  Each drug, melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid and tylosin has been shown to    make a significant
contribution to the effectiveness of the combination.<p> 
<b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
    No adverse reactions due to the feeding of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid, or
tylosin, either singly or in    combination were reported.<p> 
<b>8.  Special Issues</b><p>
   <b>Compliance with combination drug policy:</b><p> 
    a.  The effectiveness and safety of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid, and
tylosin when fed singly to feedlot cattle       are well documented in their
respective approved NADAs.  The results of effectiveness and safety studies
were        submitted to the FDA in support of these respective NADAs.  Such data
resulted in the approval of             melengestrol acetate as per CFR 558.342,
lasalocid as per CFR 558.311, and tylosin as per CFR 558.625.       Data generated
in support of combination usage have demonstrated that melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and       tylosin fed together are effective and safe.<p> 
        The data establish compliance with 21CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's combination
drug guidelines             (November 9, 1983).  The combination is justified as
detailed in items 4, 5 and 6 above.<p> 
 
        The use of untreated controls was not deemed necessary as a test for general
effectiveness because the           individual drugs have been previously shown to be
effective and already approved at the levels tested.  The       treatment groups
consisting of the individual drugs and the two-way combinations served as the
appropriate         controls for the respective three-way combination.  Thus, these
treatment groups essentially served as          negative controls with respect to
21CFR 514.111 (a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), and the studies were properly controlled.<p> 
        To justify the combination, comparisons were made which demonstrated that
each drug made a statistically      significant contribution to the combination.
The three-way combination provides a benefit that cannot be         obtained from any
of the possible two-way combinations.<p> 
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-lasalocid-tylosin vs. melengestrol
acetate-lasalocid for transformed       percent liver abscesses demonstrates the
contribution of tylosin to the combination.<p> 
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-lasalocid-tylosin vs. lasalocid-tylosin
for ADG, FE and estrus          suppression demonstrates the contribution of
melengestrol acetate to the combination. Significance for any       variable shows
that melengestrol acetate contributes to the combination.<p> 
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-lasalocid-tylosin vs. melengestrol
acetate-tylosin for ADG and FE      demonstrates the contribution of lasalocid to
the combination.  Significance for any variable shows that      lasalocid
contributes to the combination.<p> 
        The proposed ranges for each drug are justified when fed in combination since
the highest levels proposed         were tested in combination for efficiency and
human and animal safety.<p>

<b>V.  Animal Safety:</b><p> 
<b>A.  Pivotal study</b><p> 
The safety of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and of tylosin in the bovine have

tylosin) as feed additives. The following pivotal study was conducted to
establish the target animal safety of these three additives when fed in
combination.<p>

    *Bone marrow smears were made at the time of necropsy, air dried and fixed for
30 seconds or more in methanol.     Slides were stained with Wrights stain.<p> 
    The following organs were weighed at necropsy, paired organs weighed
together:<p>
    Adrenals, liver, kidneys and heart.</ul><p> 
<b>4)  Results</b><ul><p>
    <li>a.  Clinical Observations<p>
        No adverse, drug-related clinical signs were observed during this study.
Although there were no significant     
         differences in average daily gain (ADG) between treated and control animals
at mid-study and at termination,        there was a trend toward decreased ADG at
the 3X and 5X levels of treatment.<p> 
    <li>b.  Clinical pathology<p>
        Occasional statistically significant changes in several hematologic and serum
chemistry parameters were       detected, but all values were well within normal
acceptable ranges and no dose-related trends were seen.<p> 
    <li>c.  Gross and microscopic pathology<p>
        Several gross and histologic tissue changes were observed, but due to the
relative even distribution of the       changes in all dose groups including
controls, these findings were considered to be incidental rather than drug-
related.</ul><p> 
<b>5)  Conclusions</b><p>
    Based upon the results of this study, the combination of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin phosphate in  the daily feed of yearling heifers appears
to be non-toxic when fed for 90 days at up to 5 times the recommended   dose.<p>

<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><p> 
<b>A.  Drugs for use in food animals</b><p> 
<b>1.  Toxicity tests</b><p>
    Data regarding toxicity testing in melengestrol acetate, lasalocid sodium and
tylosin phosphate are contained in  the approved NADAs for the three above
mentioned compounds.<p> 

<b>2.  Safe concentration of residues</b><p>
Tolerances for melengestrol acetate, lasalocid sodium and tylosin phosphate
are published in the <i>Code of Federal     Regulations</i>.&#160; Melengestrol acetate
is currently approved under 21CFR 558.342 for use in heifers at 0.25 to 0.50
mg/head/day with a 48 hour withdrawal period.  No residues of melengestrol
acetate may be found in uncooked    edible tissues of cattle with a method
sensitive to 25 ppb (21CFR 556.380).  The tolerance for lasalocid in    edible
tissue of cattle under 21CFR 556.347 is 0.7 ppm with no withdrawal period
established for cattle under    21CFR 558.311.  The tolerance for tylosin
phosphate has been established at 0.2 ppm (negligible residue) in   uncooked
fat, muscle, liver and kidney (CFR 556.740).  Tylosin phosphate has no
withdrawal period established   under 21CFR 558.625.<p> 

<b>3.  Residue depletion and metabolism studies</b><p>
Numerous studies have been conducted relative to the metabolism and depletion
of residues of melengestrol     acetate, lasalocid, and tylosin when administered
individually to cattle.  The results of those studies have been     filed under
the following submissions:<p>

    The animals in each group were slaughtered within 16 hours following their
last feeding.  Perirenal fat was    collected from all four treatment groups for
the melengestrol acetate analysis, and liver samples were collected     from the
group 1 and 2 animals for the assay of lasalocid and tylosin.<p> 
    <b>a.  Residues of melengestrol acetate</b><p>
        The samples of pererenal fat from each animals were assayed for residues of
melengestrol acetate using the      official AOAC gas chromatographic method.
Analysis of the samples from the group 2 (1X) animals           showed that all fat
samples were below the 25 ppb tolerance for MGA and five of the seven samples
were        below the 10 ppb limit of reliable measurement of the assay.  The two
fat samples that gave positive          responses had MGA levels of 12.7 and 13.7
ppb.<p> 
        Fat samples from groups 3 and 4 (the heifers dosed at 3X and 5X levels)
yielded average residue levels of       37.6 and 49.4 ppm, respectively.<p> 
    <b>b.  Residues of lasalocid</b><p>
        Liver tissue that was collected from the seven control animals and the seven
heifers fed the group 2 (1X)        ration were assayed for lasalocid by the
HPLC   -fluoresence regulatory method for the drug.  An average residue        value of
0.09 ppm (SD. 0.11 ppm) was obtained for the group 2 heifers, and that level is
well below the 0.7      ppm tolerance for lasalocid in the livers from the control
animals.<p> 
    <b>c.  Residues of tylosin</b><p>
        The liver tissue samples from the group 2 (1X) heifers and 7 of the control
animals were assayed for tylosin        by the official assay which measures
microbiologically the active drug.  No positive responses were obtained         for
any of the samples by this method which has a limit of quantitation of 0.1
ppm.<p>
  <b>5.  Assay noninterference data</b><p>
    <b>a.  Melengestrol acetate assay</b><p>
        Data were generated using spiked control fat tissue samples to demonstrate
that the presence of residues of        lasalocid and tylosin does not interfere
with the assay for MGA.  The study was also intended to show that       MGA is
stable  in frozen fat tissue over a period of 60 days.<p> 
        Samples of freshly ground control bovine fat tissue were spiked with MGA,
lasalocid and tylosin at the        following levels:  <p>
        MGA:  0.025<br>
        Lasalocid sodium:  7.0 ppm<br>
        Tylosin phosphate:  1.0 ppm<p> 
The spiked samples were assayed in duplicate for MGA by the official AOAC
method after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of storage at -20&#176;C.  The average
recoveries are shown below.<p>

Hoffmann-LaRoche to support the original NADA approval      for lasalocid in
cattle (NADA  96-298).  Those data have also been published as a journal
article (<i>J.          Agricultural and Food Chemistry </i>, 31, 75-78 (1983)) and

Elanco Products Company.  Samples of liver from control         heifers were
composited and fortified with 0.2 ppm lasalocid, 0.2 ppm tylosin and 0.2 ppm
MGA.  The       samples were assayed for tylosin by the cylinder plate
microbiological method using <i>Micrococcus luteus</i>&#160; as       the test organism.
No interference was detected by the presence of lasalocid and MGA.<p> 
        The stability of tylosin in frozen liver tissue was demonstrated in study
MRC8910 conducted by the Elanco         Products Company.  Liver tissue from control
animals was fortified with 0.2 ppm tylosin and then frozen.         Portions of the
samples were thawed at intervals up to 56 days and assayed for tylosin.  The

        Regression analysis of these data demonstrates satisfactory tylosin stability
for the period the tissues in the       residue depletion study were stored before
assay.<p> 
        The residue depletion and assay noninterference studies presented above
demonstrate that the combined feeding       of melengestrol  acetate, lasalocid
sodium, and tylosin phosphate at their highest approved levels results in
tissue residues below the tolerance levels for each of the three drugs at 16
hours of withdrawal.  The data also         show that each drug in the three-way
combination does not interfere with the assays for the others.  This        work
confirms the adequacy of the 48 hour withdrawal time required for the presence
of MGA in the           combination and demonstrates that the use of these feed
additives in combination does not pose a hazard to      public health.<p> 

<b>6. Regulatory methods</b><p>
    Practical analytical methods of analysis for tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid sodium and tylosin   phosphate may be found in the <i>Food
Additives Analytical Manual</i>&#160; on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Room 12-A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>
<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p> 
These NADA's provide for the combination use of MGA, lasalocid sodium, and
tylosin phosphate at the levels of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day, 10 to 30 g/ton of
feed, and 8 to 10 g/ton of feed (to supply 90 mg/head/day), respectively; for
increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of estrus
(heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter.  Adequate data were submitted which show that the MGA,
lasalocid, tylosin combination is justified for its effect on estrus
suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased rate of weight gain and
reduction of liver abscesses.  Each drug; MGA, lasalocid, and tylosin has been
shown to make a significant (P&lt;0.05) contribution to the effectiveness
of the combination.  The combination, when fed at up to 5X the highest
recommended combination approval (0.5 mg MGA/head/day plus 30 g lasalocid/ton,
and 10 g tylosin phosphate/ton for 90 days), did not produce an adverse effect.
No changes were made in the approved levels of the compounds or in the target
animal and the noninterference of tylosin phosphate, lasalocid sodium and MGA
with the analytical methods for MGA, lasalocid sodium and tylosin phosphate,
respectively, was demonstrated.  Accordingly, approval of these NADA's is not
expected to increase human exposure to drug resides, and therefore did not
require a complete re-evaluation of the human safety data in the original
applications.  For the purposes of human food safety review, these original
NADA's have been treated as Category II supplements under the Agency's
Supplemental Policy (42 FR 64367).  These production drugs are OTC because they
do not raise any special safety concerns.<p>

claim for monensin is for an improvement in feed efficiency.
Such an improvement occurred in every experiment.   Monensin did not interfere
with the tylosin activity in regard to reduction of liver abscesses.   Tylosin
did not interfere with monensin activity in regard to improved feed efficiency.
Thus, the use of the two drugs are in complete compliance with the combination
drug policy.<P>

<b>SUMMARY:</b><p>
Two hundred steers weighing approximately 625 lbs. were used in
this 140-day experiment to study the effect of feeding monensin for improving
feed efficiency and of feeding tylosin for the prevention of liver abscesses.
The ration treatment programs were 0, 5, 20 and 30 g/ton monensin with and
without 10 g/ton tylosin.  The ration was a complete mixed meal ration
containing approximately 80 percent steam-flaked milo, 10 percent cottonseed.
hulls and 10 percent supplement.<P>
Average daily gain and feed efficiency main effects for 0,  5,
20 and 30 g/ton monensin respectively were 3.46, 7.18, 3.63, 7.67, 3.56, 6.86,
3.51 and 6.47.  Monensin was effective in improving feed conversion and feed
conversion was not altered by tylosin treatment.   There were no abscessed
livers in any of. the tylosin treatments while-7% of the livers in the
treatments not receiving tylosin were abscessed    Liver abscess incidence was
not affected by monensin treatment.   There were no differences in carcass
measurements. All steers were 6 to 9months of age.<p>

<b>SUMMARY:</b><P>
A total of 383 finishing steers weighing approximately 660 lbs. each were fed a
high moisture corn ration for 90 days to evaluate the effects of 0, 5, 20 and
30 g/ton monensin with and without 10 g/ton tylosin.  The main effects of
monensin for feed per pound of gain were 7.14, 6.94, 6.98 and 6.42 respectively
for 0, 5, 20 and 30 g/ton.   Tylosin reduced the incidence of abscessed livers
from 59 of 190 for control to 36 of 187.  Tylosin also improved feed efficiency
from 7.04 for control to 6.71.  Monensin had no effect on incidence of liver
abscesses or average daily gain except 5 g/ton monensin increased average daily
gain by 4%.  All steers were 6 to 9 months old and typical animals for feedlot
use.  All steers were implanted with SYNOVEX-S on day 30 of the study.<p>

<b>SUMMARY:</b><P>
One hundred ninety-two Holstein steers weighing approximately 
590 lbs. were used in this 223-day experiment to test the compatibility of
feeding monensin for improving feed efficiency and feeding tylosin for the
prevention of liver abscesses.   In addition, two sources of protein, alfalfa
haylage and soybean meal were evaluated.   The ration treatment programs were
0, 5, 20 and 30 g/ton monensin with and without 10 g/ton tylosin.  The grain source was
cracked corn and the final ration contained approximately 80% concentrate and
20% roughage.   The alfalfa haylage and soybean meal protein supplements were
formulated to contain the same level of fiber and to be isonitrogenous.
Average daily gain and feed efficiency main effects for 0, 5, 20 and 30 g/ton
monensin respectively were 2.65, 7.67, 2.77, 7.32, 2.83, 7.14, 2.90 and 6.88.
Average daily gain and. feed efficiency main effects for 0 and 10 g/ton tylosin
were 2.75, 7.34, 2.83 and 7.17 respectively.   There were 8.33% of the livers
condemned for abscesses in the treatments without tylosin and 6.25% of the
livers condemned for abscesses in treatments with tylosin.<p>

<b>SUMMARY:</b><P>
The effect of 0, 5, 20 and 30 g/ton monensin alone and in combination
with 10 g/ton tylosin upon feedlot performance was studied during a 142-day
finishing trial using 216 yearling cattle weighing approximately 600 lbs. each.
Two pens of eighteen cattle each were used on the 0 and 30 g/ton levels while
one pen of 18 cattle was used on the 5 and 20 g/ton levels, both alone and in
combination with 10 g/ton tylosin. Feed efficiency was improved by the 30 g/ton
monensin treatment with and without tylosin.  The 20 g/ton monensin treatment
also improved feed efficiency when fed in combination with tylosin. Gain was
not affected by treatment.   Tylosin had no apparent effect upon performance in
this study, but was highly effective in controlling liver abscess.  Incidence
of abscessed livers was 61% vs. 4.9% for non-tylosin and tylosin cattle
respectively,  (P &lt; 0.001).  Carcass quality was not affected by treatment.
There were 8.33% of the livers condemned for abscesses in the treatments
without tylosin and 6.25% of the livers condemned for abscesses in treatments
with tylosin.   All cattle were implanted with SYNOVEX. Tylosin and monensin
were both effective in improving feed efficiency, and the responses of the two
appeared to be additive.<p>

Monensin
decreased the dry matter (feed) required for gain in both the non-tylosin and
tylosin-fed groups.  Tylosin reduced the incidence of liver abscesses.
Monensin increased liver abscesses when tylosin was not fed.  All cattle were
typical for starting feedlot animals and were approximately 9 to 12
months of age.<P>

<b>SUMMARY:</b><P>
Hereford cattle were fed the combination of monensin and tylosin at 30 and 10,
90 and 30, and 150 and 50.g/ton of complete feed, respectively, for
approximately 160 days to determine the safety of the combination for
cattle.<P>
All cattle-but one, a control animal, survived the 160-day feeding period.   No
gross or microscopic treatment associated changes were observed in the cattle
at necropsy.  There were no changes in serum chemistry, hematology, and
urinalysis values which were regarded as being indicative of toxicity.   A dose
associated decrease in performance occurred during the first 56 days of
feeding, but the.cattle accommodated to the treatment and performance was as
good as or better than controls for the remaining feeding time.   It was
concluded from this study, that the combination of monensin and tylosin could
be fed at levels of 30 and 10 g/ton in complete feed with a 5X margin of
safety.<P>

Feedlot cattle were fed rations containing tylosin  (10 g/ton) and monensin (30
g/ton) for 141 days.   Selected animals were fed an additional two days with
medicated and/or non-medicated feed to provide 0, 24 and 48-hour withdrawal
samples.   No detectable residues of either tylosin or monensin were found in
any of the tissues assayed.   The assay sensitivities were &lt;0.l ppm for
tylosin and &lt;0.04 ppm for monensin.<P>
<b>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:</b><P>
<b>Design:</b><P>
One hundred ninety-two steers were randomly allotted to four treatments:   1)
control, 2) 10 g/ton tylosin, 3) 30 g/ton monensin and 4) 10 g/ton tylosin plus
30 g/ton monensin.  Each treatment consisted of two replications with 24 steers
per replicate.  The efficacy portion of this experiment continued for 141 days.
Selected cattle were slaughtered two days after the conclusion of the 
efficacy study so that tissue samples for 24 and 48-hour withdrawal intervals
were available for the safety study.  Since there were no drug residues in any
tissue at "0" day withdrawal, absolute human safety is assured.<P>
The regulatory analytical methods for detection of residues of the drug are
filed in the Food Additives Analytical Manual on display in the Public Records
and Document Center, Room 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland
20852.<P>
<b>Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The Food and Drug Administration has concluded that when used as directed
monensin and tylosin will be safe and effective for the claims in compliance
with Section 512 of the ACT.<P>

<B>Generic Name:</B> Mupirocin<p>
<B>Tradename:</B> BACTODERM&#174;<p>
<B>Marketing Status:</B> Rx<p>
<B>Date of Summary:</B> September 28, 1988<p>
<B>Indications for Use:</B><p>
BACTODERM&#174; Ointment is indicated for the topical treatment of canine bacterial
infections of the skin, including superficial pyoderma, caused by susceptible
strains of the following organisms: <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>&#160; and
<I>Staphylococcus intermedius.</I><p>
<B>Dosage and Administration</B><p>
Prior to treatment the lesion should be cleansed.<p>
BACTODERM Ointment should be applied to the affected area
twice a day. Apply a sufficient amount of ointment to completely cover the
affected area. The maximum duration of treatment should not exceed 30 days.<p>
<B>Efficacy:</B><p>
The effectiveness of BACTODERM for canine bacterial  skin infections was
demonstrated in experimentally induced infection models and a well-controlled
field study.<p>
<B>A. Pivotal Studies</B><p>
<B>1. Experimentally Induced <I>S. intermedius</I>&#160;Infection Study</B><p>
An experimentally induced <I>Staphylococcus intermedius</I>&#160;skin abrasion study was
conducted in dogs by Dr. R. Garg, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama. The study was
conducted as a double-blind, randomized, parallel group design.<p>
A total of 23 dogs were used in this study. Nine dogs were treated with
BACTODERM Ointment, nine with the vehicle ointment and five were non-treated
controls. The study model consisted of clipping the hair along the dorsal
midline and then shaving a two inch by two inch area. This area was surgically
scrubbed and then abraded. This abraded area was inoculated both topically and
intradermally with 2 ml of a 24-hour broth containing <I>Staphylococcus
intermedius</I>. Eight hours later, the sites were reinoculated topically.<p>
Treatment was initiated 48 hours after the initial inoculation and was
continued twice a day for five days. A thin layer of medication was spread
over the lesion.<p>
Bacteriological evaluation, the pivotal parameter, was performed on days 2,
4, 6, 7, 9, and 11. Clinical observations were made on days 1-7,
9 and 11. Two investigators independently evaluated the lesions for
swelling, pain, exudation, erythema and pruritus.<p>
Bacteriological results were based upon complete elimination of
<I>S. intermedius</I>&#160;from lesions. The antimicrobial effect of mupirocin
was evident as early as 48 hours after initiation of treatment. By the last day
of treatment, 78&#37; of the animals in the BACTODERM group were negative for the
challenge pathogen compared to 33&#37; for the vehicle. At 72 hours and 120 hours
post-treatment, 100&#37; of the animals treated with mupirocin were negative compared to
89&#37; and 78&#37; for the vehicle. At no time during the study was <I>S. intermedius</I>&#160;
eliminated from the no-treatment group.<p>
When the lesions were evaluated for complete healing, it was apparent that
BACTODERM treated lesions healed most rapidly. By five days post-treatment,
67&#37; of the lesions were completely healed in the BACTODERM group compared to
43&#37; for the vehicle ointment and 0&#37; for the no-treatment group.<p>
<B>2.  Field Study</B><p>
A clinical field study was initiated to determine the efficacy of BACTODERM
Ointment for the topical treatment of skin infections in dogs. A blind,
parallel group, multi-center trial was conducted wherein BACTODERM Ointment was
compared to the vehicle ointment containing no mupirocin. Animals enrolled in
the study were assigned treatment on a random basis with the medication
dispensed in coded, identical-appearing tubes according to a sponsor-generated
randomization schedule.<p>
Dogs of any breed and either sex with bacterial pustular dermatitis were
enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of infection was based upon clinical
signs and identification of a pathogen from the pre-treatment culture.<p>
Treatment consisted of cleansing the lesion(s) with a non-antimicrobial
solution followed by application of the medication.<p>
A sufficient volume of ointment was applied to cover the affected area twice
daily.<p>
Pre- and post-treatment cultures were required in all cases unless healing
precluded the availability of post-treatment culture. Clinical symptoms present
at the time of the pre- and post-treatment examinations were described in
detail, and in a large number of cases, photographs of the lesions were
obtained.<p>
A total of 17 investigators participated in this study. These investigators

Overall clinical response was judged according to the following criteria:<p><DL>
<DT><B>Cure:</B><P>
<DD>Clinical findings subsided in a reasonable period of time with no
evidence of infection at the time drug was discontinued nor during follow-up.<p>
<DT><B>Improvement:</B><P>  
<DD>Clinical findings subsided significantly in a reasonable period
of time but with incomplete resolution of evidence of infection, possible
related to underlying disease state.<p>
<DT><B>Failure:</B> <P> 
<DD>No apparent response to therapy.<p></DL>
Of the 57 evaluable pustular dermatitis cases in which <I>S. aureus</I>&#160;was isolated,
28 were treated with BACTODERM Ointment while 29 were treated with the vehicle
ointment. When the clinical response was judged to be a cure or improvement
and the bacterial isolate was eliminated, the case was classified as an animal
success. A 61&#37; (17/28) animal success rate was observed following treatment
with BACTODERM Ointment. The vehicle ointment resulted in an animal success
rate of 45&#37; (13/29).<p>
BACTODERM&#174; (mupirocin ointment 2&#37;) is identical to the product approved under a
New Drug Application (NDA &#35;50-591) for use on humans. Therefore, in accordance
with the Center for Veterinary Medicine's Guideline for Effectiveness
Evaluation of Topical/Otic Animal Drugs, additional dose determination studies
were not required.<p>
<B>B. Corroborative Studies</B><p>
<B>1. Experimentally Induced <I>S. aureus</I>&#160;Infection Study</B><p>
An experimentally induced <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>&#160;skin abrasion study was
conducted in dogs by Dr. Pat McKeever, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN.
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of BACTODERM Ointment
in reducing the bacterial numbers when compared to the vehicle ointment and a
no treatment control. The study was conducted as a double-blind, intra-subject,
randomized, parallel design.<p>
A total of nine dogs were used, three replicates of three dogs each. The study
compared BACTODERM Ointment, vehicle ointment and a non-treated control. The
two medications were packaged and labeled in such a manner as to insure
blinding.<p>
The infection procedure involved clipping the hair over the dorsal midline.
Abrasions were made to six areas of skin 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm on the back of each
dog. A Plexiglas rim was glued to the skin around each lesion. The lesion was
then inoculated with 3.25e5 <I>S. aureus</I>&#160;organisms. The inoculated area was
subsequently covered with a coverslip. Twenty-four hours later, quantitative
cultures were taken from each site and treatment was initiated. Treatment was
applied twice a day for five days. Quantitative cultures were obtained daily
prior to treatment.<p>
The total number of bacterial colonies for each treatment group starting 24
hours after the first treatment through 24 hours post-treatment was determined.
The BACTODERM Ointment had the lowest count with 2.87e3 followed by the
vehicle ointment (3.96e4) and the non medicated control (8.0 e 4).<p>
The bacterial elimination rate is shown in Table &#35;1. Within 24 hours of the
first dose, BACTODERM eliminated 94.1&#37; of the original <I>S. aureus</I>. The
antibacterial effect of mupirocin is apparent when this initial effect is
compared to the 47.6&#37; elimination rate for the vehicle and 39.9&#37; for the
control.<p>

<B>2. Experimentally Induced Skin Infection Model</B><p>
A series of experimentally induced skin burn models were conducted in dogs by
Dr. Pat McKeever, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN. <I>In vivo</I>&#160;activity against
three different pathogens was determined: <I>S. aureus</I>, beta-Streptococcus and <I>E.
coli.</I><p>
The studies were conducted in a double-blind, intra-subject, parallel,
randomized group design wherein BACTODERM Ointment was compared to the vehicle
ointment and non-treated controls. Each study consisted of three replicates of
four dogs each.<p>
The hair was clipped along the dorsal midline. Six second degree burns 1.9 cm
in diameter were made along the back of each dog. The burned areas were
scarified and a screw cap container glued to the surrounding skin. The lesions
were then inoculated with 1e3 organisms. Treatment was initiated 24 hours
later and was continued twice a day for three days. Quantitative bacterial
counts were obtained from each site on each dog 12 hours after the last
treatment.<p>
The bacteriological efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by the average
number of colonies of <I>S. aureus</I>&#160;per dog for each treatment day and the number
of sites per treatment group in which the quantitative count was over 100. The
BACTODERM Ointment group had the lowest average count with 77 compared to 549
for the vehicle and 528 for the control. BACTODERM also had the lowest number
of sites (3/24) in which the quantitative count was over 100 compared to the
vehicle (17/22) and the non-treated control (21/24).<p>
In the second leg of the study, beta-Streptococcus was used to demonstrate <I>in
vivo</I>&#160;antimicrobial activity. The average number of colonies of beta-Streptococcus per
dog for BACTODERM was 116 compared to 629 for the vehicle and 755 for the
control. In the number of sites in which the colony count was over 100, the
BACTODERM Ointment group had the lowest bacterial numbers (7/24) compared to 18
of 24 for the vehicle and 20/24 for the non-treated group.<p>
The third leg of the study utilized <I>E. coli</I>&#160; as the pathogen. The study design
was the same as the previous two studies with the exception that the treatment
duration was two days instead of three.<p>
The BACTODERM Ointment group had the lowest average colony count of <I>E. 
coli</I>&#160;(27) of the three test groups. The vehicle group had a colony count of 91 and
the non-treated group had 186. BACTODERM also had the fewest number of sites
in which the <I>E. coli</I>&#160; count exceeded 100 (2/24) while the vehicle had 18 of 24 and
the non-treated group had 20 of 24.<p>
<B>Animal Safety:</B><p><B>A. Pivotal Studies</B><p>
<B>1. Target Species Chronic Toxicity Study</B><p>
The objective of this study was to observe any toxic/irritating effects of
mupirocin when administered topically to mature dogs for a period of six (6)
consecutive weeks. The study was conducted by Dr. M.R. Gilman, LRE, Kalamazoo,
Michigan, under the direction of Dr. T.J. Keefe, Beecham Laboratories, Bristol,
Tennessee.<p>
Ten male and 10 female adult Beagle dogs were used. Two days prior to
treatment the dogs were divided into five groups, each consisting of two males
and two females.<p>
This study was an open evaluation of mupirocin utilizing three dosage levels of
the test drug (2, 6, and 10&#37;), a placebo group and a control group (no medication).
The ointment was administered topically to abraded skin lesions twice a day for
six weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: food consumption,
temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, general observations, fecal
consistency, body weight, lesion appearance, hematology, clinical chemistry and
urinalysis.<p>
The lesions were also evaluated for erythema, swelling and exudate using a
scoring system. One male and one female from each group were necropsied on day
43 of the study. The remaining dogs were necropsied on day 44. Gross and
histological evaluations were performed.<p>
No values were obtained which were considered to be clinically significant in
regard to body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, body weight and food
consumption.<p>
In regard to the dermal scoring, all levels of test material produced erythema
ranging from pink to deep red. The vehicle control and 2&#37; mupirocin produced
mild erythema. The non-treated group exhibited a scattered, mild erythema
showing some reaction to occlusion. Some edema was observed in all of the test
groups initially. With the exception of one dog in the 6&#37; mupirocin group,
there was only a scattered incidence of edema after day 26.<p>
Hematology, blood chemistries and urinalysis did not show any consistent
pattern of variations. Histopathological examination did not show any
meaningful differences in type or severity of reaction at the test article
application site between the five groups. All reactions at the application
sites were minimal to mild. Any intergroup differences were considered within
the range of normal biological variation.<p>
<B>B. Corroborative Studies</B><p>
<B>1. Acute Toxicity Studies</B><p>
<B>a. Acute Oral, Subcutaneous and Intravenous Toxicity in the Rat</B><p>
Acute single dose toxicity studies were conducted with mupirocin sodium by Dr.
T.L. Hardy, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England.<p>
Three male and three female rats were orally dosed at 5,000 mg/kg. There were
no deaths and all animals remained in a healthy condition throughout a 14-day
observation period. There were no abnormal findings at the post-mortem
examination.<p>
Three male and three female rats were dosed with 5000 mg/kg subcutaneously at a
volume of 1 mL/100 g bodyweight. There were no deaths and all animals remained in
a healthy condition throughout the 14-day observation period (except for marked
injection site irritation). There were no internal abnormalities at post-mortem
examination.<p>
Three male and three female rats were used in each of the dose groups discussed
below. In dose groups 3200 and 2560 mg/kg, all animals died within 50 to 130
seconds. In dose group 1310 mg/kg, one male and one female died approximately
ten minutes after dosing. One female in the 1048 mg/kg dose group died
approximately one hour after dosing. One male dosed at 734 mg/kg was found dead
on day 14; this death was not considered drug related.<p>
<B>b. Acute Oral Subcutaneous and Intravenous Toxicity in the Mouse</B><p>
Acute single dose toxicity studies in the mouse were conducted with mupirocin
sodium by Dr. T.L. Hardy, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex,
England. The mice were observed for 14 days. In the subcutaneously and
intravenously dosed mice, the kidneys were thought to be possible target
organs.<p>
<B>2. Subacute and Chronic Studies</B><p>
<B>a. Topical Repeat Dose Study</B><p>
Sixty-five male and 65 female rats were allocated to five treatment groups of
10 males and 10 females per group with an additional five animals of each sex
in the high dose and control groups. Mupirocin ointment was administered
topically to areas of shaved skin at dose levels of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg.
Animals were dosed with 2 ml/kg of the vehicle ointment alone and the other
group remained undosed.<p>
At the end of the 28 day treatment period, 10 animals from the high dose group
and ten from each of the control groups were left undosed for a withdrawal
period of 14 days.<p>
The treatment area of each rat was observed daily for erythema, eschar and
edema formation. After 28 days of treatment and after 14 days 'off-dose' as
appropriate, the rats were sacrificed an subjected to a detailed post-mortem
examination.<p>
There were no mortalities and no apparent local reaction to treatment.
Hematological examination revealed no changes considered to be treatment
related. No treatment related changes were found on organ weight analysis or
macroscopic pathological examination. Histopathology showed a dose related
incidence of parietal cell vacuolation in the stomachs of treated females which
was not present after the 14 day regression period. No evidence of a reaction
to treatment was seen at the application sites. This study was conducted by
Drs. A. Cockburn and D.J. White, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow,
Essex, England.<p>
<B>b. Oral and Subcutaneous Repeat Dose Study</B><p>
A 14-day repeat study in the rat was conducted with mupirocin sodium by Dr.
T.L. Hardy, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England.
Fifty male and 50 female rats were allocated to five treatment groups of 10
male and 10 female rats per group, plus an additional group of five male and
five female rats left undosed. Mupirocin sodium was administered subcutaneously
at levels of 100 and 500 mg/kg and orally at 100 mg/kg. Controls received
distilled water for the orally dosed rats and sterile saline for the rats dosed
subcutaneously. Dosing was carried out daily for 14 consecutive days.<p>
There were no treatment related deaths. Animals receiving 100 mg/kg orally and
subcutaneously showed no adverse external signs. At 500 mg/kg subcutaneously,
all animals had injection site pathology after three doses. There was no
adverse effects on the body weights and no treatment related changes were seen
in food and water intake or feed conversion.<p>
Hematological examination showed that rats receiving the 500 mg/kg subcutaneous
dose had a slight decrease in hemoglobin, PCV and red cell count, together with
an increase in total leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count. Orally
dosed females had slightly increased hemoglobin and red cell counts with a
decreased MCV.<p>
Blood chemistries showed that rats receiving the 500 mg/kg subcutaneous dose
had reduced SAP activity, total protein, albumin and A/G ratio together with
increased ALT activity. Males also exhibited increased glucose and decreased
potassium levels. Orally dosed rats exhibited no changes considered treatment
related.<p>
Post-mortem examinations revealed injection site pathology. Histopathologic
exam revealed a marginal increase in changes in the kidneys when compared with
controls in four of 12 animals receiving the high subcutaneous dose and two of
12 animals receiving the oral dose. A dose related increase was also seen in
the extent and severity of subcutaneous injection site reactions.<p>
<B>c. Subcutaneous Repeat Dose Study</B><p>
A three-month subcutaneous repeat dose study in rats was conducted with
mupirocin sodium by Drs. A. Cockburn and D.J. White, Beecham Pharmaceuticals
Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. Seventy males and 70 female rats were
allocated to four treatment groups of 15 males and 15 females per group, with
an additional five males and five females in control and high dose groups.
Mupirocin sodium was administered subcutaneously at dose levels of 10, 40 and
100 mg/kg. All animals were dosed for a minimum of 90 days; at the end of
dosing, five males and five females from the control and high dose groups were
left undosed for a withdrawal period of 28 days. At the end of the treatment
or withdrawal period, all animals were sacrificed and detailed post-mortem
examination performed.<p>
There were no treatment related deaths with the exception of one female in the
100 mg/kg group which was killed <I>in extremis</I>&#160;on Day 3 having been found in
poor condition. Treatment related alopecia and/or scab formation at all
injection sites was seen from Day 7 in the high dose group.<p>
Hematological examination showed no significant changes except for a slight
reduction in red cell parameters in treated females at the interim examination.
Blood chemistries showed a slight increase in ALT in intermediate and high dose
males at the terminal examination. Histopathological examinations showed no
changes considered to be related to treatment.<p>
<B>d. Repeat Dose Dermal Toxicity Study</B><p>
A 30-day repeat dose dermal toxicity study in the rabbit was conducted with
mupirocin by Dr. P. Varney, Hazleton Laboratories, Harrogate, North Yorkshire,
England. Thirty-one male and 31 female rabbits were allocated to five
treatment groups of five males and five females per group with an additional
two animals of each sex in the high dose and control groups. Mupirocin
ointment was administered topically to areas of shaved, abraded skin at dose
levels of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg. One control group was dosed with the vehicle at
2 ml/kg and the other control group remained untreated. Doses were applied
daily for 30 days, each dose remaining on the skin under an occlusive dressing
for a six-hour period.<p>
There were no treatment-related deaths or clinical signs. No treatment-related
changes in any of the hematologic or blood chemistry parameters were evident.
At the post-mortem examination, there were no macroscopic changes considered
treatment related. Histopathologic examinations revealed minimal acanthosis of
the epidermis and/or minimal leukocyte accumulation in the stratum corneum at
the treatment site in both the vehicle control and high dose test animals.
There were no findings in the other tissues examined to suggest an effect of
treatment.<p>
<B>e. Maximum Tolerated Subcutaneous Dose in Rabbits</B><p>
A maximum tolerated dose study was conducted in rabbits by Dr. A. Cockburn,
Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. Mupirocin
sodium was administered to five female rabbits by the subcutaneous route in
order to ascertain the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment commenced at 20 mg/kg
and the dose was doubled at three day intervals until a level of 640 mg/kg had
been achieved. Five female rabbits receiving sterile saline subcutaneously
served as controls. At the end of the dosing period, those animals treated
with mupirocin sodium were sacrificed and subjected to a detailed macroscopic
examination.<p>
There were no mortalities. Signs of irritation were apparent following
treatment at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Two rabbits showed evidence of darkened urine at
80 mg/kg. On terminal examination, subcutaneous hemorrhages were seen at the
injection sites. This study suggests that the maximum tolerated subcutaneous
dose of mupirocin sodium in rabbits is greater than 640 mg/kg.<p>
<B>f. Subacute Oral and Intramuscular Toxicity</B><p>
A study of the subacute (14 day) toxicity of mupirocin sodium administered by
the oral and intramuscular routes to squirrel monkeys was conducted by Dr. B.G.
Procter, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. <p>
Each of five study groups consisting of two male and two female squirrel
monkeys and the test animals received mupirocin sodium by either the oral or
intramuscular route. In both cases, two dose levels (50 and 150 mg/kg) were
investigated. Control animals received sterile saline via the intramuscular
route.<p>
There were no mortalities during the study and no signs of adverse effects of
treatment on the appearance or behavior of the animals. No treatment related
effects were seen on body weight or food consumption.<p>
At necropsy, no treatment related effects were seen. Comprehensive
histopathological examination of tissues and bone marrow revealed no definite
systemic toxic effects. Focal reactive inflammation and edema was observed at
the injection site.<p>
<B>g. Maximum Tolerated Oral and Intramuscular Dose in Squirrel Monkeys</B><p>
A maximum tolerated dose study was conducted in squirrel monkeys by Dr. J.
Hopkins, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England.
Mupirocin sodium was administered to three male and three female squirrel
monkeys which were allocated to three groups of one male and one female per
group. The mupirocin sodium was administered for four days at each of the
following incremental dose levels:  100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. At
the end of the treatment period, all animals were killed and subjected to a
detailed post-mortem examination.<p>
There were no mortalities. One hematological examination revealed decreased
red blood cell values with anisocytosis from Day 9 onward in the female
monkey dosed intramuscularly. Blood chemistries revealed that SAP activity was
variable in controls and orally treated monkeys. SGPT became elevated compared
with pre-dose values in both of the animals treated intramuscularly and the BUN
was slightly elevated in the male IM monkey at term. Post-mortem examination
revealed no abnormalities other than a change in liver color. Histological
abnormalities considered to be related to treatment included very minimal fatty
change in the liver of the two monkeys dosed orally. In both monkeys dosed by
the intramuscular route, there was minimal fat deposition in the livers, mild
tubular dilation in the kidneys and moderate inflammatory changes at the
injection site.<p>
The maximum tolerated dose for mupirocin sodium in the squirrel monkey was
therefore greater than 2000 mg/kg when given orally and between 1000 and
2000 mg/kg when given intramuscularly.<p>
<B>h. Repeat Dose Toxicity in Dogs</B><p>
A three-month intravenous repeat dose study in Beagle dogs with a 28-day off-dose
period was conducted by Drs. A. Cockburn and D.J. White of Beecham
Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. Twenty male and 20
female Beagle dogs were allocated to four treatment groups of four males and
four females per group with an additional two males and two females in the
control and high dose groups. Mupirocin sodium was administered intravenously
at dose levels of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg (reduced from 10, 40 and 80 mg/kg on Day
4). The control group received sterile saline under identical conditions.
All animals were dosed for a minimum of 91 days; two males and two females from
the control and high dose group were left undosed for a withdrawal period of 28
days.<p>
There were no deaths, but immediate and severe reaction to treatment (in
particular, muscular weakness, convulsions or ataxia) was evident in several
dogs at levels of 40 and 80 mg/kg. On lowering of these dose levels to 10 and
20 mg/kg, a reaction continued to be elicited until a reduced injection rate
was introduced for the affected animals on day 7. Apart from two isolated
incidences in these dogs and in an additional high dose dog showing reaction to
treatment after 27 days, there were no further adverse signs. All other dogs
remained unaffected by treatment.<p>
Body weight, food and water intake were all unaffected by treatment.<p>
Hematological analysis revealed a decrease in total leukocyte counts in most
intermediate and high dose males and the majority of females from all treated
groups. Blood chemistry tests showed an increase in A/G ratio in four high
dose males at terminal examination.<p>
Neither urinalysis nor ophthalmological examination revealed any changes
considered to be related to treatment.<p>
Macroscopic pathology, histopathology and organ weight analysis showed no
changes which were considered to be related to treatment.<p>
<B>3. Reproduction and Teratology Studies</B><p>
<B>a. Preliminary Teratology Study in the Rat</B><p>
A preliminary teratology study in the rat was conducted with mupirocin sodium
by Dr. T.L. Hardy, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex,
England. Fifty-four female rats were allocated to four groups of 12 animals
each and one group of six animals. Mupirocin sodium was dosed subcutaneously
at 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg beginning on day six of the gestation, but the
highest dose level was reduced to 375 mg/kg after the first dose due to severe
injection site reactions. The compound was administered from days 6-15 of
gestation inclusive. Control animals were treated with sterile saline under
identical conditions. On day 21 of gestation, the animals were sacrificed and
subjected to an internal macroscopic examination. There were no mortalities
and clinical signs were restricted to localized tissue reactions at the
injection site. There were no significant differences between mupirocin sodium
treated and control animals in regard to pregnancy rate, litter size, pre- and
post-implantation losses, fetal and litter weights and fetal sex ratios.<p>
<B>b. Effects of Subcutaneous Administration of Mupirocin Sodium on Pregnancy in
Rats</B><p>
A study was conducted to determine the effects of subcutaneous administration
of mupirocin sodium on the course and outcome of pregnancy in rats by Dr. A.
Cockburn, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. One
hundred twelve premated female rats were randomly allocated to four treatment
groups of 28 animals. Dosing of mupirocin sodium at 10, 40 and 200 mg/kg and
sterile saline as control was initiated on day six of gestation, but the high
dose level was reduced to 160 mg/kg after the first dose due to marked
injection site irritation. The compound was administered subcutaneously from
days six to 15 of gestation inclusive. Control animals received sterile saline
under identical conditions. On day 21 of gestation, all surviving animals were
sacrificed and a detailed macroscopic post-mortem examination was conducted.<p>
Mupirocin sodium when administered subcutaneously daily through the main period
of organogenesis at doses up to 160 mg/kg produced no overt toxicity or
evidence of any adverse effects on the growth and development of offspring <I>in
utero</I>.<p>
<B>c. Effect of Mupirocin Sodium on Peri- and Post-Natal Development of Rats</B><p>
A study was conducted to determine the effects of subcutaneous administration
of mupirocin sodium on the peri- and post-natal development of rats. This study
was conducted by Dr. A. Cockburn, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division,
Harlow, Essex, England. On day 14 of gestation, animals were allocated into
four treatment groups containing 22 rats. Mupirocin sodium was administered
subcutaneously at dose levels of 11.1, 44.2 and 106.7 mg/kg from Day 15 of
gestation to Day 25 <I>post-partum</I>&#160;inclusive. Control rats received sterile
saline under identical conditions.<p>
Mupirocin sodium had no effect on peri- and post-natal development at dose
levels up to and including 44.2 mg/kg. Pup survival was reduced in some
litters given 106.7 mg/kg, but the majority of litters was unaffected. Other
aspects of offspring development were normal at this dose level.<p>
<B>d. Fertility and General Reproductive Performance of Rats</B><p>
A study was conducted to determine the effects of mupirocin sodium on fertility
and general reproductive performance of rats. This study was conducted by Dr.
A. Cockburn, Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England.
The animals were allocated in four treatment groups each containing 28 male and
28 female rats. Mupirocin sodium was administered subcutaneously at dose
levels of 10, 40 and 100 mg/kg. The control group of animals received sterile
saline under identical conditions. Male rats were dosed for ten weeks before
pairing throughout the mating period and until successful littering was
achieved  by the females. Females were dosed for 15 days before pairing
throughout the mating period and through day 20 <I>post coitum</I>. For those animals
killed on Day 21 <I>post coitum</I>, and in the case of animals allowed to litter,
dosing continued throughout the littering and lactation period until Day 24
<I>post partum</I>.<p>
<B>F0 Generation</B><p>
Animals receiving 40 and 100 mg/kg showed signs of local irritation at the
injection site. Estrus cycles, mating performance, fertility and gestation
lengths did not vary with treatment. In animals allowed to litter naturally,
litter size, viability, growth and development of the young to weaning remained
unaffected by treatment. At termination, no signs of macroscopic internal
pathologic changes in males, females or offspring were found. It was concluded
that treatment with mupirocin sodium at dose levels of up to 100 mg/kg is
without significant effects of reproductive performance of the F0
generation.<p>
<B>F1 Generation</B><p>
Some effects on F1 female body weight gain at dose levels of 10, 40 and 100
mg/kg were recorded but these appeared to have no consequences in terms of
reproductive performance. At 100 mg/kg there was a suggestion of slightly
reduced recall ability in the F1 males. At the same dose, female offspring had
a significantly reduced performance in the righting reflex test. In all other
respects, development was essentially normal with no indication of effects on
the part of mupirocin sodium.<p>
<B>e. Effects on Pregnancy of Rabbits</B><p>
A study in rabbits was conducted with mupirocin sodium by Dr. T. L. Hardy,
Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. Sixty premated
female rabbits were divided into four groups each containing 15 animals.
Mupirocin sodium was administered subcutaneously at dose levels of 10, 40 and
160 mg/kg daily from Day 6 to Day 18 of pregnancy. Control animals received
physiological saline under identical conditions. On Day 29 of pregnancy, the
animals were sacrificed and subjected to extensive post-mortem examination.
Four animals at the 160 mg/kg dose showed injection site reactions. Three of
these animals aborted and were killed before day 29 of pregnancy because of
poor condition. In addition to these animals, one control animal and one dosed
at the 160 mg/kg aborted. The abortions in the high dose group animals were
clearly related to the poor general condition of the animals.<p>
There was no evidence of an adverse treatment related effect on the incidence
of major malformations, minor anomalies or skeletal variance.<p>
<B>4. Mutagenicity Studies</B><p>
A series of mutagenicity studies have been conducted by Beecham Pharmaceuticals
Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England. In bacterial tests, conventional AMES
agar plate assays have proved negative. In <I>S. typhimurium</I>, TA98 in liquid
culture and in a 'repair' test with <I>E. coli</I>&#160;very small responses, around 2-3
fold the control values, have occurred in the absence of metabolic activity.
These effects have been reported for other antibiotics whose mode of action is
inhibition of protein synthesis.<p>
Tests in higher organisms (i.e., yeast, mammalian cell culture, analysis of
human chromosomes <I>in vitro</I>&#160;and a micronucleus test in the mouse of
<I>in vivo</I>&#160;damage), no mutagenic effects have been seen. The latter tests
have been conducted using very high concentrations of the compound in relation
to the likely animal exposure.<p>
<B>5. Miscellaneous Studies</B><p>
<B>a. Eye Irritation Studies in the Rabbit</B><p>
A study was conducted by Hazleton Laboratories, Harrogate, North Yorkshire,
England, to determine the eye irritation in the rabbit. In this study, three
groups of three animals received 2&#37; mupirocin in the left eye. The eyes of one
group remained unrinsed after instillation, those of the second group were
irrigated after two seconds and the eyes of the third group were irrigated
after four seconds. The untreated right eye of each animal served as a
control.<p>
Mupirocin did not appear to cause any initial pain on instillation in the eye.
No iridal inflammation nor corneal opacity were seen during the study. Based
upon the results of this study, mupirocin in polyethylene glycol was classified
as non-irritating to the rinsed eye and as practically non-irritating to the
unrinsed eyes of rabbits.<p>
<B>b. Primary Skin Irritation in the Rabbit</B><p>
A study to determine the primary skin irritation in rabbits was conducted by
Hazleton Laboratories, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. Six rabbits were
used in this study. An area on the back of each animal was clipped. The left
side of the clipped area was left intact and the right side was abraded. Two
percent mupirocin ointment was applied to both skin sites and covered with
gauze pads.<p>
No adverse skin reactions were noted at either the 24 or 72-hour observation.
A primary irritation index of 0 was obtained, thus, it was concluded that a
single 24-hour application of mupirocin in polyethylene glycol ointment to
occluded rabbit skin was non-irritating.<p>
<B>c. Immunogenicity Studies in Laboratory Animals</B><p>
Intradermal sensitization studies in rats and contact sensitization studies in
guinea pigs were conducted with mupirocin by Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research
Division, Great Burgh, Surrey, England.<p>
Twelve rats were allocated into groups of six animals. One group received a
subcutaneous dose of 10 mg of mupirocin in Freund's complete adjuvant and six
intradermal doses of 1 mg of mupirocin in buffered saline. The control group
received the same volumes of the vehicles only. The animals were challenged
14, 21 or 28 days after the sensitizing dose.<p>
No erythema, induration or other adverse reactions were observed in animals up
to 48 hours after challenge at 14, 21 or 28 days after sensitization.
Mupirocin did not, therefore, induce cellular immunity in rats.<p>
Twelve male guinea pigs were allocated in two groups. One group was treated
with 100 mcl of a 0.1 molar solution of mupirocin applied topically to the
shaved flank. The other group was treated with the vehicle only. In each
case, a total of six applications in 12 days were made to the same site.
Animals were challenged 23 days after the first sensitizing dose on two sites
on the contralateral side. No erythema or adverse reactions were observed in
any of the sites tested in either group up to 48 hours after challenge.
Mupirocin was not considered irritant nor a contact sensitizing agent under
these conditions.<p>
Eighteen female guinea pigs were allocated in three groups of six animals. One
group was treated with a 0.3 molar solution of mupirocin, a second group was
treated with 3&#37; oxazolone solution as a positive control and the third group
was treated with the vehicle alone. One hundred microliters of the respective
solutions were applied topically to a site on the shaved flank six times during
a 12-day period. Animals were challenged 4, 6, 10 and 18 weeks after the
first sensitizing dose.<p>
Mupirocin had no local irritant effect on the skin. Four animals produced a
low level response to the highest challenge concentration although evaluation
of this response was complicated by a generalized erythema. Mupirocin provoked
a more pronounced response at the second challenge, but in subsequent
challenges, it caused a weak response in only one animal. From these studies,
mupirocin is considered to be a weak contact sensitizing agent in the guinea
pig.<p>
<B>d. Modified Draize Skin Sensitivity Study in the Guinea Pig</B><p>
A skin sensitization study in the guinea pig (modified Draize method) was
conducted with mupirocin by Hazleton Laboratories, Harrogate, North Yorkshire,
England.<p>
No adverse skin reactions were observed during the induction period. Five of
the animals previously induced with 2&#37; mupirocin ointment showed very slight
erythema 24 hours following the challenge application. No edema was noted at
this time. The skin response regressed and a very slight erythema was noted in
only one animal after a further 24 hours.<p>
These results indicate that mupirocin has some sensitizing potential in the
guinea pig.<p>
<B>e. Cardiovascular Toxicity Studies in Dogs</B><p>
A cardiovascular toxicity study in anesthetized Beagle dogs with mupirocin
sodium was conducted by Beecham Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Harlow, Essex,
England. Two male and one female Beagle dogs were anesthetized and set up to
measure systemic blood pressure and heart rate. Mupirocin sodium was
administered intravenously to the animals at a dose volume never exceeding 1
ml/kg body weight. One male and one female animal were given ascending doses
of mupirocin sodium at 30 minute intervals to assess the effect of increasing
doses on cardiovascular parameters. The male dog received doses of 5, 12.5,
25, 50 and 100 mg/kg; the female dog was dosed additionally at 2.5 mg/kg. The
third animal was dosed with the same lot of mupirocin sodium as the other two
animals at 25 mg/kg and the effect was compared to that of doses of 20 and 25
mg/kg of a new lot of mupirocin sodium.<p>
Mupirocin sodium at 5 mg/kg had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure. The
12.5 and 25 mg/kg doses caused hypotension and bradycardia. Increasing the
dose to 50 or 100 mg/kg had no greater effect than the 25 mg/kg dose. The
changes in heart rate and blood pressure were rapid in onset (within
approximately one minute of dosing) and were spontaneously reversible within
six minutes. ECG recordings revealed no abnormalities of wave form.<p>
<B>f. Local Irritancy Study in Rats</B><p>
A local irritation study in the rat was conducted by Beecham Pharmaceutical
Research Division, Harlow, Essex, England.<p>
Mupirocin sodium in sterile water was injected intramuscularly into the shaved
right thigh of rats at a concentration of 25 mg/2 ml or 250 mg/2 ml at a dose
volume of 0.2ml. Rats were given either one or seven daily injections followed
by one or seven days recovery. Sterile water was injected into the left thigh
muscle under identical conditions to act as  control.<p>
There was no apparent effect of treatment on the general clinical appearance of
any of the rats in the study. A dose related injection site reaction was
evident in these animals.<p>
<B>g. Effect of Mupirocin on Wound Healing in Pigs</B><p>
A study was conducted to determine the effect of mupirocin on epidermal wound
healing in pigs by Dr. William H. Ealgstein, University of Pittsburg, Pittsburg, PA.
Young domestic pigs were clipped and shaved. Approximately 100 rectangular
wounds were made in the paravertebral and thoracic area with a Castroviejo
Keratome. Daily thereafter for seven days, the wounds on each back were
treated with either mupirocin ointment, vehicle or received no treatment.<p>
By day 5, 100&#37; of the wounds treated with either mupirocin ointment or its
vehicle were healed as compared to 27&#37; of the untreated wounds. By day 6, all
untreated wounds had also healed. Thus, neither mupirocin ointment nor its
vehicle produced any inhibition of epidermal wound healing.<p>
<B>Human Safety:</B><p>
<B>A. Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption</B><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA. This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only on dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>
<B>B. Human Safety Considerations Other Than Food Safety</B><p>
No special human caution statement is needed.<p>
<B>Agency Conclusions:</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this New Animal Drug Application (NADA) comply
with the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the
implementing regulations. The data demonstrated that BACTODERM (mupirocin),
when used under its approved conditions of use, is safe and effective for the
topical treatment of canine bacterial infections of the skin, including
superficial pyoderma, caused by susceptible strains of <I>Staphylococcus
aureus</I>&#160;and <I>Staphylococcus intermedius</I>. <p>
This product is prescription because the expertise of a veterinarian is
necessary for diagnoses of the underlying etiologies resulting in the
conditions for which the product is indicated.<p>

<title>NADA 140-582 Oxytetracycline HCl</title>
</head>
<body><b>Freedom of Information Summary</b><P>
<b>I. Identification:</b><P>
<b>NADA Number:</b> 140-582<P>
<b>Sponsor:</b><P>         
Anthony Products Co.<br>
5600 Peck Rd.<br>
Arcadia, CA 91006<P>
<b>Generic Name:</b> Oxytetracycline HCl<P>
<b>Trade Name:</b> Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride Injection, 50 mg and 100 mg<P>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Over-the-counter; Prescription<P>
<b>Date of Approval:</b> March 15, 1988<P>
<b>II. Indications for Use:</b><P>
Oxytetracycline HCl (50 mg and 100 mg) is intended for use in the treatment of the
following diseases in beef cattle and non-lactating dairy cattle when due to 
oxytetracycline-susceptible organisms:<P>
<b>Cattle:</b><P>
In cattle, Oxytetracycline (50 mg and 100 mg) is indicated in the treatment of
pneumonia and shipping fever complex associated with <i>Pasteurella</i>&#160; spp. and
<i>Hemophilus</i>&#160; spp.; foot-rot and diphtheria caused by <i>Fusobacterium
necrophorum;</i>&#160;bacterial enteritis (scours) caused by <i>Escherichia coli;</i>&#160; 
wooden tongue caused by <i>Actinobacillus lignieresii;</i>&#160; leptospirosis caused by
<i>Leptospira pomona;</i>&#160; and wound infections and acute metritis caused by strains of
staphylococci and streptococci organisms sensitive to oxytetracycline.<P>
If the product contains the statement "Federal law restricts this drug to use
by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian," it may contain additional
directions for use in beef cattle and non-lactating dairy cattle for the
treatment of anaplasmosis caused by <i>Anaplasma marginale</i>&#160; and anthrax caused by
<i>Bacillus anthracis.</i><P>
<b>III. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><P>
<b>Dosage Form:</b><P>  Oxytetracycline HCl Injection (50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml) is
available in 500 ml and 100 ml multidose vials containing 50 mg or 100 mg
Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride per milliliter.<P>
<b>Route of Administration:</b><P>  Oxytetracycline Injection (50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml) is
administered intravenously.<P>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><P>  The intravenous injection of 3 to 5 mg of Oxytetracycline
HCl per pound of body weight per day is the recommended dosage.<P>

<b>IV. Animal Safety and Effectiveness:</b><P>
An in-vitro equivalence of biological activity was conducted using the
microbiological method of potency testing as described in USP XXI and comparing
this biological activity with that of the Pfizer product for both the 50 mg/ml
and the 100 mg/ml products.  The pioneer NAS/NRC/DESI product (Pfizer) is cited
in 21 CFR 522.1662a(c)(1).  These conditions are NAS/NRC/DESI reviewed and
deemed safe and effective.  Applications for these uses need not include 
effectiveness data as specified by 21 CFR 514.111. However,
satisfactory bioequivalency data were submitted in support of this approval.
The Anthony and Pfizer 50 mg/ml products were tested and found to contain 50.4
- 53.8 and 52.4 -55.5 mg/ml oxytetracycline HCl, respectively.  The 100 mg/ml
generic and Pfizer products were assayed and found to contain 100.5 - 105.5 and
108.3 and 113.4 mg/ml of oxytetracycline HCl, respectively.  This data is
satisfactory and meets our requirements for the establishment of
bioequivalency.  Since the drug is indicated for intravenous use only, the drug
is introduced directly into the blood stream and the bioavailability of the
drug is therefore assured.<P>

<b>V. Human Safety:</b><P>
The formulations for the 50 mg/ml and the 100 mg/ml drug products have been
evaluated and found chemically and microbiologically equivalent to the pioneer
100 mg/ml product.  Therefore, since the products are both chemically and
microbiologically equivalent and the fact that the products are indicated for
intravenous use only assuring biological equivalence with 100 mg/ml the pioneer
product, the 19-day withdrawal period for the pioneer product has been assigned
to these products.  Tissue residue data are not necessary.<P>
<b>VI. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this new animal drug application comply with
the requirements of 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Oxytetracycline
Injection 50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml when used under its proposed condition of use
are safe and effective for labeled indications.<P>
Approval of the application poses no increased human risk from exposure to
residues of oxytetracycline because the number of food producing animals
receiving medication will not significantly increase and because the drug is
already regulated at the requested use level.<P>
The prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) status is the same as the
pioneer's.  Therefore, this product is approved as an over the counter product
as well as a prescription product.<P>

<hr>
Introduction <p>

This summary includes all domestic adverse drug experience reports submitted to
the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) that the Center has determined to be at
least "possibly" drug related.  The Center's adverse drug experience (ADE)
process takes into consideration confounding factors such as:<p>

<UL>
	<LI>Dosage 
	<LI>Concomitant drug use 
	<LI>The medical and physical condition of animals at the time of treatment 
	<LI>Environmental and management information 
	<LI>Product defects 
	<LI>Extra-label-uses 
</UL>

However, the specifics of these complex factors cannot be addressed in this summary.<p> 

NOTE: This summary is intended ONLY as a general reference to the type of adverse
experience that veterinarians, animal owners, and others have voluntarily reported
either to the FDA or to the manufacturer as associated with drug use. This
summary should NOT be used for:<p>

<UL>
	<LI>Determining drug association for a particular sign 
	<LI>Determining the safety and efficacy of a given drug 
	<LI>Determining the frequency of occurrence of an adverse experience 
	<LI>Determining the effects of on-label versus extra-label use of a drug 
	<LI>Comparing one drug with another drug 
</UL>

Adverse experiences are listed by generic drug name. <p>

<h2>Adverse Drug Experience Reporting System</h2><p>


<B>Introduction</B> <p>

Veterinarians and animal owners are encouraged to report adverse experiences and
product failures to the government Agency that regulates the product in question.
Pretesting by the manufacturer and review of the data by the government does not
guarantee absolute safety and effectiveness due to the inherent limitation
imposed by testing the product on a limited population of animals.  CVM
encourages you to contact the manufacturer of a suspect product. Reporting
information for the following product categories:<p>

<B>1. Animal Drugs, Devices and Foods</B><p>

Veterinarians and animal owners may report adverse drug experiences to FDA by: <p>

A. <B>Submitting a FORM FDA 1932a</B>, "Veterinary Adverse Experience, Lack of
Effectiveness or Product Defect Report".  The 1932a is pre-addressed, prepaid
postage form that is completed and dropped in the mail.  A form may be obtained
by writing:<p>

      ADE Reporting System<br>
      Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
      U.S. Food & Drug Administration<br>
      7500 Standish Place<br>
      Rockville, MD 20855-2773<p>

The Center may occasionally need more detailed information about an incident and
the reporter may be called by a CVM staff veterinarian.<p>

B. <B>Telephoning the Center for Veterinary Medicine</B>: 1-888-FDA-VETS<p>

IMPORTANT: The identities all persons and animals is held in strict confidence by
FDA and protected to the fullest extent of the law.  The reporter's identity may
be shared with the manufacturer or distributor unless requested otherwise. 
However, FDA will not disclose the reporter's identity to a request from the
public, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.<p>


<B>2. Animal Biologics: Vaccines, Bacterins and Diagnostic Kits </B><p>

      U.S. Department of Agriculture <br>
      (800) 752-6255<p>


<B>3. Pesticides: Topically Applied External Parasiticides</B><p>

      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <br>
      (800) 858-PEST<p>


<B>4. USP Veterinary Practitioner's Reporting Network (USP PRN)</B><p>

Yet another option for reporting is the USP PRN, which is sponsored by the United
States Pharmacopeia.  The USP PRN is an independent, non-government reporting
program.  The phone number to reach USP regarding any veterinary product is (800)
4-USPPRN.<p>

<b>V.      Agency Conclusion:</b><u></u><br>
<u></u><br>
Approval of  this application is based on safety and effectiveness data
contained  in Elanco  Products  Company's approved NADA 012-491.   Use of  the
data  in NADA 012-491  to  support  this  application has  been authorized by
Elanco.   This approval does  not change the approved use of  the drug.
Consequently,  approval of this NADA poses no  increased human risk from
exposure  to  residues of  the animal drug,  nor does  it change the conditions
of the drug's  safe use in the  target animal species.   Accordingly, under
the Center for Veterinary Medicine's  supplemental approval policy  (42 FR
64367),  this  is  equivalent to  a Category II supplemental approval which
does not require reevaluation of  the safety and effectiveness  data  in  the
original approval<p>

<TITLE>FDA CVM BEGINNINGS</TITLE>

<H3>FDA CVM BEGINNINGS</H3>

<P>
<B>An Act Against Selling Unwholesome Provisions</B><br>

<I>WHEREAS some evilly disposed persons, from motives of avarice and filthy lucre, have
been induced to sell diseased, corrupted, contagious or unwholesome provisions, to the
great nuisance of public health and peace:</I><br>
 Be it therefore enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court
assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any person shall sell any such
diseased, corrupted, contagious or unwholesome provisions, whether for meat or drink,
knowing the same without making it known to the buyer, and being thereof convicted
before the Justices of the General Sessions of the Peace, in the county where such
offence shall be committed, or the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, he shall be
punished by fine, imprisonment, standing in the pillory, and binding to the good
behavior, or one or more of these punishments, to be inflicted according to the degree
and aggravation of the offence.<br>
[Massachusetts law of 1785]
<P>
The regulation of food in the United States dates back to 1784, when Massachusetts
enacted the first general food law.  National drug control began in 1848 with the
Import Drugs Act.  This was the first Federal statute designed to guarantee the quality
of medicines.  In 1850, the first Pure Food and Drug Law was passed by the State of
California.  Eventually, most of the other states enacted similar legislation.	 
<P>
In 1880, after a year's investigation into food and drug adulteration, Mr. Peter
Collier, Chief of the Division of Chemistry at the USDA, began advocating enactment of
a national food and drug law.  Mr. Collier was succeeded in 1883 by Dr. Harvey W.
Wiley, who embarked on a long and stormy crusade for reforms.
<P>
In 1906, the first Federal Food and Drug Act was signed into law by President Theodore
Roosevelt.  The Act was administered by USDA's Bureau of Chemistry; it prohibited the
interstate shipment of adulterated or misbranded food, drinks, and drugs.  The
practices existing in the food industry at that time were reflected in the restrictions
spelled out by the Act.  In essence, food was declared adulterated, or unfit for
consumption if:
<P>
<I>...it is mixed or packed with another substance so as to reduce or lower or injuriously
affect its quality and strength if any substance has been substituted wholly or in
part; if any valuable constituent has been wholly or in part abstracted, if it has been
colored, powdered, coated, or stained to conceal damage or inferiority; if poisonous or
deleterious substances have been added; if it consists wholly or in part of filthy,
putrid, or decomposed animal or vegetable substance, or any portion of an animal unfit
for food; or if the product is from a diseased animal or one that died otherwise than
by slaughter.</I>
<P>
Dr. Carl I. Alsberg, who succeeded Dr. Riley as USDA's Chief Chemist in 1912, initiated
the regulatory and research function of the Bureau of Chemistry with an investigation
of drug labeling to determine if the claims were false or misleading.  By 1921,
attention was directed toward truthful labeling as it applied to quantity information,
such as "net weight," particularly in wrapped meats.
<P>
In 1927, a separate law enforcement agency was formed, known first as the Food, Drug,
and Insecticide Administration, and later as the Food and Drug Administration.  The
agency employed its first veterinarian, Dr. Henry Moskey, to evaluate vitamins and
minerals in light of their claimed nutritional and treatment uses.
<P>
In 1938, the more stringent and inclusive Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
was enacted.  For the first time, manufacturers were required to provide evidence of
product safety before distributing new drugs.  The Act also granted FDA explicit
authority to conduct factory inspections and to use court injunctions as enforcement
tools, in addition to prior penalties of seizure and prosecution.  Other provisions
stipulated the establishment of acceptable tolerances for unavoidable poisonous
substances.
<P>
FDA was transferred in 1940 from USDA to the Federal Security Agency, and the Office of
Commissioner of Food and Drugs was established.
<P>
The Durham-Humphrey Amendment of 1951 required that human drugs which cannot be safety
used without medical supervision must be dispensed only on the prescription of a
licensed practitioner, and must bear the Rx legend.  The veterinary prescription legend
was subsequently effected through a rulemaking procedure.
<P>
In 1953, the Federal Security Agency became part of the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare (DHEW), and the following year FDA was organized into five Bureaus,
including a Bureau of Medicine.  With the establishment of this Bureau, a Veterinary
Medical Branch was created with Dr. John Collins as the first chief.  The Branch's
primary function was to determine the safety of animal drugs, both for animals and for
consumers of food derived from treated animals.
<P>
The great expansion in the development and use of animal drugs and medicated feeds
during this period presaged the increasingly prominent role that veterinary medicine
was to play in FDA and in animal and human health.  By 1959, the Veterinary Medical
Branch had developed into a Division headed by Dr. Charles G. Durbin.  The Food
Additive Amendments of 1958 expanded regulatory authority over animal food additives
and drug residues in animal-derived foods.
<P>
Enactment of the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962 brought the most significant
and sweeping changes in the Act since its passage 24 years earlier.  These Amendments
authorized FDA to monitor the clinical trials of investigational drugs and strengthened
the agency's factory inspection authority.  For the first time, manufacturers were
required to test new drugs for effectiveness as well as safety before clearing them for
marketing.  The Amendments also imposed a retroactive efficacy requirement for drugs
previously approved for safety alone.  Furthermore, the Amendments required
manufacturers to report promptly to FDA any adverse reaction or effects and other
clinical experience relative to the safety and efficacy of drugs already on the market.
 Additional provisions stipulated that new drugs may not be cleared for marketing if
the labeling is in any way false or misleading.
<P>
Animal drugs were regulated under three sections of the Act.  They were first regulated
as either new drugs under Section 505, or as antibiotics under Section 507.  If used in
the feed for drinking water of food-producing animals they were, in addition, regulated
as food additives under Section 409.  
<P>
In September 1965, recognizing the importance of animal health to the welfare of the
country, the Secretary of DHEW established the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine (BVM). 
Dr. M.R. Clarkson was the Bureau's first director.  In 1968, the Act was amended to
include the animal drug provisions of each of these Sections under a new Section 512.
<P>
In 1984,  BVM became the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).

 BACKGROUND 
</a></B>
<p>
The use, in accordance with label directions,  of the approximately 40 animal
drugs approved for use in lactating dairy cows presents consumers with a
negligible risk from residues in milk (<B>footnote 1:</B> Additional animal drugs may be given to lactating cattle by veterinarians).

under the Center for Veterinary Medicine's Extra Label Drug Use Policy.  The eleven
approved drugs used to treat mastitis and respiratory infections -- penicillin,
ampicillin, cephapirin, hetacillin (<B>footnote 2:</B> Residues of hetacillin are almost 
immediately and completely metabolized to
ampicillin following administration to animals, and for this reason, are not
normally considered in drug residue monitoring programs.), 

amoxicillin, ceftiofur,
oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, novobiocin, erythromycin, and
sulfadimethoxine -- are among the most widely used drugs to treat dairy cows.
The first five can cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people.  Because of
this, residues of beta-lactam type antibiotics are of greatest concern from the
standpoint of human food safety.<P>
Prior to 1991, the only required monitoring of raw milk for animal
drug residues was described in Section 6 of the <i>Grade A Pasteurized Milk
Ordinance</i> (PMO).  It states, "...drug tests on each producer's milk shall
be conducted [by State regulatory agencies] at least four times during any
consecutive 6 months."  The tests accepted at that time by the National
Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (NCIMS) for Section 6, PMO, testing
were the Difco <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus</i> Disc Assay (BSDA), the
generic BSDA described in Appendix G of the PMO, the Charm I and II Liquid
Tests, and the Delvo Test P.<P>

 DEFINITIONS
</a></B>
<p>
The following definitions are important to the understanding of the
evaluation and use of milk antimicrobial drug screening tests:  <P>
A.    A <b>truly positive test result </b>is a positive test result on a milk sample in which the actual drug
concentration is at or above the established tolerance or safe level.<P>
B.   A <b>false violative test result</b> is a  positive test result on a milk sample in which the actual drug
concentration is at or above the detectable concentration, but below the
established tolerance or safe level.  
<P>
C.  A <b>false positive test result</b> is a positive test result on a
milk sample which actually contains no drug residue at a detectable
concentration.<P>
D.  A <b>false negative test result</b> is a negative test result on a
milk sample which contains drug residue at a detectable concentration.<P>
E.  The <b>sensitivity rate</b> is the percentage of truly positive
samples that are found by the test to be positive.  <P>
F.  The <b>selectivity rate</b> is the percentage of truly negative
samples that are found by the test to be negative.  <P>
G.  The <b>estimated minimum ninety percent sensitivity level</b> is the
estimated lowest drug concentration which gives, with 95 percent confidence, a
positive result with the test at least 90 percent of the time on samples which
are truly positive.<p>

<B>
<a name="RTFToC3">III.
 APPENDIX N, PASTEURIZED MILK ORDINANCE
</a></B>
<p>
At their 1991 biennial meeting, the National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments (NCIMS) passed a resolution modifying the PMO to require the contents
of every bulk milk pick-up truck tanker to be tested for beta-lactam residues
prior to entering the food supply.  This change in the PMO, which was
identified  as Appendix N, created a need for rapid, reliable screening tests
that could detect residues of beta-lactam antibiotics in milk when present at
or above the concentrations established by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to be safe.<P>
In part because Appendix N, PMO, required methods used in monitoring programs
to "have been evaluated through AOAC and accepted by FDA," the Agency began the
evaluation program in cooperation with the AOAC International-Research
Institute (AOACI-RI) and the A. D. Little, Inc. (A. D. Little, Inc. is no
longer participating in the evaluation program). These firms served as
independent third parties in the initial evaluation.  <P>
A protocol was developed for the evaluation of the tests for detecting
antibiotics in raw, bulk, commingled milk.  This protocol was developed with
cooperation and input of representatives of all interests of the milk industry.
Since the NCIMS (Appendix N, PMO) required monitoring at the truck tanker, the
protocol was only for raw, bulk, commingled milk and not for milk from
individual cows.<P>
The selectivity and sensitivity data developed by the test sponsors were
verified in an independent laboratory.  The selectivity standard used requires
tests to correctly identify, with 95 percent confidence, milk containing no
drug residues in 90 percent of the samples (90/95).  The initial sensitivity
standard required the tests to detect milk containing residues of claimed drugs
at their tolerance/safe levels 90 percent of the time with 95 percent
confidence.  A test could meet these standards by correctly identifying 30 of
30 zero control samples and 30 of 30 samples containing each claimed drug at
its tolerance/safe level.  With this selectivity standard for acceptance, the
probability is low that an accepted screening test would produce a positive
result on a milk sample that does not contain any of the drug it is designed to
detect. <P>
Although the only standards FDA established for acceptance of tests were those
for selectivity rate and sensitivity rate, other parameters of test performance
were also evaluated in the joint program, and the sensitivity was validated
with incurred residues in milk.  Parameters studied include:  effect of the
presence in milk of PMO-permitted levels of bacteria and somatic cells;
possible interference of other classes of animal drugs which might be present
as residues in milk; the percent of positive results to be expected from a test
when milk containing residue levels below a drug's tolerance are assayed (dose
response)(false violative test results); and ruggedness testing provided for
the evaluation of variation in times, volumes, temperatures, etc. in the
directions for operating the test that would impact the performance of each
test.  In requiring the incurred residue parameter, milk from animals receiving
the different drugs are evaluated using the tests.  This requires that the
tests detect the incurred residues at the tolerance/safe level with the
concentration in the milk being quantitatively determined by a chemical test.
The objective of including these parameters of test performance is to insure
that manufacturers of FDA accepted tests provide potential users with as much
information as possible about the performance of a given test.  This enables
individual users to make informed decisions about which test is the best one
for them to use and also to encourage test manufacturers to develop improved
tests.<P>
To date, 17 screening tests for beta-lactam residues, one test for
chloramphenicol, and one test for sulfonamide residues in milk have been
accepted by FDA, certified as "performance tested" by AOACI-RI, and/or accepted
by A.D. Little, Inc.  These tests are also accepted by the NCIMS for Appendix
N, PMO, testing.  The attached Chart contains the tolerance/safe levels for
approved beta-lactam drugs and the 90/95 percent sensitivity levels for
accepted tests.(<B>Footnote 3:</B>  The BSDA described in Appendix G and discussed above as having
been evaluated earlier by AOAC, was widely used in the years prior to 1991.
The test was available as a complete kit from Difco Laboratories, but some
testing facilities used a generic BSDA made in-house from agar, spores,
standards, etc. obtained from Difco or from other sources.  The BSDA listed in
the attached Chart is a complete kit manufactured by Charm Sciences, Inc.
Neither the Difco BSDA nor any generic BSDA was submitted for inclusion in the
Agency's initial evaluation of the BSDA test.  Under the provisions of Appendix
N, any version of the BSDA that has not been accepted by FDA should no longer
be used to monitor tanker truck milk.  <p>

<B>
<a name="RTFToC4">IV.
 BACILLUS STEAROTHERMOPHILUS DISC ASSAY (BSDA)
</a></B>
<p>
Appendix G of the PMO presently recognizes a generic BSDA.  The BSDA is a
microbiological test based on growth inhibition to detect antibiotic presence.
Performance of the BSDA was evaluated in 1982 in an AOAC collaborative study
using <b>only</b> penicillin.  A 16 mm zone was accepted as the standard
for a violative result.  A positive test result with this test indicates that
an inhibitor is present in the milk.  It does not provide the identity nor
quantity of the inhibitor.  In addition to penicillin, this BSDA procedure has
been demonstrated to detect residues of ampicillin, cephapirin, and amoxicillin
at or below safe levels.  The test also detects residues of ceftiofur at
slightly above its level of concern for misuse.<P>
Charm Sciences and Difco Laboratories market a complete BSDA kit.  The Charm
Sciences' test has been evaluated and accepted for Appendix N monitoring.
Difco recently decided to have its test evaluated.  At this time, the Difco
BSDA is not accepted for Appendix N, PMO, testing.  <P>
At the 1995 meeting of the NCIMS, all the tests accepted for milk monitoring
under the provisions of Appendix N, PMO, were also accepted for Section 6, PMO,
testing (producer bulk tank).  The Difco BSDA, the Delvo Test P 5 Pack, the
generic BSDA described in Appendix G, PMO, and the Charm I and II Liquid tests
are accepted for use on farm bulk tank samples but not Appendix N, PMO, tanker
truck samples.  These tests have not passed the performance standards of the
Appendix N, PMO, tests, and their use in regulatory decisions is an issue that
is expected to be an item for consideration by the NCIMS. (Note:  The Charm I
and II Liquid tests are no longer manufactured).<p>

 SENSITIVITY STANDARD
</a></B>
<p>
Since the screening tests give positive results at drug concentrations below
the tolerance/safe level, there have been a number of questions regarding the
acceptance of the tests.  These comments have inferred that tests should not
have been accepted by the NCIMS as they were to have been evaluated exactly "at
the safe level or tolerance" (Appendix N, PMO).<P>
The original evaluation required a determination of a 90/95 percent
concentration at or below the tolerance/safe level.  All the evaluations have
included the tolerance/safe level.  Had FDA not accepted tests which give a
positive result at drug concentrations below the tolerance/safe level, none of
the tests would have been accepted (including the current Section 6, PMO,
tests).  The current state of screening test technology is inadequate for this
level of precision.  <P>
All the tests have a characteristic sigmoid response curve.  This means that as
drug concentration increases, there is also a corresponding increase in percent
positives until you reach a concentration plateau after which all samples will
be positive.  In the original evaluations, only a minimal number of assays were
required at the lower concentrations.  The Food and Drug Administration
originally established a sensitivity rate standard requiring a test to give 90
percent positive results with 95 percent <P>
confidence on milk samples containing drug concentrations at or below the
tolerance/safe level.  All the tests met this standard for each drug claimed on
the label.  When the data were presented to the NCIMS, they requested that the
test sponsors provide data which define the dose response at the lower drug
concentrations with equal confidence as the 90/95 percent level.  These data
provide the means to determine the <b>estimated minimal 90 percent
level</b>, with 95 percent confidence.  The development of these data is
nearing completion and will be reflected on revised labeling for each test.
The FDA remains convinced that the dose response information is important to
the user in deciding on the test to use.  This information is on the label of
each accepted test.<P>
Ideally, the accepted tests should give no positive results when there are drug
residues below the tolerance/safe level (false violative test result). Equally
desired is for the tests to give a positive result 100 percent of the time when
the drug concentration is exactly at or above the tolerance/safe level (no
false negative test results).  The screening tests evaluated to date do not
perform in this manner.  They do not "turn on and off" precisely at the
tolerance/safe level.<p>

QUESTIONS/ISSUES ON PERFORMANCE OF THE CURRENTLY ACCEPTED TESTS
</a></B>
<p>
There is no ideal screening test currently available for detecting
antimicrobial drug residues in milk (see attached Chart).  None of the
beta-lactam tests detect all the beta-lactam drugs.  Some have the 90/95
percent sensitivity level for specific drugs below the tolerance/safe level,
and all give false violative test results.  These multi-residue tests are
developed to be sensitive to at least four of the beta-lactam drugs at their
tolerance/safe level.  Each multi-residue test, <b>including the
BSDA</b>, detects one or more drugs at levels below their tolerance, and
each test fails to detect one or more approved beta-lactam drugs at their
tolerances.  There is a consumer concern when a test is used which does not
detect all the beta-lactam drugs because milk might contain residue that has
not been shown to be safe.  The above is also true for the sulfonamide test.<P>
The rejection of safe milk is an economic issue for the milk producer.
Currently the NCIMS accepted screening tests, including the BSDA, produce
positive results on a certain proportion of samples which contain below
tolerance/safe level concentrations of residues (false violative test results).
For example, a test that demonstrates a 90/95 percent sensitivity of 10 ppb for
residues of ampicillin, might produce a positive result on 40 percent of the
samples with 4 ppb, etc.  Of course, the number of truck tankers that would be
rejected because of this detection characteristic of screening tests is a
function of the number of truck tankers that arrive at a processor containing 4
ppb of ampicillin.  Our best estimates of this number is that it is low.  To
help test users select the most appropriate test for their situation and
minimize the number of false violative test results, the Agency requires
concentration-response data to be placed on the labels of all accepted
screening tests. <P>
Furthermore, it is obvious from Chart that different tests demonstrate
different sensitivities toward the six approved beta-lactams.  It is not
surprising therefore, that the action of replacing the single official BSDA
(Appendix G, PMO) with 17 different, more reliable, and some more sensitive,
accepted beta-lactam tests has resulted in some confusion.  For example, the
same sample of milk could produce different results when tested by different
receiving stations, processors, or State regulatory agencies, that do not
employ the same test.  <P>
Recognizing the economic importance of false violative test results to the milk
producer, the Agency and the NCIMS agreed to a procedure whereby all truck
tankers found to have a positive test result in their initial screening test
must be confirmed using a procedure to reduce the incidence of false positive
and false violative test results.  This is actually a retesting of the positive
sample using the same test when the initial test is conducted by the industry
analyst.  This retesting includes the following:  <p>
    

<pre>
1.  Positive control sample -- Ensures that truly positive milk 
    will test positive.
2.  Negative control sample -- Ensures that truly negative milk 
    will test negative.
3.  Two truck tanker samples -- For the truck tanker to be rejected, 
    one of the retests must be positive.  
</pre>
<p>
In the example of the test described above, the follow-up testing procedure
would reduce the chance of finding a positive truck tanker with milk containing
4 ppb of ampicillin from 40 to 26 percent.  Some comments have criticized this
procedure because of use of the term "confirm."  The purpose of the retesting
is to reduce the number of false violatives.  <P>
The following are other issues for consideration in forming an opinion
regarding the use of milk residue screening tests: <P>
1.  Milk producers rarely, if ever, treat their entire herd with an antibiotic.
Rather, in most instances, a few cows are treated at the same time.  Following
the milk discard time, the milk from a few treated cows is commingled in the
farm bulk tank with a greater amount of milk from untreated animals.  Farm bulk
tank milk is normally further diluted with milk from several farms while being
transported to a milk processing plant where it is tested.  The effect of this
dilution virtually eliminates the possibility that truly positive truck tanker
milk will occur when drugs are used in an approved manner.  For a test to give
a positive result, even if it is a false violative test result, the drug
<b>generally</b> must have been misused in the cow(s) that contributed
the milk containing residues at a high enough concentration to contaminate the
truck tanker.  A positive test result on a truck tanker sample is an indication
that the producer whose milk caused the positive truck tanker test offered milk
for sale which was above the recommended tolerance/safe level (regulatory
action level).  Follow-up testing on producer samples and on-farm
investigations confirm this conclusion.  <b>The proper use of approved
animal drugs in individual dairy cows does not cause the accepted screening
tests to produce a truly positive truck tanker result as some may
suggest.</b>  <P>
    In accordance with the provisions of Appendix N, PMO, all positive test
results must be investigated.  As a false violative test result is a possible
outcome from the monitoring of milk with screening tests and based on a case by
case review of each investigation, additional testing and/or investigation may
be justified.<P>
2.  An objective of the National Drug Residue Milk Monitoring Program (NDRMMP)
is to estimate the incidence of non-beta-lactam drug residues.  This objective
is being accomplished through use of screening tests for other animal drugs
which have neither been evaluated nor accepted for use in Appendix N type
monitoring programs.<P>
    Some have misinterpreted data from FDA's NDRMMP to conclude that the screening
tests used in this program produced an 85.6 percent false positive rate.  This
is a misrepresentation of the data.  These quarterly reports include any
screening test samples submitted by the states to FDA for confirmation as well
as the NDRMMP samples.  Those samples previously found to be positive by
screening tests are reported as violative as determined by chemical tests only
when the drug concentration is found to be at or above the tolerance/safe
level.  The majority of the screening test positive samples (presumptive
positive result) have been found to contain detectable concentrations of drug;
these are false violative test results.  This misleading report of a 85.6
percent false positive results includes those samples found to contain drug
concentrations below the tolerance/safe level but not reported as violative.
Except for the beta/lactam samples, all confirmed positive test results are
based on a chemical test.     <P>
3.  The FDA funds a contract under which State milk regulatory agencies report
the results of milk monitoring in their states.  The proportion of reported
positive loads throughout the country has been very low.  In 1994, there was
3.2 million truck tanker loads tested with 0.063 percent found positive (63 of
each 100,000 truck tankers).  The milk rejected for human food totaled
approximately 68 million pounds which is approximately 0.044 percent of the
milk supply.  These numbers represent the maximum percent of positive test
results at or above the tolerance/safe level plus false violative and false
positive test results.  <P>
4.  Several reports in the scientific literature describe the presence 
of "natural defense secretions" in milk from mastitic cows that will produce
positive screening test results on milk from cows that have not been treated
with any animal drug.  These data indicate that certain screening tests produce
false positive test results in milk from individual cows secreting  these
natural inhibitors.  Some authors have attempted to apply the false positive
rates obtained in milk from individual cows to samples from truck tankers
containing commingled milk derived from many cows.  The FDA believes these are
invalid comparisons as the data reported would not support a conclusion that
false positive milk from one or several cows produces a false positive test
result in truck tanker milk.  Using the level of somatic cells as an indicator
of the presence of natural inhibitors, none of the research and test
evaluations conducted at FDA has revealed an effect on test performance from
natural inhibitors unless the milk has a somatic cell count that exceeds
several million - many times the level of these cells permitted under the
PMO.<p>

<B>
<a name="RTFToC7">VII.
TRULY POSITIVE, FALSE POSITIVE, OR FALSE VIOLATIVE TEST RESULT
</a></B>
<p>
Prior to the implementation of milk testing in accordance with the provision of
Appendix N, PMO, the milk processors, who carry out the testing, acknowledged
that some positives could result from residue concentrations that are below the
tolerance/safe level.  However, since they advised FDA that they do not want
<b>any</b> antibiotic residues in their products, they indicated they
were prepared to accept some false violative results.  <P>
Based on the levels of drug residues expected to be in milk from individual
cows following recommended milk discard periods for approved drugs, the use of
animal drugs in accordance with label directions does not cause a truly
violative result in truck tanker samples when using an accepted screening test.
There is the small possibility that when using an approved beta-lactam drug in
accordance with label directions on an entire herd with that herd being the
only one represented on a given truck tanker, a positive result is possible.
The FDA believes the probability of this scenario happening is remote as herd
treatment for mastitis is a rare event.  There is also the possibility of a
positive screening test result for chlortetracycline when administered via the
feed on a herd basis.<P>
<b>It is important to understand that a truly false positive, false
negative, or false violative test result can only be determined by a chemical
analysis of the milk sample.</b>  A determination of the true status of a
positive sample, before the milk enters the food chain, requires that:<P>
1.  Each positive tanker be held for further chemical analysis to determine the
drug and concentration.  This would prove to be impractical because of the time
and cost involved.  <P>
2.  Screening tests of increased capability be accepted for screening truck
tankers.  Current state of the art for practical, inexpensive tests, does not
permit an identification of the drug nor determination of concentration.  In
the meantime, the NCIMS screening tests are the best technology available.<p>

<a name="RTFToC8">VIII.
 MILK DISCARD TIME ON APPROVED DRUG LABELS
</a></B>
<p>
Milk discard time is the number of hours after treatment that are required for
residues in milk to reach the tolerance/safe level.  The milk discard time is
<b>not </b>the point at which residues can no longer be detected with
the chemical tests or some screening tests.  Currently, milk discard times are
established using a chemical test; the accepted milk screening tests do not
have the required analytical characteristics to establish official milk discard
times. <p>

<a name="RTFToC9">IX.
EVALUATION OF SCREENING TESTS FOR USE IN MILK FROM INDIVIDUAL COWS
</a></B>
<p>
The FDA announced in 1993 its interest in developing a protocol for the
evaluation of screening tests for milk from individual cows.  A number of
meetings were held involving representatives of the industry, including the
National Mastitis Council.  A protocol was designed using the same
administrative procedures as for the accepted tests for commingled milk with
the test manufacturers paying for the evaluation.  As there is no regulatory
requirement for the testing of milk from individual cows, the manufacturers saw
no economic incentive to have their tests evaluated; and consequently, no tests
have been evaluated under this protocol.<P>
Given FDA's view of the importance of having reliable, independently evaluated
tests available for use by the producer/practitioner in milk from individual
cows, the Agency decided to fund an evaluation of the tests.  Recognizing the
screening tests which had already been evaluated for commingled milk and the
parameters included in that evaluation, FDA developed a different protocol
using the selectivity and mastitis concerns as parameters for additional
evaluation.  This revised protocol was also reviewed by representative of the
National Mastitis Council.  The protocol addresses the issues of false positive
test results in milk from individual cows which are healthy and have not been
treated with drugs and also a mastitis model to address the issue of cows
recovering from mastitis.  In the mastitis model study, the tests must give the
correct result on a milk sample from healthy cows and also on visually normal
milk following recovery from an endotoxin challenge in the udder.  The tests
must also give the correct response on the visually normal milk when claimed
drugs are added.  The Agricultural Research Service at the United States
Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD  is conducting the studies under an
Interagency Agreement with the Center for Veterinary Medicine.  Test
manufacturers requested that nine of the accepted beta-lactam tests be
evaluated.  The selectivity study section of the protocol has been completed.
The mastitis model study was completed in 1995.  The FDA expects to issue a
report on these studies in the spring of 1996. <P>
As screening tests can detect drug concentrations below the tolerance/safe
level, a positive test result is possible with a screening test on a milk
sample collected from cows after the labeled milk discard time.  For this
reason, FDA does not recommend the use of screening tests on cows which have
been individually treated in accordance with label directions.  It should be
noted, however, that these lower concentrations will not cause a violative or
non-violative positive truck tanker except in those exceptions described
previously.  If it is desirable to have no detectable residue in milk from
individual cows, then testing with a screening test until the sample is
negative is a viable option.  To preclude the possibility of a truck tanker
positive result, screening tests may also be used in milk from individual cows
treated in an extra-label manner. <p>

<B>
<a name="RTFToC10">X.
 STATE OF THE ART
</a></B>
<p>
The FDA recognizes that screening tests for detecting antimicrobial drugs in
milk are neither drug specific nor quantitative in their performance.  A
positive test result means that something in the milk caused this outcome.  The
evaluation protocol used provides ample assurance that a positive test will
result when the drug claimed on the label is in the sample at concentrations at
or above the tolerance/safe level.  Similarly, FDA is confident that the test
result will be negative when there is no drug in the sample.  The residue
concentration between no detectable concentration and the 90/95 percent
concentration (false violative test result) is a concern, particularly for the
producer, as these concentrations may cause a positive test result and the
truck tanker of milk deemed unacceptable for human food.  From a human safety
perspective, FDA is also concerned for the false negative potential of the
tests.  <P>
It is important to understand that under Section 6 of the PMO, producer bulk
tank milk has been monitored for a number of years, before implementation of
Appendix N, PMO, using some of the accepted Appendix N, PMO, tests.  These
screening tests have the same limitations whether used as a Section 6, PMO,
test or an Appendix N, PMO, test.  The difference is that now the PMO requires
the monitoring of each tanker truck for beta-lactam residues before entry into
the food chain.<p>

<B>
<a name="RTFToC11">XI.
 SUMMARY
</a></B>
<p>
Some have inaccurately reported results of milk monitoring to advance the
proposition that the use of the accepted milk residue screening tests be
discontinued until more accurate tests are available.  The percentage of truck
tankers found positive in 1994 (National Milk Drug Residue Third Party Data
Base) was 0.063 percent.  This low incidence of positive truck tankers supports
our standard for selectivity (false positive test result).  Further, this low
incidence of positive truck tankers also demonstrates that the majority of the
milk producers are using drugs in a responsible manner.  The FDA has found no
evidence which indicates that the use of approved drugs in accordance with
label directions will cause a positive test result in a truck tanker with the
possible exception when chlortetracycline is administered in feed on a herd
basis.  <b>The FDA has concluded that despite the inherent limitations of
screening tests, the issue remains one of proper drug use.  </b>The FDA
believes the use of the accepted tests under the provisions of Appendix N, PMO,
has reduced the amount of milk containing antimicrobial drugs entering the food
supply.   <P>
The low incidence of positive truck tankers and the rejection of those truck
tanker loads for human food is recognition of the milk industry's focus on and
commitment to the human safety of milk.  <b>This low incidence and Appendix
N, PMO, monitoring is a significant factor for the milk industry in maintaining
consumer confidence in the safety of milk.</b>  The reliability of the
accepted tests to detect drug residues adds credibility to the testing program,
and the small percentage of positive tankers confirms the validity of the
acceptance standards for the tests.<P>
The FDA recognizes the limitations of the screening tests.  These are:<P>
1.  The tests cannot identify the drug residue nor the concentration of the
residue.  A safety determination cannot be determined from a positive
result.<br>
2.  The screening tests produce some positive results when the drug
concentration is below the tolerance/safe level.  Under the provisions of
Appendix N, PMO, this limitation provides for a few positive truck tanker loads
of milk to be rejected for human consumption when the milk is safe.<P>
While these accepted tests have their limitations in drug identification and
quantification, they work well in detecting violative drug residues in milk.
The low probability of a false positive and a false negative finding is
inherent in the acceptability standards of the evaluation.  The FDA has found
no evidence which would indicate that the accepted tests are not performing in
this manner.<P>
The FDA recognizes the economic losses to the milk producer which would result
from false violative and false positive test results.  With this issue in mind,
the NCIMS and the FDA agreed to retest all original positive truck tanker
samples using the same test when tested by an industry analyst.  Only after the
results from retesting indicate a positive finding is a truck tanker rejected.
Retesting increases the probability of acceptance of a non-violative milk
tanker and decreases the number of non-violative truck tanker rejections.  The
FDA must also be concerned with the incidence of false negative results to
ensure the public health.<P>
Based on reports from the states, the FDA has concluded that misuse of animal
drugs is the cause of most positive test results from truck tanker testing even
when residue concentrations are below the tolerance/safe level.  The FDA has
found no evidence which indicates that treating lactating cows in accordance
with labeled directions will cause a positive truck tanker.  The low incidence
of positive truck tanker results do not appear to be caused by unreliable
tests.  The follow-up by the State regulatory agencies on positive truck
tankers indicates that the positive test results are primarily the result of
misuse of animal drugs.<P>

<b>4.    EFFECTIVENESS   </b><p>

     The new animal drug application for lufenuron tablets contains adequate
and well-controlled studies which demonstrate efficacy in preventing and
controlling flea populations<i>.</i>  Lufenuron is an insect development
inhibitor which breaks the flea life cycle at the egg stage. The adult female
flea is exposed to the drug when feeding on a treated dog. The drug, which has
no deleterious effect on the adult flea, acts to inhibit the development of
flea eggs.  The mode of action is interference with the synthesis,
polymerization and deposition of chitin, the major supportive component of the
flea egg case and cuticle that forms the exoskeleton of larval stages.
    <p>
     
 <b>A.   DOSE ESTABLISHMENT </b>  <p>
 
    Three pivotal studies, one titration and two confirmation, were conducted to
establish and confirm the minimum effective dose of lufenuron for the
prevention and control of flea populations<i>.</i>  These studies titrated and
confirmed a monthly dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for dogs.  A list of the
pivotal dose establishment studies, principal investigators and study sites can
be found in Table 1 .<p>

<b>Type of Study:   </b><p>Experimental infestations of the cat flea,
<i>Ctenocephalides felis </i>&#160;     <i>C. felis </i>&#160;    is
the common flea of both dogs and cats in most areas of the Unites States, with
<i>C. canis </i>&#160;    being found only
occasionally. (Muller, GH, Kirk, RW, and Scott, DW. Small
Animal Dermatology. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1989. pp. 347-426). 
   In a field study of 3,000 fleas collected
from dogs, 89% of the fleas collected were <i>C. felis </i>&#160;    while only 11% were
<i>C. canis </i>   . ( Dryden, M.W.  Evaluation of Certain Parameters in the Bionomics of
<i>Ctenocephalides felis felis</i>.  Masters Thesis, Purdue University, West
Lafayette, IN, 1988).    Based on this information, the cat flea was used
in all laboratory efficacy studies for lufenuron. <p>
 
<b>Animals:</b><p> Forty adult dogs, 24 beagles and 16 mixed breeds, divided into
4 groups of 10 dogs each. Equal numbers of male and female dogs were used.<p>
<b>Controls:</b> <p>   One group of 10 dogs receiving placebo tablets comprised of
the formulation excipients without active ingredient.<p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Lufenuron tablets (swallow)<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>  Orally, on a full stomach<p>
<b>Doses Tested:    </b>5.0 mg,  10.0 mg, and 20.0 mg per kg animal body weight<p>

<b>Frequency of Treatment</b>:  One treatment<p>

<b>Duration of Study:</b><p>   Dogs were experimentally infested with newly emerged
cat fleas weekly from day 7 to day 28. The dogs were treated on day 0. Flea
eggs were collected from each dog twice weekly from day 3 to day 32
post-treatment. The number of adult fleas emerging from these eggs were counted
35 days after they were collected.<p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p>Efficacy was calculated by comparing the development of eggs
collected from fleas feeding on treated versus control animals.  The data
provided below is an average from eggs collected on days 28 and 32
post-treatment:<p>

Lufenuron at all doses tested provided &gt;90% prevention of flea egg
development through day 21 of the study. Since the drug is administered
monthly, the critical parameter was determined to be efficacy at the end of the
test period. Therefore, the combined efficacy from days 28 and 32 (above) was
used to establish the dose of lufenuron. Efficacy was based on percent efficacy
and no statistical analysis was required.<p>  
<b>Conclusions</b>: <p> The dose of 10 mg lufenuron per kg body weight provided
&gt;90% prevention of flea egg development and worked better than the highest
dose used in the study. The lowest dose used in this study, 5 mg/kg, failed to
prevent &gt;90% egg development during the critical test period (days 28 and
32). <p> 
<b>Adverse Reactions:</b>   No adverse reactions were reported.<p>

<b>Animals:</b><p>  Twenty-four 7 month old female beagle dogs (female dogs were
used based on availability).<p>
<b>Controls:</b> <p>   Placebo tablets, comprised of formulation excipients without
active ingredient<p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Lufenuron tablets (swallow)<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>  Orally, on a full stomach<p>
<b>Dosage and Frequency of Treatment:   </b><p>Minimum recommended dose of 10 mg per
kg of animal body weight administered to four groups of three dogs each on
study days 7, 37, and 68. Four groups of 3 dogs each were treated with the
placebo tablets on study days 7, 37, and 68.<p>
<b>Duration of Study:</b>  91 days<p>
<b>Study Design: </b><p>  Dogs were housed in two adjacent buildings, each divided
into 4 rooms measuring 4' by 7'. Each room was paneled and carpeted so as to
simulate a typical home environment and had access to outside runs. Each room
housed 3 dogs from the same treatment group. <p>
 
On study days 0 and 2, all dogs were infested with newly emerged cat fleas. On
day 6, all dogs were combed and the fleas enumerated and returned to their
respective canine hosts.  The carpets were seeded with pulverized dog food,
dried beef blood, brewer's yeast and sand to provide food for developing flea
larvae. Weekly from day 14 to day 91, the dogs were combed, fleas enumerated,
and returned to their respective canine hosts.<p>
 
<b>Results:</b>  Total adult flea counts were made weekly to measure drug
efficacy.<p>

<b>Conclusions: </b><p> In a simulated home environment, lufenuron provided &gt;90%
control of flea infestations when administered at the minimum use rate of 10
mg/kg body weight for the last 2 months of a 3 month treatment period. Because
the dogs in this study were infested with fleas prior to treatment and because
lufenuron has no effect on the adult fleas, there was a 35 day lag period
before the drug's effect on the flea life cycle could impact the adult flea
population.<p>
 
<b>Adverse Reactions: </b><p>  No adverse reactions to treatment were reported.
Seven dogs in the control group and 1 dog in the treated group showed
dermatologic signs attributable to flea bites or flea allergic dermatitis.
Diarrhea was noted in 4 runs (1 treated and 3 control) and fecal analyses were
positive for <i>Giardia </i>&#160;    sp.<p>

        Urbana, IL<p>
 
<b>Animals:</b> Sixteen adult female beagle dogs<p>
<b>Study Design/Dosage/Frequency of Treatment: </b><p>  Control and treated dogs
were maintained in identical indoor/outdoor runs.  Indoor runs were carpeted
and maintained at normal temperature and humidity to simulate a home
environment.  All animals were experimentally infested with fleas at the onset
of the study. Lufenuron was administered at the minimum recommended dose of 10
mg/kg body weight to two groups of 4 dogs. Dosing took place on days 7, 37, and
67.  Placebo tablets were administered to two groups of 4 dogs on days 7, 37,
and 67. The dogs were combed weekly until day 70, the fleas on each dog were
counted, and returned to their respective canine hosts.<p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p>An active flea infestation was not achieved in one of the two
control groups. This group and its corresponding treated group (both housed on
the west side of the building) were not included in the evaluation of efficacy.
In the remaining lufenuron-treated group, 97% control of fleas was achieved by
day 63 when compared to the remaining control group.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions: </b><p>  In a simulated home environment, lufenuron provided &gt;90%
control of flea infestations when administered at the minimum use rate of 10
mg/kg body weight. Because the dogs in this study were infested with fleas
prior to treatment and because lufenuron has no effect on the adult fleas,
there was a lag period before the drug's effect on the flea life cycle had an
impact on the adult flea population. The lag period was 63 days for this study
conducted in Illinois compared to the 35 day lag period seen in study
BPU-D-AL-034 conducted in Alabama. In cooler geographic areas where the life
cycle of the flea is prolonged, the time required for control of an existing
flea population may also be prolonged.<p>
 
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>:  No adverse reactions were reported.<p>

 <b>B.   WELL-CONTROLLED CLINICAL FIELD TRIALS </b>  <p>
    Lufenuron tablets were evaluated in a multi-centered, well-controlled clinical
field trial conducted in twenty-one veterinary clinics located in several
geographic locations.  Each study site adhered to one of two study regimen
protocols;  Regimen I evaluated lufenuron tablets in animals with low or no
existing flea infestations or Regimen II which evaluated lufenuron tablets in
animals with pre-existing flea infestations.  A total of 411 dogs were enrolled
in Regimens I and II of the clinical trials and a total of 306 of the dogs
enrolled were accepted for inclusion in the analysis.  Animals were excluded
from the data base for a number of reasons, primarily for protocol violations
and owner non-compliance. A list of the clinical investigators participating in
Regimens I and II can be found in Table 2 <p>

Only 3 dogs &lt; 6 months of age were treated with lufenuron in the study. Data
to support the use of lufenuron in dogs &lt; 6 months of age were generated in
the pivotal target animal safety studies (see pages 14-28). In Pivotal Studies
1 and 2 (see pages 14-17), the dogs were 8 weeks of age when treated with
lufenuron was initiated. In Pivotal Study 5 (see page 20) the dogs were 6 weeks
of age at the start of the study.<p>
 
Approximately 44 different breeds of dogs were enrolled in the clinical trials
(34 included in the analysis) as well as a large and diverse selection of mixed
breeds.<p>
 
During the course of the trials, no treatment related deaths or adverse
reactions were attributed to lufenuron.  Isolated cases of vomiting occurred
but were not consistent for any specific animal, breed, dose, treatment or
placebo group, and, therefore, not attributed to lufenuron.  Lufenuron was
administered concurrently with a wide range of routinely used veterinary
medications and vaccines without any adverse reactions reported.<p>
 
<b>  Regimen I   </b><p>
 
<b>Type of Study: </b><p>   Two-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
designed to evaluate the effect of lufenuron tablets under "pre-infestation"
conditions.  <p>
 
<b>Test Groups: </b>  Group A received lufenuron tablets and Group B received
placebo tablets.<p>
 
<b>Number of Veterinary Clinics Participating:</b>  Eleven<p>
 
<b>Animals: </b><p>Each investigator was to recruit at least 12 households for the
study which were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups.  All
animals from a household were enrolled in the same treatment group.<p>
 
<b>Study Duration:</b>  Minimum of six months.<p>
<b>Dosage Administration: </b><p>   Lufenuron tablets, formulated to provide the
minimum effective dose of 10 mg/kg, were administered by the dog owners to dogs
enrolled in Group A once-a-month for a minimum of six consecutive months.  In
clinical field trial locations experiencing a "light" flea season (as
determined by the clinical investigators based on their experience), the study
protocol was amended to extend the study past six months. <p>
 
<b>Controls: </b><p>    Placebo tablets, formulated without active ingredient, were
administered by the dog owners to Group B animals once-a-month for six
consecutive months or longer if a particular study site used an extended
protocol.<p>
 
<b>Clinical Evaluation: </b><p> At enrollment all animals were given a complete
physical examination and blood was collected for a complete blood count (CBC)
and serum chemistry profile.  Flea counts were performed in the clinic prior to
treatment and monthly, thereafter, for the duration of the study.  A
short-acting adulticide (Adams(TM) Flea &amp; Tick Mist) was used on dogs from
both groups as labeled once-a-month to kill adult fleas for removal and
counting.  At the conclusion of the study, a final flea count and physical exam
were performed.  Blood was also collected for a CBC and serum profile.<p>
 
<b>Concomitant Therapy: </b><p> Other than once-a-month administration of the
investigational drug and placebo and the adulticide used at the veterinary
clinic for flea counting, no other flea treatments to animals or their
environments were allowed.  Other treatments and medications commonly used in
the practice of veterinary medicine were allowed.<p>
 
<b>  Results:  Regimen I   </b><p>
 
In Regimen I, treatment with lufenuron was initiated in animals before the
onset of flea infestations.  Of the 213 dogs enrolled under this regimen, 107
comprised the lufenuron treatment group and 106 the placebo treatment group.
These animals represented a total of 127 dog households, 64 and 63 in the
lufenuron and placebo groups, respectively. A total of 173 cases were included
in the data analysis; 89 comprised the lufenuron treatment group and 84 the
placebo treatment group.  A total of 156 cases completed the trial; 85 in the
lufenuron treatment group and 71 in the placebo treatment group.  The number of
dogs initially enrolled, included in the data analysis, and remaining in the
study at four and six months are provided below:<p>

The study design allowed those households which developed intolerable flea
infestations to withdraw from the study after the fourth month exam.  This was
necessary especially for Group B (placebo control) where severe flea
infestations developed without adequate control measures.  Some households
dropped from the study for other reasons including convenience in adhering to
the protocol.  Data analysis was performed only on data through the six month
exam to prevent the data from becoming skewed by households with heavier flea
infestations dropping from the study and households with fewer fleas remaining
on trial.<p>

<b>Statistical Analysis: </b><p>  Non-parametric, one-way analyses of variance were
used to analyze Savage scores, based on monthly flea counts. Dogs with 20 or
fewer fleas at the study initiation were included in the analyses. The placebo
and lufenuron treatment groups were compared at each time point. Significant
differences in Savage scores were found between treatment groups from month 2
onwards (p&lt;0.05). Average flea counts were lower in the lufenuron-treated
dogs than in the placeob-treated dogs from month 1 onwards.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions: </b><p> Lufenuron, administered at a minimum dose of 10 mg/kg body
weight at monthly intervals starting prior to the flea season, prevented the
build-up of flea populations after approximately 60 days following the
initiation of monthly dosing. <p>
 
<b>  Regimen II   </b><p>
 
<b>Type of Study: </b><p>   Two-group, double blind, positive-controlled study
designed to evaluate efficacy of lufenuron tablets in dogs with established
flea infestations.<p>
<b>Test Groups: </b><p> Group C received lufenuron tablets plus adulticide
treatment (Adams(TM) Flea &amp; Tick Mist) and Group D received placebo tablets
plus a topical adulticide and insect growth regulator (Ovitrol
Plus<sup>reg.</sup>---an Environmental Protection Agency-regulated topical
insecticide). See Clinical Evaluation for further explanation.<p>
 
<b>Number of Veterinary Clinics Participating:</b>    Ten<p>
 
<b>Animals: </b><p> Each investigator was to recruit at least 12 households for the
study which were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups.  All
animals from a household were enrolled in the same treatment group. <p>
 
<b>Study Duration: </b>  Minimum of 6 months.<p>
 
<b>Dosage Administration: </b><p>   Lufenuron tablets, formulated to provide the
minimum effective dose of 10 mg/kg, were administered once-a-month by the dog
owners for a minimum of six consecutive months to dogs enrolled in Group C.  In
clinical field locations experiencing a "light" flea season (as determined by
the clinical investigators based on their experience), the study protocol was
amended to extend the study past six months.<p>
 
<b>Controls: </b><p>    The control (D) group in this trial received a placebo
administered by the dog owner in a dosage form identical to lufenuron tablets,
as well as treatment with a positive control insect growth regulator (Ovitrol
Plus&#174;) per label instructions by the veterinary staff of the veterinary
clinic.<p>
 
<b>Clinical Evaluation: </b><p> At enrollment, all animals were given a complete
physical examination and blood was collected for a CBC and serum chemistry
profile.  As an initial treatment for the existing flea infestations and to
assure compliance in the early stages of the study when flea infestations were
likely to be the heaviest, households from both groups used weekly, on-animal
pyrethrin adulticide applications (Adams(TM) Flea &amp; Tick Mist) for the
first eight weeks of the study.  Flea counts were performed in the clinic prior
to treatment and monthly, thereafter.  A short acting adulticide (Adams(TM)
Flea &amp; Tick Mist) was used as labeled once-a-month at the veterinary clinic
in the lufenuron-treated group to kill fleas for removal and counting.  The
control group received Ovitrol&#174; Plus, which contains an adulticide
(pyrethrin) and an insect growth regulator (methoprene), once-a-month at the
veterinary clinic to kill adult fleas for removal and counting. The insect
growth regulator in the product served as the positive control for the study.
At the conclusion of the study, a final flea count and physical exam was
performed.  Blood was also collected for a CBC and serum profile.<p>
 
<b>Concomitant Therapy: </b><p> Other than those treatments mentioned above, no
other flea treatments to animals or their environment were allowed.  Other
types of medications commonly used in veterinary practice were allowed as
needed.<p>
 
<b>  Results:  Regimen II   </b><p>
 
In Regimen II, lufenuron tablets were evaluated in animals with pre-existing
infestations of fleas.  Of the 198 dogs enrolled under this protocol regimen,
107 comprised the lufenuron treatment group and 91 the control group. These
animals represented a total of 112 households; 58 in the lufenuron group and 54
in the control group. A total of 133 cases were included in the analysis; 66
comprised the lufenuron treatment group and 67 the control group. All dogs
included in the analysis completed the trial. <p>

<b>Statistical Analyses: </b><p> Non-parametric, one-way analyses of variance were
used to analyze Savage scores, based on monthly flea counts. Dogs with as few
as one flea at the study initiation were included in the analyses. The positive
control and lufenuron-treatment groups were compared at each time point. No
significant differences in Savage scores were found between treatment groups at
any time point (p&gt;0.05), though average flea counts were higher in the
lufenuron-treated dogs than in the positive control-treated dogs from month 2
onwards.<p>
<b>Conclusions: </b><p>  Lufenuron, administered at a minimum dose of 10 mg/kg body
weight at monthly intervals during active flea infestations, effectively
controlled the flea populations. Lufenuron, an insect development inhibitor
which has no effect on the adult flea, was used in combination with a topical
insecticide to kill the adults for the first 2 months of the study when the
pre-existing flea infestations were at their heaviest. The investigational
insect development inhibitor (lufenuron), administered by the dog owners,
worked as effectively as the insect growth regulator in the topical spray,
Ovitrol&#174; Plus, applied by the veterinary staff.<p>

<b>5.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>
 
Nine pivotal target animal safety studies were conducted in dogs to address
the tolerance and safety of lufenuron.  These studies were specifically
designed to evaluate safety of the drug administered at exaggerated doses in
breeding animals, in a long-term (10-month) study, in a study with commercially
available flea adulticides and in six-week old puppies.  These studies
demonstrated that lufenuron tablets provide a wide therapeutic index when
administered orally to dogs at the minimum recommended dose of 10 mg/kg  body
weight, monthly.  A list of the target animal safety studies, principal
investigators and study sites can be found in Table 3.<p>
 
<b>  Pivotal Study 1:<p> Ten-Month Oral Toxicity Study In Beagle Dogs   </b><p>
 
<b>Type of Study: </b><p>A chronic (10 month) study during which lufenuron tablets
were administered at 0, 1X, 3X, or 5X the monthly use rate of 10 mg/kg body
weight daily for three consecutive days each month from months one to three and
at 0, 2X, 6X, and 10X for three consecutive days each month from months four
through ten of the study.<p>
 
<b>Investigator/Study Director: </b><p> Dr. Edwin Goldenthal<br>
    International Research and Development Corp. (IRDC)<br>
    Mattawan, MI<p>
 
The dogs used in this study were whelped at Hazelton Laboratories, Michigan.
During the tenth week of the study, when they were 18 weeks of age, the dogs
were transported to IRDC.<p>
 
<b>Animals: </b><p> Twenty-four male and twenty-four female purebred beagle dogs
that entered the study at eight weeks of age and were mature (approximately one
year of age) at the conclusion of the study.<p>
 
<b>Dosage Form: </b>  Lufenuron Tablets (swallow)<p>
 
<b>Route of Administration: </b> Oral (at IRDC, dogs were fed at 7 am and were
dosed within 2 hours).<p>
 
<b>Dosage and Frequency of Treatment: </b><p>The dogs were assigned to 4 groups of
12 dogs each, six males and six females. Three groups were dosed at 1X, 3X and
5X the recommended use rate of 10 mg/kg body weight.  These dosages were
administered on three consecutive days per month for 3 months.  For the
following seven months, dosages were doubled from 1X to 2X, 3X to 6X and 5X to
10X, respectively. The reason for this dosage increase was to show safety at
exaggerated doses since the proposed dosage scale allows for some degree of
overdosage at the low end of each weight range. <p>
 
<b>Controls: </b><p>    Twelve animals each, six male and six female, were dosed with
placebo tablets in a manner identical to the lufenuron treatment groups.<p>
 
<b>Study Duration: </b> Ten Months<p>
 
<b>Evaluation: </b><p>  Criteria evaluated for treatment effect included
observations for overt toxicity, moribundity and mortality, body weights, food
consumption, water consumption, ophthalmologic examinations, hematological,
biochemical and urinalysis determinations, and macroscopic and microscopic
examination of tissues, including selected major organ weights.  All surviving
dogs were sacrificed following ten months of study.<p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p> One female dog in the 1X dose group died on study day 16 due to
pneumonia and was replaced with another female dog.  The death was determined
to be unrelated to the administration of the test article. At the 1X (2X) use
rate, all criteria evaluated were considered to be comparable to findings in
the control group.  At the 3X (6X) and 5X (10X) use rates all criteria
evaluated were considered to be comparable to findings in the control group
with the exception of the average food consumption. Females in the two highest
dose groups showed a decrease in average food consumption compared to the
control females, as shown in the following table:<p>

<b>Conclusions:</b><p> There were no overt signs of toxicity when lufenuron was
administered to 8 week old puppies at doses up to 5X the intended monthly use
rate for three consecutive days per month for 3 months and to 5 month old
puppies at doses up to 10X the intended monthly use rate for three consecutive
days per month for 7 months. Decreases in food consumption were evident in the
female dogs given lufenuron at 3X (6X) and 5X (10X) the use rate, though there
was little effect on the mean body weight of these dogs at termination.<p>

The dogs used in this study were whelped at Hazelton Laboratories, Michigan.
During the tenth week of the study, when they were 18 weeks of age, the dogs
were transported to IRDC.<p>
 
<b>Animals: </b><p> Eighteen male and eighteen female purebred beagle dogs entered
the study as weanlings at eight weeks of age.  The six groups used in the study
contained three male and three female dogs each.<p>
 
<b>Dosage Form: </b>  Lufenuron Tablets (Swallow)<p>
 
<b>Controls: </b>  Placebo Tablets (Swallow)<p>
 
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment: </b><p>   Lufenuron tablets were administered at
10X the recommended use rate (10 mg/kg monthly) for the first three days each
month for six consecutive months.  Commercially available insecticides which
have activity against the adult flea were administered concurrently to these
dogs. These insecticides were used according to label recommendations, with the
exception of chlorpyriphos (group III below) which is not labeled for use in
dogs less than 4 months of age.  The study evaluated safety parameters in dogs
receiving the following treatment regimes:<p>

</pre>
The commercial insecticides were administered beginning within 2 days after
completion of the first monthly dose of lufenuron. The carbaryl product
(Mycodex&#174; Powder Plus) was applied as a topical powder, the permethrin
(Expar(TM)3.2%EC) and chlorpyriphos (Dursban&#174; Dip) were applied topically as
dips and the cythioate (Proban&#174;) as an oral tablet. <p>
 
During week 4 of the study, the dogs were not dosed with any of the above
treatments due to a <i>Giardia </i>&#160;    infestation. All dogs were treated with
metronidazole (Flagyl&#174;) for 5 days.<p>
     
    <b>Study Duration: </b>  Six Months<p>
 
<b>Evaluation:  </b><p>Criteria evaluated for treatment effect included
observations for overt toxicity, moribundity and mortality, body weights, food
consumption, ophthalmologic examination, hematological, biochemical and
urinalysis determination, and macroscopic and microscopic examination of
tissues, including selected major organ weights.  All surviving animals were
sacrificed following six months of study.<p>
 
Plasma cholinesterase and red blood cell (RBC) cholinesterase were determined
pretest and monthly, thereafter. <p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p> There were no opthalmological, hematological, urological,
macroscopic or microscopic pathological abnormalities found in any of the
groups. Food consumption, body weight, and organ weights at necropsy were
normal for all groups.<p>
 
Slight hair loss/alopecia was observed in 27 of the 36 dogs in this study,
including 3 of the 6 control dogs.  It's significance is unknown. One dog in
group I was sacrificed on study day 2 due to poor condition. Gross necropsy
revealed a thin, dehydrated dog with pale mucous membranes. Based on the
chronic nature of the presenting clinical signs, the dog was presumed to have
been ill at the initiation of the study.<p>
 
Cholinesterase was inhibited in those groups exposed to organophosphates
(chlorpyriphos and cythioate); however, no clinical signs typical of
organophosphate toxicity (vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, salivation, muscular
tremors) were observed.  Plasma cholinesterase values were reduced at the
6-month interval of analysis in the group treated with both lufenuron and
chlorpyriphos (group III).  A reduction in plasma cholinesterase was also noted
in females in this group at the 3-month analysis interval.  An additional study
was conducted to determine if this effect was due to lufenuron or chlorpyriphos
(see Pivotal Study 3).<p>
 
A reduction in red blood cell cholinesterase was observed in females treated
with lufenuron and cythioate (group IV) at the third and fourth month analysis
intervals.  Since the five and six month values were not different from
controls, this effect was considered transient and attributable to
cythioate.<p>  
<b>Conclusions: </b><p>No overt signs of toxicity were observed in dogs
administered  lufenuron at 10X the use rate for three consecutive days per
month for 6 consecutive months in combination with commercially available flea
adulticide products used at their labeled use rate. This study demonstrates
that lufenuron, when used concomitantly with common flea adulticide products,
does not result in any additional side effects; however, plasma cholinesterase
inhibition in dogs exposed to lufenuron plus chlorpyriphos was observed. This
inhibition is addressed in an additional study (see Pivotal Study 3).  <p>

</pre> 

The recommended use rate of chlorpyriphos (Dursban&#174; Dip) is once every 3
weeks. In this study, the product was applied topically as a dip once a week
for three weeks in order to rapidly cause cholinesterase inhibition.  <p>
 
    <b>Study Duration:</b>  Six Weeks<p>
 
<b>Evaluation: </b><p>  Criteria evaluated for treatment effects included
observations for overt toxicity, moribundity, mortality, body weights, food
consumption, hematological, biochemical and urinalysis determination.<p>
 
Plasma and RBC cholinesterase were determined pretest and at weeks 2, 4, 5, and
6 of the study.<p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p> No findings were observed in any of the measured parameters
except for plasma cholinesterase.  Plasma cholinesterase levels were depressed
in all groups exposed to chlorpyriphos.  No differences were observed in the
rate or degree of plasma cholinesterase depression between the
chlorpyriphos-only and the lufenuron-chlorpyriphos groups.  There was no
difference in plasma cholinesterase levels between the lufenuron treated and
control groups.<p>
 
<b>Conclusion: </b><p>  Lufenuron does not cause cholinesterase inhibition nor does
it enhance cholinesterase depression caused by exposure to organophosphates.<p>

<b>Animals: </b><p> Twenty-five female and twenty-five male beagle dogs were
selected from the stock population of proven dams and sires at
Hazleton-Laboratory Research Enterprises, Inc., Kalamazoo, MI.  Animals were a
minimum of two years old and bitches had whelped at least two times previously.
During an acclimation period, all dogs were dosed with the placebo for seven
consecutive days and a semen evaluation was performed on all males.  The five
males and five females judged least suitable to fulfill study objectives, based
on semen quality and/or tendency toward tablet regurgitation, were eliminated
from the study. A total of twenty males and twenty females were selected for
inclusion in the study.<p>
 
<b>Dosage Form: </b>  Lufenuron Tablets (swallow)<p>
 
<b>Controls: </b>  Placebo Tablets (swallow)<p>
 
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment: </b><p>   To ensure maximum exposure during all
phases of embryogenesis, lufenuron was administered   daily    at 3X the
recommended   monthly    use rate of 10 mg/kg, equivalent to a minimum dosage
of 30 mg/kg body weight/day (90X the minimum recommended monthly use rate).
Control dogs received the corresponding number of placebo tablets.  Males and
females were dosed starting approximately three months prior to mating and
continued throughout the mating period.  Bred females were dosed throughout
gestation, whelping, and weaning for a total of approximately nine months.<p>
 
<b>Study Groups/Mating: </b><p> Prior to dosing, animals were listed in descending
order by body weights and assigned to one control and one treatment group of
twenty animals each; ten studs and ten bitches.  Within each study group, the
first bitch with signs of proestrus was paired with the first stud etc., until
all animals were paired.<p>
 
    <b>Study Duration: </b>  Approximately nine months.<p>
 
<b>Evaluation: </b><p>  Specific parental criteria evaluated were survival rate,
appearance and behavior, body weights, stud sperm quality, stud and bitch
fertility indices and mean gestation period.  Viability, body weights, growth
and survival indices were criteria measured for pups from the litters
produced.<p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p> The ratio of gravid females to females mated was 8/8 or 100% in
the control group and 6/9 of 66.7% in the lufenuron treated group.  Comparing
the study results to historical colony fertility data from Hazleton-LRE
(86-88%), it was determined that no biological conclusions could be drawn from
the difference in the fertility rate between control and treated groups. It
could not be determined if this was a drug effect or a function of the small
sample size (10 bitches per group) There were no treatment related effects for
the other reproductive parameters measured, though one bitch in the treated
group had a "possible" retained placenta. Any bitch with green discharge
post-whelping is classified as having a possible retained placenta and is
treated with oxytocin as a preventive measure. The diagnosis was not confirmed.
The pertinent reproductive parameters measured are shown in the following
table:<p>

The mean birth weight of pups from treated bitches was lower than from control
bitches. It could not be determined if this was a drug effect or a function of
litter size. The mean number of live pups per litter in the treated group (6.5)
was two animals higher than the concurrent control (4.4). Treated pups in this
study grew at a similar rate to both colony and concurrent controls.  <p>

There was a higher incidence in the treated versus control group pups of
clinical signs such as nasal discharge, pulmonary congestion,
diarrhea/dehydration and sluggishness.  The incidence of these signs were
transient and decreasing by the end of lactation.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions: </b><p> The following observations were made in this study where
breeding dogs were given lufenuron at 3X the minimum recommended monthly use
rate (10 mg/kg) on a <i>daily </i>&#160;    basis (equivalent to 90X the monthly dose)
prior to breeding, during mating, and through weaning (bitches): 1) fertility
in the treated group was less than in the control group; 2) mean birth weight
of pups born to treated bitches was less than that of pups born to control
bitches; and 3) pups born to treated bitches showed an increased incidence of
clinical signs compared to pups born to control bitches, though pup survival to
weaning was greater in the treated group compared to the control group.<p>
 
Additional studies were conducted to determine if these effects were related to
treatment with lufenuron (see pivotal studies 7, 8, and 9).<p>

Some pups had to be fostered onto untreated females as a result of large litter
sizes and/or inability of the female to sustain the litter. A total of 13 pups
from control females, 15 pups from 1X females and 6 pups from 5X females were
fostered. Because these pups did not nurse from study females for the entire
lactation period, they were not included in the calculation of mean weaning
weight.<p>
 
Two treated females, 1 in the 1X group and 1 in the 5X group had "possible"
retained placentas and were treated with oxytocin. The diagnosis was not
confirmed in these dogs. One treated female in the 1X group had a confirmed
retained placenta. Physical examination and general observations made at
whelping and weaning were similar between control and treated pups. Prior to
weaning, 10 pups (from 2 litters) in the 5X group had mucopurulent nasal
discharge. No gross necropsy findings considered treatment-related were
observed that differentiated between control and treatment pups.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions: </b><p>  Fertility and  mean birth weights in the 1X and 5X
treatment groups were comparable to the concurrent controls, indicating that
treatment with lufenuron had no adverse effect on these parameters. One treated
female (1X group) had retained placenta and there was an increased incidence of
mucopurulent nasal discharge in the pups born to 5X females.<p>

available. Each study group sire and all females in a group received the
initial and all subsequent doses at the same time. In an attempt to have both
treated and control groups represented for each breed, the following table was
used to assign groups to specific treatments (i.e., if there were two groups of
Yorkies available, 1 was randomly assigned to treatment with lufenuron and the
other with the control, if 3 groups were available, 2 were randomly assigned to
treatment with lufenuron and 1 to control, etc.):<p>

*Percent whelping (litters produced/#bitches) was evaluated in this
study (versus percent fertility) because individual animal observations
were not possible when mating and pregnancy occurred.  The major puppy
mortality finding was stillborn pups, which occurred more in the control
than treatment groups. Detailed clinical signs were not recorded for the
puppies because such observations were not part of the normal procedures
for the commercial kennels involved in this study. 
</pre>
Blood samples were collected at various study intervals to measure the
lufenuron blood levels in the 5X group compared to the 1X group.  For the males
and females combined, the mean lufenuron level in group 1 was 0.796 ppm and in
group 3 it was 2.279 ppm. This represents approximately a 2.9X difference.  The
males maintained higher blood levels than the females in this study. The group
3 males had an average of 3.8X higher blood levels than the group 1 males,
while the group 3 females had an average of 2.7X higher blood levels than the
group 1 females.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions: </b><p> Lufenuron, administered to reproducing small breed dogs at
1X (monthly) and 5X (twice monthly) the minimum recommended monthly use rate of
10 mg/kg, did not have any adverse effects on the reproductive parameters

<b>Dosage Form: </b>  Lufenuron Tablets (swallow)<p>
 
<b>Controls: </b>  Untreated<p>
 
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment: </b><p>   Lufenuron was administered in a single

<b>Results: </b><p>A lufenuron-treated male puppy died on day 5 with clinical
findings of decreased activity, unidentified red material in the feces and body
tremors.  The major necropsy findings were edematous kidneys with thickened
capsules and cystitis.  The other treated puppies exhibited decreased appetite
during days 8-11 and the surviving two treated males exhibited decreased
activity on days 10-11.  Red colored material was observed in the feces of the
two surviving treated males during study days 10-13.  Incidental clinical

beagle dogs. <p>
 
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment:   </b><p>Four dogs were dosed daily for 28 days,
with an oral 15% suspension of lufenuron at 50 mg/kg (5.0X).<p>
 
<b>Controls:</b>  None<p>
 
<b>Study Duration:</b>  Twenty-eight days.<p>
 
<b>Results:</b><p> All four dogs tolerated lufenuron without overt or covert signs
of toxicity at 50 mg/kg body weight given   daily    for 28 days.  Clinical
signs, mortality, ophthalmoscopic examination, body weights and food
consumption, clinical chemistry and organ weights were parameters measured.<p>

    <b>Animals:</b>  Five proven beagle bitches.<p>
 
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment:</b><p>   Beginning with the first mating, five
proven female beagle bitches were dosed   daily    at 30 mg/kg with an orally
administered 15% suspension of lufenuron until 21 days post-whelping.<p>
 
<b>Controls: </b>  None<p>
     
<b>Results:</b><p> Animals were observed daily and body weights and puppy health
parameters were evaluated.  Three of the five bitches bred conceived.  Pregnant
bitches tolerated lufenuron and produced normal progeny. Mean puppy birth
weight was 0.23 kg.  All surviving puppies appeared thrifty.  Only 2 puppies
died, both deaths thought to be unrelated to treatment.<p>

    <b>Study Location:</b><p>  Hazleton-LRE<br>
            Kalamazoo, MI<p>
 
<b>Animals:</b><p> Ten proven beagle bitches were randomly placed into two groups
of five animals each.<p>
 
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment:</b><p>   Group 1 received 30 mg/kg lufenuron
  daily    beginning with the first tie, continuing through gestation and for
twenty-one days post whelping.  Group 2 received the same dosage for the same
duration but were treated once per week.<p>
 
<b>Dosage Form:  </b>Tablets (swallow)<p>
 
<b>Controls: </b>  None<p>
 
<b>Results: </b><p> Nine of the ten bitches on test conceived, one exhibited
pseudo-pregnancy. Both pregnant bitches and their progeny tolerated lufenuron
administered at 30 mg/kg weekly or daily to the bitches. The mean birth weight
was 0.25 kg. <p>
 
The average lufenuron blood concentration in group 1 bitches was approximately
10X that of group 2. Blood concentrations in 6-7 week old puppies whelped and
nursing from group 1 bitches were 7X those whelped from group 2 bitches.  Blood
concentrations in pups drawn at the same time as their respective dams were
4-6X higher in the puppies compared to the dams. Elevated lufenuron levels were
detectable in puppies 4-5 weeks after weaning.<p>
 
Comparison of blood and milk samples collected indicates that lufenuron
concentrates in the milk of treated bitches. Milk concentrations were from
14-49X higher than blood concentrations in bitches when measured 49-56 days
post whelping.<p>

<b>Animals:</b><p> Ten male and twenty female beagle dogs, 10-22 months of age,
were placed into six groups (5 per group) - two groups of unbred females, two
groups of bred females, two groups of males not used for breeding.<p>
    
<b>Dosage/Frequency of Treatment:</b> <p>  One group each of unbred and bred females
and unbred males received either 20 (2X recommended dose) or 60 (6X recommended

four weeks through gestation and through day 28 post-whelping.  Unbred females
were dosed on the same schedule.  Males were treated once and observed for 30
days.<p>
 
<b>Dosage Form:  </b>Lufenuron Tablets (swallow)<p>
 
<b>Results:</b><p> All 10 females bred become pregnant. The mean birth weight of
pups born to females treated at 2X was 227.5 grams compared to 290.7 grams for
the pups born to females treated at 6X. No overt toxicity was observed in any
of the parameters evaluated including clinical observations, daily

<b>Results:</b><p> This study involved the analysis of lufenuron in blood and milk
samples collected from the previous study (Corroborative Study 6) conducted at
Hazleton-LRE.  <p>
 
The average milk:blood concentration ratio was approximately 60 (i.e. 60X
higher concentration in the milk compared to the levels in the blood of treated
bitches). Blood concentrations were higher in pregnant bitches during the
gestation period as compared to the nonpregnant bitches, but lower during the
lactation period. The lower blood concentrations in lactating bitches as
compared to nonlactating bitches was attributed to the significant excretion of
lufenuron in milk. Pertinent blood/milk information is provided below:<p>

   FDA PROPOSES PRECAUTIONARY BAN
       AGAINST RUMINANT-TO-RUMINANT FEEDING
</h3> 
 
 <hr>
 
      The Food and Drug Administration today proposed to prohibit using tissues from ruminants -- animals such as cows, sheep and goats -- in the manufacture of ruminant feeds.  Mink tissue would also be prohibited from such feeds.<p>
 
      The proposed regulation is the latest in a series of preventive measures -- including a voluntary industry moratorium -- that FDA, other federal agencies and industry have already taken to protect animals from transmissible degenerative neurological diseases, and to minimize any potential risk that such diseases could be transmitted from animals to humans.<p>
 
      These animal diseases are known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is among the more commonly known of these diseases.  TSEs are characterized by a long incubation period, a relatively short clinical course of neurological signs, and 100 percent mortality. Because of concerns that BSE could in the future be identified scientifically as the cause of a new TSE in humans, FDA and USDA officials said the protection of public health depends on the development of a strategy to control possible routes of TSE expansion in food animals.<p>
 
      FDA's proposed regulation would prohibit the use of nearly all potential sources of ruminant and mink protein in feed intended for ruminants.  The only exceptions would be bovine blood, ruminant-derived milk and gelatin, since FDA has no information suggesting that milk proteins, gelatin or bovine blood proteins are potentially infective for TSEs.<p>
 
      "This is a precautionary measure -- there have been no reported cases of BSE in this county," said Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services.  "It will add another level of safeguards to protect the U.S. against the potential risk from these diseases."<p>
 
      "If for some reason a case of BSE were to occur in the U.S. -- and it is important to emphasize that not even one case of BSE has ever been found here -- the steps we are taking today would confine it to the individual animal and greatly decrease the potential risk to humans," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D.  "In essence, this proposal would build a protective barrier against the spread of BSE."<p>
 
      In addition to prohibiting tissues with the potential to spread TSEs, the proposed rule also requires process and control systems to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain the prohibited tissues.<p>
 
      The first case of BSE was reported in the United Kingdom in 1986.  Epidemiological evidence gathered in the U.K. suggests an association between the outbreak of BSE there and the feeding to cattle of protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE.<p>
 
      Recently, scientists have postulated an association between BSE and a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (v-CJD) reported in the U.K.  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that affects humans.<p>
 
      The British government on March 20 announced a possible link between BSE and 10 cases of v-CJD.  Nine days later, U.S. national livestock organizations and professional health groups announced a voluntary moratorium on the use of ruminant protein in feeds of ruminants.  At the same time, FDA committed to expediting regulations addressing issues related to feeding ruminant protein, and on May 14 the FDA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit scientific and economic information and other public comments.<p>
 
      Today's proposed regulation is the product of FDA's evaluation of this information to date.  FDA will continue to evaluate additional data and comments related to this proposal.

One hundred and twenty-three ruminating cattle weighing approximately 150 to
188 pounds were used in 4 trials to confirm the effectiveness of monensin fed
at 0, 10, 20 or 30 g/ton against coccidiosis.  The cattle were orally
challenged with sporulated <i>Eimeria bovis</i> and/or <i>Eimeria zuernii</i>
oocysts on the third day after monensin feeding began.  The experimental design
used was a randomized block at several locations with the challenge type
(coccidia species) as the blocking factor.  Oocyst counts and fecal score data
were collected over time on several days throughout the 33 to 38-day trials.
These data were viewed as sub-sampling units and analyzed accordingly.  Animal
weights and feed intakes were measured weekly, but analyzed over the entire
length of the trial.  Mortality within each treatment group was recorded upon
occurrence.  The least squares treatment means for pair-wise comparisons to the
control treatment (0 g/ton monensin) were as follows:

For both <i>E. bovis</i> and <i>E. zuernii</i> oocyst counts, the 10-gram level
showed significant reduction as compared to controls.  A statistically
significant decrease in both oocyst counts was seen through 20 grams per ton.
Although the 30 gram per ton level gave directionally lower oocyst counts than
the 20-gram per ton level, the difference was not significant.  Medical
judgment was utilized in deciding that the 30-gram per ton level was medically
meaningful.<p>

weeks of age.<P>
c.  Each animal constituted an experimental unit.  The four non-challenged
animals served as controls for baseline performance and were confined in
separate tie stalls adjacent to the coccidial challenged animals.  The
challenged controls and treated animals were blocked by inoculum (<i>E. zuernii
</i>or <i>E. bovis</i>) into treatment groups of four animals each.  Treatments
(0, 10, 20, or 30 g/ton monensin) were assigned at random to each group as

<b>5.  Animal Safety</b>:<P>
Monensin premix is the subject of an approved NADA 095-735. The conditions of
the existing approval are described in <B>21CFR 558.355</B>.  The feeding levels and
rates proposed in this supplemental NADA providing for the control of bovine
coccidiosis are essentially the same as for the existing approval.  The
differences involve changing the lower feeding level/rates of 5-30 g/ton and
50-360 mg/hd/day and providing 10-30 g/ton and 100-360 mg/hd/day when used for
the control of coccidiosis.  The duration of feeding will not exceed that
already approved in the cited regulation.  There is no reason to conclude that
this additional approval at essentially the same levels will adversely affect
the safety of animals receiving monensin.<P>
<b>6.  Human Food Safety:</b><P>
This information is addressed in the original FOI for monensin for cattle in
confinement for slaughter (<B>FR 58289-58290, Vol:40, No. 242, December 16,
1975</B>).<br>
 <P>
<b>7.  Agency Conclusions:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA satisfy the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and <B>21CFR 558</B> of the implementing
regulations.  It demonstrates that monensin (Type A medicated article) is safe
and effective for the indications stated on the product labeling.  The
supplement provides for a new claim, the use of monensin in feedlot cattle for
the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria bovis</i> and <i>E.
zuernii</i>.<P>
Monensin sodium for use in food producing animals is an over the counter
product.  Accurate diagnosis can be made with reasonable degree of certainty by
the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on the labeling are likely to
be followed in the practice.  Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has
concluded that this product remains under over-the-counter marketing status.<P>
According to the Center's provisions of <B>21CFR 514.106</B> (2) (vii) this is a
Category II change because the claim was expanded for the use of monensin in
feedlot cattle to prevent coccidiosis caused by <i>E.</i> <i>bovis</i> and
<i>E. zuernii</i>.  It was concluded that the approval of this supplement
neither poses an increased human risk from exposure to the drug nor alters the
condition of the drug's safety in cattle.<P>
The approved monensin sodium premix  is codified in section <B>21CFR 558.355</B> as a
Type A medicated article for use in broiler chickens, turkeys, replacement
chickens intended for use as cage layers, bobwhite quail, and goats for the
prevention of coccidiosis, and in cattle for the improvement of feed
efficiency.  The tolerance is codified in section <B>21CFR 556.420</B> (a) and is
established at 0.05 part per million for negligible residues of monensin in the
edible tissues of cattle and goats.  Withdrawal time before slaughter is not
required.<br>

<b>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</b> <P>
<b>I. GENERAL INFORMATION</b> <P>
NADA: 046-592 <P>
SPONSOR: <P>
A. L. Laboratories, Inc.<br>
One Executive Drive<br>
P. O. Box 1399<br>
Fort Lee, NJ 07024 <P>
GENERIC NAME: Bacitracin Methylene Disalicylate <P>
TRADE NAME: BMD &#174<P>

MARKETING STATUS: OTC <P>
EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENT: <P>
<B>21 CFR 558.76</B> provides for the use of BMD in poultry,  
cattle, swine, pheasant and quail variously for increased  
rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency and control  
of certain diseases. <P>
This supplement adds the claim for the control of  
clostridial enteritis caused by <i>C. perfringens</i> in  
suckling piglets born to sows medicated with BMD at a  
level of 250 grams/ton of feed during the period 14 days  
before through 21 days after farrowing on premises with a  
history of clostridial scours. <P>
<b>II. INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b> <P>
For control of clostridial enteritis caused by <i>C.</i>  
<i>perfringens</i> in suckling piglets when fed to sows from 14  
days before through 21 days after farrowing on premises  
with a history of clostridial scours. <P>
<b>III. DOSAGE FORM:</b> <P>
BMD Type A Medicated Articles<br>
Concentrations: 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 75 grams/lb. <P>
Dosage: Feed at a level of 250 grams/ton of feed from 14  
days before through 21 days after farrowing. <P>
Route of Administration: Orally in the feed. <P>
<b>IV. SUMMARY OF EFFICACY DATA:</b> <P>
Well-controlled range finding studies using pregnant sows  
in an environment infected with <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>  
were conducted under investigational new animal drug  
regulations to establish an optimal dose/duration of  
administration profile. Sows (with controls) were fed BMD  
at levels of 0, 50, 150 and 250 grams/ton of feed to  
determine an optimal dose as measured by control of  
clostridial enteritis in piglets and increased rate of  
weight gain in said piglets. Results from these studies  
showed that the 250 g/ton dose level was better than the  
150 g/ton dose level in the primary efficacy parameters  
of scour scores and mortality due to clostridium, and  
these parameters were near maximum efficacy at the 250  
g/ton dose. <P>
Four well-controlled replicated studies were conducted in  
Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska to confirm the  
efficacy of BMD for control of clostridial enteritis in  
neonatal pigs. These trials, conducted among natural  
outbreaks of the disease, entailed feeding pregnant sows  
of varying parity BMD at 250 grams/ton of feed for a  
minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 18 days before  
through 21 days after farrowing. Since the sow was the  
experimental unit, piglet mortality due to clostridial  
enteritis was expressed as a percent of pigs born alive  
and average daily gain and scouring score were expressed  
as a litter average. Scour score ranged from 1 (normal)  
to 4 (severe diarrhea). Details and results of the  
individual trials follow: <P>

Purpose of Study: To establish that suckling piglets born  
to sows fed BMD at 250 grams/ton of feed for 14 days  
prior to and 21 days after farrowing experienced less  
morbidity and mortality and increased rate of weight gain  
compared to offspring of unmedicated sows under  
conditions where clostridial enteritis due to <I>C.  
perfringens</I> is present. <P>
Test Animals: Pregnant sows of locally popular crossbreed  
at least 2-1/2 weeks before farrowing were used. Animals  
were ranked by farrowing date and paired off, each pair  
treated and control were assigned randomly to a block.  
Treatments were assigned randomly to the pen with the  
restriction that there was one pen per block for each of  
the two treatments. Health status of the piglets was the  
criterion of efficacy as measured by percent mortality,  
degree of diarrhea observed and rate of weight gain. <P>
Treatment: Pregnant sows were given feed medicated with  
BMD at a level of 0 and 250 grams/ton of feed - 13  
animals per treatment. <P>
Results: <P>
The medicated group of sows (250 grams/ton) lost fewer  
pigs from all causes than the controls, (7 vs 31), and  
fewer from <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>, (2 vs 24), even  
though there were more sows in the treatment group (13 vs  
10). There was a higher incidence of scours in the  
control groups. The pigs in the medicated group weighed  
more at weaning. Results are summarized in the table  
below. <P>

Test Animals: The test system was pregnant sows in  
individual test pens on a practical swine farm where the  
disease is prevalent. The sows were on test from  
approximately 2.5 weeks pre-farrowing to 3 weeks post-  
farrowing. Animals were ranked by farrowing date and  
paired off, each pair treated and control were assigned  
randomly to a block. Treatments were assigned randomly to  
the pen with the restriction that there was one pen per  
block for each of the two treatments. Health status of  
the piglets was the criterion of efficacy as measured by  
percent mortality, degree of diarrhea observed and rate

Treatment: Pregnant sows were given feed medicated with  
BMD at a level of 0 and 250 grams/ton of feed - 12  
animals per treatment. <P>
Results: <P>
The BMD treated sows weaned 8.83 pigs per litter. The  
control sows weaned 6.77 pigs per litter. This 2.06 pig  
increase in weaning average was primarily due to a 1.66  
pig per litter reduction in death loss due to clostridial  
diarrhea. The pigs from the BMD treated sows had only  
slightly higher 21-day weights per pig. The reduced  
weaning average of over two pigs per litter in the  
control sows probably reduced the competition for  
available milk allowing each pig more nutrition. However,  
litter weaning weights were higher for the BMD treated  
sows due to the increase in the average number of pigs  
weaned. <P>
The improved average number of pigs weaned and weaning  
weights in conjunction with a reduction in pigs requiring  
treatment for clostridial scours as evidenced by the  
improvement in fecal consistency scores, shows that BMD  
treatment of the sows is an effective method of  
controlling clostridial enteritis. Results are summarized  
in the table below. <P>

<b>V. SUMMARY OF SAFETY TO THE ANIMAL</b> <P>
Target animal safety studies conducted for the swine  
dysentery claim, codified into <B>21 CFR 558.76 (47 FR  
18591)</B>, FOI Summary dated April 30, 1982, determined the  
effect of 500 g/ton of BMD fed continuously to sows from  
30 days before breeding through mid-gestation. Abortions,  
stillbirths, litter size, birth weights, agalactia, and  
maternal weight and health status were evaluated and  
found not to be affected by the drug product. Field trial  
data submitted for this claim showed no adverse effect in  
abortions, stillbirths, litter size, birth weights,  
agalactia, and maternal weight and health status for sows  
fed 250 g/ton of BMD from late gestation to weaning.  
These studies, together with reproductive safety studies  
in rats and metabolic studies comparing the  
pharmacokinetics of bacitracin in the rat and the pig,  
adequately demonstrate the safety of this product for use  
in pregnant sows and gilts. <P>
<b>VI. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b> <P>
An FOI Summary was prepared with the supplemental  
application to NADA 046-592 approved April 30, 1982 (<B>47 FR  
18591</B>) providing for the use of BMD in swine feeds at a  
level of 250 grams/ton as set forth in <B>21 CFR 558.76</B>. <P>
This supplemental application is for an identical intake  
for treatment of a different condition and for a shorter  
period of time. Therefore, the human food safety data  
summarized in the previous FOI, which discusses the  
toxicity, safe concentration of residues, total residues,  
and regulatory method for the use of BMD in swine feeds  
at 250 g/ton of feed, are applicable and show that the  
use of BMD in swine feeds at a level of 250 g/ton is safe  
from the standpoint of human food safety. <P>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b> <P>
The data submitted in support of this supplemental NADA  
satisfy the requirements of 512 of the Act and  
demonstrate that BMD 50 premix, when used under its  
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its  
labeled indications. <P>
Four well controlled, replicated studies were conducted  
to establish the effectiveness of BMD for the control of  
clostridial enteritis caused by <i>C. perfringens</i> in  
suckling piglets born to sows medicated with BMD in the  
feed for the period 14 days before parturition and  
through 21 days after farrowing on premises with a  
history of clostridial scours. Based upon data provided  
showing a decrease in mortality (21%) and a decrease in  
the prevalence of diarrhea in the treated over the  
controls, the agency concludes that BMD at a level of 250  
g/ton is an effective dose for control of clostridial  
enteritis. Reproductive safety studies in rats, metabolic  
studies comparing the pharmacokinetics of bacitracin in  
the rat and pig, reproductive safety studies in swine  
conducted for the swine dysentery claim, and the field  
trial results submitted for this claim, adequately  
demonstrate the safety of this product for pregnant sows. <P>
Bacitracin products for use in food-producing animals are  
over-the-counter products. Accurate diagnosis can be made  
with a reasonable degree of certainty by the layman.  
Adequate directions for use have been written for the  
layman and the conditions of use prescribed on the  
labeling are likely to be carried out in practice.  
Therefore, the agency has concluded that this claim for  
bacitracin product be granted the over-the-counter  
marketing status. <P>
Under CVM's supplemental approval policy (<B>55 FR 46052;  
November 1, 1990</B>), this is a category II approval because  
this supplemental NADA requests approval of an additional  
claim. A review of the underlying human safety data  
supporting approval of the original application was not  
required, because the supplement did not request a change  
in dose level or class of animal, and thus approval does  
not pose an increased human risk from exposure to  
residues. <P>
As provided under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term  
Restoration Act of 1988 and section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of  
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.  
360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), this supplemental approval qualifies for  
three years of marketing exclusivity because new clinical  
or field investigations conducted or sponsored by A.L.  
Laboratories Inc. were essential to the approval. <P>

<h2>Compliance Policy Guides</h2>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><P>
<b>PURPOSE</b><P>
The purpose of the Compliance Policy Guides (CPG) Manual is to provide a
convenient and organized system for statements of FDA compliance policy,
including those statements which contain regulatory action guidance
information.  The statements made in the CPG are not intended to create or
confer any rights, privileges, or benefits on or for any private person, but
are intended for internal guidance.<P>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><P>
The CPG Manual system was initiated in 1968 in order to establish an orderly
method for assembling and maintaining statements of policy and was first issued
in 1969 by the Bureau of Compliance.  In 1972, the responsibility for its
maintenance was assigned to the Division of Field Operations, Office of the
Executive Director of Regional Operations.  In November 1984, the offices of
the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs and the Executive Director
for Regional Operations were combined reorganized.  As a result, the
responsibility for directing and coordinating the preparation and maintenance
of the CPG Manual was assigned to the newly formed Division of Compliance
Policy (HFC-230), Office of Enforcement, Office of Regulatory Affairs.<P>
<b>CONTENTS</b><P>
The CPG Manual is the repository for all agency compliance policy that has been
agreed to by the center(s) and the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory
Affairs.  Examples of sources form which CPGs are prepared include: a)
statements or correspondence by headquarters offices of centers reflecting new
policy or changes in compliance policy including Office of the Commissioner
memoranda, center memoranda and other information issuances, agency
correspondence with trade groups and regulated industries, and advisory
opinions; b) precedent court decisions; c) multicenter agreements regarding
jurisdiction over FDA regulated products; d) preambles to proposed or final
regulations or other Federal Register documents; and f) individual regulatory
actions.<P>
<b>RESPONSIBILITY</b><P>
OFFICE OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS (HFC-1)<P>
The Associate Commissioners for Regulatory Affairs (ACRA) (HFC-1) approves all
new or substantially revised CPGs prior to their issuance.  Final clearance for
rescinding a CPG generally is provided by the ACRA.  An exception to the
requirement for ACRA clearance may be made if the basis for rescission was
previously published in the Federal Register.  In this situation, the director
of the Division of Compliance Policy (HFC-230) can authorize the rescission.<P>
OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT - DIVISION OF COMPLIANCE POLICY (HFC-230)<P>
Review the policy in the CPG Manual on a continuing basis to assure that it is
current.  Coordinate the preparation of new or revised CPGs with the Center(s),
ORA headquarters and field offices, and the Office of General Counsel.  Obtain
any necessary clearances for new policy statements or changes in exiting
compliance policy and obtain final approval, and ensure that a Federal Register
notice availability is prepared for new and substantially revised (including
rescinded) CPG.<P>
Control and assign numbers for CPG.  Prepare the camera copy of CPG Manual and
forwards it to the Management Methods Branch (HFA-250) for publication.<P>
Notify the field and other offices as soon as possible when a new or
substantially revised CPG becomes effective or when a CPG is rescinded.  The
effective date of new or substantially revised CPG is the date that the CPG is
approved by the ACRA, unless otherwise stated in the CPG or a Federal Register
notice announcing availability of the CPG.<P>
CPGs having a revision date of the month and year of the bound edition are
revised CPGs with this publication.  The index shows the current status of all
prior and current CPGs under the heading Compliance Policy Guides.<P>
CENTERS AND HEADQUARTERS OFFICES<P>
Review policy in the CPG Manual to assure that it its current.  Identify new
and developing compliance policies that are significant enough to be
articulated and disseminated to the field and industry.  Center and
headquarters offices will cooperate with the Division of Compliance Policy
(HFC-230) in the formulation and clearance for individual CPG.<P>
OFFICE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT - MANAGEMENT METHODS BRANCH
(HFA-250)<P>
Process Manual issuances for printing. Serves as the Agency's contact with the
National Technical Information Services (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce,
Springfield, VA 22161 which makes the Manual available to the general public
for a fee.<P>
<b>FORMAT OF CPG</b><P>
TITLE: A clear concise statement of the subject of the CPG<P>
BACKGROUND: Information concerning the problem or situation addressed by the
CPG.  Whenever possible, the original source of the policy statement or changes
will be cited.  When the CPG contains a change in existing policy, the
background should indicate the original policy and the reason for the
change.<P>
POLICY: A clear and concise statement of the current FDA policy.  Whenever any
limitations on, or exceptions to the stated policy are necessary, those
limitation and exception will be stated.<P>
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: Whenever possible, each CPG will contain regulatory
action guidance.  This section will include the necessary guidance for making
regulatory decisions and should include, but is not limited to, the following
information: a) the limits at which the field is authorized to take direct
regulatory action without referral to the appropriate center; b) information
for use in making decision as to admissibility of imports; c) information on
products, processes, or conditions for which there is insufficient experience
or data to warrant delegation of authority for direct regulatory action by the
field; and d) recommended charges (specimen charges) for direct regulatory
actions.<P>
<b>CPG NUMBERING SYSTEM</b><P>
The CPG Manual utilizes both a "Section" and a "CPG" number for individual
Guides.  The CPG numbers are preceded by CPG and have number in the range of
7100-7199.  The CPG numbers were based on the previous organization of the CPG.
The Guides have been reorganized into new chapters and Section numbers now
indicate the chapter and location within the chapter.  The Section numbers
precede the title of each Guide while the CPG numbers follow the title in
parentheses.<P>
<b>CLEARANCE PROCEDURE</b><P>
Any new or substantially revised CPG must be cleared by the originating center,
other offices or centers affected, and by the ACRA.  The Division of Compliance
Policy (HFC-230) will coordinate and maintain all clearance records.<P>
<b>DISTRIBUTION</b><P>
For FDA personnel, copies may be obtained by contacting the Division of
Compliance Policy (HFC-230) at (301) 827-0420.<P>
For state and local government agencies personnel, copies many be obtained by
contacting the State Information Branch, (HFC-151), Division of Federal-State
Relations at (301) 443-6200.<P>
Issuances of new or revised CPGs between Manual publications will be
electronically available to FDA personnel.  NTIS will be provided with a
printed copy of all new or revised CPGs for distribution to the general public
for a fee.<br>

<H3> PRESCRIPTION NEW ANIMAL DRUG ADVERTISING</h3>
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, CENTER FOR VETERINARY  MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
AND EDUCATION BRANCH, HFV-12, 301/594-1755  <p>
Revised January 1995<br>
         Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
            D.H.H.S. Pub. No. (FDA) 95-6001<br>

             Pharmaceutical houses producing veterinary prescription 
            drugs, and firms planning to enter this field, are advised 
            that advertising for such drugs falls under the same 
            regulations that affect human prescription drug advertising. 
            Firms should be alerted that the advertising regulations will 
            be uniformly applied for all veterinary prescription drugs.
            <p>
            When an advertisement is developed for a new animal 
            prescription drug, the firm should be sure that adequate 
            documentation is on file in the appropriate New Animal Drug 
            Application (NADA). Undocumented claims of effectiveness or 
            superiority of drugs are considered "false and/or misleading 
            advertising." In addition, Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
            Regulations (CFR), Part 510.300(b)(3) states that 
            "advertising ... devised for the promotion of new animal 
            drugs shall be submitted (to the Center for Veterinary 
            Medicine) at the time ... of initial publication of any 
            advertisement for prescription drugs and at the time of 
            initial dissemination of promotional labeling."
            <p>
            Failure to comply with these regulations may result in 
            withdrawal of approval of the firm's New Animal Drug 
            Application.
            <p>
            Pharmaceutical houses in the veterinary prescription drug 
            business are urged to check on regulations regarding these 
            drugs in order to avoid violations. 21 CFR 202.1 
            (Prescription Drug Advertising) spells out FDA regulations 
            concerning prescription drug advertisements. This section 
            provides specific guidelines regarding permissible 
            advertising materials. Firms are urged to use these 
            guidelines in the development of their advertising.
            <P>
            Changes in the regulations may be made from time to time. 
            Such changes are published in the <B>Federal Register</b> (FR) and 
            become part of Title 21 CFR. These publications may be 
            purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
            Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

<b><A NAME="effect5">5.   Effectiveness</b></a><P>

The indication for use of this product is:  "For increased production of
marketable milk in lactating dairy cows."<P>

Increased production refers to an increase in <b>weight</b> of milk
produced. Dairy producers in the U.S. measure (and describe) milk production
per cow or per farm in weight units, not volume.  Thus, in the pivotal
effectiveness and animal safety studies, weight of milk produced (not volume)
was measured.  <P>

The term "marketable" milk refers to the milk that the dairy producer can
legally sell.  (The term "salable" milk is used interchangeably with
"marketable" milk in this section of the FOI Summary.)  Milk produced the first
few days after a cow has a calf, also called colostrum, is not marketable as
its composition is considerably different from true milk.  Also, milk produced
from cows after receiving certain therapeutic drugs cannot be sold legally if
the milk contains residues of the drug above the FDA-established tolerance.  In
determining the effectiveness of sometribove, milk produced by a cow during the
"withdrawal period" for any drug she had been administered therapeutically was
excluded.  (In the case of extra-label drug use, specific drug withdrawal
periods were specified by the firm for purposes of the calculation, with CVM's
concurrence.)  Thus, on any day that a cow's milk should have been discarded
because of a withdrawal period, the cow's production of "marketable/salable"
milk was considered to be <b>zero</b>.  Therefore, the evaluation of the
effectiveness of the drug was based on production of marketable milk.<P>

The evaluation of the effectiveness of sometribove was also based upon
production of salable "3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk" or "FCM."  The content of fat
in milk typically varies among cows from about 2.0 to 6 &#37;  and is affected by
factors such as the breed of the cow, stage of lactation, and its diet.  The
current pricing system in the U.S. generally favors milk of higher fat and
other "solids" content, such as protein, because more cheese and other
manufactured dairy products can be produced from the same unit of milk if
solids content is higher.  (For example, producers may get a bonus for milk of
higher fat or solids content.) A long-standing practice in the dairy industry
and the field of dairy science is to express milk production in terms of how
much milk would have been produced if it was standardized to 3.5 &#37;  fat content
(i.e., FCM).  Thus, a cow that produced 100 lbs of milk with 2.5 &#37;  fat content
would be calculated as having produced only about 84 lbs of FCM, whereas
another cow producing 100 lbs of milk with 5 &#37;  fat content would be said to have
produced 124 lbs of FCM.  The actual equation for the calculation of FCM is
provided on page 12.<P>

Other calculation procedures are discussed in Section 5.a of the FOI
Summary, including standardization to a specific length of lactation. All of
these steps were taken to remove any potential biases in the calculation of the
effectiveness of sometribove and also to evaluate milk production as it
typically is evaluated in the dairy industry.<P>

 <b>a.  Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4
Dose-SC)</b><P>

Clinical studies were conducted at four separate locations (University of
Arizona, Cornell University, University of Florida, and Utah State University)
to determine the effective dose range of sometribove when administered
subcutaneously (SC) commencing 60  &#177;   3 days postpartum and continuing until
the end of lactation.  The same study protocol was employed at each location
with minor variations to allow for differences in management practices.

  <b>   Materials and Methods</b>:<P>

One hundred nine primiparous (first calf heifer) and 145 multiparous
(mature) Holstein cows were randomly assigned within the two parity groupings
to treatments of 0 (excipient), 250, 500, or 750 mg of sometribove every 14
days.  Animals calved on location to allow acclimation prior to study
initiation.  At approximately 40 days postpartum, each cow was given a general
physical examination by a veterinarian.  Selection criteria for study cows
included acceptable body and udder conformation, disposition, and body
condition, adequate milk production and general health, vaccinations for IBR,
PI3, BVD, and leptospirosis, and a negative test for brucellosis and
tuberculosis. An additional requirement at Cornell was a negative test for
Johne's Disease (bovine paratuberculosis).  <P>

The 0 mg dose consisted of the formulation ingredients (excipient) minus
the active ingredient.  Sometribove was administered via subcutaneous injection
in one of four postscapular sites:  right upper, right lower, left upper, or
left lower.  Injections were rotated among these four sites so that eight weeks
elapsed prior to reinjection in a particular site, except at Florida, where due
to a protocol misinterpretation each site was used twice consecutively before
rotating to the next site.  Treatments were administered using 16-gauge 1-inch
hypodermic needles.  Within each study location, cows were injected on the same
day of the week, and all cows receiving treatment on a given day were injected
in the same postscapular site.  <P>

Treatment was initiated at 60  &#177;   3 days postpartum and continued at 14-day
intervals throughout lactation.  In pregnant animals, treatment ceased at least
74 days prior to expected calving date to allow for a dry period of
approximately 60 days or when average daily milk production decreased below 8.2
kg/day (unless low milk production was due to temporary ill health), whichever
occurred first.  Open (non-pregnant) animals continued on treatment for 25
treatment cycles (approximately 400-day lactation), or when average daily milk
production decreased below 8.2 kg/day (unless low milk production was due to
temporary ill health), whichever occurred first.  In all cows, injections
ceased as closely as possible to 14 days prior to dry off. <P>

</pre>

Within each parity group (primiparous and multiparous), blocks consisting
of random permutations of the four treatments were generated for each location
prior to the start of the study.  Cows were assigned to blocks in order of
calving dates.  Within a block the maximum range in average daily milk
production per cow during weeks 4 through 6 of lactation was  &#190; to 9.1
kg/day (with the exception of one multiparous block at 15.8 kg/day).  The range
in the first day of treatment for the first and last cows entering a block was
no greater than 56 calendar days.<P>

All cows were milked twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals except
at Florida where intervals were 11 and 13 hours.  All locations followed the
same general milking procedures.  Udders were washed and dried with individual
paper towels.  In addition, at Arizona and Utah, teats were predipped with an
approved iodine teat dip and dried.  Milk was forestripped onto the floor from
each quarter to detect abnormal milk before milking machines were attached.
The appearance of mastitic/abnormal milk was recorded.  After milking was
complete, teats were dipped with an approved iodine teat dip.  Weight of milk
yield was recorded for each cow at each milking throughout lactation.
Individual cows' milkings that were discarded (withheld from human consumption)
because the animal was administered med</i>&#160;ion that had a milk withdrawal
period were identified. <P>

Milk fat, protein, and lactose percentages and somatic cell counts were
determined from milk samples collected weekly from each cow on consecutive PM
and AM milkings throughout lactation.  Consistent days of the week were used at
each location.  Across the four locations, samples were collected three to four
and 10 to 11 days post-injection during the treatment period.<P>

Content of milk minerals (ash, calcium, and phosphorus) was determined on
samples collected at consecutive PM and AM milkings from each cow during
treatment weeks -2, -1, 3, 15, and 27.  Consistent days of the week were used
at each location.  Across the four locations, samples were collected three to
six days post-injection during the specified treatment weeks.<P>

Diets at each location were formulated to meet or exceed nutritional
requirements recommended by the National Research Council (NRC; 1978). All cows
were fed total mixed rations (TMR) <i>ad libitum</i>&#160; with sufficient feed
offered to allow for approximately 5 &#37;  refusal.  Amount of feed offered and
refused was recorded daily throughout lactation.  <P>
    Feeding practices were according to established management at each
location.  At all locations, cows were fed a high energy diet from freshening
to at least 90 days postpartum.  Thereafter, cows were switched to lower energy
density diets depending on level of milk production.  Because the dietary
formulations for different levels of milk production were based on typical
levels of <i>ad libitum</i>&#160; intake, it was also necessary to consider body
condition in making dietary shifts. At the discretion of the herd manager in
consultation with the investigator, the timing of a cow's shift to a lower
energy density diet may have been modified.  If actual feed consumption was
such that a cow was underconditioned for that stage of lactation, she may have
remained on the higher energy density diet for a longer period than that
indicated by her level of milk production. <P>

At each location, diets and components were sampled weekly and composited
monthly.  Analyses of these samples were performed at appropriate testing
facilities.  <P>

Cows were weighed weekly throughout the entire lactation.  Within a study
location, weights were taken at approximately the same time of day on a
consistent day of the week such that during the treatment period, across the 4
locations, weighings occurred on days three to five and 10 to 12
post-injection.  Body condition was scored at each weighing using a scale of 1
to 5 (1 = excessive underconditioning; 5 = excessive overconditioning) in
quarter point increments (Wildman et al., 1982, Journal of Dairy Science
65:495).<P>

The incidence of subclinical mastitis was evaluated from microbiological
cultures of duplicate milk samples collected from each quarter of each cow once
during the two-week pretreatment period, at 56-day intervals thereafter
throughout lactation, and at dry-off.  All cows at a location were sampled on
the same day relative to injection.<P>

For cases of clinical mastitis, duplicate samples were to be collected for
microbiological culture before antibiotic treatment, if any, was administered.
Adherence to this provision varied from location to location, and some
discretion regarding treatment regimen was allowed at each location.  However,
the Utah location rarely treated clinical mastitis, resulting in unacceptably
long cases.  The lack of any attempt to control clinical mastitis did not
reflect accepted mastitis management practices and could have resulted in
mastitis organisms being shed from infected quarters to other quarters and/or
cows, therefore confounding attempts to evaluate the effect of sometribove on
mastitis incidence at this location.  Mastitis data from the Utah location were
therefore eliminated from analysis.  Cows received intramammary dry cow
treatment in each quarter after their last milking of the lactation (end of
sometribove treatment period) at Arizona, Cornell, and Florida
locations.<P>

General herd health programs were followed at all locations.  Current
guidelines (National Institutes of Health), entitled "Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals," were followed.  Cows were observed daily for signs
of disease, injuries, or other disorders.  Minor disorders were treated by farm
personnel according to standard animal care procedures.  A veterinarian was
consulted when necessary.  Cows were treated with approved medications which
were used according to label direction unless the herd veterinarian or designee
deemed the extra-label use of medication necessary.  All health related
observations and medications administered were documented.  All available
practical means were taken to diagnose the cause of any illness or injury.
Cows received a general physical examination by a veterinarian during the last
injection cycle.  Sick or injured animals were removed from study if deemed
necessary by the attending veterinarian and the investigator or herd manager.
Necropsies were usually performed on clinical trial animals that died or were
euthanized while on study.  Any gross lesions observed at necropsy were
collected for histopathological examination.  All aborted fetuses of at least
100 days gestation and stillborn calves were examined externally and internally
for malformations.  If possible, the cause of abortion was determined. <P>
 <P>
Estrus detection was according to existing location practices and was based
on visual observation and tail head marking.  All observed heats were recorded
and scored as described in Section 6.i on Reproduction. <P>

Prostaglandins were not used as a reproductive aid in normal cycling cows
until after 120 days postpartum.  Prostaglandin use was allowed to treat
pyometra or cystic ovarian disease at any time if prescribed by a
veterinarian.<P>

Cows received a veterinary examination to evaluate reproductive health
prior to initiation of treatment.  All breeding was by artificial insemination
commencing at the first observed estrus after treatment initiation.  Pregnancy
was confirmed by rectal palpation at least 30 days after breeding.  Breeding
was continued through 400 (305 at Cornell) days postpartum.  Sire selection was
according to location practices.<P>

Injection sites were observed for any swellings or adverse reactions three
and ten days post injection and scored (see Section 6.g for description of the
scoring system).  If a visible swelling remained, scoring continued weekly
until the swelling disappeared, or up to 8 weeks, whichever occurred first.
<P>

All calves born after the initial lactation of treatment were weighed after
birth.  Birth weight, sex of the calf, and a calving ease score (as described
in Section 6.i on Reproduction) were recorded, in addition to any unusual
observations (surgical intervention or stillbirth) noted during calving.  After
birth, the navel was treated with tincture of iodine. All calves were fed 4 to
6 quarts of colostrum within 24 hours of birth. At Florida, calves may have
been allowed to nurse for up to 24 hours. Calves were then fed whole milk until
weaned after at least 35 days of age.  Free choice feeding of calf-starter
began 2 days after birth except at Cornell, where calf-starter was begun 5 days
after birth.  All calves were given a general physical examination, usually
within 72 hours of birth.  Female calves were weighed during the second and
fourth weeks of life.<P>

<b>Data Handling</b>:<P>

All cows started on treatment were included in the analysis of clinical
health, mastitis (excluding Utah, see below), and injection site reactions
(excluding Florida, see Section 6.g) for the period of time in which they were
on study.  Thus, every incident that occurred in these categories during the
study was included in the evaluation of the effect of the drug.  However, the
evaluation of effectiveness, reproduction, nutrient intake, and body weight and
condition generally involved the calculation of average values over the
treatment period. Therefore, to be included in these latter analyses, cows had
to complete greater than two-thirds of the 252-day standard treatment period
(i.e., &#62 or &#61  169 days of treatment) to provide sufficient data to
accurately estimate effects over an entire treatment period.  Reasons for not
completing &#62 or &#61 169 days of treatment included low production, health
problems, administered an incorrect dose, and incorrect blocking.  Also, a
block had to include at least two cows so that an estimate of within block
variation was possible.  The following cows did not complete at least 169 days
on treatment:<P>

Daily milk yield for each cow was the sum of two milkings per treatment day
and was set to missing if the yield at either milking was not recorded due to
mechanical or human error.  An average daily AM milk yield for each cow was
calculated for each treatment week from all of her non-missing daily AM milk
weights that week.  The same calculation was performed for all non-missing PM
milk weights to obtain an average daily PM milk yield per week for each cow.
Each cow's average daily AM and PM milk yields per week were summed to
determine her <b>average daily milk yield</b> for the week. <P>

An <b>average daily 3.5 &#37;  fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield</b> for each week
was calculated for each cow as follows.  <P>

1.  Each cow's average AM milk fat percent value and average daily AM milk
yield during a week were used in the following equation to determine her
average daily AM FCM yield for that week:<P>

          AM FCM (kg/d) = AM Milk (kg/d) X (0.43237 + (.16218 X AM fat
 &#37; ))<P>

2.  A cow's average daily PM FCM yield for the week was calculated using the
same equation and the animal's average PM milk fat percent value and average
daily PM milk yield during the week.<P>

3.  A cow's average daily AM and PM FCM yields for the week were summed to
obtain her average daily FCM yield for that week.<P>

4.  Any milk fat percent value greater than 8 &#37;  was designated as missing
because such a high value would generally represent a laboratory error.  During
the pretreatment period, missing weekly AM or PM milk fat percent values (e.g.,
sample not collected or laboratory error) were estimated from the average of
the adjacent weeks' AM or PM fat percent values, respectively.  However, during
the treatment period, weekly milk fat percent values tended to be cyclic.
Thus, if a cow's AM or PM milk fat percent value was missing during an
<b>even</b> week of the treatment period, the average of her adjacent
<b>even</b> weeks' respective AM or PM milk fat values was used as a
replacement for purposes of calculating a FCM value for the week.  Missing
values during odd numbered treatment weeks were similarly estimated.  <P>

The actual period of time in which cows remained on treatment varied
depending on conception date, milk yield, and health conditions.  Thus, an
<b>average daily standardized FCM (SFCM) yield</b> per cow was calculated,
adjusting to a 252-day treatment period (i.e., 36 weeks) according to the
following procedures.<P>

1.  For cows on treatment &#62;  or &#61; 252 days, the average daily FCM yields
during each of the first 36 weeks of treatment were averaged.<P>

2.  For cows dried off at &#60; 252 days due to low milk production, an
average daily FCM yield of 0 kg/day was assigned to the weeks following the
last injection cycle through 36 weeks of treatment. The average daily FCM
yields for each of the 36 weeks were then averaged.<P>

3.  For cows dried off at &#60; 252 days to allow a 60-day dry period (i.e.,
early conception) or because of non-treatment related removal from study, data
were extended beyond the last complete injection cycle by linear regression.
Individual cow regressions were estimated from the last six completed injection
cycles, excluding cycles for which milk production was judged to be atypical
for the general trend.  Average daily FCM yield for the cycles was regressed on
median treatment day of the cycle.  The resulting equation for each cow was
used to estimate her production during each week after the last completed
injection cycle through 36 weeks of treatment.  The average daily FCM yields
for each of the 36 weeks were then averaged.<P>

<b>Average daily salable standardized FCM (SSFCM) yield</b> was calculated
for each cow.  Each cow's average daily standardized FCM (SFCM) yield was
multiplied by 252 days to obtain her total standardized FCM yield.  The sum of
all FCM discarded during the treatment period was subtracted from the total
standardized FCM yield.  The result was then divided by 252 days.<P>

For the purposes of evaluating the effect of treatment on <b>milk
composition</b> (milk fat, lactose, and protein percent and somatic cell
counts), each week's AM and PM milk component values for each cow were weighted
by the daily AM and PM milk yields within the week to calculate a weekly milk
component value.  Any PM or AM fat percent value greater than 8 &#37;  again was set
to missing.  If any of a cow's AM and/or PM milk component values were missing,
her week's average milk component value was designated as missing so that, for
the evaluation of effects on milk composition, only actual data (i.e., no
estimated values) were used in the analysis.  Somatic cell count data were
converted to log base 10 prior to any statistical analysis. <P>

Milk mineral values (ash, calcium, and phosphorus) were calculated for each
cow during each sampled week by averaging replicates for each sampling, and
then averaging values for consecutive milkings sampled during that week.
<P>

The amount of feed consumed by each cow was calculated for each day by
subtracting the feed refused from the feed offered.  The consumed value was set
to missing if any offered or refused value was missing. <P>

Results of laboratory analysis of TMR and feed ingredient samples were used
to calculate feed composition for each day that a particular TMR (also hay at
Utah) was fed.  Estimated composition for days with missing composition data
was the average of values for two adjacent periods.  <P>
    Net energy of lactation (NE) for TMRs was calculated from NE of the
components based on the proportion of each in the total diet.  Values for NE
for grains and by-products were those documented by NRC (1978). Values for NE
for forages were those reported by the feed analysis laboratory for that
sample.  Dry matter content and all other nutrient values for each sample were
also those reported in the feed composition analysis.<P>

Amount consumed and composition for each day were combined to calculate dry
matter, net energy, protein, calcium, and phosphorus intakes. These intakes
were calculated separately for each feedstuff consumed and summed to obtain
total nutrient intake per cow per day.  Total daily intake was set to missing
on any day that an individual feed consumed was missing. <P>

Average daily dry matter, net energy, protein, calcium, and phosphorus
intakes per cow per treatment week were calculated as the mean of non-missing
daily intakes.<P>

Energy, protein, calcium, and phosphorus balances were calculated for each
cow as follows:  <P>

1.  The requirements for these nutrients for milk production were calculated
from average AM and PM milk yield per treatment week and weekly AM and PM fat
test separately, then summed for the average daily requirement per treatment
week.  The equations for these requirements are as follows (derived from 1978
NRC):<P>

NE Required for Milk Production (Mcal/d):<P>

2.  The daily maintenance requirement was calculated as (1978 NRC):<P>

calcium (g/d) = 0.185 * (body weight)^3/4 -1.256<br>
phosphorus (g/d) = 0.137 * (body weight)^3/4 + .411<P>

 
where body weight was in kilograms and weekly weights were estimated by interpolation
between actual weekly weights.<P>

3.  Total nutrient requirement for milk and maintenance was the sum of the
two individual parts.  Nutrient balance was calculated on a weekly basis as the
net nutrient intake minus the sum of the nutrient requirements for milk and
maintenance.<P>

<b>Statistical Analyses</b>:<P>

Because primiparous cows are generally still growing and have a lactation
curve shaped differently from multiparous cows, analyses of all effectiveness
data and animal safety data (excluding injection site reaction and body
temperature data) were performed separately for the two parity groups.
Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis System
(SAS).  Data were analyzed using analysis of variance.  The pooled analyses used
the linear model Y(i,j,k) = U + T(i) + S (j) + T(s,i,j) + B(k)(S
(j)) + b*PRE(i,j,k) + e(i,j,k), where U = overall mean, T(i) =
treatment effect, S (j) = location effect, T(s,i,j) = treatment by location
interaction, B(k)(S (j)) = block (within location) effect, PRE(i,j,k) =
covariate, b = regression coefficient for PRE(i,j,k), and e(i,j,k) =
residual. The treatment by location interaction, when significant (P &#60; 0.25),
was used as the error term to test the significance of the treatment effect.  Treatment
effects were deemed to be significant when P &#60; 0.05 for effectiveness data and
P &#60; 0.10 for safety data.  Each cow's average 14-day pretreatment value for
each variable was expressed as the deviation from the location and parity mean
and included as a covariate in the analysis for that variable to reduce
experimental variation.  Variables not covariately adjusted (e.g., somatic cell
counts) are so indicated where results are tabulated.<P>

Analyses of effectiveness data were first performed on average daily values
computed up to 18 completed cycles (252 days of treatment). Variables were
first subjected to tests for normality for information only; no transformations
were made for non-normal data.  Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variance
across locations was also performed. For pretreatment effectiveness data,
Bartlett's test was based on a model that did not include treatment or the
treatment by location interaction.  For treatment period data, the full model
was used for Bartlett's test.  Significant heterogeneity (P&#60;0.005) required
that analyses be weighted using the reciprocal of the residual variance for
each location.<P>

Nutritional parameters, body weight, and body condition score data were
also analyzed as daily averages calculated over four 56-day periods of
treatment and for the four periods combined (224 days).  Pretreatment values
were used to reduce experimental variation in each analysis, and each was
weighted if the 252 day average for that variable had significant heterogeneity
of variance across locations.  Treatment effects were determined for each
period separately.  Although not analyzed by repeated measures techniques,
these analyses allowed for comparison of treatment effects during different
time intervals of the entire lactation.<P>

Linear-plateau modelling (Anderson and Nelson, 1975 and 1984) was used to
determine the effective dose range of sometribove.  The relationship examined
was between the dose administered and average daily SSFCM and adjusted for the
effects of location, block, and pretreatment production (deviations from within
location by parity mean used as a covariate).  Five types of models were used
with notation following Anderson and Nelson (1975) and dose = 0, 1, 2, 3 for
the 0, 250, 500, 750 mg/14 day treatments, respectively:<P>

1.  Model II - a straight line where response = [[beta(0)]] + [[beta(1)]] *dose +
[[epsilon]].<P>

2.  Model III - a linear plateau model where response = [[beta(0)]] + [[beta(1)]]
*dose + [[epsilon]].  Two submodels were tested, III-1 with plateau beginning at dose 1
(250 mg/14 days) and III-2 with plateau beginning at dose 2 (500 mg/14
days).<P>

3.  Model IV -  A linear plateau model where response = [[beta(0)]] + [[beta(1)]]
*dose, + [[beta(2)]] *dose + [[epsilon]].  Two submodels were tested, IV-1 with plateau
beginning after dose 1 (250 mg/14 days) and IV-2 with plateau beginning after
dose 2 (500 mg/14 days).<P>

4.  Model V - two sloping lines where response = [[beta(0)]] + [[beta(1)]] *dose,
+ [[beta(2)]] *dose + [[epsilon]].  Two submodels were tested, V-1 with lines intersecting
at dose 1 (250 mg/14 days) and V-2 with lines intersecting at dose 2 (500 mg/14
days).<P>

5.  Quad - a quadratic model where response = [[beta(0)]] + [[beta(1)]] *dose +
 [[beta(2)]] *dose* + [[epsilon]].<P>

Four models were excellent candidates to fit the results for each parity
separately.  These are the linear, quadratic, IV-2, and V-1. All had
R^2 values greater than 0.96.  However, the quadratic model was not
appropriate since all coefficients in the model were not significantly
different from zero, and the model degenerates to the linear model.  For model
V-1, the slopes of the two line segments do not differ, leaving a linear model.
For model IV-2, the breakpoint to a plateau can be calculated to occur above
the highest administered dose.  This violates the assumption that the plateau
occurs before the highest administered dose, and causes the model to degenerate
to the linear model.  Therefore, the linear model was chosen as the best
candidate for an appropriate dose titration over this dose range.  The linear
model mean squared error also best approximates the ANOVA mean squared error.

<b>Results</b>:<P>

Data from the four locations were intended to be pooled to evaluate the
measure of effectiveness, salable standardized FCM (SSFCM).  However, the SSFCM
data from the Utah location were excluded from this analysis. As discussed
previously, most mastitis cases at the Utah location were not treated, thus, it
was not possible to quantitate the amount of milk that would have been
discarded due to mastitis therapy.  Also, the incidence and duration of
mastitis cases may have been affected by the lack of treatment, which would
have also affected the calculation of SSFCM.  Thus, the Utah data were excluded
from the analysis of effectiveness in increasing the production of
SSFCM.<P>

injection cycle, peaking on approximately day 8 and having the lowest response
at the beginning and end of each cycle.  As seen in Table 5, the difference

  At the 500 mg dose, fat and protein
percents were slightly increased for both parity groups (0.14 and 0.06
percentage units, respectively) and lactose percent was slightly decreased
(0.02 percentage units) for primiparous cows in the second week compared to the
first week of the treatment cycle. However, because cows within a herd are
generally at various stages of lactation, and stage of lactation had a greater
impact on milk composition than cyclicity due to treatment with sometribove,
these minor effects would be expected to have no impact on average milk
composition of bulk tank milk.<P>

Dry matter intake increased for both primiparous and multiparous cows (see
Table 44 in Section 6.h).  Feed efficiency could not be evaluated in this study
since the change in body condition over the treatment period was not similar
across treatment groups for each parity for the cows treated at the 500 and 750
mg level.  For further discussion of body condition see Section 6.h.  Mastitis
data are reviewed in Section 6.j.  Reproduction data are discussed in Section
6.i.  Health data are discussed in Section 6.k.  Data on offspring are
discussed in Section 6.l.<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>:<P>

The increase in marketable (salable) milk in response to sometribove in
lactating dairy cows was linear in both parity groups.  The response at 250 mg
every 14 days was significantly greater than in controls, and the response was
linear through the highest dose tested, 750 mg every 14 days.  The dose
requested by the sponsor, 500 mg administered every 14 days, was within the
range of effectiveness and therefore approvable for use.  The milk yield
response exhibited a cyclic pattern during each 14-day injection cycle, with
greatest response during the middle of each cycle; this effect is described in
the product labeling so that dairy producers are aware of the pattern in milk
yield during treatment.  Administration of sometribove had no significant
effect on the overall composition of milk.<P>

<b> b.  Tailhead Versus Postscapular Subcutaneous Administration

Two field studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
sometribove by SC administration in the ischiorectal fossa (depression on
either side of the tailhead region, subsequently referred to as tailhead)
compared to the postscapular region in increasing the production of 3.5 &#37; 
fat-corrected milk.  Results from these studies, as well as histopathological
data (see Section 6.g), were used to determine whether the tailhead was an
acceptable SC route of administration for sometribove. <P>

Eighty-eight Jersey cows from a commercial dairy farm in Arizona were

</pre>

Following a 14-day pretreatment period, a 14-week (98-day) treatment period
was initiated in which controls were untreated and the sometribove treatment
groups received a maximum of 7 injections. Treatment was initiated on the same
calendar day for all animals, and cows ranged from 59 to 179 days postpartum on
this date.  <P>

Cows were housed in an open-lot corral throughout the study and fed a total
mixed ration which met or exceeded nutritional requirements recommended by NRC
(1989).<P>

The cows were milked twice a day.  Daily milk yield per cow was measured
once every week, with consecutive PM and AM milk weights recorded on days -10
and -3 relative to treatment initiation during the pretreatment period, and
then on days 3 and 10 following each treatment injection.  Milk was also
sampled on these days, and daily PM and AM samples were composited and analyzed
to estimate the average weekly milk fat percent value for each cow.  Each cow's
milk fat percent and average daily milk yield for the week were used to
calculate an average daily FCM yield per week as described in Section 5.a.
<P>

Two primiparous cows (one in each sometribove treatment group) and 9
multiparous cows (six 500 mg-PS; three 500 mg-TH) missed one of the 7
injections during the treatment period.  Average daily FCM yield for these cows
during these weeks of the treatment period was considered missing.  <P>

During even-numbered treatment weeks, milk fat percents or milk weights
that were not recorded (human or mechanical error) were estimated from the
average of the cow's adjacent even weeks' values; missing values during
odd-number treatment weeks were similarly estimated.  One multiparous control
cow was excluded from analysis because her milk yields were not recorded for
three consecutive weeks.<P>

An average daily FCM yield during the treatment period was calculated for each
cow from all treatment weeks in which injections were not missed.  Results were
analyzed using analysis of variance, fitting the model Y(i,j,k) =  U + T(i)
+ B(j) + b*PRE(i,j,k) + e(i,j,k), where U = overall mean, T(i) =
treatment effect, B(j) = block effect, PRE(i,j,k) = covariate (14-day
pretreatment FCM yield), b = regression coefficient for covariate, and e(i,j,k)
= residual.  Results are provided in Table 9.  There was no difference in FCM
response in dairy cows administered sometribove subcutaneously in either the
postscapular or tailhead region.<P>

Forty-eight Holstein cows from a commercial dairy farm in Idaho were
assigned to one of three treatment groups:  control; 500 mg sometribove
administered SC in the PS region every 14 days; or 500 mg sometribove
administered SC in the TH region every 14 days.  The distribution of cows
started on treatment is provided below:<P>

</pre>

Following a 14-day pretreatment period, a 12-week (84-day) treatment period
was initiated in which controls were untreated and the sometribove treatment
groups received a total of 6 injections. Treatment was initiated on the same
calendar day for all animals, and cows ranged from 65 to 175 days postpartum on
this date.  <P>

Cows were housed in free-stall lots throughout the study and fed one of
four total mixed rations balanced to meet or exceed nutritional requirements
recommended by NRC (1989) depending on stage of lactation, parity, production,
and body condition score.  <P>

The cows were milked three times a day.  Weight of milk yield was recorded
for each cow at each milking during the pretreatment and treatment period.
Daily milk yield for each cow was the sum of the three milkings per day and was
set to missing if the yield at any milking was not recorded.  An average daily
milk yield was calculated for each cow during each treatment week from all
non-missing daily milk yields measured that week.  Beginning the week prior to
treatment initiation, each cow's milk was sampled once a week (days 2 and 9
post-injection) during the three milkings that day.  The three samples were
composited and analyzed to estimate the animal's average weekly milk fat
percent value.  Each cow's milk fat percent and average daily milk yield for
the week were used to calculate an average daily FCM yield per week as
described in Section 5.a.  <P>

During even-numbered treatment weeks when a cow's milk fat percent value
was missing, the average of her adjacent even weeks' values was used as a
replacement; missing values during odd-number treatment weeks were similarly
estimated.  <P>

An average daily FCM yield during the treatment period was calculated for
each cow from her weekly values.  Results were analyzed using the model
described for the Arizona Jersey study (#100-AZF-COW-JAD-89-075). One
multiparous 500 mg-TH treated cow was diagnosed with lymphosarcoma on day 63 of
treatment and was excluded from analysis.  Results are provided in Table 11.
There was no difference in FCM response in dairy cows administered sometribove
subcutaneously in either the postscapular or tailhead region.<P>

          of the
          United States of America
          AT THE SECOND SESSION
          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
          the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and
          ninety-four
          An Act
          To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify the
          application of the Act with respect to alternate uses of new animal
          drugs and new drugs intended for human use, and for other purposes.
           [Italic->]   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
          Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
          assembled, [<-Italic]
          SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
            This Act may be cited as the `Animal Medicinal Drug Use
          Clarification Act of 1994'.
          SEC. 2. UNAPPROVED USES.
            (a) GENERAL RULE- Section 512(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
          Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(a)) is amended by adding the following
          new paragraphs at the end:
            `(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if an approval of
          an application filed under subsection (b) is in effect with respect
          to a particular use or intended use of a new animal drug, the drug
          shall not be deemed unsafe for the purposes of paragraph (1) and
          shall be exempt from the requirements of section 502(f) with 
          respect to a different use or intended use of the drug, other than 
          a use in or on animal feed, if such use or intended use--
                `(i) is by or on the lawful written or oral order of a
              licensed veterinarian within the context of a
              veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as defined by the
              Secretary; and
                `(ii) is in compliance with regulations promulgated by the
              Secretary that establish the conditions for such different use
              or intended use.
          The regulations promulgated by the Secretary under clause (ii) may
          prohibit particular uses of an animal drug and shall not permit 
          such different use of an animal drug if the labeling of another
          animal drug that contains the same active ingredient and which is 
          in the same dosage form and concentration provides for such
          different use.
            `(B) If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable 
          probability that a use of an animal drug authorized under
          subparagraph (A) may present a risk to the public health, the
          Secretary may--
                `(i) establish a safe level for a residue of an animal drug
              when it is used for such different use authorized by
              subparagraph (A); and
                `(ii) require the development of a practical, analytical
              method for the detection of residues of such drug above the 
              safe level established under clause (i).
          The use of an animal drug that results in residues exceeding a safe
          level established under clause (i) shall be considered an unsafe 
          use of such drug under paragraph (1). Safe levels may be 
          established under clause (i) either by regulation or order.
            `(C) The Secretary may by general regulation provide access to 
          the records of veterinarians to ascertain any use or intended use
          authorized under subparagraph (A) that the Secretary has determined
          may present a risk to the public health.
            `(D) If the Secretary finds, after affording an opportunity for
          public comment, that a use of an animal drug authorized under
          subparagraph (A) presents a risk to the public health or that an
          analytical method required under subparagraph (B) has not been
          developed and submitted to the Secretary, the Secretary may, by
          order, prohibit any such use.
            `(5) If the approval of an application filed under section 505 is
          in effect, the drug under such application shall not be deemed
          unsafe for purposes of paragraph (1) and shall be exempt from the
          requirements of section 502(f) with respect to a use or intended 
          use of the drug in animals if such use or intended use--
                `(A) is by or on the lawful written or oral order of a
              licensed veterinarian within the context of a
              veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as defined by the
              Secretary; and
                `(B) is in compliance with regulations promulgated by the
              Secretary that establish the conditions for the use or intended
              use of the drug in animals.'.

<b>Study No. 100-FRE-COW-PJE-86-023</b><P>

A controlled, single lactation study was conducted to evaluate the effects
of sometribove injected intramuscularly (IM) over multiple doses.  Based on
results of the IM/SC Bridging Study, this study was used to provide data on
health, nutritional variables, and reproduction of treated cows.  Milk
production and milk composition were also examined to verify that the study
conditions represented a valid system to evaluate animal safety.  The study was
conducted at Monsanto Animal Research Center, French Village, MO. <P>

Eighty-five lactating Holstein cows in their 1st, 2nd, or 3rd lactation were
used.  Cows were housed in two tie-stall facilities with artificial lighting and
evaporative cooling.  All cows were brought to the test facility prior to their
pretreatment parturition, and individual health and production records were
maintained beginning at parturition.


The study was conducted as a randomized complete block with a two-way
classification.  The two classification factors were sometribove dosage (0,
250, 500, or 750 mg/14 days) and parity (primiparous vs. multiparous).  All
doses were administered from 60  &#177;   3 days postpartum via IM injection,
alternately into the distal and proximal semitendinosus and semimembranosus
muscles on the left and right sides (i.e., 8 rotating sites) at 14-day
intervals until one of the following:  1) 74 days prior to expected calving; 2)
average milk production for the 14-day injection cycle fell below approximately
5 kg/cow/day; 3) moribundity or death; or 4) 400 days postpartum was reached in
the case of open, lactating cows.  Pregnant cows remained on study and were
monitored three weeks following subsequent parturition.  The distribution of
cows started on treatment is provided in Table 26.<P>

Cows were milked twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals. Weight of
milk yield was recorded for each cow at each milking throughout lactation.  The
appearance of mastitic/abnormal milk was recorded.  <P>

Individual milk samples were collected from each cow weekly on consecutive
PM and AM milkings throughout lactation (days 4 and 11 post-injection) for
analysis of fat, protein, and lactose percent and somatic cell count.  Milk
ash, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium concentrations were measured in
samples collected on consecutive PM and AM milkings during treatment weeks -6,
-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, 23, 24, 29, 30, 35, and 36.   <P>

All cows were fed diets formulated to meet or exceed requirements
recommended by NRC (1978).  Cows were offered sufficient feed to allow for a
refusal rate of approximately 5 &#37;.  Feed refusals were determined for each cow
daily throughout the lactation.  Rations were sampled daily, composited weekly,
and analyzed for nutrient content.  Body weights were measured weekly beginning
at parturition.  Body condition was scored on week 1 of treatment and at the
end of each subsequent calendar month.<P>

Estrus detection and breeding were conducted using accepted management
practices.  Management tools such as KAMAR&#174; strips and cow-side progesterone
kits were used to facilitate estrus detection.  Breeding commenced
approximately 40 days postpartum and animals that had not conceived by 200 days
were declared open.  Birth weight, height, and heart girth were recorded for
all male and female calves born to cows on study.  Female calves were raised
until approximately 4 weeks of age, and their body weights were measured on a
consistent day of each week during this period.<P>

The general health status of all animals was evaluated daily throughout the
study.  Rectal temperatures were measured daily beginning two weeks prior to
treatment initiation.  Blood was sampled on days -14 and -7 of pretreatment and
on days 0, 7, and 14 of treatment cycles 1, 5, 11, 16, and 22.  Serum or plasma
was analyzed for somatotropin, insulin, thyroxine, nonesterified fatty acids,
beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, creatinine, triglycerides, calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, and urea nitrogen.  Blood and urine samples were also collected at
veterinary physical examinations at approximately 40 and 180 days postpartum,
at the last week of treatment, and at two weeks postpartum in the subsequent
lactation.  These samples were analyzed for hematology parameters, calcium,
magnesium, phosphorus, creatinine, and triglycerides.  <P>

Four multiparous cows were removed from the study prior to completing their
treatment period:<P>

    Milk production was higher in treated cows, indicating that study
conditions were valid for the evaluation of animal safety.  A linear response
pattern for production variables was present for primiparous but not
multiparous cows.  Mean proportions of major milk constituents during the
treatment period were not significantly affected by sometribove administration
regardless of dosage.  Similarly, magnesium and calcium concentrations were not
significantly different in treated and control cows.  Zinc concentrations were
higher (P &#60;0.05) in the 250 mg group (primiparous only) while phosphorus was
elevated (P &#60;0.05) for all sometribove-treated groups in multiparous cows.
However, the small increases in zinc and phosphorus concentrations for these
groups were not consistent across all dosages and both parities.  Also, the
concentrations did not exceed normal ranges for these variables and were not
considered to be of biological importance.<P>

All cows calved on-location prior to treatment initiation to allow
acclimation.  Animals were randomly assigned to one of two treatments,
sometribove (500 mg) or placebo (excipient), administered by intramuscular
injection every 14 days.  Treatments began at 60  &#177;   3 days postpartum and
continued until a minimum of 74 days prior to the expected calving date or
approximately 14 days prior to dry off for low production in pregnant cows.
Non-pregnant cows received treatments until 400 days postpartum or until
approximately 14 days prior to dry off for low production.  Site of treatment
was rotated among four areas (semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles) in
the rear legs.  The distribution of cows started on treatment at each study
location is provided in Table 30.<P>

Animal management followed generally accepted practices for dairy cows.
Milking occurred at approximately 12-hour intervals, and milk weights per cow
were recorded twice daily beginning at parturition.  Milk samples were
collected from two consecutive milkings at weekly intervals throughout
lactation and analyzed for fat, protein, and lactose percent and somatic cell
count.  These AM/PM samples were composited at Arizona and Utah and analyzed
separately at Cornell and Dardenne.  In addition, milk ash, calcium, and
phosphorus content were determined on samples collected at one and two weeks
prior to treatment initiation and at four-week intervals throughout the
remainder of lactation.<P>

Diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutritional requirements
recommended by NRC (1978).  Feedstuffs and total mixed diets were analyzed for
composition on a regular basis.  Diets were fed <i>ad libitum</i>&#160; to obtain a
5 &#37;  or greater refusal.  Feed ingredients and specific feeding practices varied
with location; however, feed consumption was measured daily throughout
lactation.  Water was available at all times. Animals were weighed weekly
(biweekly at Cornell) and body condition scores were assigned at calving, at
each physical examination, and throughout lactation at intervals specific to
each location. <P>

Reproductive management varied with location but estrus detection was
primarily by visual observation of animals at least twice per day by dairy
personnel.  A scoring system of one to six was used when recording observed
signs.  At two of the locations (Dardenne and Utah), KAMAR&#174; 
heat-mount detectors were also used as reproductive aids.  All breeding was by
artificial insemination during the prescribed breeding period.  Animals were
bred between days 40 or 50 until at least day 170 postpartum.  Breeding beyond
this point was at the herdsman's discretion.  Cows diagnosed as having a cystic
ovary were treated, and prostaglandins were used for estrus synchronization in
animals that were problem breeders.<P>

Clinical mastitis was detected by forestripping milk from each quarter onto
the floor prior to each milking, and observation of abnormal milk was recorded.
Standard operating procedures required the antibiotic infusion of infected
quarters, but this practice was inconsistent across locations.  Antibiotic
infusions were infrequently used for mastitis cases at the Utah location.  As
discussed in Section 5.a, the lack of an approach to control clinical mastitis
rendered the mastitis data from the location incompatible with that from the
other three locations.  Thus, the Utah mastitis data were excluded from
analysis.<P>
Physical examinations were performed by a veterinarian on all cows at days
40 and 180 &#177; 3 postpartum and during the last treatment cycle. In addition,
all animals were observed daily for signs of disease, injury, or other
disorders, and observations were recorded.  Blood samples (for hematology and
serum chemistry measurements) were collected at the day 40 physical
examination.  Serum chemistry analysis was also carried out on blood samples
collected from the cows at day 180 &#177; 3 postpartum and during the last
treatment cycle.  However, no blood samples for hematology were collected
during the treatment period of the study.  Anti-somatotropin binding activity
was determined from blood samples collected at 14 and 21 days after the initial
treatment, at days 40 and 180 &#177; 3 of lactation, and during the last treatment
cycle.  Physical examination, body weight, and general health data were also
collected on the calves from these cows through nine weeks of age.<P>
All animals that calved following the lactation of treatment were observed
for the first nine weeks into the subsequent lactation.  Milk weights, feed
consumption, and daily observation data were collected as previously described.
No sometribove treatments were administered during this time.<P>
Fourteen multiparous cows were removed from the study prior to completing
their treatment period, had chronic health problems through much of the
treatment period, or were dried off early (&#190; 2/3 standard 252-day
treatment period) due to low production:<P>

These cows were excluded from the evaluation of production, reproduction,
blood, and nutritional data, but they were included in the analysis of clinical
health and mastitis so that all health and mastitis incidents were included in
the analysis.<P>
Average daily milk production, average daily FCM production, and average
milk composition values were determined for each cow, using data from completed
treatment cycles up to 252 days of treatment. Also, an <b>average daily
standardized FCM (SFCM) yield</b> to 252 days of treatment was calculated for
each cow as described previously (see Section 6.c).  <P> Statistical analyses of
milk production and composition data were conducted using the Statistical
Analysis System (SAS).  Within location variances for FCM milk were found to be
homogeneous across the four locations so that weighted analyses were not
necessary in pooling the data.  The model was Y(ijk) = U + T(i) +S(j)
+ TS(ij) + [beta]PRE(ijk) + e(ijk); where U = overall mean; T(i) = treatment 
effect; S (j) = location effect; TS(ij) = treatment by
location interaction; PRE(ijk) = covariate; [beta] = regression coefficient
for PRE(ijk); and e(ijk) = residual. Whenever the treatment-by-location
interaction was significant at P &#60; 0.25, the treatment-by-location error term
was used to test the significance of the treatment effect.  Where location
differences were expected, the average two-week pretreatment level for each cow
was expressed as a deviation from the location mean for each variable and
included in the model to reduce experimental variation.  <br>

Production variables were increased 13-18 &#37; by sometribove during the
treatment period, indicating that study conditions were valid to evaluate
animal safety.  Milk composition was not significantly affected with the
exception of a small increase in milk phosphorus content for treated
primiparous cows.  A similar trend was noted for treated multiparous cows, but
the slight increases were within normal variation for Holstein cows and not
considered to be of biological importance.<P>

Effects of sometribove treatment on the musculoskeletal system were
evaluated in the TAS study and the clinical studies discussed in previous
sections, as well as a clinical field study.<P>
From the previous sections, the following studies provided data on the
effects of sometribove on the musculoskeletal system:<P>

Clinical signs, including lameness and injuries to the musculoskeletal
system, from 848 dairy cows in the above studies were analyzed. Results and
analyses of health data, including musculoskeletal effects, are discussed in
Section 6.k on Cow Health.<P>
As presented in Section 6.k (Cow Health), treated primiparous cows in the
TAS Study had significant increases in the number of cows affected, days
observed, cases observed, and duration of cases of lameness or abnormal gait
during the first year of the study.  In the second year of the TAS Study,
lameness was not increased in the treated primiparous cows.  Treated
multiparous cows did not have a clear pattern of increased lameness for either
the first or second lactation during treatment with sometribove.  <P>
In the pooled analysis, lameness tended to be increased in treated
multiparous cows compared to controls, but not in treated primiparous
cows.<P>
Results of the pooled analysis indicated that, in primiparous cows, there
was an increase in total cows affected and total days observed for hock
abnormalities.  An increase in cows affected with hock abnormalities,
particularly swollen hocks, was also evident from analysis of the physical
examination data from the pooled clinical trials.<P>
In multiparous cows, an increase in total cows affected and total days
observed for hock abnormalities, particularly swollen hocks, was observed in
the pooled analysis.  An increase in disorders of the foot region was also seen
in these trials.  An increase in cows affected with knee abnormalities,
specifically knee calluses or knee fibrosis, was observed in the physical
examination data from the pooled analysis for both parity groups (Section
6.k).<P>
As discussed in Section 6.k on cow health and the following paragraph, the
following clinical study was conducted in order to resolve questions on the
effects of sometribove on the musculoskeletal system of treated dairy
cows.<P>
<b>Study No. 100-USA-COW-RJC-92-007 - A Clinical Field Study</b><P>
In addition to the unresolved questions on the effects of sometribove on
lameness as discussed above, a clinical lameness study was precipitated by
results of a postmortem study conducted to evaluate injection sites in
sometribove-treated cows from commercial dairy farms (Study
100-DDC-COW-PJE-91-068).  Five cows from two commercial dairy herds that had
been chronically treated with sometribove (no controls) were sacrificed and
complete postmortems were performed.  Multiple articular (subchondral) erosions
and other joint pathologies were observed in multiple joints of all of the
animals at post mortem. However, of 25 subarticular eroded surfaces identified
from proximal and distal articular cartilage of long bones from the five cows,
only 5 (20 &#37;) occurred in the posterior (rear) limbs while 20 (80 &#37;) occurred in
the anterior (front) limbs.  If the effect were drug related, a more equal
distribution of lesions among joints would be expected.  Also, ante mortem
swellings (enlarged tibio-tarsal [hock] and radio-carpal [knee joint]) observed
in the five cows did not correspond to the intra-articular lesions, 7 of 10
posterior limb joints being enlarged (70 &#37;) versus 4 of 10 anterior joints being
enlarged (40 &#37;).  This was the opposite result from that which would be expected
if joint swellings were a reliable indicator of intra-articular joint lesions.
The results were suggestive that some other factor peculiar to the front limbs,
such as higher weight bearing, was responsible for the articular lesions rather
than any direct effect of sometribove.<P>
Nonetheless, since three of the five cows were clinically lame upon
presentation prior to sacrifice, and since the question of lameness as
reflected in TAS and pooled analysis results was not fully resolved, the
sponsor conducted a further study to evaluate prevalence of lameness in a
larger population of chronically treated cows on commercial farms. <P>

Clinical
lameness was evaluated in field trial dairy cows that had received sometribove
for at least two consecutive lactations.  These field trials were designed to
evaluate sometribove use under practical farming conditions.  Field trial were
conducted in Michigan (3), New York (4), and Pennsylvania (1).  <P>
Herds for this study were selected based on cow availability, milk yield,
management, and feeding practices.  All cows were housed in loose housing/free
stall arrangements and milked in herringbone-type milking parlors.  <P>
Cows selected for lameness evaluation were part of the ongoing field trials
evaluating the effect of sometribove on longevity of cows in a specific herd.
All cows (188, 94 sometribove-treated, 94 control) were multiparous.
Sometribove-treated cows had completed at least two lactations in which they
received at least 11 sometribove injections (500 mg/14 days) per lactation.
Control and sometribove-treated cows were matched by parity, age (up to 4
months difference), and stage of lactation.  Matched animals also had resided
on the farm for a similar time period.  <P>
All cows were examined in the standing position by two evaluators
(veterinary experts in the study of lameness in dairy cattle) for at least
three minutes prior to the evaluation of gait.  A similar surface (grooved
concrete alleyway) was used at each location for the cows to walk on.  The
evaluators were positioned in a similar location so as to afford an equal
opportunity to observe the animals in motion.  Cows were first encouraged to
walk away from the evaluators, beginning a distance of ten feet from the
evaluators and walking a distance of approximately 40 feet.  The cows were
allowed to proceed at a walk. Cows were then turned and walked toward the
evaluators.  Cows were walked a second time and additional times at the request
of either evaluator.  Evaluators were blinded to treatment and to each other's
recorded observations (Table 33).  Results were recorded independently by each
evaluator.<P>

Following the evaluation of gait, cows were restrained for a physical
examination of the limb.  Both evaluators jointly conducted each examination
and completed a physical examination form after agreeing on results.  The
following areas of the limbs were examined:  shoulder, pelvis, humerus, femur,
stifle, tibia, elbow, radius, hock, carpus, metacarpus, metatarsus, fetlock,
pastern, coronet, interdigital, and hoof.  Each area was evaluated for the
following lesions: swelling/enlargement (superficial), swelling/enlargement
(deep/bone), swelling/enlargement (synovial), laceration (superficial),
laceration (deep), laceration (articular), infection, growth, atrophy, hoof
overgrowth, hoof abnormal overgrowth, hoof crack, and other (defined in
comments).  The grades given to each area and lesion type were: 0 (none), 1
(mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe).<P>
Kappa coefficients, used to assess evaluator agreement within each gait
score as well as across all scores, were greater than 0.7 for all scores.
Analyses were conducted on gait abnormality scores from each evaluator
separately and on the maximum evaluator score assigned to each animal.  The
proportions of control and treated animals with gait abnormalities were
compared using McNemar's test which is appropriate for dichotomous matched pair
data.  Because an animal judged by the evaluators to have a gait abnormality
score of 1 was not considered lame, lameness proportions were evaluated by
collapsing the gait scores into two categories, namely non-lame (0 or 1) and
lame (2 or 3). Differences in lameness proportion were tested using McNemar's
test. McNemar's test was likewise used to compare the proportions of animals
with unequal weight bearing stance.  Limb lesions were statistically evaluated
within each limb section (shoulder, humerus, etc.) and lesion type.  Within
each animal, the maximum lesion grade assigned to similar limb sections was
analyzed.  Proportions of control and treated animals with lesions present were
compared using McNemar's test.<P>
There were no differences detected between treated and control cows based
on the evaluation of stance (Table 34).  Overall 29.0 &#37; of treated and 28.0 &#37; of
control cows had uneven stance (P=1.0).  The frequency of lameness was not
different between treated and control animals (Tables 35 and 36).  The
frequency of lameness (score 2 and 3) was 39.4 &#37; for controls and 46.8 &#37; for
treated cows across all farms (P=.323, Table 35).<P>

In summary, based on results of the TAS, pooled analysis, and field
lameness studies, increased enlargements of the hock and calluses of the knee
(carpal region) of both parity groups and increased disorders of the foot
region in multiparous cows occurred but were unrelated to the prevalence of
lameness as determined by the field lameness study. The product labeling states
that treated cows may have increased numbers of enlarged hocks and lesions
(lacerations, enlargements, calluses) of the knee (carpal region).  Treated
multiparous cows may have increased disorders of the foot region.  The results
of these studies did not indicate that use of sometribove increased
lameness.<P>
 <b><A NAME="bst6g">g.  Injection Site Reactions</A></b><P>
Injection site reactions resulting from sometribove treatment were
evaluated in several studies.<P>
<b>Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4 Dose-SC)</b><P>
The methods for the 4 Dose-SC study are described in Section 5.a. Injection
site reaction data from the University of Florida location were excluded from
analysis because the rotation schedule for injections was different from the
other three trials (see Section 5.a). <p>
Injection sites were scored using the following system: 0 = no visible
swelling; 1 = a visible swelling of &#60; 10 cm in longest surface dimension
and/or &#60; 1 cm in height; 2 = a visible swelling of 10 to 16 cm in longest
surface dimension and/or 1 to 2 cm in height; 3 = a visible swelling &gt; 16 cm
in longest surface dimension and/or &gt; 2 cm in height and/or other
complications (e.g., draining lesion, lameness, hematoma, etc.).  <P>

Over 90 &#37; of scores from placebo injections were 0.  The few
control animals with injection site reactions generally had
scores of 1 or 2, and they resolved (score of 0) by week 3
or 4.  At the Cornell and Arizona locations, the SC
injection of sometribove generally resulted in little or no
injection site reaction (score 0-1).  However, at Utah,
approximately half the scores during the first week after
sometribove injection were scored 2 or 3.  At all three
study locations, over 95 &#37; of scores were completely resolved
within 5 weeks of injection.

revealed that there was no relationship between injection
site score and milk yield.

Responses to SC administration of sometribove were more readily seen and
therefore tended to persist longer than IM injections.  In both primiparous and
multiparous cows, SC administration sites scored significantly higher than the
IM sites due to closer proximity to the skin.  Most of the swellings observed
in IM treated animals decreased in size by day 9 post-administration, and over
90 &#37; were resolved (site score = 0) by three weeks post-administration.  Scores
were higher for SC treated cows than for control and IM treated sites but were
resolved by week 4 post-administration.  <P>
Comparison of milk production of the SC injected cows that experienced
injection site scores of 2 and 3 with those scoring 0 and 1 revealed that there
was no relationship between injection site score and milk yield. <P>

Injection site responses from cows treated with sometribove were evaluated
at a single point in time from five commercial dairy farms that were part of a
larger clinical field study.  Two hundred thirty-two lactating dairy cows were
chronically treated with 500 mg of sometribove every 2 weeks with SC injections
in the postscapular and/or tailhead region.  Of the 232 cows, 13 (6 &#37;) were
selected because of persistent injection sites, and 6 of these cows had
multiple sites scoring at least 2.  The mean number of injections these cows
had received was 30.  All of the injection sites for these cows were scored for
size.  The scores were awarded as follows:  0 = no swelling; 0.5 = slightly
visible swelling (&#60; 5 cm in longest surface dimension and/or &#60; 0.5 cm in
height); 1 = minimal swelling (5 to 10 cm in longest surface dimension and/or
0.5 cm to 1 cm in height); 2 = moderate swelling (10 to 16 cm in longest
surface dimension and/or 1 to 2 cm in height); 3 = severe swelling (&gt;16 cm
in longest surface dimension and/or &gt;2 cm in height and/or other
complications associated with injection site reactions).  Injection sites that
scored 2 or 3 were collected for histological and microbiological examination
by excisional biopsy.  <P>
The majority of injection sites scoring 2 or 3 were fewer than 8 days old,
suggesting that many of these sites would resolve.  Only 4 cows had injection
site scores of 2 or 3 that were at least 30 days old. Of the 19 samples
examined for microbiological contaminants, 14 were negative.  Two sites
contained <i>Actinomyces pyogenes</i>.  The other three samples contained
common air contaminants.  Therefore, the microbiological evaluation of the
injection sites that scored 2 or 3 indicated that there is no direct microbial
involvement in the formation of or persistence of the injection site reactions
observed. <P>
Five cows that represented both typical (minimal) and large/persistent
injection site responses were necropsied.  As discussed below (see Study No.
100-DDC-COW-PJE-91-068), it was determined that injection site reactions did
not affect surrounding structures (e.g., muscle, uterus, nerves).<P>

Five mature Holstein cows from commercial herds were utilized.  The animals
had previously received sometribove, 500 mg/14 days, as part of an ongoing
field study.  In that field study, sometribove had been administered SC in the
postscapular and/or the ischiorectal fossa (tailhead).<P>
Clinically, two animals had chronic reactions (persisting for 6 to 12
months) while the other 3 animals had more typical reaction sites. Fibrous
masses were identified at the injection sites of all 5 animals. At gross
necropsy, articular erosions and other joint pathology were noted in multiple
joints of each cow.  (See discussion in Section 6.f on lameness.)  <P>
Microscopically, granulomatous inflammation was found at nearly all sites
characterized by multifocal areas containing macrophages, lymphocytes,
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and giant cells.  Granular material was again
seen within the macrophages.  The overall reaction was supported by fibrous
connective tissue while foci of residual sometribove were apparent.  These foci
were usually surrounded by multinuclear giant cells.  Lymphocytes were clumped
at the periphery of the inflammation.<P>
Injection site lesions were similar in size and appearance for the two
chronic reactor cows and the three typical cows (animals in which injection
lesions regress over 14 to 28 days).  The only notable difference was an
increase in the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the sites from
chronic reacting animals.  The injection sites did not affect surrounding
tissue or the general health of the animal.<P>

Forty-six Jersey cows received SC injections of either 500 mg of
sometribove or excipient biweekly beginning at about 60 days of lactation and
continuing until dry-off.  The study was conducted at the University of
Vermont.  Injection sites were scored on days 3 and 10 after each injection
using the same scoring system described for the 4 Dose-SC and IM/SC Bridging
studies.<P>
Jersey cows that received sometribove had more swellings at the site of
injection than did the controls.  On day 3 after injection, 12 &#37; of injection
site reactions in sometribove-treated cows (primiparous and multiparous
combined) had a score of 0, 37 &#37; had a score of 1, 46 &#37; had a score of 2, and 6 &#37;
had a score of 3.  On day 10 after injection, 7 &#37; of injection site reactions in
sometribove-treated cows had a score of 0, 37 &#37; had a score of 1, 48 &#37; had a
score of 2, and 8 &#37; had a score of 3.<P>
The injection site reactions were usually localized swellings, although
some persisted for several months.  In some cases, swellings broke open and
drained.  The study suggested that Jersey cows might be more sensitive to
sometribove treatment than Holsteins with respect to injection site reactions.
Additional studies, discussed below, were conducted to further evaluate
injection site reactions in Jersey cows.<P>

The effect of sometribove administration on milk production response was
evaluated in lactating Jersey cows on a commercial dairy farm in Arizona, as
described in Section 5.b.  Eighty-eight cows between 59 and 179 days postpartum
were randomly assigned by parity into treated (500 mg sometribove/14 days) or
control (untreated) groups.  Sometribove injections were given SC in the
postscapular or tailhead regions.  The experimental period was 14 weeks or 7
injection cycles.  Injection sites were evaluated on days 3, 10, 17, and 24
after each injection using the same scoring system described in Study No.
100-USA-COW-RJC-91-072.  <p>
    No adverse injection site reactions were noted.  The highest score
assigned was an injection site score of 1 given to cows receiving sometribove
postscapularly.  A total of 4.2 &#37; of the injections for the animals receiving
sometribove postscapularly demonstrated minimal injection site swelling that
persisted through 24 days.  Only one animal of those treated with sometribove
in the tailhead region was noted as having a slight injection site swelling at
day 3 postinjection.<P>

Thirty-eight Jersey cows were assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial design with
excipient or 500 mg sometribove treatment and normal or high dietary calcium
levels.  The study was conducted at Monsanto's Animal Research Center at
Dardenne, MO.  Cows were injected SC with sometribove or excipient for three,
2-week cycles beginning approximately 4 weeks prior to expected calving date (2
injections in the dry period, 1 injection in the peripartum period).  All
injections occurred in the tailhead region.  If a cow calved 10 or more days
earlier or later than expected, fewer or additional injections were
administered to allow similar treatment effects during the immediate peripartum
period. Injection sites were scored 3 and 10 days after injections so that the
number of scores per animal varied slightly, depending on actual calving date
relative to expected date.  The scoring system used was the same as that used
in Study No. 100-USA-COW-RJC-91-072, above.  The highest score assigned on day
3 out of 55 total sometribove injections was one score of 1.  On day 10, no
injection site swellings were observed.<P>
<b>Conclusions</b>. <p> In cows injected SC with 500 mg sometribove at 14-day
intervals, few injection sites scoring greater than 1 on the scoring scale of
0-3 should be expected.  Some cattle may consistently experience reactions
scoring 2 or 3, and an occasional site may break open and drain, as happened in
the Utah SC-Dose and Vermont Jersey trials.  Labeling of the product reflects
that a mild transient swelling of 3-5 cm in diameter may occur at the injection
site beginning about 3 days after injection and may persist up to 6 weeks
following injection.  Some cows may experience swellings up to 10 cm in
diameter that remain permanent but are not associated with animal health
problems.  The typical swellings of injection sites are of cosmetic concern
only; if permanent blemishes are objectionable to the user, administration of
the product to the particular animal should be discontinued.  Use of
sometribove in cows in which injection site swellings repeatedly open and drain
should be discontinued.<P>
There was no significant deleterious effect of repeated injections into the
ischiorectal fossa (tailhead) region of cows.<P>

Twenty-seven Holstein cows located in New York (7), Michigan (11), and Utah
(9) and 4 Jersey cows located in Arizona were examined postmortem to evaluate
injection sites and carcass condition.  All of the cows had received SC
injections of 500 mg sometribove in the postscapular, tailhead, or flank areas.
Each cow received between 5 and 27 injections at 14-day intervals.  The animals
were slaughtered at commercial meat processing plants and the comments of each
USDA inspector were documented.<p>
    Overall comments from the USDA inspectors regarding carcass condition
indicated no observable differences in general carcass condition from other
dairy animals processed through their respective facilities. However, there
were more injection sites noticed in these cows due to the short time elapsed
since the last sometribove injection in most cows (1-12 days).<P>
Of the twenty-seven cows, 17 had lesions that were identified, excised,
photographed, and examined histologically.  The range in injections identified
per cow was from 5 to 28.  The 17 cows had received a total of 238 sometribove
injections.  The time from last injection to post mortem was one to 12 days
except for three cows in which the last injections were administered 8-10
months before slaughter.  <P>
Examination of photographs comparing injection sites in carcasses injected
in either the postscapular or tailhead (ischiorectal fossa) regions led to the
conclusion that tailhead injections resulted in less carcass damage, especially
hemorrhage and swelling, that might require trimming of underlying muscle.
Also, tailhead injection sites were more likely to be removed during the normal
trimming process.  Most of the injection sites in either region remained on the
carcass after the hide was removed.  The most recent injections sites (1-2 days
old) were characterized by slight swelling and hemorrhage, and were easily
noticed after the hide was removed.  Histological examination revealed that
maximum edema, infiltration of fibrin, and neovascularization was evident at
5-7 days post-injection.  During days 7-10 post-injection, infiltration of
collagen proceeded while edema and fibrin subsided. From both gross and
microscopic observation of the progression of injection response, it appeared
that the sites generally reached maximum size and reactivity at days 5-7.
<P>
The number of cull dairy cattle coming into some slaughtering plants with
<b>recent</b> injection sites as a result of sometribove injections could cause
an increase in the number of carcasses held for testing for antibiotic
residues.  Also, because of the gross and microscopic timing of injection site
resolution and because the management decision as to whether to reinject or
cull a cow would occur at 14-day intervals, in order to minimize injection
lesions on carcasses at slaughter, product labeling includes a statement
recommending that no injections be given within 2 weeks of expected slaughter.

Failure to follow label directions and observer pre-slaughter withdrawal times
for animal drugs are the major causes of violative drug tissue resides in
food-animal production in the United States. <P> Even if the mistake in
withdrawal times involves only a few days or a few hours, the resulting residues
can violate Federal laws against the sale of adulterated food in interstate
commerce.<P> Any illegal residues found in a market product may result in
marketing delays for producers, lead to condemnation of a shipment, and result in
regulatory actions under the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Planning
proper drug use can help  avoid these costly business problems and help to
maintain consumer confidence in food-animal products. <P> How to Calculate
Withdrawal Times <P> Each withdrawal day is a full 24 hours starting with the
last time an animal receives the drug. Here is an example of the pre-slaughter
withdrawal time:

<IMG SRC="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/fda/infores/memos/clocks.gif" ALIGN=top ALT="Picture of clock faces">
<P> A drug with a five-day pre-slaughter time is withdrawn from the
birds at 9 a.m. on Friday.  At 9 a.m. on Saturday, the treated birds have
completed their first withdrawal day.  The fifth withdrawal day will end at 9
a.m. on Wednesday. <P> If the drug in use has a withdrawal time, it will be found
on the label, the package insert, or the feed tag.  Other drug use information
also will be found on the labeling of the specific drug product in use. <P>

<h3> CVM MEMO - 15 </h3>

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS AND
EDUCATION BRANCH, HFV-12, 301/594-1755<p>
Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
H.H.S. Pub. No. (FDA) 95-0619<br>
Revised June 1995<p>
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <br>
Public Health Service Food and Drug Administration<br>
7500 Standish Place, HFV-12, Rockville, Maryland 20855<p>
    The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) requires that 
all new animal drugs be approved by the FDA. The use of an approved animal drug
in accordance with the label directions (type of animal, medical conditions,
route of administration, withdrawal time, milk discard time, etc.) ensures that
food from the treated animals will not contain illegal drug residues.<p>
Live animals are considered unprocessed food and FDA will enforce the food
provision of the Act. Therefore, persons involved in raising, handling,
transporting, holding, and marketing food-producing animals are encouraged to
establish systems to ensure that animal drugs are used properly and to prevent
illegal drug residues.<p>
<ol>
<li> Identify and keep track of medicated animals.<p>
<li>  Keep a system of medication/treatment records that identifies the animal(s)
treated, the date(s) administered, who administered the drug(s), the amount
administered, and the withdrawal time prior to slaughter.<p>
<li>  Properly store, label, and account for all animal drug products and
medicated feeds.<p>
<li>  Obtain and use veterinary prescription drugs only under a valid
veterinarian-client-patient relationship.<p>
<li>  Educate all individuals who medicate animals on the procedures used to
accomplish points 1 through 4 above.<p>

</ol> Livestock dealers may also be subject to enforcement action 
if they market animals containing illegal residues and have failed to take
reasonable precautions to prevent the sale of adulterated food. Please refer to
Compliance Policy Guide "Proper Drug Use and Residue Avoidance by
Non-Veterinarians" for details.<p>
<b>How to Calculate Withdrawal Times</b><p>
Each withdrawal day is a full 24 hours starting with the last time an animal
receives the drug. Here is an example of the pre-slaughter withdrawal time:<p>
<img src="cvmm15.gif" alt="Clock faces showing withdrawal times "><br>   
    
A   drug with a five-day pre-slaughter time is withdrawn from 
the animals at 9 a.m. on Friday. At 9 am. on Saturday, the treated animals have
completed their first withdrawal day. The fifth withdrawal day will end at 9
am. on Wednesday.<p>
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GUIDE<p>
The listing of brand names in no way implies any product endorsement by the
Food and Drug Administration. This publication is not intended to serve as an
official reference for firms or individuals dealing with the agency.<p>
The drugs listed are those commonly available to the producer (over-the-counter
or feed drugs) and to the veterinarian (prescription drugs).<p>
Withdrawal times listed may not apply if other drugs or pesticides requiring
pre-slaughter withdrawal times have been used in the intended species.
Withdrawal times may change during the life of this publication on certain
entities. Follow drug labels, package inserts, or feed tags for up-to-date
information on exact usage of the products. There is no attempt to list drug
use information other than the withdrawal times.<p>

    TEN DRUG USE TIPS<p> <ol>
<li>Read the label carefully--labeling directions change 
frequently.<p>
<li>Use drugs only in animal species listed on the 
label--drugs used in other species may cause adverse reactions or illegal
residues, and possible animal deaths.<p>
<li>Use the proper dose for the species and size of animal to be
treated--overdosing can cause illegal residues.<p>
<li>Calculate pre-slaughter drug withdrawal times accurately--withdrawal and
discard times begin with the last drug administration.<p>
<li>Use the correct route of administration--giving drugs incorrectly can lead
to drug ineffectiveness, adverse reactions, illegal residues, and possible
animal deaths.<p>
<li>Do not "double dose"--use of the same drug in the feed and by injection can
cause illegal residues.<p>
<li>Select needle size and injection sites carefully, if injections are
necessary--misuse can lead to tissue damage, reduced effectiveness, and/or
illegal residues.<p>
<li>Allow proper withdrawal times for feed containing drugs--during the
withdrawal time, storage bins and feeders must be completely free of medicated
feed and only drug-free feed should be used or illegal residues may result.<p>
<li>Keep accurate records of drugs used and animals dosed--poor records can be
costly if drug residue violations occur.<p>
<li>Seek the advice of your veterinarian--your records will allow him/her to
provide safer and more effective treatment and save you money by preventing
illegal residues.

</ol> <p>
*** For a complete explanation of all the precautions you need to take in using
any particular drug or feed medication, first consult the drug label or feed
tag. If you have any questions about the proper use of any drug, see your
veterinarian or feed dealer.<p>

 <title>FDA's Approval of New Animal Drug
Products</title></head><body><b>INFORMATION ON GETTING FDA'S APPROVAL OF NEW
ANIMAL DRUG PRODUCTS</b><P>
 
Q.	<b>I want to market a new animal drug product.  Where can I find out about
FDA regulations?</b><P>
A.	All Federal agency regulations are published in the <b>Code of Federal
Regulations </b> (CFR).  Title 21 of 		the CFR consists of nine volumes
pertaining to the Food and Drug Administration and is up-dated each 		year as
of April 1.  The volume,  Part 500 to 599,  deals with the regulations
governing animal drugs, 		animal feed, and related products.  You may purchase
a copy from the Superintendent of Documents, 		U.S. Government Printing Office,
Mail Stop:  SSOP, Washington, DC, 20402-9328.  <P>
	Regulations pertaining to other requirements, such as registration, listing,
labeling and current good 		manufacturing practices are contained in the volume
Part 200 to 299.<P>
	In order to keep up-to-date on a daily basis, you may also wish to subscribe
to the <b>Federal Register</b> (FR), 		through which  the government  publishes
notices, changes, additions, proposed and final regulations, 		etc.  It is
published Monday through Friday (excepting official holidays).  The FR is
available in paper 		and microfiche format from:  New Orders, Superintendent of
Documents, P.O. Box 37194, Pittsburgh, 		PA  15250-7954.  Telephone (202)
783-3238.<P>
	<P>
<b>Center for Veterinary Medicine						         Revised August 1993</b><br>
<b>DHHS Pub. No. (FDA) 93-6037</b><P>
Q.	<b>How do I apply for FDA approval of my new animal drug product?</b><P>
A.	Before a new animal drug may receive FDA approval, it must be clinically
tested for effectiveness 		and safety.  If your product is intended for use in
a food-producing animal, it must also be tested for 		safety to human
consumers, and the edible animal products must be free of unsafe drug
residues.<P>
	In order to obtain the necessary clinical and residue data, you must first
list your product with the 		Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) as an
Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD), and then 		arrange for laboratory
testing of your product.<P>
	Write to the Center stating what your product is, what drug(s) it contains,
its proposed labeling, the 		animal species for which it is intended, the route
of administration, anything you may know of the 		drug's history, and any other
pertinent information.  CVM will first determine if it is a new animal 		drug;
and if so, will provide guidance for your INAD.  When you submit a Notice of
Claimed 			Exemption for an Investigational New Animal Drug to CVM, along with
the information specified 		in Section 511.1 of the CFR, an INAD number will be
assigned to your product and clinical testing 		may begin.<P>
<b>NOTE:</b><P>
Drug sponsors are encouraged to submit investigational protocols for CVM
comment before starting the studies.  CVM will work with you on establishing
what tests are required, the analyses, 	toxicological studies, etc.  Working
out details in advance can eliminate some potential problems,  such as having
to repeat studies because some parameter was neglected.  It can also save you
time and money.<P>
If you plan to visit the Center, please make an appointment, preferably two
weeks in advance, so that  the appropriate people can be available to make the
meeting most helpful to you.<P>
	Also, a new animal drug must be manufactured in an FDA-registered facility and
in accordance with 		Good Manufacturing Practices.  If your facility is not
registered, contact the nearest FDA District 		Office (DO) to get a
registration form.  When you are ready to begin manufacture, contact the DO
again and request an establishment inspection.  Experienced FDA investigators
will examine your 		facility and procedures to ensure that your product will be
manufactured in compliance with FDA 		regulations.<P>
<P>

Basically, a new animal drug is one which is not generally recognized by
experts as safe and effective for the conditions described in its labeling.
(Reference Section 201(w) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act).<P>
Q.	<b>Who does the clinical testing?</b><P>
A.	You may select anyone you wish to be your investigator(s) as long as they
are qualified by  scientific 		training and experience, and are capable of
testing your product in accordance with the  regulations in 		21 CFR 511.1.  If
your product is intended for use in a food-producing animal, you  as the drug's
sponsor 		are responsible for the development of analytical methods to detect
and measure drug residues in edible 		animal products.  This responsibility and
those of your  investigator(s) are spelled out in 21 CFR 511.1.  		FDA has
established regulations for the conduct of non-clinical investigations, such as
toxicology 		studies, and has proposed regulations for the conduct  and
monitoring of clinical trials.  These provide 		excellent guidance to assure
valid, meaningful studies.<P>
Q.	<b>How many investigators will I need?</b><P>
A.	You need enough investigators to conduct at least two well-controlled
efficacy and safety studies.  		The important thing is that sufficient testing
must be conducted to establish evidence to support the safety 		and efficacy
claims for your drug.  Adequate testing may take several years, particularly if
your product 		is for use in a food-producing species.<P>
Q.	<b>What happens if I decide to discontinue the testing?</b><P>
A.	If for any reason you abandon the investigation, report this to CVM, giving
the reason for discontinuing 		the trials, and the disposition of the drug.<P>
Q.	<b>What do I do when the testing has been completed?</b><P>
A.	When you feel that sufficient data has been generated to establish the
safety and efficacy of your<br>
	product, you are ready to apply for approval of your drug.  Form FDA 356V,
New Animal Drug <br>
	Application  (NADA) must be submitted to CVM in triplicate along with
<b>all</b> the data obtained during 		the clinical trials, including any
adverse effects associated with the drug's use.  In addition, you must 		submit
all the information called for in 21 CFR 514.1 (labeling, manufacturing
controls, environmental 		assessment, etc.)<P>
Q.	<b>How long does it take to get a new drug approval after the NADA is
filed?</b><P>
A.	Approval time can vary greatly, depending on such factors as the
completeness and accuracy of the safety 		and efficacy data submitted.
However, by law, CVM is required within 180 days of receipt of your
application to either approve your application or advise you why it cannot be
approved.<P>
Q.	<b>Is the procedure different if my drug is to be added to animal
feed?</b><P>
A.	No, the same requirements apply to medicated articles and medicated feeds.
However, an additional step 		may be necessary before a medicated feed can be
marketed.  For certain drugs, the feed mill or mixing 		firm wishing to add the
drug to a feed must submit and obtain approval of a Medicated Feed Application
	(Form FDA 1900).  The classification of drugs intended for use in medicated
feeds is described in 21 CFR 		558.3.<P>
Q. 	<b>What if I believe I have a `Breakthrough' Drug?</b><P>
A.	If you believe you have a drug which has not been previously approved for
animal use and offers a new 		and unique therapeutic advance, you may request
"Expedited Review" status.  If your drug qualifies, and 		you are so notified,
you may submit your safety and effectiveness data for review as it is
generated.  This 		procedure is described in the CVM Policy and Procedures
Manual (Guide 1240.3135).<P>
Q.	<b>Where can I get additional information on animal drug approval
procedures?</b><P>
A.	As mentioned earlier, you are welcome to write, visit or phone CVM for
further information or<br>
	clarification of regulations.  In addition, the Center has issued a list of
guidelines, <i>I<b>nformation and 		Resources</b></i><b>,</b> which is
available upon request from CVM's Communications &amp; Education Branch,
HFV-12, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD  20855.  The phone number is: (301)
594-1755.<P>

 <h3> INFECTIOUS MASTITIS PREPARATIONS (intramammary infusions) </h3>
                                      
  <b>Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
  DHHS Pub. No. (FDA) 94-6025<br>
   
  Revised December 1994 </b><p>
 <b> What is mastitis? </b><p>
  
  Mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland. The word is 
  derived from the Greek <i>mastos</i>, meaning "breast" and <i>itis</i>, 
  meaning "inflammation of." In the dairy cow, mastitis is 
  nearly always caused by microorganisms, usually bacteria, 
  that invade the udder, multiply and produce inflammatory 
  toxins.
  <p>
  Some of the more commonly recognized pathogens causing 
  mastitis are:
  <pre>
    Staphylococcus aureus                Klebsiella spp.
    Streptococcus agalactiae             Pseudomonas spp.
    Streptococcus dysgalactiae           Corynebacterium bovis
    Streptococcus uberis                 Nocardia
    Streptococcus bovis                  Candida albicans
    Escherichia coli                     Mycoplasma spp.
    </pre>
   <b>How can a dairy producer control mastitis in the dairy herd?
   </b><p>
  The treatment and control of mastitis in dairy cattle is a 
  complex process. The disease is caused by a variety of 
  microorganisms that by a variety of circumstances have gained 
  access to the inside of the mammary gland. A dairy producer 
  should be aware that for every case of observed (clinical) 
  mastitis, there are 15 to 40 more cows in the herd with 
  unobserved (subclinical) mastitis.
  <p>
  The main focus for approaching mastitis control in a dairy 
  herd is to institute management practices designed to prevent 
  intramammary infections. For the purpose of preventing 
  mastitis infections, mastitis-causing organisms are 
  characterized as being either Contagious or Environmental. 
  Contagious organisms are spread directly from cow to cow, 
  often at milking time, by contaminated milkers, preparation 
  equipment or milking equipment. The object of controlling 
  contagious infections is to improve milking hygiene. 
  Conversely, environmental organisms, present throughout the 
  cow's environment can gain access to the udder at any time. 
  The focus for controlling infections due to these organisms 
  is to reduce the cow's exposure. The goal of preventing these 
  infections is to keep the dairy cow's teats and udder clean 
  and dry, particularly around the time of milking.
<p>
  Damaged teats facilitate microbial access to the udder. Teats 
  may be damaged in a number of ways including poorly 
  functioning milking equipment and improper teat dipping 
  procedures (causing frostbite).
<p>
  Dairy producers should work closely with their veterinarians 
  to design an effective mastitis control program. As part of 
  that program, the veterinarian should provide the producer 
  with advice on appropriate mastitis treatment. Currently, 
  there are more than a dozen intramammary infusion products 
  approved by FDA to treat infectious bovine mastitis. These 
  products represent a wide variety of treatments, with several 
  different active ingredients in various dosages. Thus, the 
  veterinarian and the dairyman can select the products they 
  think are best for their treatment needs.
<p>
  For additional information regarding the control and 
  prevention of mastitis, we recommend contacting the National 
  Mastitis Council, 1840 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 
  22201.
<p>
  <b>How can bovine mastitis be successfully treated?  </b><p>
  Even in the best managed herds, it occasionally becomes 
  necessary to treat a dairy cow for mastitis. Successful 
  treatment depends on a specific and accurate diagnosis, 
  followed by treatment with an appropriate anti-mastitis 
  product.
 <p>
  Whenever a mastitis infusion product is sought for treatment 
  for an intramammary infection, the decision regarding which 
  product is most appropriate should be based on a number of 
  factors. One of the most important factors is the culture and 
  sensitivity results from a milk sample taken either from the 
  infected cow, or from recent milk culture samples. It is 
  important to note that the results of a bacterial culture and 
  sensitivity test will not ensure successful treatment. These 
  tests are among the tools that can aid the veterinarian in 
  selecting the most appropriate therapy. The veterinarian must 
  decide which drug will remain active in an infected udder and 
  has the appropriate chemical properties for reaching the site 
  of infection. Each mastitis-causing microorganism poses a 
  unique set of considerations for the veterinarian.
 <p>
  Lactating dairy cows should be treated with lactating cow 
  mastitis preparations. Dry cow medications are not designed 
  for use in lactating cows. Even though a dry cow intramammary 
  infusion product may contain the same or less concentration 
  of active ingredient, the other ingredients in the product 
  are designed for use in dry cows. The use of a dry cow 
  intramammary infusion product may result in a prolonged drug 
  depletion time. This may cause an extended milk withholding 
  time or a residue violation.

 <b>  How does FDA's role in approving animal drugs help 
  veterinarians and dairymen?  </b><p>
  By following the recommended dosages on the labels of 
  FDA-approved drugs, the dairyman is assured that: (1) 
  excessive amounts of the drugs are not being used to effect a 
  cure; (2) the least amount of milk is being discarded to 
  avoid illegal drug residues; and (3) an approved drug will be 
  effective in treating infectious mastitis. The veterinarian 
  can also assure his client that the product he is using has 
  been proven safe and effective for the specific labeled claim.
  Further, by using FDA-approved drugs according to label 
  directions, the veterinarian and the dairyman are both 
  protected against violations associated with the consequences 
  of extra-label drug use.
<p>
  FDA recognizes that the veterinarian may, on occasion, 
  consider extra-label drug use when the health of the animals 
  is immediately threatened, and suffering and death would 
  result, from failure to treat the affected animals. In such 
  instances, regulatory action would not be considered, 
  provided that appropriate criteria are met, and precautions 
  observed:
 <p> <ol>
  <li>A careful medical diagnosis is made by an attending 
  veterinarian within the confines of a valid 
  veterinarian/client/patient relationship;
 <p>
  <li>A determination is made that a) there is no marketed drug 
  specifically labeled to treat the condition diagnosed, or b) 
  drug therapy at the dosage recommended by the labeling has 
  been found to be clinically ineffective in the animals to be 
  treated;
 <p>
  <li>Procedures are instituted to assure that the identity of 
  the treated animals is carefully maintained; and
 <p>
  <li>A significantly extended time period is assigned for drug 
  withdrawal prior to marketing meat, milk, or eggs, and steps 
  are taken to assure that the assigned time frames are met, 
  and that <i>no illegal residues occur</i>.
 </ol>
  Therefore, extra-label use of drugs in treating 
  food-producing animals under this policy may be considered 
  only in special circumstances. The exempting criteria do not 
  include drug use in treating food-producing animals by the 
  layman. Lay persons cannot be expected to have sufficient 
  knowledge and understanding concerning animal diseases, 
  pharmacology, toxicology, drug interactions, and other 
  scientific parameters to use drugs in treating food-producing 
  animals in any way other than as labeled.
 <p>
  The Center for Veterinary Medicine assists manufacturers in 
  the development of anti-infectious bovine mastitis product 
  development, by providing guidelines. The guidelines are 
  intended to help firms design studies to develop safety and 
  efficacy data in support of new products, thereby 
  facilitating the collection of data which may lead to 
  approval of applications for marketing. New concepts 
  contained in the guidelines should allow more rapid 
  development of individual and multiple active ingredient 
  products for the treatment or control of subclinical and 
  clinical infectious mastitis.
 <p>
  Additionally, the Center has available voluntary guidelines 
  for uniform labeling of drugs intended for use in dairy 
  cattle. One of these guidelines specifically addresses 
  intramammary infusion products. These guidelines are designed 
  to promote standard labeling for over-the-counter and 
  prescription drug labeling which can be uniformly understood 
  and interpreted by the user.
  <p>
  <hr>
  <p>                
  Remember, to avoid violating State and Federal regulations, 
  you must read the label and follow directions for the 
  mastitis products you use. Follow preslaughter withdrawal 
  times and milk discard times as stated on the label. Even if 
  you treat only one quarter, discard milk from all quarters 
  for the stated time.
<p>

  cattle, write to the Communications and Education Branch,

             New drugs intended for marketing, whether for animal or 
            human use, should be safe and effective for their labeled 
            uses. FDA is responsible for assuring that the drugs meet 
            these criteria and fulfills this responsibility by making a 
            scientific assessment of--among other things--the toxicology, 
            pharmacology, and clinical data (i.e., bioresearch data) 
            collected and submitted by drug sponsors.<p>
            The law (Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public 
            Health Service Act) imposes on manufacturers the burden of 
            demonstrating that their products meet safety and 
            effectiveness requirements and are not misbranded. 
            Manufacturers satisfy this mandate by performing extensive animal
            and other types of testing. FDA often will prescribe the kind 
            and extent of testing necessary. The studies may be submitted 
            before the product is marketed or after marketing has begun 
            to justify continued distribution; a few cases, the studies 
            are not submitted but must be available to FDA on request.<p>
            FDA carries out independent testing of its own on certain 
            types of products and validates test systems, but it lacks 
            the resources to test each product requiring studies and 
            therefore must assess data presented by the manufacturers.<p>
           <b> Program</b>
            The Bioresearch Monitoring Program is a multi-Center project 
            made up of 4 parts, depending on the type of activity 
            involved: (1) Good Laboratory Practice, (2) Sponsor/Monitor, 
            (3) Clinical Investigator, and (4) Institutional Review 
            Boards. The Good Laboratory Practice Program deals with 
            <b>nonclinical</b> (toxicology) laboratory studies. The last three 
            activities are in the <b>clinical</b> area.<p>
            Most of the progress has been in the <b>nonclinical laboratory 
            area</b> (i.e., in the Good Laboratory Practice Program). 
            Nonclinical laboratory studies are those in vivo (in a living 
            body) or in vitro (outside the living body and in an artifical 
            environment) experiments in which a 
            test article is studied under laboratory conditions to 
            determine its <b>safety</b>. They do <b>not</b> include studies utilizing 
            human subjects, studies done to prove the efficacy or utility 
            of a product, basic research or pharmacology studies, or 
            studies done to develop new toxicology methods.<p> <ol>
            <li><b>Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Program</b> <p>
            a. The program is designed to ensure the quality and 
            integrity of the safety data submitted to FDA.<p>
            b. Good Laboratory Practice regulations were finalized on 
            December 22, 1978, and amended on September 4, 1987.<p>
            The regulations are found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
            Regulations: <b>Part 58--Good Laboratory Practice for 
            Nonclinical Laboratory Studies</b>.<p>
            c. FDA conducts a vigorous program of inspections of 
            toxicology laboratories that support or are intended to 
            support applications for research or marketing permits for 
            products regulated by FDA (including food and color 
            additives, animal food additives, human and animal drugs, 
            medical devices for human use, biological products, and 
            certain electronic products). These inspections cover 
            domestic, foreign, and our own Government laboratories, each 
            of which is identified and inspected approximately every 2 
            years (except foreign laboratories, which are inspected as 
            circumstances dictate). The agency has found that the 
            laboratories are attempting to comply with the GLPs and the 
            total overall performance appears to be improving.<p>
            d. <b>Key features of the GLP regulations:</b> <p>
            <b>* Quality assurance unit:</b> A testing facility must provide for 
            a unit composed of one or more individuals responsible for 
            monitoring each study to assure that the facilities, 
            equipment, personnel, methods, practices, records, and 
            controls conform to GLP standards. For any given study, the 
            quality assurance unit should be separate from and 
            independent of the personnel engaged in the direction and 
            conduct of the study.<p>
            <b>* Standard operating procedure (SOP):</b> There must be written 
            procedures for the nonclinical laboratory study methods to be 
            used--methods determined by management to be adequate to 
            insure the quality and integrity of the data. All deviations 
            in the study from the SOPs must be authorized by the study 
            director and be documented in the raw data.<p>
            <b>* Protocol:</b> Each study must state the objectives and all 
            methods for the conduct of the study in a clearly written and 
            approved protocol. Included should be a descriptive title and 
            statement of the purpose of the study, a description of the 
            experimental design, the route of administration and the 
            reason for its choice, and a statement of the proposed 
            statistical methods to be used. All changes in or revisions 
            of an approved protocol and the reasons for any changes must 
            be documented, signed by the study director, and maintained 
            with the protocol.<p>
            In the <b>clinical area</b> of the Bioresearch Monitoring Program 
            (includes Sponsor/Monitor, Clinical Investigator, and 
            Institutional Review Board Programs), live human or animal 
            subjects are involved. The experiments--performed in a 
            natural or nonlaboratory environment--are conducted to 
            determine the clinical or therapeutic <b>effectiveness</b> of a drug 
            in humans or animals. They are performed to support for 
            research or marketing permits for FDA-regulated products. The 
            individual programs are discussed below: <P>
             <li><b>Sponsor/Monitor Program</b> <p>
            a. Sponsors of FDA-regulated products must monitor--or have 
            monitored--the clinical investigations being conducted for 
            them. The program is intended to provide adequate protection 
            of the rights and, safety of subjects involved in clinical 
            investigations and assure the quality and integrity of the 
            resulting data.<p>
            b. Regulations dealing with the obligations of sponsors and 
            monitors of clinical investigations were proposed on 
            September 27, 1977, but have not been finalized. A Guideline 
            For The Monitoring of Clinical Investigations has been 
            issued, under 21 CFR 10.90, which represents a standard of 
            practice that is acceptable to FDA. <b>NOTE:</b> Each Center has 
            regulations for sponsor/monitor obligations including 21 CFR 
            312 (OBER, CDER, CFSAN), 21 CFR 812/813 (CDRH) and 21 CFR 
            511.1(b) (CVM).<p>
            c. <b>Key features of the Sponsor/Monitor Program:</b> <p>
            Describes the responsibilities that sponsors (those who 
            submit marketing applications and initiate the clinical 
            investigations) and monitors (those who oversee the progress 
            of a clinical investigation) have in the conduct of clinical 
            investigations in (1) humans involving a drug, medical 
            device, food additive, color additive, cosmetic, or 
            biological or electronic product and (2) animals in animal 
            drug and those food additives for use in animal that affect 
            animal nutrition or other animal functions.<p> <ul>
           <li>Requires a sponsor to designate one or more appropriately 
            trained and qualified individuals to monitor the progress of 
            the investigation.<p>
           <li>Requires establishment of written procedures for monitoring 
            a clinical investigation.<p>
           <li>Requires the monitor to make pre-investigation visits to 
            the site of the clinical investigation to assure that the 
            investigator understands the status of the test article and 
            the requirements for its accountability.<p>
           <li>Requires periodic visits to assure that the investigator's 
            obligations are being fulfilled and that the facilities used 
            in the clinical investigation continue to be acceptable.<p>

            <li><b>Clinical Investigator Program</b> <p>
            a. Persons who conduct clinical investigations regulated by 
            FDA, as well as clinical investigations that support 
            applications for research or marketing permits for 
            FDA-regulated products, have certain obligations and 
            commitments to observe which are designed to protect the 
            rights and safety of subjects involved in the investigations 
            and to help assure the quality and integrity of the data 
            submitted.<p> 
            b. <b>Key features of the Clinical Investigator Program:</b> <p> <ul>
           <li>Investigators should (1) understand the status of the 
            investigational drug, the nature of the research protocol, 
            and the investigational plan and controls; (2) recognize the 
            obligation to conduct the studies under FDA regulations; and 
            (3) have sufficient time, adequate facilities, and a 
            sufficient number of research subjects to conduct the 
            clinical investigation properly.<p>
           <li>The sponsor should conduct a pre-inspection of facilities 
            used for clinical investigations.<p>
           <li>Procedures should be established to ensure test article 
            accountability, proper handling of controlled substances, and 
            disposition of unused test articles.<p>
           <li>Investigators should obtain written consent of patients, or 
            in the case of animals, the animal owners. In veterinary 
            medicine, because of the risks to the animals themselves and, 
            in the case of food producing animals the risk to humans from 
            residues of the test article, it is important that the 
            animal's owner be aware of and consent to the use of a 
            research article.<p>
           <li>In the case of food-producing animals, establish 
            withdrawal, withholding, and discard periods. The sponsor of 
            the Investigational New Animal Drug Application (INADA) must 
            obtain authorization for disposal of investigational animals 
            when they are to be used for food. The sponsor must submit 
            evidence to show that food derived from these animals will 
            not be detrimental to the public health or that the food 
            product does not contain residues or metabolites of the 
            drugs. The investigator must notify the sponsor as to when 
            and where treated animals are to be shipped to a processing 
            plant.<p>
           <li>Promotion or commercial distribution of test articles is 
            prohibited.<p>
           <li>The investigator must conduct the trials or research under 
            a valid INADA held either by himself or by his sponsor.<p>

<h3> MONITORING FOR RESIDUES IN FOOD
ANIMALS </h3>

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS AND
EDUCATION BRANCH, HFV-121, 301/594-1755<br>
D.H.H.S. Pub. No. (FDA) 94-6001<br>
Revised March 1994<br>
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <br>
Public Health Service Food and
Drug Administration<br>
7500 Standish Place, HFV-12, Rockville, Maryland 20855<p>
	The use of drugs to control and treat animal disease and to promote faster,
more efficient growth of livestock is a common practice. An estimated 80
percent of U.S. livestock and poultry receive some animal drugs during their
lifetime. Improper use of animal drugs may cause residues in the edible tissues
of slaughtered animals that could be hazardous to consumers. To protect the
public, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), through its Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS),
cooperate in a program to monitor the use of these animal drugs, identify
improper use and take action to prevent future illegal use by a producer.<P>

FDA requires animal drug manufacturers to show that each new animal drug is
safe and effective for its intended use before it is approved for marketing. To
ensure food safety the Agency sets a tolerance and withdrawal time for the
product. For drugs approved for use in food-producing animals, additional
toxicology residue and metabolism studies are required. Manufacturers also must
submit a reliable assay method for detecting drug residues in edible tissues of
slaughtered animals and in milk. These analytical methods are reviewed by FDA
and FSIS before the drug is approved.<P>
FDA establishes tolerances to include a safety factor to assure that the drug
will have no harmful effects on consumers of the food product. The Agency first
determines the level at which the drug does not produce any measurable effect
in laboratory animals. From this, the Agency determines an acceptable daily
intake (ADI), the drug tolerance and withdrawal times are then determined so
that the concentration of drug residues in edible tissues are below the ADI.
Depending on the drug, "safety factors" of between 100-fold to 2,000 fold are
included in the calculations used to set the tolerances.<P>
USDA regularly monitors tissue samples from slaughtered animals for many
individual chemical compounds including:<p><ul>
<li><b>Antimicrobials:</b> Sulfonamides, penicillins, streptomycin, tetracyclines,
erythomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, and tylosin; <p>
<li><b> Other drugs:</b> Coccidiostats, growth
promotants, antiparasitics, and other special purpose drugs;<P>
<li><b> Pesticides and industrial chemicals:</b>
 Chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, organophoshates, plus others
on an "as needed" basis.</ul> <P>
	The main goal of USDA's National Residue Program is to protect consumers from
adulterated meat and poultry products. The program is divided into three major
activities: Monitoring, Surveillance, and Exploratory phases.<P>
<b> Monitoring</b> <P>
Monitoring is designed to provide profile information on the occurrence of
residue violations in specified animal populations on an annual national basis.
The focus of monitoring is on violations; therefore, only compounds with
established safe limits, tolerances, or action levels are considered. Compounds
are selected for monitoring based on risk profiles and the availability of
laboratory methodology that is suitable for regulatory purposes. Monitoring
information is obtained through a statistically-based selection of random
samples from healthy appearing animals under inspection.<P>
In addition to profile information, monitoring provides a basis for further
action. In particular, the results are used to identify producers and others in
the marketing chain who market animals with violative concentrations of
residues. Other auxiliary uses of the data are to indicate prevalence and
concentrations of residues, to evaluate residue trends, and to identify
problems within the industry for which educational or other corrective efforts
may be needed. Thus, monitoring not only gathers information, but also assists
in deterring practices that lead to violative residues.<P>
Tolerances and action levels represent the maximum residue concentrations safe
for daily consumption over a lifetime. To  help livestock producers and
marketers avoid exceeding FDA residue tolerances, FSIS notifies the individual
producer or other responsible party whenever a tissue sample is found to be
above the established tolerance. FSIS tests animals from subsequent flocks or
herds to assure that residues in food products from that particular source
remain below the legally permissible levels.<P>
When an illegal residue is detected, FSIS reports the violation to the
appropriate FDA district office. The district office may then, following
compliance program guidelines, conduct an investigation. FDA investigators (or
State officials in certain cases) visit the various premises and individuals
handling the animal prior to and at slaughter, such as the farm or feed lot,
the auction market, the livestock hauler or dealer, and the slaughterhouse. The
investigation is aimed at determining the cause of the residue and identifying
those responsible. Under the law, an animal is considered as food in the
production unit and is subject to FDA regulations.<P>
<b> Surveillance</b> <P>
Surveillance is designed to investigate and control the movement of potentially
adulterated products. The sampling is often purposely biased and is directed at
particular carcasses or products in response to information from monitoring or
other sources (e.g., industry members or a State agency), or from observations
during ante-mortem or post-mortem inspection indicating that adulterating
concentrations of residue may be present. In-plant testing procedures may be
performed by the inspector, or samples may be submitted to an FSIS laboratory
for analysis. Depending upon the weight of evidence that led to the testing,
products may be retained until test results indicate the appropriate regulatory
disposition. Laboratory testing of surveillance samples is completed as rapidly
as possible and takes precedence over monitoring samples.<P>
No matter in which phase of the program an illegal drug residue is found, FDA
can conduct a follow-up investigation and FSIS can detain future shipments from
the affected producer while tissue samples are analyzed. FDA follow-up
investigation may lead to enforcement action when appropriate or necessary.<P>
<b>Exploratory</b><P>
Exploratory projects are conducted for a variety of reasons, but these
activities, whatever their objective, have in common the fact that test results
are not ordinarily used to take regulatory action or to trigger follow-up
surveillance testing.<P>
Exploratory projects generally fall within the following two types:<P> <ul> 
<li>  Studies on the occurrence of residues for which no safe limits (i.e.,
tolerances or action levels) have been established or in a species not approved
for use of a particular drug.<P>
There are many chemicals (e.g., trace metals, industrial chemicals, and
mycotoxins) that may be inadvertently present in animal tissues yet have no
established safe concentrations. Their consistent presence in food (and the
resulting need for a tolerance or action level to protect public health) has
not been established. FSIS, with input from FDA, may conduct studies to develop
information on the frequency and concentrations at which such residues
occur.<P>
These studies may be nationwide or limited to specific geographic areas. Sample
collection may be random and statistically based, or biased to obtain "worst
case" information. The results are given either to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or the FDA, which have responsibility for establishing tolerances
for contaminants in food under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Exploratory programs planned on a limited scale may be expanded if preliminary
results cause greater concern and make acquiring comprehensive information more
urgent.<P>
<LI> Other projects as appropriate.<P>
These may be designed for various purposes, such as evaluating new methods and
approaches to monitoring, or supplementing the information used in considering
a compound for monitoring.<P>
</ul> 
<b> Federal/State Agency Cooperation</b> <P>
Three Federal agencies--FDA, FSIS and the EPA--have an agreement that outlines
each agency's responsibilities in the national residue reduction effort.<P>
Illegal residues in animals are investigated by FDA; however, the dynamics of
the Tissue Residue Program are such that no one agency can accomplish the goal
of residue reduction and subsequent enhancement of consumer confidence. To this
aim, the Center has participated in joint FDA and State cooperative
work-sharing programs and awarded contracts for States to perform residue
follow-up investigations on first time residue violators. If pesticide residues
are determined to be due to direct application or environmental contamination,
this information is furnished to the appropriate EPA regional office, which
works with FDA and FSIS to help correct the problem. In cases of drug or
pesticide residues in animals caused by contaminated feed,  FSIS and FDA join
forces to correct the problem. In either case, FSIS assumes primary
responsibility for the wholesomeness of the meat supply, EPA has the
responsibility to assure that pesticides are used according to label
directions, and FDA has final authority for enforcement of the laws governing
use of animal drugs and acceptability of medicated feeds.<P>
Thus, FSIS, in their enforcement of Federal regulations, frequently must
condemn food intended for human consumption. FDA, through the federal courts,
has enjoined producers and livestock from sending animals to slaughter
containing illegal drug residues. In past years, FSIS has condemned animals for
a variety of pesticide and drug residues and FDA must seek other legal
remedies. While FDA does not usually take punitive action for a first offense,
it may do so if intent or prior knowledge of a residue violation can be
documented. If found guilty, offenders may face criminal prosecution with fines
or imprisonment as provided for under the law.<P>
<B> Summary</b> <P> <ol>
<li> FDA and FSIS review the feasibility and effectiveness of a drug firm's
proposed residue detection method.<P>
<li> FSIS monitors food animals for tissue residues of drugs, pesticides, and
environmental contaminants.<P>
<li> Animals with illegal residues will be condemned by FSIS. Producers of these
animals may be subject to detention of future shipments until they can prove
their animals are in compliance with applicable tolerances. Repeated residue
incidents may lead to legal sanctions.<P>
<li> Illegal drug residues detected by FSIS are reported to FDA, the livestock
producer, or other responsible individual, and, where appropriate, State
authorities.<P>
<li> FDA, or the appropriate State agency, may initiate an on-site investigation
of a suspect producer. If the evidence shows a flagrant violation of the law,
criminal charges may be filed against the producer.<P>
<li> The convicted animal drug abuser may be fined and possibly imprisoned for
his crimes.  </ol> <P>

 <H3><b>POSILAC&#174;</b> (sterile sometribove zinc suspension) </H3>

<b> h.  Nutrient Intake, Body Weight, and Body Condition Score </b><P>
Adequate intake of nutrients by lactating dairy cows is necessary to
support milk production, to maintain normal health and reproductive functions
and, in primiparous cows, to support growth.  Dairy cows are also dependent
upon sufficient body energy reserves, as reflected by body condition, to
sustain production particularly in subsequent lactations.  Thus, the effect of
sometribove on nutritionally related variables, including dry matter and
nutrient intakes, nutrient balances, body weights, and body condition scores
was measured.  The need for additional nutrients to support higher milk
production was evaluated, and it was determined whether sometribove-treated
cows could consume sufficient nutrients during various phases of the lactation
cycle to meet these requirements while maintaining appropriate body weight and
body condition.  In addition, production performance during the beginning of
the subsequent lactation was evaluated to determine if there were carry-over
effects due to sometribove treatment in the previous lactation.  The following
studies were used to evaluate these effects:<P>
Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (TAS)<br>
Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study (4 Dose-SC)<br>
Multi-location IM Single Dose Study (Single Dose-IM)<br>
IM Dose Titration Study (Dose-IM)<br>
IM/SC Bridging Study (IM/SC)<P>
The experimental design of each of these studies is described in Sections
6.b, 5.a, 6.e, 6.d, 6.c, respectively.  Animals were fed total mixed diets.  In
all studies cows were fed diets that met or exceeded the nutrient requirements
as recommended by the National Research Council during the conduct of the
study.<P>
<b>Nutrient Intakes and Nutrient Balances</b><P>
In general, the results indicated that sometribove treatment increased
nutrient intake when cows responded with an increase in milk production.  Peak
feed intake followed peak milk yield by several weeks.  The increase in intake
associated with sometribove treatment occurred earlier for primiparous cows
than multiparous cows.  Energy balance is subject to extensive variability
which limits the ability to evaluate absolute values; nevertheless, the
relative differences in energy balance between treatment groups could be
evaluated.  Nutrient balances when averaged over the treatment period were
unaffected by sometribove, except for calcium and phosphorus balances. <P>
<b>Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study</b>.<p>  
Dry matter (DM) and
net energy for lactation (NE) intakes were greater at all dosage levels of
sometribove compared to the controls for both parities through 252 days of
treatment (Table 43).  Dry matter intake for primiparous cows was increased by
1.9 kg/day (9.5 &#37;) at the 500 mg dose compared to the controls over the 252-day
treatment period.  Dry matter intake was increased by 1.5 kg/day (6.6 &#37;) during
the 252-day period for the multiparous cows administered 500 mg sometribove
compared to control cows.  Also, the increases in DM and NE intake were greater
for cows treated with the 750 mg dose compared to the 500 mg dose across both
parities, although only significantly for the primiparous cows.<P>
When intake parameters were summarized in 56-day periods, the pattern of
increase in treated cows was different by parity.  Primiparous cows
significantly increased net energy intake at each of the four 56-day periods.
The multiparous cows treated with sometribove, however, did not increase their
net energy intake until the second 56-day period (Table 44).  Thereafter,
intake of sometribove-treated multiparous cows was higher than the controls for
the remaining 224 days of treatment. Thus, there was a longer delay in the
response in net energy intake for the multiparous cows compared to the
primiparous cows.  Dry matter intake response of cows treated with sometribove
was similar to net energy intake for both primiparous and multiparous cows.  In
comparing dry matter intake plots (Figures 7 and 9) with the milk production
plots (Figures 8 and 10, see pages 64 and 65), dry matter intake peaked after
the peak in milk yield for both parities. <P>
Dry matter and NE intake of treated primiparous and multiparous cows peaked
higher than the control cows, and the higher level of intake was maintained
throughout the treatment period (Figures 7 and 9).<P>
Energy and protein balances averaged over 252 days of treatment were not
affected by sometribove administration (Table 43).  However, energy balance of
treated cows differed from controls when data were summarized in 56-day periods
and also differed by parity (Table 44). The variability in energy balance
increased with each 56-day period, because the pattern of repletion of body
tissue and the persistency of lactation varied among animals.  Significant
effects due to sometribove treatment were as follows:  1) energy balance was
higher in primiparous cows treated at the 750 mg dose level for days 113 to 168
of treatment compared to controls due to higher intake in the treated cows; and
2) energy balance was reduced in treated multiparous cows during the first 56
days of treatment compared to controls due to an increased milk energy output
and a delay in energy intake.    <P>
Calcium and phosphorus balances averaged over 252 days of treatment were
similar among all treated groups for the multiparous cows (Table 43).  In the
primiparous cows, calcium balance was higher in the 500 (93 grams/day) and 750
mg/14 days groups (99 grams/day) than the control (87 grams/day).  Phosphorus
balance was significantly higher in the 750 mg/14 days group (41 grams/day) as
compared to the controls (32 grams/day; Table 43).<br>

<b>Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study</b>.<p>  In general,
sometribove-treated primiparous cows tended to have a greater intake (DM and
NE) than controls during the first year of the study.  By contrast, sometribove
had no effect on DM or NE intake in the second lactation of study.  (However,
numbers of primiparous cows during year two were very low.)  Intakes of DM and
NE were increased for sometribove-treated multiparous cows for years one and
two of the study.  The effect of sometribove on intakes of crude protein,
calcium, and phosphorus were similar to the effect of sometribove on DM intake
for both groups over the two lactations of treatment.<P>
Analysis of intake data using the cows that completed both lactations
showed no effect of sometribove on DM or NE intake for primiparous cows over
the 2-lactation period.  Numerically, intakes of DM and NE were higher for the
primiparous cows treated at the 1800 and 3000 mg levels compared to the control
and 600 mg dosage levels for year one.  The multiparous cows administered
sometribove had significantly greater intakes of DM and NE for both years of
treatment (Table 45).<P>
Energy balance was higher in year two compared to year one for the
primiparous cows but was not affected by treatment.  There was a dose by year
interaction for energy balance of multiparous cows.  The treated multiparous
cows had numerically lower energy balances than the control cows during the
first year of treatment and numerically higher energy balances during the
second year of treatment.  This appears to have been due to a lower energy
balance for the control multiparous cows during year two compared to year one
(Table 45).<P>

Following pretreatment, sometribove-treated primiparous cows decreased
their average daily dry matter intake approximately .5 to 1 kg during the first
4 weeks of treatment.  In contrast, the control primiparous cows increased DM
intake about 2 kg over pretreatment levels during this time period.  Control
primiparous cows peaked in dry matter intake at approximately week 5 to 9 of
treatment, which would be week 13 to 17 of lactation.  Treated primiparous cows
reached a peak in dry matter intake at approximately week 12 to 15 of treatment
(week 20 to 25 of lactation) and essentially maintained that level with a small
decrease through week 36 of treatment.  Intake of treated primiparous cows
exceeded controls beginning at approximately 17 to 19 weeks of
treatment.<P>
The sometribove-treated multiparous cows increased their DM intake by
approximately .5 kg from pretreatment levels over the first four weeks of
treatment while the control cows increased DM intake approximately 3 kg over
the same time period.  The control cows peaked in DM intake at 4 to 6 weeks of
the treatment period, whereas, the treated multiparous cows peaked in DM intake
at 10 to 13 weeks of treatment and did not achieve the peak levels of intake of
the control cows.  Intake of the sometribove-treated cows was maintained at
this level with only small decreases throughout the treatment period (36 weeks)
while the control cows deviated from the treated cows and decreased at a
greater rate starting at approximately 21 weeks of treatment.<P>
Mean energy, protein, calcium, and phosphorus balances of the
sometribove-treated cows were similar to the controls for primiparous and
multiparous cows (Table 47).

<b>IM/SC Bridging Study</b>.<p>  When averaged over the treatment period,
sometribove-treated primiparous and multiparous cows increased dry matter
intake 2.8 and 2.7 kg/day and net energy intake 5.0 and 5.1 Mcal/day,
respectively, over the controls (Table 49).  Within two to four weeks of the
initial sometribove treatment, the treated primiparous cows had increased their
DM and NE intake compared to controls.  The multiparous cows treated with
sometribove deviated from the control cows beginning at approximately seven
weeks of treatment. These results suggest that the intake response to
sometribove treatment is delayed for the multiparous cows.<P>

<b>Body Weight and Body Condition Score</b><P>
Overall, body weight was not affected by sometribove treatment for
multiparous cows over the course of the treatment period.  In contrast, there
was evidence to suggest that sometribove administration increased body weight
of primiparous cows.  Body condition scores were more reflective of the tissue
reserve (energy status) throughout the course of the lactation than body
weight.  The change in body condition score over the treatment period was the
variable chosen to evaluate the effect of sometribove on tissue energy
repletion since it corrects for within animal variation.  Use of sometribove
may reduce the amount of body condition that is regained during lactation.
This change in body condition from the pretreatment period through the end of
treatment was significantly less in the sometribove-treated primiparous and
multiparous cows compared to their controls. <P>
<b>Multi-location SC Dose Response Clinical Study</b>.<p>  Mean body weight
over the treatment period was higher in sometribove-treated primiparous cows
compared to controls (Tables 43 and 50).  The increase in body weight in the
sometribove-treated groups was evident within the first 56 days and remained
throughout the treatment period (Table 50).  In contrast, body weight and
change in body weight were unaffected in multiparous cows treated with
sometribove (Tables 43, 50, and 51).<P>

Body condition when averaged over the entire treatment period was similar
among control and treated primiparous cows (Table 43).  Only when averaged over
treatment days 169-224 was the body condition score of the 500 and 750 mg dose
sometribove groups below that of the controls.  For the multiparous cows, only
during treatment days 57-112 were the 500 and 750 mg groups significantly below
the controls (Table 50).  In contrast, when the change in body condition score
(18-cycle score minus pretreatment score <b>or</b> end of treatment score minus
pretreatment score) was analyzed, the 500 and 750 mg/14 days sometribove groups
did not increase body condition to the same extent as the 250 mg and control
groups for both primiparous and multiparous cows (Table 52).  The treated cows
remained on the high energy rations for a longer period of time than controls.

<b>Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study</b>. <p> There was no
significant effect of sometribove on the change in body weight during the
treatment period in either lactation for primiparous cows. However, during year
two with limited animal numbers, change in body weight was numerically but not
significantly greater for treated primiparous cows compared to controls.
Treated multiparous cows did not differ from controls in change in body weight
during the treatment period in either lactation (Table 53).<P>
Differences between the body weight at the end of the second lactation of
treatment and body weight prior to the first lactation of treatment were
examined to evaluate long term effects.  Only cows that completed the two
lactations of treatment were included in the analysis.  The results are shown
in Table 54.  The primiparous cows treated with sometribove had a significantly
greater gain in body weight compared to their controls.  No differences across
treatment groups were observed in body weight change for the multiparous cows.
This suggests that sometribove administered during the first two lactations for
a primiparous cow may result in a greater body weight.<P>

<b>Performance In Subsequent Lactation</b><p> 

The Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study (two dry periods and
early lactation following first lactation of treatment), Multi-location IM
Single Dose Study (8 weeks of the subsequent lactation), and the IM Dose
Titration Study (3 weeks of the subsequent lactation) were evaluated to assess
the effects of sometribove on performance in the subsequent lactation when no
sometribove was administered.  <P>
Increased dry matter intake without a corresponding increase in milk
production was observed primarily in multiparous cows administered sometribove
in the previous lactation.  The effect was variable among study locations.
Based on the results of these studies, cows may have increased dry matter
intakes in the dry period and early in the subsequent lactation without a
corresponding increase in milk production early in the subsequent lactation, as
compared to the first few weeks of the previous lactation.<P>
<b>Multi-lactation Chronic Animal Toxicity Study</b>.<p>  Milk yields during
the early portion of the second lactation tended to be increased over the
previous lactation for the control, 600 mg, and 1800 mg groups, in contrast to
a numerical decrease for the 3000 mg group in both primiparous and older cows.
After one lactation of sometribove treatment, multiparous cows consumed more
feed during the early part of the second lactation than controls.  No
difference in dry matter intake or net energy intake was observed in the
treated primiparous cows (Table 58).<P>
<b>Multi-location IM Single Dose Study</b>.<p>  Data collected for the 8 weeks
of the lactation following sometribove treatment were analyzed for primiparous
and multiparous cows (Table 59).  Dry matter intake, body measurements, and
milk production did not differ for treated and control primiparous cows over
the first eight weeks of the lactation. The multiparous cows treated with
sometribove had significantly greater DM and NE intakes and were significantly
lower in body condition score than control cows during the early part of the
subsequent lactation. <P>

<b>IM Dose Titration Study</b>.<p>  Treatment with sometribove during the
previous lactation had no significant effect on body weight, body condition
score, or DM or NE intake during the first three weeks of the subsequent
lactation in primiparous cows, although FCM production was reduced for the 750
mg primiparous cows (Table 60).  In contrast, treated multiparous cows did not
differ in milk production and FCM in the subsequent lactation compared to
controls.  Although body weights did not differ in the first three weeks of the
next lactation, body condition score was reduced for the multiparous cows
treated with sometribove.  This reduction was greatest for cows that had been
administered the 750 mg dose.  These results are based on only three weeks of
data in early lactation when variability is high.<P>

<b>Conclusions</b><P>
Feed intake increases over several weeks after initiating the use of
sometribove in lactating dairy cows.  This increase occurs earlier for
primiparous cows than for multiparous cows.  Use of sometribove may reduce the
amount of body condition that is normally regained during lactation.  This
effect is more pronounced for multiparous cows.  Also, voluntary feed intake
may be increased and body condition decreased during both the dry period and
subsequent early lactation.  These effects are contained in product labeling.
Also, the labeling recommends that cows be fed diets formulated to meet or
exceed the nutritional requirements recommended by the National Research
Council. The labeling also states that milk yield, stage of lactation, and body
condition should be considered when making dietary changes.  The feeding
program should be managed to optimize energy intake and to have cows in
appropriate body condition particularly during late lactation and the dry
period.<p>
