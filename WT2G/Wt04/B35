Personal attention! Feel free to call us to discuss things, suggest changes,

improvement every month at no additional charge. If your site isn't measurably
helping you draw good business, we'll discover it immediately and keep at
it until it works.

Why not wait a while?</H2>
<DL>
  <DD>Because for as little as <B>$113</B> (or even <A HREF="#anchor1586692">$<B>98</B></A>)
you can have a Directory Listing here that puts your contact information
and a description of your products and services on the web for 6 months.
Really. The worst that could possibly happen is that you get no new business
despite our 40,000+ visitors. If your time is worth anything, scratch your
head over some difficult decision -- because this one is a no-brainer.

Aren't 'REAL' websites expensive? </H2>

description of your services on the web, you can go further . . .

callers to your site, we include a free entry in our high-traffic on-line
directories. And our policy is that we insist that the site work for you.
Every website comes with a half hour of free support every month, directed
toward continuously improving it.

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">You could spend thousands of dollars, here or elsewhere;
but keep in mind the law of diminishing returns: get on this high traffic
site affordably now before planning a larger presence. 
</DL>
<H2>What if I have web pages elsewhere? </H2>
<DL>
  <DD>Consider moving them here because your potential customers will get
faster response if your pages are on this server, and you'll have your own
direct, prestigious, address: www.finishing.com/yourname. Plus, every site
here includes a literature request form and a half hour of continuous improvement
every month; sites here work! But, yes, if you already have pages elsewhere,
your Directory Listing here can link to them. 
</DL>
<H2>What if I have a special need? </H2>
<DL>
  <DD>We serve only the finishing industry, you can't advertise your car
wash or hair salon here. But we can set up nearly anything you can imagine:
domain names, forms, Javascripts, applets, pdfs--whatever. Call us.

Pullizzi, CEF,</A> founded finishing.com with the vision of helping the
finishing industry benefit from the remarkable power of telecommunications
and the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
Here we are building a clearinghouse for everything related to metal finishing
and the allied surface finishing arts. Both science and commerce are served
here. <BR>
<BR>
For more than 7 years we offered similar services via the Finishing Technology
Hotline BBS, which received thousands of calls from hundreds of people in
the finishing field, and was considered by many to be a premier resource
to this industry. The technology of the World Wide Web is making the service
more accessible to more people, and allowing us to begin to assemble and
organize the whole world of finishing in one accessible place. <BR>
<BR>

We're working hard to make these pages the place you come to for all your
finishing needs. Please or e-mail your suggestions to: <BR>

Technical Content vs. Product Advocacy</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<B>Readers:</B><BR>
<BR>
We want our <A HREF="index.html">Library</A> pages and our <A HREF="../Letters/index.html">Letters</A>
pages to arm you with useful technical information, not ad copy. But there
will always be grey areas: articles we're not quite sure of and have put
on probation. So, if you feel that a particular letter or article is product
advocacy rather than interesting technical content, please let us know and
we'll cleanse it or dump it.<BR>
<BR>
We'll keep promo stuff out of your hair when you're looking for technical
content on our library pages and letters pages, but please remember that
this site is here for you only because our advertisers pay for it.  So,
can we please count on you to consider our advertisers when you're hunting
for a <A HREF="../Shops/index.html">jobshop</A>, a <A HREF="../Products/index.html">product
or service</A>, a <A HREF="../Consultants/index.html">consultant</A>, or
a piece of <A HREF="../Directory/software.html">software or training service</A>?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Writers:</B><BR>
<BR>
If you have a technical article, please submit it for possible publication
at this web site.  If it makes the cut, we'll be happy to print it -- and
there is, of course, no charge.  General guidelines are similar to those
of most magazines: 
<OL>
  <LI>It must be a technical article, not a promotional piece.
  <LI>You must hold copyright; if it has been printed in a magazine, make
sure that it is still yours before submitting it!
  <LI>Exclusivity is expected. While it is not mandatory that the article
has never been seen anywhere else, we expect to be the only web site to
have it.  If we're not, tell us and we'll think about whether it is more
likely to help our readers or bore them with repetition.
</OL>
<DL>
  <DT>Guidelines for responses on our letters pages are similar, except
that we also print <B>highly apropos</B> commercial responses to an inquiry.
For example:<BR>
<BR>
  <DD><I> Q. I'm looking for a jobshop in Mudville, FL that offers nickel
barrel plating.</I>
  <DD><BR>
  <DD>We'll be happy to print:  <I>My name is John Smith from Mudville Nickel
Plating Co. . .</I>
  <DD><I><BR>
</I>
  <DD>We will not print:  <I>Schmaltz Inc., the world's premier supplier
of 'Zinc Sputter Flaming' would like to help everybody by introducing our
exclusive . . .</I>
</DL>
The latter is fine on <A HREF="../Home/getapage.html">your own web site
here</A>, and we'd be happy to build and serve the site for you, but it
is neither technical content, nor responsive, and it can't be printed in
our free areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Policy regarding contact info:<BR>
</B><BR>
In the course of a highly apropos commercial response to an inquiry, you
can mention brand names or company names. <BR>
<BR>
Please do not include contact info for the commercial entity except for
city and state; that's what Directory Listings here are for--and what pays
for this site and makes it possible. Besides, such responses often lead
to cluttering our letters page with endless threads like: &quot;I tried
that fax number you gave me and it rang 4 times, then I heard this double
buzz, or maybe more of a buzz-click-buzz and then somebody picked up and
said 'farblelon?' or maybe 'off or on'?, or maybe they were speaking German--do
you think they were speaking German? I think I heard some dipthongs or tildes
or whatever you call those vowels with the two little dots over them. No,
it's umlauts, isn't it? But I might have transposed the 6 and the 9, or
maybe you did? Anyway, could you call them for me and ask them to send any
information they have on plating to my sister-in-law's summer house? But
if they can't get it out within 5 days, then please have them direct it
to my Uncle Josh's house in . . .'<BR>

Dear Netters,<BR>
<BR>
I would really appreciate receiving information about companies or vendors
of galvanizing furnaces (vertical top loading chamber). This type of equipment
will be used in our laboratory to melt about 5 kilograms of Zn. So we don't
want industrial furnaces. <BR>
<BR>
Thank you in advance for your help.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>
<BR>

Electroless Nickel or Electroless Zinc<BR>
<BR>
     I am looking for an electroless nickel or electroless<BR>
zinc (if electroless zinc sols. exist). to Provide some crude protection
on cut ends of carbon steel tubes. I am not looking for furniture quality
plating . . . just an assist<BR>
for ends that get painted anyway.<BR>
<BR>
     Ideally, I would like not to rinse at all but instead just dry and
paint. I realize this will not do anything for my adhesion but I care more
about visible rust in a short period than I care about whether the paint
flakes.<BR>
<BR>
     My intent is to brush the ends and let a small amount of nickel plate
out and then paint over the dried end. The ends of our product are never
seen after the product is in place but as it is sold, product that has been
stored in rainy weather for more than a week rusts rather badly. I am looking
for about ninty days of protection in the northwest.<BR>
<BR>
Can you make any suggestions? <BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><BR>
<I>I'm not sure that you  really want what you think you want, Mr. Carroll.
 To apply an electroless plating solution, you would need to first clean
the tubing rigorously, and then acid dip it, before plating.  Then , as
a minimum, you would have to rinse it. <BR>
<BR>
I could be missing something, but I think  you might want to consider phosphate
and oil for these tubing ends.  Dried-in-place phosphates do exist.<BR>

Organization: Marcis Wire Works Co., Inc.<BR>
<BR>
Marcis Wire Works Co. is a manufacturer of steel wire frames and forms for
lampshades. We have been in search of someone who can nickel-brass plate
C1008 steel wire in continuous coil. The diameter of the wire would be .115
and .135. We have searched for over 15 years without any luck. This wire
was available in 1973 but the finisher who had the equipment retired and
closed his business. Many people have pointed us in the direction of the
steel belted radial tire business because they use brass plated continous
coil wire. Unfortunately this wire has no nickel base and is not suitable
for the decorative product we manufacter. Currently we use strips 41&quot;
in length and recut to the size we need. This adds huge labor and scrap
costs because it cannot be routed on automatic machinery.<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><BR>
<I><TT>Well, let's see if any plater can do this for you. If not, it may
be worthwhile for you to have a small specialty machine built for you, housed
either in your shop or in a local plating shop.<BR>
<BR>
Have you evaluated whether an electrophretic tinted lacquer on top of the
nickel will suffice in lieu of brass? Some lamp manufacturers are doing
this, and it eliminates the presence of cyanide.<BR>

Anodes for Ni sulfamate electroforming<BR>
<BR>
I'm electroforming nickel from a sulfamate bath, and I <BR>
understand that a sulfur-bearing anode is needed if no <BR>
chloride is used in the bath. How much sulfur is enough<BR>
for this purpose? Also, can anyone suggest a supplier<BR>
that sells this type of anode? I'm looking for a small<BR>
amount; the bath only 2 liters.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
<BR>
Jim<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><I><TT>This anode material is a standard product, Jim. Inco calls
them &quot;S-rounds&quot;; I'm not sure what Falconbridge or others call
them, but just ask for sulfurized nickel anodes. One good source is <A HREF="../tally/index.html">Tally

nickel anodes for Hull cell or for Jiggle cell. Sara<BR>

Jiggle cell is a one litre cell used with bended cathode. Gives you a better
way to evaluate problems in plating solutions, like roughness,covering power

Hello everyone.<BR>
<BR>
Could somone please recommend a piece of equipment for plating a type 3
alloy with a matt brass finish?<BR>
<BR>
The equipment is intended for a small workshop and not heavy industrial
use.<BR>
<BR>
I am based in England and have found it hard to find suppliers of such equipment.<BR>

Hi guys, I'm looking for information about types of brighteners use on the
Ni and Ni-P electrolytic plating system, I heard from some friends there
are some types that contain sulphur (but this can cause me adhesion problems),
I'm looking more on brighteners without sulphur. If you can give me or send
to me by e-mail or this media information on the most recommended ones including
their characteristics or contact me with someone who supplies them I really
appreciated, thanks in advance for your help.<BR>

Sulfor containing brightners for nickel are the most common ones and they
do not cause adhesion problems. Sulfor free systems are used mainly for
corrosion reasons. You can find brightners at any supply house for the metal
finishing industry.Sara</TT></I><BR>

Cobalt salts were very popular Ni brighteners in the old days, especially
for barrel applications. I don't believe anyone sells them as brighteners
anymore, but you can buy cobalt sulfate or chloride and use low concentrations
(~.01 g/l, if memory serves) to get a brightening effect (not as strong
as with organic ones). You need to experiment.<BR>
Sara is right, though, organic brighteners if used properly should not cause
adhesion problems.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, Berl<BR>

Agitation equipment wanted for passivating washers<BR>
<BR>
We are having problems outsourcing passivation of 301 stainless steel and
are looking for equipment to provide to our metal treater to aggitate flat
1.378&quot;OD x .015&quot;thick 301ss washers.They tend to get sandwiched
together when passivating 3000 at a time and many parts are not passivated
satifactorily. Is there any equipment available to agitate parts to help
uniform passivation of these parts? Please call us at (216) 942-3120 or
fax at (216) 951-4977<BR>

We have been passivating stainless steel for many years and would advise
not waiting too long for an answer to your inquiry!<BR>
<BR>
The diameter of the washer @.015 thick create too much vacuum to be separated
with a rinsing method.  The force of the agitation system needed would bend
the washers and probably make them dysfunctional.<BR>
<BR>
Look for a racking system that would keep the parts separated like the phonograph
records did on the on the juke box!!!  If passivation all over is needed<BR>

Have any of the new &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; paint strippers
been used to strip off baked on dry film lubricants used as part of a wear
coating system on Ti? The dry film material is being mechanically stripped
now - realize that chromic acid will strip it but cannot do that.<BR>

E-mail address: cooki001@tc.umn.edu<BR>

<BR>
I am looking for a chemical resistant coating I can apply to 6061-T6 aluminum
which will make it &quot;bullet-proof&quot; against chemicals within 4-12
pH range.<BR>
<BR>
I currently anodize which is only for color purposes and offers little to
no protection. I need to offer better protection - inexpensively - as my
products are being utilized for ever more challenging projects.<BR>
<BR>
The process should have high volume capacity. I would run <BR>
1000+ parts at a time. EAU 50,000+ pcs.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you.<BR>

<BR>
Anodized aluminum is very susceptible to chemical attack from high<BR>
or low pH solutions. However, it can act as an excellent substrate<BR>
for chemically resistant topcoats. These might include; resin-bonded dry
film lubricants, fused fluoropolymers &quot;Teflon&quot;, or epoxy paints.
Typically, these involve a spraying and baking cycle which can be automated.</TT></I><BR>

RO-59 has a bonded teflon coating that is applied to sealed aluminum to
create a corrosion reisistant coating.<BR>
It passes Salt Fog and Spray tests.  Request testing by RO-59 with pH required
and material samples.  The coating is environmentally safe and easy to use.<BR>

I need your help to verify the proper coating adhesive which we urgently
need for down hole drilling applications.  We need to coat metal sleeves
(band type which is flexible) which are used to hold and fixture equipment
on drill pipe. We need coatings with a very high friction factor (at least
0.4 - 0.5 to steel) which can hold up 250F, oil based and water based mud
(environment), and are flexible (high elongation). <BR>
<BR>
We are open to tests if needed to verify the liability.  Please reply to
your convenience.<BR>

I have never done any Chroming before,but I am Interested in starting a
small bussiness chroming wheel,can anybody help me with details of where
I can get the Equipment or advice to which equipment is better.I prefer
a machine that can chrome alloy or aluminun wheel to mirror shine. Please

<BR>
Certainly you can go into the business of chroming wheels if you wish. But
chrome plating is a process that involves stripping the old finish, polishing,
buffing, detergent cleaning, etching, acid desmutting, zincating, nitric
acid stripping, re-zincating, copper plating, buffing again, recleaning,
semi-bright nickel plating, bright nickel plating, chrome plating, and de-ionized
water rinsing. Water pollution control and air pollution control are a big

Why wouldn't it be possible to build equipment to repolish aluminum wheels
that makes use of electropolishing or anodizing as an alternative to chrome
plating? Lots of the wheels on today's cars and light trucks are aluminum,
not chrome. Most of them look crummy after five years or so.<BR>

<BR>
It IS possible, David. It's probably more a question of esthetics than of
any other issue. Bright dipped and anodized wheels are nice, and some people
may like them better. But some people like the look of chrome. That glint
from polished chrome plating can't be matched by anodizing.</TT></I><BR>

<BR>
Hi, Everyone<BR>
<BR>
I am interested in learning to replate used and worn-out meat market equipment.
Such as meat grinder heads, meat saw wheels, ect. The materials and process
will need to be &quot;USDA APPROVED.&quot; I believe the materials used
for this type of work are either nickel or tin. I will be needing a supplier
of equipment, materials, and training.<BR>
<BR>
If anyone can help and would like to contact me you can reach me at (210)
223-6171 or (800) 227-7297 weekdays. Otherwise, I will look for replies
here.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Donny<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><I><TT>Plating, much more so than most businesses, is 'jobshop'
oriented. So I'd suggest that you start by becoming an expert in writing
specs for refinishing equipment in this market,finding <A HREF="../Shops/index.html">plating
shops</A> who will do the actual plating for you, and supervising the Q.A.
<BR>
<BR>
Very few manufacturers, even huge ones, do their own plating in-house anymore.
Actually doing the plating would involve you in EPA and OSHA regs for air
and water pollution control and solid waste management, as well as learning
1000 things at once. Why not start on the marketing end, and only move to
the actual manufacturing side if and when you need to and have enough experience
to stay out of trouble?<BR>

Are you sure it needs to be used? What if you could get one of the plating
industry's most experienced engineers to design everything you needed, down
to the last bolt hole, letting you seek individual items, buying used items
when they are perfect and a great value, but allowing you to have your local
suppliers build the balance? If you would like to think further about the
possibility, please see <A HREF="../FinTech/index.html">www.finishing.com/FinTech/</A><BR>

For our research, we need a black finish on metal that when illuminated
by light at 585 nm will produce no fluoresce (that is absorb this light
and reemit light of a different wavelength). Thus, we would like to try
out different finishes to see which works best. We believe that treatments
involving organic dyes or oils will not work for our application. So, we
would like suggestions for black finishes on any metal surface that don't
contain organic compounds. We would also be interested in any suitable paints
you know of. <BR>
<BR>
</TT></I><HR><TT>Christian Johnson of N.I.S.T. wrote a paper called &quot;Unique
Surface Morphology with Extremely High Light Absorption Capacity&quot; for
&quot;Electroless Nickel Conference&quot; (1979, I believe) sponsored by
Products Finishing magazine, Cincinnati, Ohio. This sounds like it will
work. Maybe you can reach them through <A HREF="http://www.gardnerweb.com/">www.gardnerweb.com</A><BR>

black chrome and black nickel appear to comply or come close to fitting
this requirement. Source Safranek's book the properties of electrodeposited
metals and alloys. Not much difference in absorbance and emmission numbers
between the two. Instrumentation and cosmetics are their most common uses.
Not a lot of companies do this type of plating because it can be a pain.
You may find a plater <A HREF="../Shops/index.html">in this site</A> or
try AESF' listing.<BR>

Why not try using &quot;black oxide&quot; an oxide-layer on copper. A lot
of companies (like e.g. Lea-ronal or ENTHONE-OMI are offering processes
for this. Try to contact them also and let us know (me and my peers) if
you solved you're problem. Good luck.</TT><BR>

Harry is right, black oxide could be a good solution. In case your substrate
is not copper, you can find black oxide for steel and stainless steel as
well. The point is that black oxide gives no protection to parts. Black
chrome (it is a coating I spacially like) or black nickel are usually plated
on nickel so it will give a protection effect as well. Black nickel is much
easier to maintain then black chrome.By the way, there are also coatings
of black Ruthenium, black nickel-tin etc.<BR>

Help! <BR>
<BR>
We are jobbing out passivation of extrahard stainless steel washers and
can't seem to find a source for a consistant process. The washers are .015&quot;
thick x 1.375&quot; Dia. and very smooth and flat. When we have a shop test
passivate a dozen, they passivate fine. When we send over a <BR>
few thousand, passivation is very inconsistent from part to part. I suspect
that some of the parts are not passivated due to being &quot;sandwiched&quot;
or buried under other parts. Can you help by performing passivation for
us or helping develope a good process? Please call me at (216) 942-3120
or fax at (216) 951-4977 Thank You! <BR>

I am looking for a wear resistance-low coefficient of friction coating to
apply to 304 stainless which can be economically processed (many hundreds
of parts at a time) . The final surface finish would be 6 micro.<BR>
<BR>
It is used in a reciprocating pump and seal abrasion is the enemy.<BR>
<BR>
I have tried: Hard Chrome, TiN, Armaloy, Melonite QPQ. <BR>
<BR>
I would appreciate any help anyone can offer. I do not mind being solicitated
by suppliers.<BR>

ID or OD? How thick a layer of chrome did you put on. What chemicals and
abrassives is it up against. Tight tolerance ahd speed? Have you considered
a ceramic sleve or liner as appropriate. One of the high energy plasmas
like tungsten carbide followed by grinding might work if that is &quot;cost
effective&quot;.</TT></I><BR>

Resin-bonded dry film lubricants may solve your problem. These products
are applied like paint and cured. They are not inherently hard, but rather
are designed to carry high loads while reducing sliding friction. Numerous
products are offered by various material suppliers. You will probably need
help from a qualified applicator to pick the right formulation for your
pump shaft. To contact <A HREF="../Shops/luke.html">Luke Engineering</A>,

You might consider using electroless nickel or an electroless nickel composite
plating process that incorportes teflon as occluded particles within the
nickel plate.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps CrN would work better than TiN.<BR>

Had a similar problem on percussion drills , laser nitriding gave the best
results , but that was cavitation corrosion . Perhaps combining hard chrome
with laser nitriding might work , I remember the system being used on moulds
in the early eighties .<BR>

Our sputter deposited MoS2 coating is the low u coating you are looking
for.  This is a physical vapor deposited coating resulting in very high
levels of adhesion, density and purity.  We have more information available.<BR>

Let me know if I can be of further help.<BR>

Looking for H.D. Galvanizer<BR>
<BR>
My inquiry has to do with hot-dipped galvanizing an already formed part.
I currently produce a deep-drawn part that is approximately 4.00&quot; O.D.
and 2.00&quot; deep.There is no top or bottom to the piece, just an outside
flange. (it looks like a large eyelet). I currently produce this part from
an uncoated HSLA material. It is near imposible to purchase this material
coated because of the specified high manganese content. <BR>
   I am looking for a hot-dipped galv. coater in the Northeast who could
apply a G-60/G-90 coating. Is it even possible?<BR>

<H1>FAQ: Can I download mil-specs (and other specs) on the net?</H1>
<BR>
This question is asked constantly here, on other technical web sites, and
in the science newsgroups. As of now, the answer is apparently: &quot;No&quot;.
(This may not be bad anyway--web pages are very changeable and transient,
and it might not be a great idea to rely on an online mil spec yet).<BR>
<BR>
There are, however, sites where you can search specs and order them on line--
<UL>
  <LI>A great commercial site, with ASTM, ANSI and other specs, as well
as mil specs, is <A HREF="http://www.doccenter.com/doccenter/"><TT>http://www.doccenter.com/doccent</TT>er/</A>

 Electropolishing is a &quot;black box&quot;.  I don't understand what is
happening.  I don't need a book, more like a technical article.<BR>

Anyone know where we can download MIL-SPECS for no charge on the net?<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><I><TT>I know of no such place. However, there is a GREAT commercial
site where you can search for the specs you need and order them for instant
delivery at a pittance: <A HREF="http://www.doccenter.com/doccenter/">http://www.doccenter.com/doccenter/</A>
<BR>
With the military busy abandoning MIL specs to cut the military budget,
I wouldn't foresee the military putting up a free site soon.<BR>
<BR>
But who knows -- the government appears desperate to spend money on grants;
as soon as they get wind that there is a commercial site doing this, they
are likely to give somebody a million dollar grant to try to drive them
out of business (speaking from experience) :-) <BR>

I did some anodizing of 3003 aluminum in 15% oxalic acid with a 3003 aluminum
cathode. The results were very interesting. When the sample was rotated
by about 45 degrees, in one angle it showed green, in the other angle it
showed a reddish color. Many of my anodizing samples look opalescent.  </TT></I><BR>

Has anyone heard of a coating called &quot;Stone Guard&quot; or &quot;Stone
Hard&quot; applied over a copper substrate?<BR>

This coating is apparently used on a machine for sealing the plastic bags

Sirs,<BR>
<BR>
We need, due to a tight schedule, to shorten the time between the application
of Alodine process and the mechanical use (assembly) of the treated Aluminum
parts.<BR>
<BR>
According to ASTM-B449 (7.1) the chromate conversion coatings should be
&quot;handled carefully for the first 24 hours after treatment...&quot;.<BR>
STD QQ-P-416F (6.1.2.2) &quot;require a sufficient period....approximately
24 hours at 70^F to 90^F...&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Do you have any Good Engineering Practice to decrease the drying time?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks...................................Asaf Katz <BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><I>Many shops use a final warm rinse (not over 140 degrees F),
followed by a forced air dryer heated by hot water or steam .<BR>
Plenty of air, and not much heat , seem key to accelerating the drying without
dehydration of the chromate film.<BR>

During the first 24 hours the chem film coating is drying from a quasy gel
film. Care must be taken not to remove this &quot;gel&quot; Hot water above
140, skin temperatures above 220, and handling will disturb the surface.
One of the best ways is forced hot air, the higher the pressure the better.
Good luck.<BR>

We found that a couple of hours in direct sunlight (in Florida) really accelerated
the setting. My real recommendation is that you start the process one day
earlier so that it can set the required 24 hours. It is there for good reasons.<BR>

Anodized surface for electrical insulation<BR>
<BR>
I'm interested in learning more about anodized aluminum, specifically whether
it can reliably be used as an electrical insulator. As I understand the
finish, it's primarily aluminum oxide (alumina ceramic) which is a common
material for electrical isolation. I'm considering hard anodization, to
resist abrasion. Is this a common practice, and to what voltage? Are there
specific ways to call out the finish for this application? Any comments
would be appreciated.<BR>

<BR>
Anodize and hardcoat anodize are very good electrical insulators. Di-electric
breakdown values greater than 2,000 volts have been reported for hard anodize.
Of course, these are laboratory conditions. In practice, the coating quality
and thickness, base aluminum alloy, surface finish, sealing method, racking
technique, and part geometry all effect the insulating properties. We run
a number of jobs in our shop where hardcoat anodize is specified primarily
for electrical isolation. Wear and corrosion resistance are secondary benefits.
In high performance applications, a two mil (50 um) coating thickness is
usually specified. Grounding or part to part continuity can be achieved
by masking off contact areas. Luke Engineering contact information can be
found in the shops directory at &lt;<A HREF="../Shops/luke.html">http://www.finishing.com/Shops/luke.html</A>&gt;<BR>

Hello,<BR>
<BR>
In chrome plating bumpers, is there a difference with respect to appearance
and/or corrosion resistance (in winter conditions) between the two following
precesses?<BR>
<BR>
1) dull nickel, bright nickel, chrome<BR>
<BR>
2) copper, dull nickel, bright nickel, chrome<BR>
<BR>
If there is a difference, can the options be made equivalent by modifying
the duration of the steps?<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><I><TT>There are still some people who believe that copper offers
a different appearance. I was at one O.E.M. bumper plating shop about 5
or 6 years ago that was still using copper for one automobile brand. But
I've been to many others, before and since, and I think copper is a rarity
for O.E.M.s these days. Further, neither the MFSA quality guides, nor anything
else I've stumbled on over the years, claims better performance for copper.<BR>
<BR>
I think the story is like this:<BR>
<BR>
There was once a time, before bright self-leveling nickel, that copper was
important because the bumpers would be copper plated, then buffed, before
nickel and chrome plated. When self-leveling bright nickel became available,
many shops still stuck with copper--not only out of familiarity, but because
it allowed them to deal with old work per the old specs, and it allowed
continued buffing of copper plate, which could be an easier way of dealing
with minor scratches when refurbishing old bumpers than repolishing the
stock. So copper plating stuck for much longer than the technology really
required. But I wasn't elected keeper of the oral tradition, so if someone
thinks I'm wrong, please speak up.<BR>
<BR>
In terms of corrosion resistance, it seems that having the proper activity
ratio between the bright and semi-bright nickel, so that pits grow laterally
instead of penetrating, is the key. This is controlled with the STEP test.
To improve corrosion resistance, some wheel platers do electroless nickel
before the duplex nickel and chrome, but I'm personally not aware of any
bumper platers that do it.<BR>

I think Ted is right, copper is out. Double layer nickel gives a bright
and ductile deposit. Sara <BR>
<BR>
</TT></I><HR><TT>While I think that copper is out, for the most part, on
O.E.M. bumper plating, let me ask about aluminum wheels. I read that some
quality wheel manufacturers are zincating and electroless nickel plating,
then acid copper plating, baking, buffing, and nickel-chrome plating. My
question would be why the copper plating? Per an article I read, it's for
buffability. So my question would be, can you just duplex nickel plate the
electroless nickel, or will it be too dull? --or have some other undesireable
characteristic?<BR>

I am a plater in a small job shop. We use a cyanide copper strike prior
to bright nickel, chrome plate. In all the years I have found that the copper
does help on corrosion resistance on plated parts in weather conditions.
One thing I found is on any kind of exhaust pipe, &lt;where heat is high&gt;,
I skip the copper and go direct into bright nickel. I have never had the
problem of blistering since I have practiced this process. <BR>
Does anyone have any pro's or con's on this?<BR>

Dear Sirs:<BR>
I am currently working on anodizing die-casted aluminum, LM5 or Al-Mg alloy,
parts.  Known from &quot;The Surface Treatment and Finishing of Aluminum
and its alloys&quot; that different metalic compounds' dissolvabilities
in aluminum alloy matrix are different in sulphic acid during anodic process,
so inhibitor should be used or else the texture outcome will be unsatified.
 I would like to know what inhibitor or any brand name type is available
in the market.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you!!<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Wei-Chwen Wang<BR>

Dear Fellow Finishers:<BR>
<BR>
While I believe it is generally known that sulfuric acid anodize will/may
cause a reduction in the fatigue strength characteristics of aluminum alloys.
I would appreciate it if someone could supply me with an actual reference
which documents this. A reference with test data would be even more helpful.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you in advance for your help.<BR>

Blair, Check out &quot;the technology of anodizing aluminum&quot; by Brace
and Sheasby. also look at volume two of &quot;The surface Treatment and
Finishing of Aluminum and its Alloys&quot; by Wernick, Piner and Sheasby.
Mr Brace is in England, you can get his address thru AESF. Probably worth<BR>
contacting if the several references in the two books do not satisfy your
needs.<BR>
In short, it is a mixed bag with conflicting research. I think that your
sister company PWA is close to paranoid about it on vanes, or at least the
stripping and preprocessing steps.</TT></I><BR>

I know of no aircraft company that allows sulphuric anodising on critical
parts . You would lose the crack detection , and it would be disasterous
if used on an assebled part . Think of what would happen to the slip rings
on a 23 E 50 prop blade in sulphuric acid .<BR>

Can anyone tell me if there is a rule of thumb dealing with the proper procedure
for connecting two threaded aluminum parts without the danger of having
them seize?<BR>

</TT><HR><I><TT>Huh! Good luck. </TT></I>

  <LI><I><TT>I have spent hours carefully hacksawing aluminum hose fittings
off of faucets, trying not to damage the threads on the faucets.</TT></I>
  <LI><I><TT>I have disconnected the electricity, then struggled to remove
broken light bulbs with aluminum bases from their sockets with pliers.</TT></I>
  <LI><I><TT>I once bought a brand new garage door that had some aluminum
parts in the lock mechanism, and a warning to use only brass keys, not aluminum
ones. My wife didn't read that caution, had a duplicate aluminum key made,
and stuck it in before the door was 2 hours old. We're still looking for
the King Arthur who can pull this Excalibur from the lock.</TT></I> 
</UL>
<I><TT>Just a private prejudice, but this guy here feels that there is no
surface finish or assembly technique that makes an aluminum-to-aluminum
screwed joint acceptable. But maybe I'm wrong: you might visit <A HREF="http://www.magnaplate.com/">General
Magnaplate</A>, who offer all sorts of slick, durable, specialty finishes
for aluminum; maybe one of them solves the problem.<BR>

Try anodize and dry film lubricant for aluminum. Comes in a spray can and
is not baked. More can be added as needed if it is regularily used. If it
is allthread, use a stainless fitting with a grease. If it is in a very
corrosive atmosphere, find another metal.</TT><BR>

I am looking for information regarding the use of 7075-T6 alodyned fasteners
with 5052 aluminum panels. <BR>
<BR>
Is there a possibility of galvanic corrosion over time between these two
types of aluminum? The application is an electronics enclosure that will
NOT see a particularly harsh enviroment.<BR>
<BR>
Anyone with galvanic cossorion experience, please contact me with any ideas
or opinions.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
PK<BR>
</TT><HR><TT>I don't know <B>exactly</B> how 7075 lines up against 5052
in the electrochemical series, and I don't know of an activity chart which
puts so fine a point on it as to distinquish between different alloys. <BR>
<BR>
Alodine is a proprietary name for a MIL-C-5541 chromate conversion coating;
it will certainly retard corrosion rather than accelerate it.<BR>
<BR>
So I just can't imagine galvanic corrosion between these two alloys being
a problem in an electronics enclosure which will not see a harsh environment.<BR>

I am no expert by far, BUT the level and rate of anode-cathode mcontamination
and i.e., build-up is dependent on the potential difeerence, the relative
size of the contact areas, and the conductivity strength of the corroding
material. It is safe to assume that GALVANIC corrosion will be minimal if
the electrical potential is very low.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this was some help. I am hunting around for a GC chart for metals
to help me select materials better.</TT></I><BR>

You responded to question in the Jan issue of Metal Finishing about galvanic
corrosion of Al alloys. If you are still interested, you can find the wrought
and casting galavanic potentials in Aluminum: Properties and Physical Metallurgy
Ed by John E Hatch. In my edition (1984) they may be found on pages 257
and 258.<BR>
<BR>
We have had extensive problems with galvanic corrosion of Al, but with the
T73 temper of 7075. Depending on storage and other conditions all alloys
and tempers we use seem to have degrees of problems.<BR>

I predict that you will not have a galvanic problem between 5052 and 7075-T6.
 Consider the following explanation:<BR>
<BR>
While, MIL-STD-889 (&quot;Dissimilar Metals&quot;) Table II shows that 7075
is more active than any heat treat of 5052 the potential difference between
the aluminum alloys must be considered to be very minute.  MIL-F-14072 (&quot;Finishes
For Ground Electronic Equipment&quot;) Table VI shows these materials to
be permissible couples.  The fact the at least one member (i.e., 7075-T6)
has been Alodined will help.  (Actually it would be better if both aluminum
parts were Alodined or conversion coated per MIL-C-5541, Class 3.)  Other
steps which could be taken to minimize galvanic potential would be to limit
the size of the cathodic member (i.e., 5052) in contact with the anodic
member (i.e., 7075-T6) of the couple.  The larger the relative anode area
is, the lower the galvanic current density on the anode, and the lesser
is the attack.<BR>
<BR>
The potential for galvanic corrosion to occur with this couple is relatively
small (especially in an electronic enclosure).  If you do observe a corrosion
problem, then I would suspect that you will have far greater functional
problems with your electroic components than you will with the corrosion
of these two aluminum metals because the inside of your enclosure must be
getting wet.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>
<BR>

Believe it or not but we actually have that information.  On a silver reference
scale the initial potentials for 5052(H-34) and 7075(T-6)are -0.75 and -0.77
respectively.  This would be great news for you, unfortunately, in our wealth
of information we also include potentials on service aged materials.  In
that case the potentials of old aluminum 5052 and 7075 change to -.96 and
-.74.  The potential difference of .22 volts is acceptable to all but the
most conservative.  In addition, the Alodine will provide some protection.<BR>

<P><TT>We would like to subcontract hard chromium plating to a company which
does embrittlement relief using an oil bath, but we noted that the applicable
AMS spec requires the use of an air atmosphere. Other chrome specs with
which we are familiar do not have this limitation. Can you think of a specific
reason for this limitation? Is it likely that our customer can be convinced
to waive this point and accept the use of the oil bath?  </TT></P>

<BR>
I'm looking for guidance on selecting the proper types and thickness for
a gold over nickel plate.  We are modernizing a 20 year old design that
used gold over silver and had problems with the cheap silver undercoat tarnishing
through too thin of a gold overcoat.<BR>
Hi, I'm an EE test engineer and am working a little out of my realm. I know
that we want to use nickel as the undercoat for gold, but I don't know if
it should be electroless or electroplated.  I'm not sure what the optimum
thickness for the nickel or gold are.<BR>
<BR>
The coper alloy 260 or 270 ASTM B134 quarter hard pin being plated is about
one inch long with a maximum diameter of about  0.09 inches and several
areas turned down to different diameters, one as small as 0.035 inches.
The pin serves as an electrical contact and a mechanical interlock.  A wire
is soldered on to one end.<BR>
<BR>
Any help with the specifics, or if you can point me to a resource that can
provide guidance, is appreciated.<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

I am trying to find out what PUMA C12 Activator is used for along with any
other information that anyone can share about it. The application is EN
plating of a 400 series stainless steel part with numerous holes. The part
was activated with PUMA C12 followed by NiCl and Sulfamate Nickel before
finally seeing EN. The EN did not adhere to the holes.<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR ALIGN=LEFT><I><TT>Here's what their (PCT Tech'y Inc., Wantagh,
NY) ad in the 1997 MFG says:<BR>
&quot;Now you can plate Cu, Ni, or Au w/o having any rejects. Our 1-step
immersion process allows you to plate any type of metal w/ 100% adhesion
&amp; a perfect bond. C-12 Activator removes oxides and eliminates passivation.<BR>

I have used the product and found it no better or no worse than acid activation.
I feel that it has a place, but still like acid as it is, to me, more agressive
and easier to tell when it has done its job.<BR>
410 activates easily, so I would look at the holes not being cleaned properly.
If it was tumbled, I would really bet on it not being clean. A oil based
coolant for drilling sometimes will char in the hole and make it nearly
impossible to clean. sharper drills or changing feed and speeds might help.
Adding a vapor degreasing or solvent degreasing step might be necessary.
Increased agitation in your hot cleaner and rinses is a cheap start.<BR>
In short, while I would not use that product for this use, I do not feel
that the product is the cause (based on information given) of your problem.<BR>

You should activate your SS in acid, then in nickel strike and then EN.
Nickel sulfamte prior to EN will cause passivation.</TT></I><BR>

This product was the cause of many serious unbonds on our hardware. Our
vendors used this product on primarily Monel, but also on other alloys.
They used it with current and without and found the success rate to be about
40%. We no longer authorize the use of this product.</TT><BR>

<P><I><TT>Garry's comment would imply that it was. If it were, you should
be seeing failures elsewhere on the part also.</TT></I></P>

<P><I><TT>I respectfully disagree with Sara's comment. I do not feel that
sulfamate nickel oxidizes any faster than woods nickel from a practical
standpoint. I do not see why you would use NiCl then sulfamate then EN.
That does not make sense from what you have given.</TT></I></P>

<P><I><TT>Bottom line, I would still use acid to activate followed by a
Woods strike then EN. Include sulfamate if you have a reason.</TT></I></P>

<P><TT>&quot;The EN delaminated from the holes&quot; Does this mean that
the Nickel Chloride Strike layer and the Nickel Sulfamate layer both did
not delaminate?  If they remained stuck then the Puma worked just fine and
your Eless bath is having a hard time with those holes. Puma works great
but it is not a cure-all. If all the nickel is delaminating from the holes
then I agree it is more likely an electrocleaning or rinsing problem. </TT></P>

Steve,<BR>
If you are not a plater, you probably do not want to start with chrome.
Waste treatment has always been a problem. Now there is air quality testing
and shortly there will be a health protocol that will be a real pain. <BR>
There are three common plating solutions plus several flouride solutions
plus at least one proprietary solution and several proprietary additives.<BR>
You really need to get a book on chrome plating since it is such a large
amount of information to be considered.<BR>
This probably sounds like a &quot;put down&quot; but it is not. There are
very good reasons existing chrome platers are going out of business at a
ratio of 10 for every new one. In a few years I look to see it be massive
companies and a few mom and pop hangers on.<BR>
In short, not a good business to get into with no experience.</TT></I><BR>

Dear Sirs,<BR>
<BR>
I am trying to run galvanized hard drawn through a spring coiler and the
galvanized coating is giving me a nice shiny appearance. What I need it
to be able to tint the material a color similar to cadmium plate qqp416
type II. If we can accomplish this with a coating that would be great. We
also run this spring through a conveyor oven at 350 degrees. If there is
a coating that can be applied to the wire before forming that then would
turn a golden yellow upon heat..that would be acceptable. We are open to
any additional ideas<BR>

<BR>
Cadmium is the same silvery color as zinc. The golden yellow you are describing
is due to a yellow chromate conversion coating, which can be applied to
zinc as well as cadmium. But the problem is that it loses its protective
value, and can dehydrate and slough off starting at about 150 degrees F.
After baking at 350 degrees F it would have lost most of its value, although
it might indeed be the color you are seeking. If it would be acceptable
to chromate the finished parts after baking, I think you could get the color
match you are looking for, and corrosion resistance as well.<BR>

I agree, deposit the conversion coating after heat treatment or it will
turn a dirty deep brown. It may also not make it through the coiler in-tact.
The best coatings are the old Allied Kelite line, now owned by MacDermott.
Every color in the rainbow is available, though the non-standard ones are
organic based.<BR>
good luck,<BR>

I'm interested in nitriding and carbonitriding. It is possible to ad oxigen
in ion nitriding process? After nitriding stainless steel lost their thin
oxid film, due to this it appear a weak corrosion resistance.It is possible
to rebuild this thin layer?<BR>

Dear Fellow Finishers:<BR>
<BR>
I would like information on stripping chromium plate from aluminum (e.g.,
6061-T6). The process suggested must not attack the aluminum.<BR>
<BR>
The only information I've uncovered so far suggested using a solution of
40 to 60 g/l of chromic acid and making the part anodic at 4 to 8 volts.
Does this sound okay?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you in advance for your assistance.<BR>

Blair , that will work better than most things. when the chromic acid hits
the aluminum, it will anodize it and stop the attack. You will have to strip
the anodize, but that should not be a problem. Good luck.<BR>

Blair , instead of a new solution you can reverse it off in the Chrome tank
(dependant on quantity ) . Just be sure you use aluminum wire or jigs ,
the soln. is also a magic copper stripper . No it wont damage your chrome
tank I've been doing it for twenty years .<BR>

I am evaluating OD chromates on zinc (from zinc sulfate bath),<BR>
and am finding a generally low chromate bath tolerance for<BR>
dissolved zinc, and am at a general loss as to what to attempt<BR>
to control (pH, chromate %, dissolved zinc) in my tube/wire<BR>
application. Immersion times are ~15 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
By low tolerance, I mean that we see a fairly quick loss of<BR>
color on the plated product, with marginal SST affects. The<BR>
chromate coating also serves as an adhesion barrier for paint,<BR>
so the marginal reduction in SST to white rust in minimized.<BR>
<BR>
How long are OD chromate baths 'good' for, in general, and<BR>
what should I attempt to control to extend bath life, while<BR>
maintaining a good conversion coating?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks!<BR>

Robert,<BR>
Every company uses a slightly different formulation, so there will be some
difference between the critical elements of each bath.<BR>
I worked with a chromate that was used for both chloride Zn and Cd. One
metal was a poison to the other and the zinc required a less aggressive
chromate than the Cad did. Your vendor should have a seperate set of operating
conditions for Zn. There was a terrible tendancy to add excessive brightner
to maintain a 100% bright range which made chromating on a panel nearly
impossible. Are you using a very dilute acid rinse prior to the chromate.
Might help. 15 seconds seems to be a rather short immersion time. If the
chromate is slowed down some, it might be less sensitive. Try some different
combinations in the lab. The lab folks at your vendor should be able to
help if your salesman has not been much help. If push comes to shove, consider
using a different vendor. I have had good luck with two vendors and not
so good with another.<BR>
Good Luck, Jim<BR>

I am looking for a method to test plating adhesion of electroless/watts
nickel over a brass base with a copper underplate.<BR>
<BR>
We currently perform a &quot;bend&quot; test of 90 degrees and look for
flaking, but we have lots of plated parts that pass this test, yet we see
flaking of the plating within a few days (during other processing operations).
The parts are small (.080 to .120 dia. pins.<BR>
<BR>
Please reply with any suggestions you might have</TT><BR>

Rick,<BR>
I do not have a lot of experience with plating on copper, but would like
to make a few comments knowing that some people will not agree with them.<BR>
1. Bend test is &quot;normally&quot; 180 degrees over a mandrel that is
4 times as thick as your part. This will give a U and is a far more severe
test than 90 degrees.<BR>
2. an option is bake it at 250C for a few minutes, let it cool and check
for blisters under a 10 X or so optic.<BR>
3. you need to know where your &quot;peel&quot; problem is. Very carefully
take one of your peeling parts and poke at it with an Xacto knife to lift
a flake that you can look at under a microscope.<BR>
4. My guess is that you are using a free cutting brass which is probably
leaded. This is going to require a slightly different preprocess steps to
remove the minute surface amounts of lead.<BR>
5. Try running a small amount without the copper strike and see if that
helps or hurts. I assume that you are using a Watts strike before EN. If
so, check the recommended concentrations, particularly pH for plating on
copper and or brass.<BR>
Hope that this helps or stimulates more knowledgeable people to comment.<BR>

Where can I find information on screw finishes?<BR>
<BR>
We join aluminum die castings with threaded fasteners. We try to use commonly
available carbon steel screws. We have used zinc plated fasteners with great
success, but the call outs all call for &quot;...with yellow dichromate&quot;.
How and/or where can I learn about screw finishes, dichromate, etc., so
that I can make informed decisions in our search to reduce cost, insure
effective corrosion protection, and save the environment?<BR>

John,<BR>
Carbon steel against aluminum will rust fairly fast. <BR>
Most if not all zinc plated screws are chromated after plating. Most use
a clear chromate because it has more eye appeal. Yellow has significantly
better salt spray corrosion resistance than clear. Olive drab is even better
but is not generaly available as it is ugly. <BR>
Cadmium is less prone to cause corrosion of the aluminum than zinc is, and
it can receive a similar chromate.<BR>
Since you are using carbon screws, I assume that stainless is not required.<BR>
I know Schlumberger as oil field related. You must be in another division
and indoors to be able to use carbon screws with any success.<BR>

Hi Ted,<BR>
<BR>
I have recently prepared a review paper on black chrome for the <A HREF="http://www.uk-finishing.org.uk/IMF/index.html">Institute
of Metal Finishing</A> (UK). I have not been able to find any references
to the actual structure of the deposit and I am curious to know exactly
what black chrome consists of. The elemental composition is approximately
60% chromium, 35% oxygen and some hydrogen. This sugests that the deposit
consists mainly of oxides of chromium. However, as far as I am aware, the
only oxide of chromium which is black is chrome (IV) oxide and this is ferromagnetic!!
Black chromium is non magnetic although the percentage of chromium and oxygen
in the deposit does suggest an empirical composition of approximately CrO2.
I would be grateful if anyone could help out here or point me in the direction
of some references.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

Most paper (including NASA's report) state that 75% is metalic chromium
and 25% cr2o3.  x-ray and auger indicated that black chrome surface exists
as a porous finely structured medium with small particles embedded in a
chromium oxide dielectric matrix.<BR>
On the other hand I found an article stating that the non metalic component
of black chrome is predominantly a hydroxide rather than an oxide. Sara

We are cyanide zinc plating a 3/4 * 44 inches 1010 steel tube<BR>
which has a hexagon inlay in one side. We are getting severe <BR>
red corrosion after the parts dry, only in the inside. We know<BR>
that no protection is given (1/2 to 1 inch of coverage in the <BR>
inside edges) in the inside but our client wants to at least<BR>
keep the parts without rust 2 weeks, while the are fully <BR>
assembled, our process cycle is as follows:<BR>
1.-soak clean, 2.-rinse,3.-hot diluted sulphuric acid,4.-rinse<BR>
5.-anodic electrolitic degreasing, 6.-rinse, 7.-zinc plating<BR>
8.-rinse, 9.-rinse,10.-brigth dip, 11.-blue chromate, 12.-rinse<BR>
13.-hot rinse.<BR>
<BR>
We have tried skipping every single of the steps mentioned,<BR>
but the result is always the same, We have made the hot rinse<BR>
alcaline but there was no improvement also. Rust inhibitors<BR>
were also tested and the result was only a little bit better.<BR>
Small traces of &quot;yellow chromates&quot; are present in the inside<BR>
of the hexagon edges and there is where the highest amount of <BR>
red rust develops.<BR>
<BR>
Have any idea or clue on how to avoid or preserve the parts <BR>
from red rust?<BR>

Try dipping into an aqueous laquer. Your last stage is acidic and this accelerates
rusting. There are proprietary products that prevent rusting for a short
period. Try McGean Rohco in Mexico. They have a product named ROGARD FE.<BR>

Blue chromates have an insufficient amount of hexavalent chromium to provide
any real corrosion resistance to steel. <BR>
<BR>
I agree with Sara that a water-based lacquer is probably your best bet.
You can obtain this from <A HREF="../Galvanolyte/index.html">Galvanolyte</A>,
or discuss it with a lacquer specialist such as Agate Lacquer (contact information
is in our Products and Services directory). <BR>

I think water based lacquer could help the red rust problem , but the color
of the blue chromate changes  after the lacquer is applied. Some clients
may not accept the yellowish blue color. Why is the color changed and how
to prevent the color change ? Is there any other way to protect the blue
chromate ?<BR>

We are currently using machined dies for transfer molding of electronic
capacitors. I recently heard these dies could be made by forming a mold
of the desired shape and then the die is built up using a electroplating
process.<BR>
<BR>
Have you ever heard of a process like this ?<BR>
If so please steer me in the right direction<BR>

Electroformed molds or mold inserts are quite common in the industry. If
you are interested in finding out how your dies/molds can be electroformed,
e-mail me a sketch of the mold or a DXF file. We do electroforming at Reflexite
and may be able to help you out. If we can not, I know of other electroforming
companies that do this kind of work.<BR>

We are looking for detailed information regarding a phenomenon called &quot;tin
pest&quot;, or &quot;tin disease&quot;. This occurs mainly at specific temperature
ranges when the pure tin plating spontaneously transforms from one crystalline
form to another and flakes off. Any help you can be will be much appreciated.
I believe this was first observed at NASA Goddard, but I'm not sure. This
effect has rendered pure tin unacceptable for space use under certain conditions
and I need to know exactly what conditions will precipitate this phenomena.
Thanks.<BR>

Dear Bob,<BR>
I learned about this phenomenum many years ago, I only know that it exists
if pure tin is exposed to temperatures below appr. 10degrees Celcius and
that the presence of &quot;tin-pest&quot; is a possible threat for non-infected
tin. The phenomenum was also observed for Tin-craftmanswork which detoriated
to powder. I think your best chance to find more is the ASTM-database. Success.

<HR>I've heard that a bit of bismuth helps, but that this introduces it's
own problems because the bath is difficult to control and requires insoluble
anodes. I've also heard that tin pest is less of a problem with acid baths
than alkaline. I'd be quite confident that your inquiry has been the subject
of papers at <A HREF="http://www.aesf.org/">AESF</A> conferences--so you
might commission them to do a literature search, which is very inexpensive,
then order the applicable conference proceedings.<BR>

Subject: Making Photopolymers Conductive<BR>
Date: Tue, 17 Dec 1996<BR>
<BR>
The photopolymer we are presently using is a water-etch or water soluable
product and in the process of silvering it, to make it conductive, the image
is destroyed because of the water based nature of the silvering. Unfortunately
applying a laquer or other coating would distort the extremely delicate
engravings which were etched into the photopolymer.<BR>
I would like to know if any of your readers could suggest a process to make
the photopolymer conductive, so that it may be used as a matrix in a nickel
sulfamate electrofoming process without distorting the images.<BR>

Most aqueous an semi-aqueous developable photo resists stand up well in
acidic solutions but not in alkaline solutions. I'm not sure how you are
silvering but you might see what the solution pH is <BR>
A few other possibilities might be to use electroless nickel in place of
the silver, process solutions are acidic. The other thing might be to re-expose
the photo resist after you have gone through the development to make sure
you get maximum crosslinking of the<BR>
polymer, that might improve ability to withstand the silver solution. <BR>

If your photopolymer is one of the acid-stable varieties such as dynachem
UH10, you can render it conductive through all acidic steps using a tin
chloride followed by Palladium Chloride sensitizer process such as Macuplex
offered by MacDermott. This can be followed by Electroless Nickel or other
Electroless deposition steps. They work great on those thin dryfilms. <BR>

We have some large panels (3'W X 8'L) that we need to wet with plating prior
to brazing. Normally we would electrodeposit gold (0.0008&quot;-0.001&quot;)
on the Narloy-Z, and Copper or Nickel (0.0002&quot;-0.0004&quot;) on the
stainless. Then braze the two together. However because of the size of the
panels we are looking into using Electroless Gold, Nickel and Copper. Can
anyone tell us the disadvantages of using Electroless in a brazing application.
Also what types of electroless solutions would work best with this application.<BR>

If you use electroless Ni,you need to look at the %P of the deposit and
also what type of brazing temp. you are using.Look at a phase diagram of
Ni/P to see what temp liquidus temp is.Brush plating might be an option
if plating needs to be done on edges,but if both panels need to be brush
plated completely,it would complicate the process somewhat,although not
impossible.</TT><BR>

Gary, EN, especially a high Phos one, works very well. Considering the cost
of gold, I would doubt the number of places that would have a tank that
would take a 3x8 panel. If you have long skinny tank to hold down volume
(cost) it is going to require very good solution pumping to maintain uniform
temp and etc.<BR>
Sulfamate nickel brazes very well also<BR>
A real question probably is what quantity per week or is cost a small factor
to reliability.</TT></I><BR>

Additional information.<BR>
1. The % of phophorus is 9<BR>
2. The temp. for the brazing operation is 1800F<BR>
3. Nickel Boron or Nickel Phosphorus which one?<BR>
4. We plan to make the tanks for plating, and plate only one side completly.<BR>
5. Any information on the Electroless Gold that would pertain to operation?</TT><BR>

Brazing at that high a temp is probably out of the realm of most platers.Two
of the better known authorities on electroless plating ar Glen Mallorory
and Juan Hajdu. Both are semi retired but were still active the last I knew.
I would try to talk to both of them if at all possible. If anyone can answer
your question it is them or they will tell you who to go to.</TT></I><BR>

One problem missed so far in this discussion is that Brazers HATE to put
metals into their furnaces with any Phospherous content as it gasses out
as a very corrosive gaseous phosphorous and damages the ovens. Eless Nickel
Boron is usually the only alternative for use in brazing ovens. Need additional
help/advise? Contact Dr. Lovoi at International Technical Associates(InTA)
in Santa Clara, CA. They can braze anything to anything, usually with proprietary,
patented braze alloys.<BR>

I have a customer, (printed circuits)that is using sodium<BR>
dimethyldithiocarbamate to treat waste waters. The problem they are having
is floating sludge. This sludge forms a very dense thick layer on the reaction
tank and the clarifier. I have ruled out flocculent overdose as the problem.
They are using an polyaluminum chloride and an anionic flocculent. This
system is basically used as a dispose all. The foaming comes and goes, but
it is there more than it's not. We have tried some silicone antifoams with
no affect.<BR>
<BR>
If anyone can help, or can shed some light on the problem it would be greatly
appreciated.<BR>

I have a few possible sources for the floating sludge problem: <BR>
(1) Look for wetting agents from cleaner dumps, or since it is a circuit
board shop, developer solutions.<BR>
<BR>
(2) Look for reactions that liberate gas (for example, sulfides, carbonates,
etc. reacting with acids). The DTC may even contribute.<BR>
<BR>
(3) Check for temperature inversions, that is, warm water entering a cold
tank or vice-versa, especially in the winter if things have been shut down
for a while and a warm waste stream enters the system.<BR>

Bill is right on target.Clarifiers should, and many do, have a flotsam trap
to minimize effluent quality excursions caused by floating sludge. <BR>

And there is one more thing which generates gas, comes and goes in a circuit
board shop, Copper metal. You probably have someone using a scotch brite
roll in one of those chemcut things.<BR>
<BR>
Also, did someone mention the peroxide from etching?<BR>
<BR>
Especially if you use the treatment plant as a dispose-all. The worst time
I ever had with a treatment plant is when I worked for a coil coater who
has these scotchbrite brushes for cleaning galvalume. When they ran galvalume,
they would run the brushes, which rubbed off the zinc into fines. The zinc
fines would dissolve in the high pH, and badabing-badaboom, floating meatballs.
It was disgusting, because we also had a lot of oil, which would form a
gooey mess.<BR>

If all this techie advise still does not make your floating sludge sink,
it may be that you have a centrifugal pump feeding the clairifyer that is
sucking air on the suction side at the threads on the inlet pipe. This entrained
air will be carried into the primary flocculent mixer as microscopic bubbles
and these bubbles will become trapped in the floc and buoy it up to the
surface. This failure usually is caused by bolting down the pump to the
floor while simultaneoulsy bolting down the inlet pipe very close to the
inlet of the pump. When the pump turns on, the quick increase in pressure
in the impeller housing causes the housing to flex outward slightly. 1/16&quot;
of movement can be expected. If the inlet pipe is fastened down nearby then
it cannot move with the pump housing flexing, and the threads on the pipe
become damaged, and eventually allow air to be sucked into the pump. Best
solution to this problem is in piping design. Come into the pump off a 90
degree elbow and fasten the pipe far enough down the line to allow for this
flexing. Worked for me. <BR>
Good Luck,<BR>

Direct filtration may be fine, Ted, provided that you can find just the
right medium (and equipment) that will take out the sludge and give you
a clear filtrate. Unfortunately, in many applications such a thing is next
to impossible and people rely on filtration, recycling the (still murky)
filtrate back into the clarifier.<BR>

But if you recycle that still murky filtrate back into the clarifier, what
you will get out of the clarifier will be the same still murky decantate.<BR>
<BR>
If a precipitate has no appreciable floc size, it won't clarify at all.<BR>

<BR>
Au contraire, Ted!<BR>
You introduce the murky recycled filtrate in the section of the clarifier
where the bulk of the treated wastewater enters, carrying larger sludge
particles as well as extra coagulant. The stuff neatly settles and you get
clear filtrate exiting the clarifier and more sludge at the bottom... we
already know how to handle that, don't we?<BR>
<BR>
I hate these complicated approaches myself!<BR>
<BR>

</TT></I><HR><BR>
<TT>The concept you are describing, 'depth filtration'applied to a floc
bed in a clarifier, is a nice idea -- in theory. When I was learning wastewater
treatment under Dr. Lancy almost 25 years ago it was much talked about.
In fact we disliked the famous-brand lamella-type settler precisely because
it has no appreciable sludge holding area to facilitate this approach.<BR>
<BR>
But since then I have tried this several times. In fact, in some cases I've
recycled a slipstream of sludge from a sludge holding tank to try to help
out during periods when floc loading was low. And my experience is that
I see no evidence that it actually works. Murky water in = murky water out.<BR>
<BR>
If anybody has any numbers, where they've actually demonstrated using larger
floc particles to clean up waste water that is devoid of a settleable floc,
I'd love to hear it. But I DO agree with you that a second shot of polyelectrolyte
can sometimes help.<BR>

Is there a practical way to brush plate aluminum parts like car wheels,
amplifier mounts,speakers,etc with nickel and then gold? I know that I can
dip it in nitric acid,zincate,nitric acid again and then electroless nickel
plate it but that is a little much for what we want to plate. I need something
simple but something that will yield a decorative, bright surface as well.<BR>
Thanks<BR>

I am trying to deposit silver on iridium electrodes (10umx700um) from a

Silver does not adhere well to many base metals, underplates or strikes.

I think Bill is right, a gold strike might be more effective. Also, how
are you activating the Iridium? A 5-7 oz./gal. cyanide with hydrogen peroxide
(0.5 ml/ 100ml of solution) should remove oxides that prevent adhesion.
Finally be sure to introduce the work &quot;hot&quot;, that is with current
on as the parts enter the plating bath to avoid immersion deposits.<BR>

<BR>
The big problem with Iridium is that it is the most corrosion resistant
element appearing on the Periodic Table of the Elements. This makes the
surface microstructure unalterable by wet chemistries, therefore pre-plate
etches or brite dips wont touch it, including Aqua Regia. So how to microetch
the surface to provide sufficient toe-holds for the Silver deposit? Iridium
can form a stable Cyanide[Ir(CN)6---]complex. A pre-plate anodic treatment
in strong, hot, alkaline Cyanide followed by the silver strike may be successful.
Otherwise molten salts are required such as KOH + KNO3 heated to red glow.
If this is too much process, mechanical abrasion methods will also work.
Ir is very hard and abrasion resistant. The Gold strike previously mentioned
may also help out if Gold is allowed in the device that you are making.

I am a Process Engineer at a R&amp;O station for aerospace engine parts.
One of the coatings we do is platinum aluminide. Recently the platinum has
small white spots appearing in the plate in the last 15 minutes of plating.
The plating is very thick but we have never observed this phenomena before.
After diffusion the white spots spread to a star like appearance. If the
are allowed to remain (usually we blend and brush plate) after the aluminide
portion of the coating, the coating will delaminate in those areas. We only
get the spots on a certain part that is close to MAR-M 247<BR>
material. The manufacturer of the platinum solutions have suggested several
corrections but nothing seems to improve this problem. Luckily it does not
appear on any other parts. Any ideas? Analyzing the spots under SEM show
only platinum and aluminum. Thank you in advance for any assistance you
may give.<BR>

Cheryl, are you using the black (sulfuric/nitric)Pt plating solution or
the Clear(Chloride) one? I have found that the black one is inherently unstable
and the pH will dive below zero due to excessive acid generation at the
anode. When this occurs to excess, I noticed microscopic white spots, along
with a reduction in Cathode efficiency even though Pt content was constant.
Correcting pH with KOH solved this pbm but the acid generation was so excessive
that I soon reached the solubility limit of the potash! Sinch Plating temperature
is extremely hot, I was able to control pH by freezing out the spent potash
overnight and replacing new KOH in the morning. The Pt in the spent potash
salts was recoverable. This was economically preferable to a feed &amp;
bleed system on the bath replenishing with fresh solution, which was the
only other solution to this pbm, as it generated more gms of waste Pt per
amp-hr.<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

I have experienced problems like this before. We paid a university to run
XPS studies underneath some blisters that appearred after diffusion heat
treating. They discovered aluminum which is a component in Nickel based
superalloys. We found the best solution was an aggressive grit blast but
on some turbine parts the sidewall thickness is important which limits the
use of grit blast. Good luck.  <BR>

in a paint spray booth setting, does anyone have any information on how
this will impact the manufacturing processes of the light fixture manufacturer,
e.g. UL, ETL, NFPA, etc.? <BR>

Zinc Chromate Paint Replacement<BR>
<BR>
I have a serious galvanic corrosion problem where aluminum panels are riveted
to steel plate. Previously, the steel plate was painted with a zinc chromate
primer which worked OK. The current unsatisfactory system has an alkyd primer
only on the steel. This application is truck trailers operating on salt
laden roads in the upper midwest.<BR>
<BR>
What would be a paint replacement for the zinc chromate with comparable
performance.<BR>
<BR>
I am also curious about usage of zinc chromate paints. Is there much use
today. If not, when did the use start to decline.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for any responses.<BR>

Larry,<BR>
The use of zinc chromate virtually disappeared from use because of the word
chromate. Since hexavalent chrome is a known carcinogen, the world has gone
the same way that it did when it found that if you gave a lab rat the equivalent
of 500 cokes with saccarin,he would have a higher rate of cancer.<BR>
Zinc chromate is still available to commercial users but not over the counter.
Most painters do not want the hassel of chrome bearing waste disposal so
went to substitutes. <BR>
If it were me, I would get out the Thomas register and talk to at least
three painting giants like Sherwin-Williams engineering departments. There
are many better products than what you are using, but will cost more. Then,
will your painter apply it?<BR>

<H1>FAQ: Problems with Passivation of Stainless Steel</H1>
<BR>
The passivation of stainless steel is problematical. Little reference to
it is found in most of the industry's 'must have' books, such as the the
Canning Handbook, the Electroplating Engineering Handbook, the Metal Finishing
Guidebook and Directory, The Properties of Electrodeposited Metals and Alloys
by Safranek, or the Products Finishing Directory.<BR>
<BR>
But there are some references: 
<UL>
  <LI>A couple of pages of theory and recipes can be found in the 'Metals
Handbook', Ninth Edition, 'Volume 5: Surface Cleaning, Finishing, and Coating',
published by the American Society for Metals International, Metals Park,
Ohio USA. ISBN 0-087170-011-5. 
  <LI>The February 1988 issue of <I>Metal Finishing</I> magazine has an
article by D.K. Verma entitled &quot;Surface Preparation of AISI 400 Series
Stainless Steel Components&quot; 
  <LI>Federal specification QQ-P-35 on passivation of stainless steel 
  <LI>Dozens of references in the &quot;Shop Problems&quot; column of <I>Metal
Finishing</I> magazine (including a very interesting one in the December
'96 issue), and the &quot;Plating Clinic&quot; column in <I>Products Finishing</I>
magazine over the years, as well as a few in the similar troubleshooting
coumns in <I>Industrial Finishing</I> magazine and <I>Plating &amp; Surface
Finishing</I>. 
</UL>
Some of the contributions by the columnists are quite interesting, revealing
that part of the problem is that nobody even knows why passivation is done,
or its basic function! 
<UL>
  <LI>For example, columnist William Snyder ,writing in the May '82 Plating/Anodizing
Forum in <I>Industrial Finishing</I> says: &quot;Remember that the intent
of passivation and its precleaning is to remove any trace of carbon steel
. . .&quot; 
  <LI>But by the March '83 issue he was saying: &quot;Over the years, people
have talked about passivation as a process that removes ferrous contamination
from stainless steel parts; it doesn't. . . Thousands of dollars are wasted
every month by manufacturers going through complete passivation cycles when
all they need is proper cleaning . . .&quot; 
</UL>
For sure the questions are going to continue. So don't be reluctant to contribute
your experience. And don't be embarassed if your experience hasn't been
too hot. Because if you have destroyed parts in attempting to passivate
them, you are a member of a very large club. People around the world are
smoking parts left and right! Read on . . .

<BR>
problem with passivation of 301 ss washer needs solving <BR>
<BR>
We are bonding 301 extrahard smooth stainless steel washers (.015&quot;
thick x 1.378&quot;) to thermoplastic with a special adhesive.  Testing
of passivation of a dozen or so washers yields exelent bonding, but when
we job out a few thousand washers at a time, bonding is inconsistant form
part to part.  I suspect that parts sandwiched or buried under other parts
are not being fully passivated.  I have no experience with passivation and
would appreciate any help regarding suggestions to process modification,
special equipment or job shops in the US capable of doing the work.  Sorry-
no E-mail, but you can call 216-942-3120 or fax 216-951-4977.  Gayle Stewart
is working at our company on this problem and would appreciate hearing from
you. She has a degree in Chemistry, but no background in passivation or
metal treatment. Help!<BR>

<HR><I><TT>I've often seen casual references to vacuum impregnation for
dealing with porosity in castings, but I've never had the opportunity to
really learn anything about this technology. So I'm happy that one of our

Ultraseal International are a design authority and major manufacturer of
porosity sealing equipment and methacrylate sealants. Applications include
ferrous and non ferrous castings, power metal parts etc. To seal parts against
pressure leakage and <BR>
chemical entrapment. <BR>
<BR>
If the visitors to finishing.com have questions, our technical services
are open to assist in the understanding of this vacuum impregnation process.<BR>

<BR>
Would vacuum impregnation be useful/useable for rather larger openings such
as the spot welded joints in chassis? <BR>
<BR>
Is there some pore size / hole size that is too small for the sealant to
enter or too large for it to span. <BR>
<BR>
I understand that it is a vacuum process, but what actually draws the sealant
into the pores--capillary action?<BR>

Generally vacuum impregnation is used to seal ferrous and non ferrous castings
against pressure leakage. These can be pumps for oil, water etc. or cylinder
heads and blocks for automotive applications. The major part of our business
is with international automotive companies around the world. Others include
eltronic housings that require water tighness etc.<BR>
<BR>
There would not be any real benifit to seal spot welding unless they were
in a pressurised enviroment and leakage was resulting from a pin hole in
the weld. As a rule the porosity should be no more than 1/20th of the mcross
section that the defect is in.<BR>
<BR>
Another application for porosity sealants is as a pretreatment for conversation
coating - chromating etc. The benifit is to seal any voids that may otherwise
trap the chemicals and spot out the surface finish. A regular component
treated in this way is power metal parts.</TT><BR>

<BR>
Thanks, Peter.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding the spot welded chassis, what I was actually referring to is this:
When such parts are placed in plating tanks, the aggressive cleaning, acid
dipping, and plating solutions tend to wick into the joints. Later, of course,
and over time, they wick back out and cause discoloration, staining and
corrosion.<BR>
<BR>
What is sometimes done is beads of sealants are run along all the edges
to exclude the solutions. I was just wondering if vaccuum impregnation might
be a competitive technology for that application.<BR>

From your discription, vacuum impregnation may well be suitable for sealing
for this application. We need to set up a trial with appropiate samples.
If this is a possibility, I will arrange treatment. Please let me know location
of available samples so that I can advise nearest job shop facility. Peter.</TT><BR>

Hi, Peter.I'm a consulting engineer, not a plater, so I don't personally
have the immediate need for this potential solution. But as I deal with
chassis platers, I will keep in mind that they should set up a trial with
you and see if vacuum impregnation is a viable alternative to the beads
of sealant.</TT><BR>

Yes the porosity in the chassis should fill with sealant providing there
is no relative structual movement in use and that the void is not so large
that sealant will run out after impregnation. I believe a good guide is
for the dia of pore to be no more than 1/20th of its length.<BR>

Peter, you are probably right that the resin could fill the seams, but it
may mean a redesign of the seam to make sure you don't have wide areas which
won't be filled, thus still causing bleedout after an expensive operation
such as impregnation. The idea is starting to appeal to me. I know we only
did impregnation on investment castings for very expensive military equipment
that required perfection. I can't see how the cost could be absorbed in
a chassis costing a few dollars, but maybe there is a way.<BR>

The cost of impregnation for military applications can be high due to certification
etc. From a commercial point of view impregnation should not be expensive.
Perhaps you could advise me of the size of the component and quantity and
I will endevour to give you a price guide.<BR>

Dear Mr. Young,<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your offer. I would be very interested in the cost of impregnation
of sheet metal boxes, just for the sake of argument. There might be many
other applications.<BR>
<BR>
The chassis, I suppose, are the ones that are used for electronic black
boxes everywhere. say 6&quot;x18&quot;x16&quot;, some are open things with
lots of nooks and crannys, some are more like a box.<BR>
<BR>
As for the number of pieces, I'm sure there are millions, but not all of
them will stand the cost of the added value of impregnation. Perhaps only
a tiny percentage, used for critical applications, would ever be done this
way. Who knows? Maybe one of your boxes will soon be on its way to Mars
or somewhere.<BR>
<BR>
I see many being plated in cyanide zinc, because of the better throwing
power from the cyanide bath. I have no idea what it would cost to seal the
seams of these boxes, relative to the total present cost of producing the
box.<BR>
<BR>
How would you do the estimate? I guess the cost is mostly a function of:<BR>
pickup and delivery of the boxes to the plant<BR>
labor to load the boxes in a carrier<BR>
dragout of the impregnate on the large surface area of the parts<BR>
amortization of the equipment<BR>
wastewater treatment<BR>
cost of heat for curing<BR>
<BR>

I've been thinking some more on the chassis. You may have seen earlier that
I suggested to a reader that they may wish to think of vacuum washing of
parts that get chemical entrapment. This is equipment we design and mfg.
In essence the parts would be washed in a hot alkline solution, vacuum dried
in the same chamber, followed by chemical conversion and subsequent washes
and further vacuuming as necessary. This all takes place in the same machine.
The workload is first placed in suitable trays, bins etc. Sub-division of
the trays may be necessary for certain components that require protection.
<BR>
In Europe we use the inexpensive plastic Eurotray. Our smallest machine
takes a payload of 400m x 400m x 600m. This can be made up of one bin or
several trays. The machine is front loading at a conveyor height of 900m.
The payload is rotated about a horizontial axis with the process solution
cascading over it. It is shear volume of liquid that does the job - no nozzels
to block! This equipment is sold to major automotive customers for chromating
of aluminium castings, acid washing and alkaline washing. The cleaning is
so great it beats ultrasonics!<BR>
Processing times are slashed due to the rapid action of the drenching action.
Also chemical usage is considerably reduced in many instances.<BR>
Caskade is the name of the system. We have our first order from a USA based
automotive company for one of these systems and would be looking to tie
up with a suitable marketing company in the US on a joiont venture bases.<BR>
<BR>
Regards Peter. Apoligies for the metrics!<BR>
<BR>
</TT></I><HR><TT>Huh? You lost me, Peter. Are you suggesting that as long
as parts are cleaned and rinsed efficiently, with ultrasonics or whatever,
that people don't need vacuum impregnation or seam sealants after all?<BR>
<BR>

<HR><I>Date: Mon, 6 Jan 97<BR>
From: &quot;Peter Young&quot; &lt;PEult@msn.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I suppose the point that I was labouring is the need to ensurer that the
components are always as clean as possible.  <BR>
<BR>
There are two schools of thought in the impregnation world -  whether to
impregnate before or after chemical treatment.  If in doubt it is worthy
to sample test both ways.  The limitation is what is available by way of
impregnation processing. Most jobshop facilities offer traditional batch
type  processes with the major part of their experiance with the sealing
of porosity for pressure tighness - where surface cleanliness is perhaps
less important. For surface finishing applications it is quite a different
story -  any sealant film left on the component, will of course mask against
chemical reaction and cause unacceptable blotchyness of the finish.<BR>
<BR>
To get around this problem, it is often recomended to chemical treat components
first and then impregnate.  The problem here of course is that corrosion
could start in the entrapment if there is undue delay between chemical processing
and impregnation.<BR>
<BR>
Where chemical processing and impregnation are available side by side, the
preference would be to first chemically treat.  This is especially so where
there is a risk of metal removal, exposing otherwise hidden voids that were
not available for sealing at the time of impregnation.<BR>
<BR>
Traditional batch processing impregnation can be made to work as a <BR>
pretreatment, but it requires care and attention to effect the removal of
surface sealant.  It follows also that whether the impregnation process
is used as a pretreatment or post treatment, itself has to be correctly
applied - good positive vacuums using a good well maintained sealant are
just as important.<BR>

Is there such a process? If so how exactly is it achieved. I'm referring
specifically to air emissions and effluents.<BR>

chemical baths; I think it is possible to work in this way, but I'm not
sure, so I would appreciate your comments or suggestions about this issue.<BR>

<BR>
i need a detailed description on a parkerizing or phosphatizing process
as it is used as a finish for handguns (companies like colt or springfield
offer a parkerized finish on some of their pistols). the finish should be
slighty rough and the colour should be a medium gray. the description should
include the pretreatment (sandblast, acid treatment, degreasing, ???), the
process itself (chemicals, solvent, concentration, temperature, time, ...)
and the treatment afterwards (sealing, chromatizing, maybe coloring, ???).
if there are any companies that offer (commercial available) parkerizing
kits (of retail size) for the gun job that are available here in europe,
please let me know.<BR>
<BR>
any (gratefully accepted) comments should be sent via e-mail to:<BR>
f533klee@mbox.tu-graz.ac.at - thank you, al.<BR>

&quot;Parkerizing&quot; is the trade name for a phosphating process by Parker.
They are now Parker+Amchem whose parent company is Germany based Henkel.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure that it is a phosphating process. It could be a Gun &quot;blueing&quot;
process.This is a controlled oxide formation process. There are various
companies offering these products.<BR>
They should be able to provide you with the information you are looing for,
and would process some samples for you as well.<BR>
Good luck! </TT></I><BR>

I've recently encountered a quantity of galvanized sheet steel which has
appears to have what the tin benders call &quot;white rust&quot; on the
surface. I assume this is essentially due to oxidation of the zinc and I
would think that it would be superficial. Several of the tin benders, however,
claim that this spells disaster and that the useful life of the Material
when exposed to atmospheric corrosion (oh, say as a roof) has been severly
compromised. The material was stored outside in bundles through several
rainstorms. The white deposits appear between the sheets, and where the
bottom sheets were in contact with the ground. Any opinions? <BR>

<BR>
Robert, I agree with the &quot;tin benders&quot;, but it depends on its
end use whether it has been seriously compromised or just compromised.<BR>
It is not an ideal product to work with and some one made a boo boo by letting
it set unprotected. That is easy to do, as the top sheet dries out daily
and doesn't &quot;rust&quot; while the inner sheets do. Aluminum will do
the same thing. Chromate or phosphate and painting with a good paint will
somewhat negate the problem. Hopefully , the responsable person learned
from it.<BR>

<BR>
When one purchases galvanized steel it is either &quot;chem treated&quot;
or non &quot;chem treated&quot; Chem treatment is a chromate solution applied
at the mill to inhibit the formation of &quot;white rust&quot; It is used
where the galvanized steel will not be painted afterwards. Examples include
guard rails, trash cans, pails. <BR>
<BR>
Non Chem treated galvanized is purchased when the parts are going to be
painted. Unfortunately the chem treatment does not allow for  typical painting
processes. ( I understand that Oakite has a paintable passivation being
evaluated by the mills for coil coating applications)<BR>
<BR>
You can specify to your steel supplier the type of galvanized desired. <BR>
<BR>
As far as removing the &quot;white rust&quot; phosphoric acid is very effective
and is not too agressive. Rememember the protective zinc has been removed
to some degree and a galvanic site has been created. the part should treated
and painted or the damaged area cut out during fabrication.<BR>
Good Luck <BR>

Deplating Brass<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking for a way to deplate brass objects. <BR>
<BR>
Please advise of any process available that I can do at home.<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><I><TT>Hello, Terry.<BR>
<BR>
With any followup questions, please provide your last name as well; as a
rule, we can't print letters without full names.<BR>
<BR>
What metal is on the brass that you want to de-plate? From your e-mail address,
may I assume that it's nickel-chrome?<BR>
<BR>
There is the possibility of removing the chrome electrolytically in an alkaline
solution--but this would leave you with hexavalent chromium, a carcinogen,
in the solution. Then you would need to remove the nickel, most likely with
a cyanide-based stripper.<BR>
<BR>
In my opinion, these kinds of operation should not be done at home.<BR>

XRF coating thickness measurements -calibration for thin AU with VEECO system<BR>
<BR>
I am interested in accurate XRF coating thickness measurements for AU/NI/CU
in the range 0,07-0,35 micrometers AU and 1,5-5 micrometers NI.My XRF measuring
system is calibrated with samples beginning with 0,45 micrometers AU.What
standards should I order to get accurate readings? What is the influence
of the plating method? How should I write the part specification in order
to get a good corellation between my mesurements and the supplier's measurements?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for the opportunity to address this forum.<BR>

These are extremely thin Au surfaces and quite thin Ni. But it sounds do-able.
Most XRF standards are foils that are glued into the handlers, but your
thicknesses may be too thin. Veeco or one of the other XRF standards suppliers(found
in Metal Finishing Mag &amp; Guidebook)will custom make you a standard set.
Its not so expensive. Just call them and discuss your concerns. They are
very helpful. More important than the thickness will be the length and width
of the surface to be analyzed. Circles of less that 3 mils diameter require
special collimators to be special ordered. Veeco is currently working on
an impossibly small one for me as we speak. When you talk to them, be sure
to completely describe the substrate, as it can interfere. You can send
veeco a sample as well...and let them figure it out. After all, what do
you pay them for anyway?<BR>

Method to analyse coumarin<BR>
<BR>
I would like to know if there is any ASTM standard to check<BR>
purity of coumarin or if there`s any way to test it at all.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance<BR>

Coumarin - what do you use it for? Once  upon a time it was used as a nickel
brightner but it is history. I think it is not allowed to use it any more.
Anyhow, any plating shop that uses coumarin has a terrible smell all over
the facility. Later on it was used for semibright nickel but nowadays even
for this application it is not used anymore. So, what do you use it for?<BR>
<BR>
</TT></I><HR><BR>
<TT>Hi, Sara.<BR>
<BR>
Your attitude about coumarin is probably correct, but it isn't quite history
yet. I was at a large O.E.M. chrome plater recently and, sure enough, they
were using generic coumarin in their semi-bright nickel--a lot of it!<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, I don't know anything about controlling it except by hull
cell analysis.<BR>

Picric Acid Replacements?<BR>
<BR>
We use minor amounts of Picric Acid (Trinitrophenol) as an etchant prior
to non-destructive testing. We are looking for a replacement for this. I
am aware that Hydrochloric (Muriatic) Acid is used as an etchant on concrete.
Any experience with Hydrochloric Acid in NDT work? or any other possible
replacement for Picric Acid, regardless of use?<BR>
<BR>
Any help would be appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you,<BR>

<BR>
The best list of micro and macro etchants that I have personally seen is
from LECO in St Joeseph Mi. It is in their metallographic preparation manual.
They obviously sell metallographic equipment and supplies. An alternative
is the metallographic book, one of a set, by ASM. Principles of Metallographic
laboratory practice, third edition or later, McGraw Hillis another source(this
is an extremely old book)<BR>
I hope you are aware that dry or very nearly dry picric acid is an explosive,
War I and II vintage.<BR>
If you get in a real bind, Email me at jwatts@sprintmail.com.<BR>

Your questions may have been answered already? Just saw note today.<BR>
We use a Solar spectrum reflectometer,Manufactured by Devices and<BR>
Services Co. Dallas, Texas.<BR>
<BR>
Reflectivity of a regular glass mirror is R am2 = .882<BR>

Hope this helps,, Max T. Faeth <BR>

Thanks Max. <BR>
<BR>
Our interested customer performed their tests using:<BR>
<BR>
Helium Neon Laser @ 633 nanometer wavelength<BR>
<BR>
Results: 63-64% reflectivity on Super #8 mirror polished stainless<BR>
     and 56-57% reflectivity on Super #8 mirror polished stainless<BR>
                with titanium nitride (gold color finishes). <BR>
<BR>
I'm told these number is below regular glass mirrors...but very good for
mirror polished stainless surface. <BR>

<BR>
I am an Associate professor of Physics from Kharkov Polytechnic University,
Kharkov, Ukraine (a new state - a part of the former Soviet Union). I am
working with some industrial enterprises and am interested in problems connected
with Metal Finishing. You can find my name among the authours of the December,
1993, issue of <I>METAL FINISHING</I>. I've found your e-mail address in
<I>METAL FINISHING</I>, too (August 1996).<BR>
<BR>
I wonder if you could advise me how to resolve the folowing problem. The
fact is our enterprises are very interested in energy saving technologies.
I have got an inquiry from one big plant concerning Soak Cleaning Products
and Electrocleaners that could operate at low temperatures (as we say -
Cold Degreasing Technology). The plant technicians want to clean parts of
bicycles and motocycles at approximately room temperature before plating
(total volume of the plating baths is about 50,000 gal.).<BR>
<BR>
If you have a some information concerning such products and their producers
I'd be very grateful if you could inform me about it. I would connect with
the American producers to discuss possibility of some cooperation. I could
to promote their products in the C.I.S. market.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to your comments on the above.<BR>
<BR>
Very sincerely yours,<BR>

My opinion, based only on my personal travels rather than a rigorous marketing
study, is that they are far less popular than they were in the 1980's, and
that the primary reason is the difficulty they usually pose in wastewater
treatment. <BR>
<BR>
Recently I was involved in an installation that used a cold-action cleaner,
and we found that it was simply not treatable--we could not achieve the
required effluent standards with any practical treatment of the wastewater.<BR>

Cold Action Cleaner manufactured by Enthone is one pretty decent example
of a heavily complexed electrocleaner that works reasonably well on steel,
copper, brass, etc. at room temperature. It is difficult, but not impossible
to treat when present in the wastewater in significant quantities (5% vol
and higher), besides, your environmental standards may not be as stringent
as ours.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, PlaterB<BR>

Nyet to cold cleaning.<BR>
<BR>
Low temperature cleaning was the hot topic of 70's and early 80's until
everyone found out how cost prohibitive it was for &quot;water break aplications&quot;.
In many cases the problems were in the soils. Buffing compounds, drawing
compounds contain components i.e. waxes where the melting point must be
exceeded to be removed. What people also found was the high concentrations
and cost of treating high concentrations made it cost prohibitive. The 4
variables for clening are time temperature concentration and energy. What
could get you close here is energy whether it be current, ultrasonic, turbulation
or agitation (heavy). Most modern day formulations are made for &quot;low&quot;
temperature. There is a big difference however between no temperature an
low temperature.<BR>
Good luck-  <BR>

We are using an anti-tarnish solution for sterling silver which contains
sodium chromate. Does anyone know of an easy, cost effective way of getting
rid of the resulting chrome in the waste? Thank you in advance, David</TT><BR>

David, Like your email address. If you are a one time household generator,
you can talk to your local garbage people. My county has a twice a year
forgiveness day where they will take noncommercial quantities of nearly
anything.<BR>
If you are commercial, immediately sign up as a conditional small quantity
generator. This allows you to do some treatment to reduce volume. Boil it
down to an almost slurry. Pour the cooled material into a heavy plastic
lined drum. Label the drum &quot;hazardous waste--satellite accumulation
container&quot; and then list the haz material in it. You can keep this
drum to nearly forever, the requirement is to periodically empty it.<BR>
Chromates are oxidizers. These will react with other material when you do
not want it to. I would be gun shy of organic material in it. Check the
MSDS sheet that you got with it. If you did not get one, call the manufacturer.
They have to provide you with one on a timely basis or they can go to jail.<BR>
When you eventually ship this of, plan on $300 to 500.<BR>

First you have to reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent with bisulfite
in low PH and then to precipitate the trivalent chromium at high PH. Sara<BR>

Sometime ago I saw an ad for an unusual filtering system for hard chromium

progressively removing finer particulates. I have misplaced the ad and have
no idea who makes this equipment. Can you help?<BR>

ventilation design<BR>
<BR>
We're doing a finishing shop relocation and addition. What I,m looking for
is a ventilation manufacturer that can do a layout and sizing for tank ventilation
along with supplying the equipment. I just don't have the time to do it
myself, and I'm sure a vendor can do it quicker. Any leads or info, or experiances
with vendors you've worked with whom you feel have done a good job appreciated.<BR>
Thank you.<BR>

Hello, Val.<BR>
<BR>
In our <A HREF="../Products/index.html">Products Directory</A> is contact
information for several ventilation suppliers, including local suppliers
Alter Manufacturing Associates and G.P. Systems, and national ones like
KCH Services and Midwest Air Products. All four have been in business a
long time, none of them are bad, and I know that at least three of them
do the design work and drawings.<BR>

Does anyone know of a completely effective, yet cost efficient method for
removing finishing solutions from small, blind threaded holes? We have a
critical application with numerous 6-32x1/2&quot;deep holes. We have tried
multiple rinses, vigerous agitation, hand shaking, and OHSA approved air
nozzles. Nothing is 100%. I welcome your suggestions!<BR>

<BR>
In addition to ultrasonics as suggested by Bill, there may be other approaches
depending on the process. For example, sulfuric acid anodizers use such
approaches as bicarbonate neutralization, or a nitric acid dip to supplant
the sulfuric acid. But these ideas may be inapproriate for plating solutions.<BR>
<BR>
Another very important idea is hot, or at least warm, rinsing. I once saw
a presentation by Berl Stein (platerb@worldnet.att.net) where he demonstrated
and graphed how important rinse temperature is in these applications.<BR>
<BR>
What about forced air drying? Is the problem general rusting, or is it an
identifiable chemical remain from a process?<BR>
<BR>
Finally, how about plugging the holes? You might want to talk to <A HREF="http://www.finishing.com/Products/beacon.html">Beacon
Chemical Co.</A>, or <A HREF="http://www.finishing.com/Products/echo.html">Echo

The answer is Caskade, a processing centre manufactured by my company. It
applies the chemicals and then washes and vacuum dries tem to eliminate
chemical entrapment. Components are rotated in jigs during processing. A
range of systems are available to suit most applications.</TT></I><BR>

Plugs are a way, but they are time consuming. If you can not afford ultrasonics,
try putting the rack in your cleanest rinse tank, preferably a hot one,
shake the rack and try fill as many of the holes with water. The harder
it is to get the plating solution out of the holes, the more likely it is
that the clean water will prevent the ingress of plating/cleaning solutions.
If possible, rack the part holes down so that it traps air.This would work
on only a few percent of the parts. A final solution that I have used is
modifying an air chuck with a piece of tubing that has been heated and drawn
to a point, and then cut off at an appropriate diameter. This is hooked
up to water and used to flush holes. It works, but is a cheap last resort
solution if you can not afford the high dollar solution.</TT><BR>

The LEX-AIRE URBO-DRYER is the perfect solution for drying blind holes,
as well as any other parts.<BR>
It consists of a high volume, low pressure, portable air heating unit that
runs on 110 volt electricity, and an air hose for drying out blind holes
or parts.<BR>

If your using an air hose,hook up a tube with a fresh water supply  allowing
the water to drip over the nozzle end.when you spray the air the water will
be forced into the hole</TT><BR>

<H1>FAQ: How do I get started in plating?</H1>
<BR>
This question takes many different forms: some people have very specific
ideas that they'd like to gold plate brass buttons or chrome plate carburetors;
others want to be able to plate anything. Some want to do it once to repair
an heirloom, or a few times as a hobby; others want to do it as a small
business. Most want to start in their basement or garage; a few want to
do it in a local lab.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless, it is not only expensive, but foolish and possibly lethal to
mess around in a business where hundreds have been killed or seriously hurt
(and dozens have been sent to jail) without adequate knowledge. Please treat
any promise that it is easy as the quackery that it is.<BR>
<BR>
For those who need that heirloom plated, look up 'plating' in the Yellow
Pages for a local large city, or see <A HREF="../Shops/index.html">www.finishing.com/Shops/</A>
for a list of plating shops. For those who want to do it as a hobby, please
think again; due to the inherent hazards and waste problems, plus the political
pressures, plating is a horrible hobby. For those considering plating as
a business, please join us--but with your eyes open.<BR>
<BR>
First, a couple of paragraphs of easy science. Plating does not consist
of dipping a part into a single tank. Part of the quackery you may hear
is that you don't have to clean and activate the parts, you can just 'dip'
them. This would be like refinishing your sink without even removing or
washing the dirty dishes that are sitting in it. It is nonsense. Plated
metal, if it is not to blister off the moment it is put into service, must
metallurgically bond with the surface; this demands that the surface be
absolutely free of contaminants and tarnish. Any 'bridging' and the plating
is useless.<BR>
<BR>
When it is said that something is 'chrome plated', sometimes it means cleaned,
etched, activated, palladium-tin plated, electroless copper plated, electrolytic
copper plated, semi-bright nickel plated, bright nickel plated, and THEN
chromium plated--with multiple rinses between each set of steps. Most plating
processes require a post-treatment step as well. It's rather involved.<BR>
<BR>
Next, the politics: the electroplating jobshop industry was the country's
very first EPA-regulated activity; the first industry for which &quot;categorical
standards&quot; were issued. Part of this was probably due to the fact that
it was easier to intimidate Mom &amp; Pop shops than General Motors; but
part of it is the reality that plating inherently involves strong acids,
caustic soda (lye), chromium, heavy metals, and cyanide. Multi-million dollar
aquifer cleanups have been necessitated by leaks from plating shops. And
it is impossible to go from one step of the plating process to the next
without copious rinsing. Whatever will you do with that rinse water as it
grows too strong to use?<BR>
<BR>
If the process demands cyanide or hydrofluoric acid, would you have these
in your house? I wouldn't have them in mine, I promise you.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, if you will accept that it isn't easy, and that you'll need to learn
some things, then . . .<BR>
<BR>
<B>Here's EXACTLY how to get started: </B>
<UL>
  <LI>First, attend a <A HREF="http://www.aesf.org/branches/">local branch
meeting</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.aesf.org/">American Electroplaters
and Surface Finishing Society</A>. Find a branch near you, then contact
the secretary (or whoever the designated contact for that branch is, as
shown on the webpage). He or she will give your directions, last minute
updates, etc., and will probably volunteer to introduce you around on meeting
night. Guests are invariably welcome, and you'll meet a cross section of
specifiers, platers, vendors, and consultants and academics. This is an
individual membership society, so you will find it very affordable to join
if/when you wish. 
  <LI>Second, get your hands on some books. As a minimum, get two or three
from the <A HREF="../Library/refbooks.html">'must-have' list</A>. After
reviewing them, you may want to get another one or two on the specifics
that interest you. 
  <LI>Third, if a local library doesn't have them, subscribe to some of
the trade journals and periodicals serving the industry, such as <I><A HREF="http://www.elsevier.com/locate/metfinish">Metal
Finishing</A></I> magazine, <I><A HREF="http://www.gardnerweb.com/">Products
Finishing</A></I> magazine, <I><A HREF="http://www.aesf.org/psf/rates.html">Plating
&amp; Surface Finishing</A></I>, and <I><A HREF="http://www.uk-finishing.org.uk/transactions.html">Transactions
of The Institute of Metal Finishing</A></I>. 
  <LI>Fourth, give strong consideration to a hands-on training course in
plating. Three excellent sources are the <A HREF="http://www.aesf.org/courses/index.html">AESF</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.uk-finishing.org.uk/IMF/training.html">IMF</A>,
and <A HREF="../Directory/kushner.html">Kushner Electroplating School</A>.
  <LI>Fifth, after you've begun to acquire a general feel for what plating
is about, please come back to <A HREF="../index.html">www.finishing.com</A>
and we'll try to help you with the next steps.

<H1>FAQ: How can I do an electroplating demonstration for my science class?</H1>
You should take a look at &quot;<A HREF="getstart.html">How do I get started
in plating?</A>&quot; for the generalities before you move on to the specifics
of the project.<BR>
<BR>
It seems that nearly everybody saw a plating demonstration years ago, and
now they are firmly convinced that the instructor showed them how to electroplate
bright, shiny, sparkly, copper onto old steel with copper sulphate and a
battery. They're SURE that's exactly what they saw: &quot;He just dipped
it, and you're trying to make it sound difficult.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Memories are faulty things. They probably saw a demo of copper spontaneously
depositing onto steel or onto a nickel from that cool blue solution; but
over the years, as they read about electroplating in a science book, their
minds melded what they actually saw, with mental pictures of what they read
about, yielding a faulty recollection.<BR>
<BR>
You cannot successfully electroplate copper out of a copper sulphate solution
onto steel (or aluminum or zinc either)! It spontaneously plates out as
a thin, powdery, non-adherent (immersion plating) coating. <BR>
<BR>
The best demo I every saw-- by far! --was a gold plating demo put on by
Technic of Providence RI. (phone 401/781-6100, fax 401/781-2890). They took
a little 89-cent nickel plated bracelet, dipped it in a beaker of cleaning
solution, then activating acid, then into a large beaker of gold plating
solution for 15-20 seconds (rinses in between, of course). Because both
the beaker and plating solution were clear, the students could watch the
piece turn into gold right before their eyes.<BR>
<BR>
Then the instructor took out a pocketful of such bracelets, hooked a piece
of copper wire around each, did the precleaning, and handed one to each
student who wanted to try it. There wasn't one who didn't jump to his feet
to get on line! My kids still have theirs. <BR>
<BR>
If you want to do a plating demo that is worthwhile, that's how to do it.
But be sure to remind the observers that you are demonstrating scientific
principles, not necessarily a practicable process that actually has industrial
utility.<BR>

Sir(s) I have been searching for authoritative info regarding the popular
fad of plating car emblems and accessories. Since most platers want to sell
you equipment to quote &quot;Get into your own business and make millions&quot;,
is not what I want. I wish to apply it as a hobby for personal items and
possibly develop small single use kits for individuals. Problem is what
are the parameters, ie power requirements, tools, and main chemicals. Strippers
and Au solutions are easily available at supply houses; BUT what are they
puttting in them to make them applicable for &quot;on site&quot; applications.
Where or under what publications are some of these questions answered?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for any input you can provide.<BR>

<I><TT>There is a book entitled &quot;Electrochemical Metallizing&quot;
by Marv Rubenstein, ISBN 0-442-27956-6, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold
Company. It's 450 pages of information about brush plating. <BR>
<BR>
But basically, you are dealing with 'proprietary' chemcials here. A supply
company paid somebody to develop, improve, and perfect the brush plating
process by testing thousands of additives under various conditions. That
development effort is paid off through charging more for the proprietary
mix than just the price of the raw chemicals. That's the way this industry
works.<BR>
<BR>
You'll find SOME information by doing a literature search, since there is
always published basic research in this field, but you won't find any supplier
who will tell you what they add to their processes. You would need to do
the research yourself, or license a process.<BR>

I'm restoring a National Cash Register with a case made of very ornate red
brass.  Being almost one hundred years old, the case is tarnished to the
point where it is virtually black.  Many polishes will remove the tarnish
on the flat surfaces, however in the deep crevases the tarnish just can't
be reached with polish.  Is there some type of chemical solution in which
I can dip the parts in order to remove the tarnish.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your time and consideration.<BR>

I have some wheel rims from a motorcycle that have a chrome ring on the
outer part of the wheel. This chrome ring is pealing off and I would like
to know if there is a way to remove this chrome ring from the wheel and
not get into a major project.<BR>
<BR>
Also if anybody cares, I have found a cheap way to make your own dremel
attachments for cleaning metal. First you take the dremel attachment that
is used for cutting wheels. In place of a cutting wheel you take a scotchbrite
pad and cut out 2 or 3, inch and a half squares. You put a center hole in
the pads and screw them to your dremel attachment. They will wear into a
circle when you<BR>
use them. They work better than any attachment I have bought and only cost
pennies. And do not forget saftey glasses.<BR>

Although we call them 'chrome plated', the chrome is only millionths of
an inch thick; what you are probably seeing is the nickel peeling. Sorry,
but there is probably no easy way to fix it.<BR>
<BR>
As a minimum you need to blast off the loose nickel, then MAYBE what is
left can be stripped of chrome, reactivated, and plated. But frankly I doubt
the results, and it will probably look quite bad. The right thing to do
is completely strip the nickel, polish and buff, and start over.<BR>

Hi, my name is jeff yi and i'm a student at oregon state university. My
major is environmental health and currently taking a class called Elements
of Industrial hygiene.<BR>
<BR>
I have a project that require to pick an industry (chemical,<BR>
textile...etc) as well as a process and find out the chemical that they
use and obtain its MSDS (material safe data sheet).I also have to describe
the process and state the reason why the chemical is important in that process.
Also, i have to find out who makes the chemical.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not really sure if you can help me with this or not, but i you could
please help me. <BR>
<BR>
my e mail address is jyi@ucs.orst.edu<BR>
address is 727 SW 15th st.<BR>
corvallis, or 97333<BR>
<BR>
thank you for your time and concern.<BR>

I work for a specialty chemical company in Cincinnati, OH (TEXO CORPORATION).
 We sell process chemicals to a wide variety of industries: Autoimotive
Mfrs., Food &amp; Beverage Mfrs., General Mfg. Industries, and the Transportation
Industries.<BR>
<BR>
If you pick an industry that interests you, we could pick a process and
discuss the why's and what for's.  Then I could send you an MSDS and some
technical information on the product.<BR>
<BR>
If this sound good to you, email me and I'll give you our 800 number so
we can talk.  I think it very resourceful of you to use an industry forum
such as this to get info for your project.  I wish more industry professionals
did the same thing!<BR>

<H2>Letter #<INPUT NAME="number" TYPE="text" SIZE="4" MAXLENGTH="3" VALUE=
"708"></H2>
<TT>Date: Tue, 31 Dec 1996<BR>
From: Steve M Williams &lt;healthsearch@earthlink.net&gt;<BR>
Organization: Southern Cross Medical Service, Inc.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I recently attended a small business job fair where a gentleman was demonstrating
a plating machine and process that he said he invented.<BR>
<BR>
He would clip an electrical clamp to a quarter and paint it with a pink
jel solution. The quarter would turn gold. He did not wear a respirator
just a pair of rubber gloves. He would rinse the quarter between applications.
He was selling the system for about 7K and the gold solution that he said
he invented for about $250.00.<BR>
<BR>
My question is... is this system really a plating system? Do you know anything
about it? Is it safe? Can the system or one like it be purchased for less?
( I only want the system to plate antiques, and small to mid sized bronze
art work.)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>

<I><TT>The general idea of brush plating as an alternative to tank plating
is sound enough, and has been used on historical preservations, aircraft
maintenance, and countless other critical jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Several suppliers of brush plating equipment and chemicals are included
in our directories here, including <A HREF="../Products/dalmar.html">Dalmar</A>,
<A HREF="../Products/goldtouc.html">Gold Touch</A>, and <A HREF="../Shops/sifco.html">Sifco</A>.
Contact them for pricing;<BR>
I think you'll find that you can obtain hobbyist level equipment for far
less than $7000, but that top of the line professional brush plating systems
will cost more than $7000. <BR>
<BR>
As for the cost of the solution, gold itself is so expensive that the gold
content will tell you what the solution is worth. That is, you're certainly
not going to buy gold in solution for less than the cost of metallic gold,
but you're unlikely to have to pay more than twice the going rate to have
it dissolved in fufu juice either. So the price range should not be dramatic.
Ask them how much gold is in the solution and judge by that.<BR>
<BR>
An old saying in plating is that 90 percent of the work is in preparation
of the substrate. When it looks easy in a demo it's because the nature of
the parts is such that they need little preparation. Ask him to gold plate
a ratty old penny instead of a shiny quarter...or maybe a chrome plated
pen clip, or a stainless steel washer, or an aluminum token. You're not
going to be able to directly plate bronze with gold--you need to nickel
plate it first.<BR>
<BR>
In brief, if you want to plate quarters you probably can do what he showed
you, and without much effort. But if you want to plate a real-world assortment
of stuff, you're going to find that there's a lot to it.<BR>

I'm considering stripping the silver plating from my trumpet and leaving

<BR>
My first thought is: &quot;Keep your hands off&quot;, or leave this to a
professional. Anyway if you want to do it yourself, you can use the so-called
MECO Ag-strip ID-1, available at MECO USA, based in Rock-Hill, South Carolina.
In this stripping-solution you have to place yr. trumpet anodically.<BR>
<BR>
The big advantage of this stripper is that it nearly doesn't strip any copper
from the basematerial away. Some slight attack of the base will be inevitable
and you should be prepared for repolishing it after the Ag-stripping.<BR>
<BR>
To my opinion, the whole operation should be done in a plating shop who
also has the possibilities to do the waste-treatment afterwards. In general
I would not advise you to do these things at home, apart from the fact that
it is probably illegal.<BR>
Anyway should you wish to do it yourself: success.<BR>

has sent chemicals and anodes to a residential address (backyard), and you
could get into a heap of trouble by bringing chemicals home from a company.
<BR>
I have never seen a successful copper-nickel-chrome home project. Nowadays,
you would also need a small backyard wastewater treatment facility, a small
backyard environmental and safety department, etc., etc. -tom </I><BR>

It's been a few years but there is (was) a company in Arizona who you might
contact. I have purchased plating supplies from them... but not for quite
a while. They used to ship even cyanide solutions though it was an expensive
proposition.<BR>

As noted in the previous letters, there are limitations on what a hobbyist
or 'backyard' plater can do. But within those limitations, in our directory
of Products and Services, you'll see several companies that are structured
to serve such needs: Dalmar, Gold Touch, and Triple-S, for example.<BR>

Gentlemen:<BR>
Thank you for being so upfront about metalfinishing. I had thought to 'dabble'
in it as I have a few old silverplated pieces not worth a pro's time (or
my $). And the interest to 'see what I could do.'<BR>
<BR>
I feel it is much better to politely educate newcomers as you have, than
to join a NG only to find out they detest newcomers, as has happened to
me.<BR>
<BR>
I will take my teapots to a silversmith.<BR>

No reply necessary.<BR>

Subject: Baby Shoes

I am interested in bronze plating baby shoes, Do you know where I might find
info?
thanks in advance for any help,
Ron

<HR>
<I>
Your best source might be the Metalworking FAQ Compendium at
http://PLAINS.UWYO.EDU/~metal/index.html

If you think you can sell bronzed baby shoes, your might just want
to find a vendor and set up a distributorship because you are
faced with two pretty big problems in trying to do them yourself:
1). You need to use dangerous, toxic, regulated chemicals.
2). While you can find technical references to the basic steps of
sealing, metallizing, and plating, we are talking about a practice that
is an artform best learned under an apprenticeship.

You might also want to read <A HREF="01skull.html">Letter #1</A> which is on a related subject.

Ronald Spitler wanted to know how to bronze plate baby shoes. I remember
that in the 1950's seeing ads selling kits to do this in magazines such
as Popular Mechanics. Recently, I saw a similar ad placed by United Bronze,
Inc. of Rumford, RI. They claim to offer kits to metalize baby shoes in
copper, bronze,or gold. I confess to being curious since I thought it was
impossible to effectively plate on to a non-metallic substrate. Does the
process really work, and if so, how?<BR>
<BR>
Nick<BR>
<BR>
</TT><HR><BR>
<I><TT>Thanks for the update, Nick. I don't know of the company you mentioned
but, yes, it is possible to effectively plate non-metallic surfaces. Almost
all bright automotive grills and headlight bezels are plated plastic, for
example. <BR>
<BR>
There is a FAQ here, '<A HREF="../faqs/organic.html">Plating organic materials</A>',
that may serve as an introduction. For shoes, basically you metallize them
by spraying them with a two-component silvering solution. One part is a
soluble silver salt, and the other part is a reducing agent; when they meet
on the surface of the shoes, metallic silver is deposited. Then you carefully
electroplate the silver.<BR>

<BR>
I looked into a couple of those baby shoe &quot;bronzing&quot; companies.<BR>
The process was not actually &quot;plating&quot;.  It was more like &quot;coating&quot;.<BR>
The first step was to dip the shoe in a clear sealer.  Then you<BR>
simply air-brushed (included in kit) the &quot;bronze&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;,
&quot;silver&quot;, or<BR>
other finish coatings.  I think one of the processes had you wipe<BR>
on or buff a powder over the shoe.  The last step was to again<BR>
seal the shoe with a clear finish.  Rather disillusioning I thought.<BR>
The term &quot;bronzed&quot; referred to the color rather than the process.<BR>

	<H1>Trading and Conduct Rules</H1>
	</center>	


<BR>

<UL>
<h2>Introduction</h3>
<p>
<h3>1.1	Purpose of Trading and Conduct Rules</h3>
<p>
The purpose of these Rules is to set out a code for personal trading and conduct at Altamira. Altamira Management Ltd. and its various affiliates (together herein referred to as "Altamira") have a fiduciary duty to their clients which requires that each employee place client interests at the forefront. Apart from the strict legal restrictions placed on Altamira, its directors, officers and employees, Altamira has long followed the policy that no director, officer, manager or employee should use their position, or the knowledge gained therein, in such a manner that a conflict of interest might arise between their personal interests and the interests of Altamira clients.
The Ontario Securities Act (the "Act") contains provisions applicable to all issuers that publicly distribute securities which expressly prohibit the trading of securities by insiders and persons in a special relationship with the issuer on the basis of undisclosed material information. The legislation also includes similar provisions specifically applicable to transactions in portfolio securities of a mutual fund by insiders of the mutual fund, its management company and distribution company.
The Rules are consistent with the provisions in the Act and in some cases are more strict in order to ensure that no hint of a conflict or breach of the law arises. While the Rules attempt to deal with most situations in which a conflict might arise, it is clearly not possible to describe every situation that might give rise to a conflict.
If you have any doubt as to the propriety of any activity, you should consult with any member of the Trading and Ethics Committee. The Trading and Ethics Committee is made up of the individuals described in Annex "A" hereto.
</p>
<p>
<h3>1.2	To whom do the Rules apply</h3>
<p>
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the Rules apply to any full and part-time employees of Altamira Management Ltd, Altamira Investment Services Inc. and Altamira Securities. It is a condition of your continued employment that you sign an acknowledgment on an annual basis stating that you have read the Rules and that you agree to abide by their terms. A form of acknowledgment will be distributed to all employees with a copy of the Rules on an annual basis. You are to return the acknowledgment to Peter Rizakos, Corporate Counsel, as soon as possible after receiving it.
For your information, a copy of the acknowledgment is attached as Annex "B" to the Rules.
</p>
<p>
<h2>2.	Restrictions on Trading Activity</h2>
<p>
<h3>2.1	Clearance and Reporting of Personal Securities Transactions</h3>
<p>
All personal securities transactions must be cleared prior to execution, unless specifically exempted from clearance as provided in Section 2.3.3 below (see "Categories of Personal Securities Transactions: Clearance Ordinarily Not Required").
To clear a personal securities transaction, you must provide a prior request to and obtain the consent of Peter Rizakos and one other member of the Trading and Ethics Committee. If Peter Rizakos is not available, the consent may be obtained from any two members of the Trading and Ethics Committee, only one of whom is a portfolio manager. All requests and the disposition of such requests shall be documented in a confidential log maintained by the Trading and Ethics Committee.
Any clearance shall remain in existence for the trading day in which the approval is granted, unless the trade is executed on a "good until cancelled basis", in which case the clearance shall remain in effect until the trade is executed or until the trade is cancelled. A new clearance will be required if the trade is not executed during the duration of the initial clearance.
Even if a personal securities transaction is exempt from the clearance requirement, you are still required to report the transaction (see "Trade Reporting Requirements" in Section 3 below).
</p>
<p>
<h3>2.2	Definition of "Personal Securities Transactions"</h3>
<p>
The following transactions are considered personal securities transactions:
</p>
<p>
<li>	transactions for your own account, including RRSPs
<li>	transactions for an account in which you have indirect beneficial ownership, unless you have no direct or indirect influence or control over the account. Accounts involving family (including a spouse, minor children or other dependent relatives), or accounts in which you have a beneficial interest (such as a trust of which you are an income or principal beneficiary) are included within the meaning of "indirect beneficial ownership".
<li>	transactions for an account over which you have no direct or indirect beneficial interest but you exercise control or direction over the investments (example, as an executor or trustee).
The definition is intended to cover most securities transactions over which you may have a direct or indirect interest, and includes long and short positions. If you have any question about whether a particular transaction fits within the definition, please seek clarification from Peter Rizakos or from any other member of the Trading and Ethics Committee.
</p>
<p>
<h3>2.3	Categories of Personal Securities Transactions</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of these Rules, personal securities transactions are divided into three separate categories: those for which clearance is ordinarily not granted, those for which clearance is ordinarily granted, and those for which clearance is not required. Clearance may also depend on other circumstances including the timing of the proposed transaction relative to the transactions made on behalf of our clients, the investment intent, the nature of the securities and the parties involved, and the percentage of the securities involved in the transaction relative to ownership by Altamira managed accounts.
</p>
<h4>2.3.1	Clearance Ordinarily Denied</h4>
<p>
Clearance will ordinarily be denied for:
<p>
<li>	Trading in Portfolio Securities. Portfolio Securities include any securities held in any portfolio managed by Altamira including any mutual fund, pooled fund or any segregated, private or other account, and include any securities actively contemplated to be included in any such portfolio. The restriction applies to any securities of an issuer represented in the Portfolio Securities and to any derivatives of the Portfolio Securities, including options, warrants and convertibles. The restriction applies regardless of whether the Portfolio Securities were acquired by Altamira before or after your acquisition. In this circumstance your security position will be "frozen" until the securities are no longer Portfolio Securities.
<li>	Trading in IPO's or Secondary Public Offerings. This includes any transactions involving the purchase of any debt, equity or equity-related securities at any initial or secondary public offering and also includes investments in private companies that are expected to make a public offering within a reasonable period of time
<li>	Trading in Restricted Securities. Annex "C" contains a list of securities (the "Restricted Securities") that Altamira is restricted from trading for client accounts. Such securities may also be inappropriate investments for personal accounts. Personal trading in Restricted Securities may be permitted depending on the circumstances of the trade and the potential for a conflict of interest to arise (see below). This list applies to Altamira officers, directors and employees and will be updated from time to time as required.
	The Trading and Ethics Committee may, in certain circumstances, approve trades in Portfolio Securities, Restricted Securities, in securities offered pursuant to an IPO or a Secondary Public Offering, if it can be shown that:
<li>	the transaction has been made for long-term investment purposes and not for speculation. The Trading and Ethics Committee will require a written declaration of investment intent from any person wishing to clear a trade on this basis. Whether there is "investment intent" will be a question of fact to be determined by the Trading and Ethics Committee;
<li>	you have no access to information concerning the investment program of the Altamira Funds or of any of our clients; or
<li>	the likelihood of a conflict of interest arising is minimal because of the nature of the security and the impact of Altamira on the market (for example, a security with a large public float in which any activity by Altamira is likely to have a minimal impact on the market price or a security which is not actively managed by Altamira such as a security which is traded by one of our international advisors)
Satisfaction of any of the above conditions will not necessarily be sufficient for clearance if there is a potential for a contravention of securities laws, a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.
</p>
<p>
<h4>2.3.2	Clearance Ordinarily Granted</h4>
<p>
Clearance will ordinarily be granted for
<p>
<li>	Trading where no direct or indirect beneficial interest. If you have a substantial measure of influence or control over an account, but neither you nor your family have any direct or indirect beneficial interest (e.g., a trust for which you are trustee but not a direct or indirect beneficiary).
<li>	Trading securities that are not Portfolio Securities. Any Portfolio Manager engaging in such a trade is required to justify to the Trading and Ethics Committee prior to clearance being granted that the security is not an appropriate investment for one of the Altamira Funds or for one of the Altamira managed accounts.
</p>
<h4>2.3.3	Clearance Not Required</h4>
<p>
The following types of trading activities are permitted personal securities transactions and no prior clearance of the trade will be required, although a report of such trades must be included in the reports filed pursuant to Section 3 of the Rules (See Trade Reporting Requirements in Section 3 below):
</p>
<p>
<li>	Automatic dividend reinvestment plan acquisitions.
<li>	Purchases of open-end mutual funds, including any Altamira Funds.
<li>	Purchases of commodities, commodity futures, financial futures and options on commodity or financial futures.
<li>	Purchases of Government debt instruments and commercial paper.
<li>	Non-volitional transactions. This includes gifts or transactions over which you have no control over timing or corporate actions applicable to all security holders (such as splits, tender offers, mergers, stock dividends, etc.)
<li>	Fully Managed Investment Accounts. This includes transactions carried out on your behalf in a fully managed investment account in which your only input involves the selection of investment guidelines or parameters and does not include any discretion or control over the selection of specific investments.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3.	Trade Reporting Requirements</h2>
<p>
<h3>3.1	Quarterly Reports</h3>
<p>
Unless specifically exempted, all employees must file a quarterly report within five (5) calendar days following the end of a quarter disclosing all personal securities transactions, whether clearance was required or not. If no trading has taken place a "nil" report should be filed. The form of report is attached as Annex "D" hereto. Report forms will be circulated to all employees on the last day of the quarter and when completed should be sent to Peter Rizakos. All reports will be reviewed in a confidential manner.
Information involving transactions in Altamira Mutual Funds will not be required to be included in the quarterly reports.
</p>
<p>
<h3>3.2	Opening accounts with outside Brokers</h3>
<p>
<li>	Altamira consent required
While all employees are encouraged to carry out personal securities transactions through AIS Securities, it is recognized that outside accounts may be required to be maintained by employees.
Obligations imposed by regulatory authorities require that prior approval be obtained by you from Altamira for the opening of outside accounts over which you have authority or control. This would include accounts held jointly, in nominee names or in the names of family members. You are also required to disclose the existence of such accounts already in place.
</p>
<p>
<li>	Direction to outside brokers to forward statements to Altamira
Altamira also requires that you direct your outside brokers to forward a statement of trading activity in all outside accounts to Altamira. The form of direction is set out in Annex "E" hereto and a letter in this form and should be provided to the broker at the time the outside account is opened or should be sent to the broker as soon as possible if the account has already been opened.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4.	Other Restricted Activity</h2>
<p>
In addition to the rules governing the clearance and reporting of personal securities transactions, there are other activities that may involve a conflict of interest with our clients or may be contrary to law. This is not an exhaustive list, and should you have any question about the propriety of any situation you should review it with Peter Rizakos or with any other member of the Trading and Ethics Committee.
<p>
<h3>4.1	Trading with Inside Information.</h3>
<p>
Persons in a "special relationship" with an issuer are subject to the insider trading provisions in the Act and are prohibited from trading in the securities of the issuer with knowledge of a "material fact" or "material change" that has not been generally disclosed. Such persons are also prohibited from tipping others as to an undisclosed material fact or change. The terms "material change" and "material fact" refer to changes or facts concerning the issuer that would reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or the value of the securities
<p>
<li>	Altamira Mutual Funds. As an employee of Altamira with access to material information concerning the Altamira Mutual Funds, you would be in a "special relationship" to any of the Altamira Mutual Funds. You are restricted from trading in the units of the Funds with knowledge of a material fact or change that has not been generally disclosed and from informing others of this information, except in the normal course of business. This restriction will generally extend to family members and any company or trust over which you or your family members exercise control.
	What would constitute a "material change" or "material fact" with to the respect to the Funds can not be precisely determined, but could include such matters as a change in the portfolio manager, significant changes in operations or to the investment strategy of a particular Fund.
<p>
<li>	Other Issuers. If in your particular capacity at Altamira, you are informed of a "material change" or "material fact" concerning another issuer, you will likely be placed in a "special relationship" with that issuer and subject to the restrictions discussed above with respect to trading or tipping prior to such information becoming generally known. A "material change" or "material fact" could include a decision to issue or redeem securities, to enter into a significant business transaction, to introduce a new product, significant management changes and any other change or fact that is reasonably expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the securities.
<p>
<h3>4.2	Disclosure of Personal Trades.</h3>
<p>
This is the practice of placing a general order with a brokerage and disclosing after the fact that a portion of the trade is for a personal account. This practice can create a clear conflict of interest and lead to abuse. All personal trades shall be disclosed at the time the trade is placed with the broker. It shall not be permissible to use an Altamira trading account for the purpose of completing a trade and to then allocate the trade to a personal account. Securities acquired or sold without this necessary disclosure or placed in an Altamira account will not be permitted to be allocated to a personal account.
<p>
<h3>4.3	Accepting Gifts and Other Sensitive Payments.</h3>
<p>
Employees should not seek, accept or offer any gifts or favors of material value or any preferential treatment in dealing with any client, broker/dealer, financial institution or any other organization with whom Altamira transacts business. Extreme caution is to be exercised in any instance in which business related travel and lodgings are paid for other than by our firm. Participation in lunches, dinners, cocktail parties, sporting activities or similar gatherings for business purposes are not prohibited. However, in keeping with the intent of these Rules, it is extremely important that even the appearance of a possible conflict of interest is to be avoided.
<p>
<h3>4.4	Use of Confidential Information.</h3>
<p>
You are not permitted to disclose confidential information concerning Altamira to persons outside the organization, except in the ordinary course of business, and you are not permitted to use this information for personal gain or in a manner that may conflict with the interests of a client. For this purpose confidential information includes, but is not limited to, information concerning the trading program of a portfolio, the securities contained in the portfolio, and information provided to Altamira by a client relative to the investment strategy of that client.
<p>
<h3>4.5	Outside Activities.</h3>
<p>
All outside relationships such as directorships or trusteeships of any kind or membership in investment organizations (e.g., an investment club) should be discussed with Ron Meade prior to acceptance of such position.
As a general matter, directorships in unaffiliated public companies or companies which may reasonably be expected to become public companies will not be authorized because of the potential conflicts which may impede our freedom to act in the best interests of clients.
<p>
<h3>4.6	CFA Code of Conduct.</h3>
<p>
Nothing in these rules shall in any way derogate or limit the applicability of the professional rules of conduct applicable to CFA's and all CFA's are expected to adhere to such rules in addition to the Personal Trading and Conduct Rules.
<p>
<h2>5.	Condition of Employment</h2>
<p>
Adherence to the Rules is considered a condition of your employment with Altamira. The Trading and Ethics Committee has been established to monitor compliance with the Rules and to review such violations of the Rules as may occur and to determine what action or sanctions are appropriate in the event of a violation.
Employees must recognize that a violation of the Rules may result, at minimum, in immediate dismissal.
<p>
<h2>6.	The Trading and Ethics Committee.</h2>
<p>
The Trading and Ethics Committee is empowered with the responsibility of enforcing the Rules. The Committee will meet on a quarterly basis to review compliance with the Rules. All violations are to be documented by the Committee. The results of the quarterly review and any violations will be reported to senior management of Altamira.
Altamira emphasizes the importance of obtaining prior clearance and reporting of all personal securities transactions in accordance with these Rules and the avoidance of situations which might involve a real or apparent conflict of interest.
Questions regarding interpretation of these Rules or questions related to specific situations should be directed to any member of the Trading and Ethics Committee.

<h3>Friday January 10,  1997</h3>
<p>

<h2>Bills, Bonds and Currencies:</h2>
Canadian Treasury Bill yields are at the following levels this morning:  3 month Bills at 2.92%, 6 month Bills at 3.32% and 1 year Bills at 3.80%.  Canadian bonds rose yesterday with the Canadian benchmark 30 year bond climbing C$0.55, which pushed the yield down to 7.34%.  Canadas unemployment rate for the month of December fell to 9.7% down from Novembers 10% level.  Yesterday in the US, the producer price index (PPI) indicated that inflation was moderate.  Federal Reserve officials commented that  interest rates may remain stable in the near term.  This morning, the US unemployment data was released for the month of December.  The report showed hourly earnings rising 0.5% month over month, while the US economy added 262,000 new jobs - expectations were for 200,000.  Average weekly hours worked also rose in December to 34.8, up from Novembers 34.5.  In currencies, the Canadian dollar is currently at 1.3522 versus the US dollar, the Japanese yen is at 115.38 against the US dollar, and the German mark is at 1.5771 versus the US dollar.

<h2>North American Equities:</h2>  
Yesterday, the TSE 300 gained 30 points or 0.50%.  Gold issues helped the TSE climb higher as the price of gold bounced, and fears of European central banks gold selling eased.  Yesterday showed a rotation into the cyclical, resource stocks such as gold and oil issues, and away from interest sensitive stocks like the banks.  Russian President Boris Yeltsins health is deteriorating.  Russia is one of the worlds largest oil producers and with cold weather expected for much of North America there is speculation that the price of oil could see higher ground.  Yesterday in the US, the DJIA gained 76 points or 1.16%, the S&P 500 rose 6 points or 0.86%, the Nasdaq composite rose 6 points or 0.44% and the Russell 2000 small companies index was up 1.4 points or 0.39%.  The Russell 2000 index set a new record yesterday, its first since May 1996 - the index now stands at 365.59.

<h2>Foreign Equities:</h2>
Overnight, the Japanese market plummeted, the Nikkei 225 index fell 770 points or 4.26%.  Bank stocks were sharply lower mainly because the Japanese banks own many shares in the stock market.  The Japanese stock market has dropped 10% in one week, once again sparking fears that the banking system is in dire straits.  With bad loans reaching an estimated 30 trillion yen, and the government showing little signs of positive stimulation,  there is a lot of pessimism amongst investors. Overnight in other Asian markets, Hong Kong was down 6 points or 0.05%. South Korea posted a gain of 1.38%.  In Korea, the focus will be on the labour strikes next week.  Many union officials commented that strikes will intensify next week, even though the strikes were declared illegal and some arrest warrants have been issued.  Unlike in other countries, workers in Korea do not receive any payments during strikes.  This increases the likelihood that the strikes will not last long.   In Europe at midday, UK is down 0.45%, France is down 0.22% and Germany is up 1.41%.  Yesterday in Latin America, Argentina was up 1.14%, Mexico was up 0.57%, and Brazil was up 0.37%.

	<h3>Highlight of the Day</h3>
	<p>
	<h3>Friday, January 10,1997</h3>
	<p>
	<h4>Main Story:</h4><p>




<p>


Investors were eagerly awaiting todays non-farm payroll data in the U.S. to get a feel for the rate of growth in the economy and the possible direction of interest rates.  If the economy is expanding too quickly, there is a fear that inflation will quicken, forcing the Fed to increase interest rates.  Expectations were for 200,000 new jobs to have been added to the economy for the month of December -  a number much higher or lower would have significant implications on the market.  The non-farm payroll number was released at 262,000 - bonds and stocks quickly moved lower with the DJIA falling over 60 points just minutes after the opening bell.  The unemployment rate in the U.S. remained unchanged at 5.3% and hourly earnings also rose 0.5%.  These reports confirmed to investors that the economy is expanding.  The DJIA finished the day up 78.12 points or 1.18%, however, as investors appear oblivious to the threat of rising rates and are more focus on better corporate earnings expectations now.  This is a new closing high for the Dow at 6703.79.  With the economy adding so many jobs, investors are optimistic that earnings will not be disappointing.  Interest sensitive issues such as bank shares, whose profits are affected by rising rates, were most affected.  Cyclicals on the other hand performed better on the day as earnings for these companies are expected to fare better in times of economic expansion.  In times of rising rates, cyclicals generally perform better than interest-sensitive issues.  The TSE 300 rose 25.54 as investors are positive that an expanding Canadian economy will be good for corporate profits.  Cyclical issues were strong on the day following a report that showed that Canadas unemployment rate dropped to 9.7% in December from Novembers 10.00% level.  The S&P 500 rose 4.59 points and the Nasdaq Composite index overcame a 14 point deficit to finish the day up 5.81 points.

	<H1>Our Investment Management Team</H1>
	</center>

<P>One of the most important assets of any investment manager is its management
team:  the individuals who manage and guide the success of each portfolio.
At Altamira we are always looking to strengthen and develop our team and ensure
they have the right resources available to do their jobs.</P>

<P>Although each of our portfolio managers is individually responsible for the portfolio
he or she manages, there is a constant sharing of ideas and insights among the team.
Our long-standing success is dependant on this ideas driven environment, with 
investment managers from all disciplines being constantly encouraged to participate
with their views and opinions.</P>

<P>Where we do not have management expertise we have looked beyond Canada's borders
and retained globally renowned managers to advise us, such as 
<A HREF="#Wellington">Wellington Management</A> Company based in Boston, 
<A HREF="#Banque">Banque Pictet</A> in Europe, and<br>
<A HREF="#State">State Street Global Advisors</A>.</P>
 

<P>We would like to take the rest of this page to introduce you to our team.</P>

with significant equity participation in the firm.  As such, they are individually
committed to the company's success.  Collectively, they represent a pool of talent
that is unique in the Canadian financial services industry.</P>

<h2>ALTAMIRACLES..</h2>
<P>
The Altamira Foundation invests in the most precious and critical future resource with which Canada is blessed-young people.

</p>
<p>
<li>Preventing child abuse and suffering

<li>Promotion of safe and healthy communities
</p>
<p>
The foundation is a registered charity in the province of Ontario, Canada. Altamira Management Ltd. contributes 1% of our pre-tax profit to the Altamira Foundation. It was founded to balance our view that governments should be more fiscally responsible and reduce deficits.
</p>

<p>
<li>Organizations which discriminate in their activities on the basis of religion,colour,nationality,gender,race or creed.
<li>Government agencies and organizations

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve long-term capital growth.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The fund invests in a broadly diversified portfolio of
common and preferred shares of established companies
with proven marketability and growth, while having 
regard for the protection of its investors' capital.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>General risk factors such as that the value of common
stocks is subject to a number of general economic and 
financial market conditions including the level of 
interest rates, stock market trends, corporate earnings
trends, and other factors.  In general, stock prices are
among the most volatile over short time periods, making
mutual funds that invite in them best suited for those 
who are prepared to make a longer term investment.  
Each of the Growth Funds will fluctuate in value and 
your investment may be worth more or less than your 
original cost when you redeem your units of a fund. These
Funds do not place any emphasis on dividend or interest
income but may make temporary investments in high quality 
fixed income securities when, in the judgment of the
investment managers, economic or market conditions warrant.
Each Canadian Growth fund may hold foreign securities 
within the limits set out in the Income Tax Act (Canada) 
(the "Tax Act") for registered investments.

<DD><PERSON>David Taylor</PERSON> MBA, CFA,
7 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>2.28%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To provide investors with superior investment
returns over the long-term, having regard to safety of capital by
investing primarily in Canadian equity securities.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund emphasizes securities of companies that have a 
significant business presence in Western Canada.  It is expected
that investment returns will be derived primarily from capital
appreciation.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>The portfolio of the Fund is invested primarily in Western
Canada and the performance of the Fund is therefore to a
large extent dependent on the economic well-being of one 
geographic area of Canada.  The economy of Western Canada 
at this time is primarily resource-based and therefore to 
a large extent sensitive to commodity prices.

<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>David Taylor</PERSON> M.B.A., C.F.A,
7 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>2.36%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve capital growth.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund's objective is attained through a 
flexible policy of investing in securities 
of companies engaged in natural resource 
industries (such as mining, oil and gas, 
forest products, water resources and fishing
and industries supportive of companies engaged
in natural resources) with a primary emphasis 
on equity securities of Canadian companies. 

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>The market value of the investment portfolio of
the Fund will fluctuate with the world price of
energy and resource commodities.  The price of
some of these commodities can fluctuate 
substantially over short periods.  The success of
some of the companies in the Fund will depend on
their ability to successfully explore for energy
and natural resource products.  This Fund should
be regarded as a highly specialized investment 
suitable as part of a diversified portfolio.

<DL>
<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>David Taylor</PERSON> M.B.A., C.F.A,
7 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>2.37%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To generate capital appreciation, primarily
through investment in North American securities
believed to be undervalued due to prevailing
economic conditions.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund may invest in fixed income securities
as well as equity securities.  The investment 
manager has the sole discretion to determine 
the Fund's asset mix and may hold large cash 
positions at any given time.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>The Fund's investment strategy involves a high 
degree of risk.  The Fund will invest in equity 
securities of companies whose fortunes have been 
adversely affected by economic conditions and as
a result there may be limited liquidity for some 
of these holdings.  Because of the distressed 
nature of many of these securities, the Fund is 
only suitable for long-term aggressive investors. 
The Fund also invests in below investment grade 
bonds including securities in default.  The ability
of such bonds to repay principal and interest is 
predominantly speculative and there is a limited 
market for such bonds.  The nature of the Fund's 
portfolio may result in substantial short-term 
fluctuations in net asset value.  This Fund should 
be regarded as a highly specialized investment 
suitable as part of a diversified portfolio.

<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Frank Mersch</PERSON> B. Comm, C.F.A.,
18 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>New Fund

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve long-term growth through investment
primarily in securities of companies or 
securities whose value is dependent upon the
value of gold, silver, platinum and palladium
("Precious Metals") or strategic metals 
(such as rhodium, titanium, chromium, cobalt and
iridium) or strategic minerals, or diamonds. 

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund's assets may be invested in equities
or other securities of Canadian and foreign 
issuers engaged directly or indirectly in the 
exploration for, or the mining, production, or 
distribution of Precious Metals or strategic 
metals or minerals, or diamonds.  The Fund's 
assets may also be invested through purchases 
of Precious Metals in the form of bullion, coins
or certificates and other evidences of such purchases.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>Investment in Precious Metals present risks
because the price of these commodities can 
fluctuate substantially over short periods of
time with the result that unit value can fluctuate
substantially.  Prices can be affected by 
unpredictable international monetary and political
policies.  The price of companies doing business in
Precious Metals, strategic metals or minerals and
diamonds can fluctuate even more dramatically than 
the price of these commodities.  The success of some
of the companies the Fund will invest in will depend
on their ability to successfully explore for the
aforementioned commodities.  Precious Metals are
traded in U.S. dollars, earn no income and must be
traded to realize gains.

<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Marie-Claude Bernal</PERSON> (Wellington Management),
M.B.A., C.F.A., 14 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>20%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>2.00%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To provide investors with growth through both
capital appreciation of, and income generated 
by, the portfolio while stressing capital 
preservation.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund is an actively managed mix of
international stocks, bonds and short-term 
securities.  The investment manager has the 
sole discretion to determine the Fund's asset
mix.  Based on the investment manager's assessment
of prevailing market conditions, the Fund may be
invested in all asset classes or may be 100% 
invested in any one asset class.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>General foreign investment risk factors.  
Investments in foreign securities may involve
unique risks not typically associated with 
investing in Canada.  The Funds may be affected
by fluctuations in currency conversion. 
Information about foreign corporations may 
not be complete, may not reflect the extensive
accounting or auditing standards or have been
subject to the same level of government 
supervision or regulation as would have been
the case in Canada.  Some foreign securities
markets may be volatile or lack liquidity.  In 
some countries, investments could be affected by
political instability, social instability, 
expropriation or confiscatory taxation.

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B>

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve long-term capital growth through
investment in a portfolio of equity securities
of companies located (or that have their principal
business activities) in Asia or the Pacific Rim Region.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund may invest in any or all of the countries
in the Region, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, 
Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, 
Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and 
the Republic of China.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>Because of the nature of the Fund, price fluctuations 
could be substantial.  Some of the companies in which 
the Fund invests are based in emerging countries.  These 
investments may involve greater risks since such companies 
are often relatively small without lengthy operating 
histories and tend to have limited products, market and 
financial resources.  Securities of companies based in 
some Asian market countries can trade less frequently 
than comparable companies in North America and may be 
subject to erratic or abrupt price movements.  These 
markets tend to be less liquid than comparable markets 
in the developed world.  To meet redemption requirements, 
the Fund may need to sell securities at a discount.

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>20%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>New Fund

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve long-term capital growth 
primarily through investment in securities
of Japanese issuers.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund will invest primarily in securities
of smaller and medium capitalization Japanese
companies.  Although the Fund can invest in any
type of equity or debt securities, it expects 
that equity securities will normally account 
for the majority of its investments.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>The unit values of the Fund will fluctuate with
changes in the Japanese market and the price of
individual securities held by the Fund.  The Fund
intends to invest a large percentage of its assets
in the securities of relatively small companies, 
some without lengthy operating histories.  Smaller
companies generally have limited product lines, 
market and financial resources and are therefore
more vulnerable to the adverse impact of competition
and market changes and product obsolescence.  Smaller
companies are often dependent on a limited number of
key individuals and can be adversely affected by the
loss of such individuals.  In addition, the marketability
of securities of smaller companies may be limited in that
they tend to be less liquid than larger companies.  
Many of these companies may be traded only in 
over-the-counter markets.  This Fund should be 
regarded as a highly specialized investment suitable
as part of a diversified portfolio.

<DL>
<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Robert Furdak</PERSON>, B.B.A., M.B.A., C.F.A., 8 
Years Investment Experience</b>

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>20%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>3.35%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve capital growth through investment in
securities of "emerging" countries.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund will invest primarily in securities in
countries which have low to middle per capita incomes
in relation to more developed countries such as Canada.
Although the Fund can invest in any type of equity or 
debt securities, it expects that equity securities will
normally account for the majority of the Fund's investments.
The Fund will invest primarily in (i)equity securities of 
companies, the principal securities trading market for 
which is an emerging county, and (ii)equity securities, 
traded in any market, of companies that derive significant
annual revenue from emerging countries.  The Fund will 
attempt to reduce volatility by diversifying its investments
throughout the developing world, to be achieved by investing
in different regions, countries and securities.

<DT><B>General Foreign Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>Investments in foreign securities may involve unique 
risks not typically associated with investing in 
Canada.  The Funds may be affected by fluctuations
in currency conversion. Information about foreign 
corporations may not be complete, may not reflect 
the extensive accounting or auditing standards or 
have been subject to the same level of government 
supervision or regulation as would have been the 
case in Canada.  Some foreign securities markets 
may be volatile or lack liquidity.  In some countries, 
investments could be affected by political instability,
social instability, expropriation or confiscatory taxation.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>Because of the nature of the Fund, price fluctuations
could be substantial.  The Fund invests in companies
based in emerging countries.  These investments may 
involve greater risks since such companies are often 
relatively small without lengthy operating histories 
and tend to have limited products, market and financial 
resources.  Securities of companies based in emerging
countries often trade less frequently than comparable 
companies in North America and may be subject to erratic
or abrupt price movements.  These markets tend to be 
less liquid than comparable markets in the developed 
world.  To meet redemption requirements, the Fund may
need to sell securities at a discount from market prices 
and during periods when such dispositions are not desirable.
This Fund should be regarded as a highly specialized 
investment suitable as part of a diversified portfolio.

15 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>20%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Annual 

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>New Fund

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To aggressively seek capital appreciation for
investors over the long term (5+ years).

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>To achieve its objectives, the fund will 
invest in global companies that exploit and
develop scientific and technology research.
The fund will endeavour to maximize returns
by investing in a diversified portfolio of
companies in the telecommunications, 
biotechnology, environmental technology,
health care, and computer industries.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>Because the fund is invested in a specific sector
of the economy and not diversified among different 
industry sectors, the funds unit price will be
volatile.</p>
<p>Scientific and technological progress can make
products and services offered by companies redundant
in a very short time, and therefore increase the 
risks of investing in companies involved in these 
areas. The success of these companies may depend on
the outcome of expensive research, and the benefits 
of this research may be only short term.</p>
<p>
The fund intends to invest in both established,
smaller and emerging companies on a global basis,
depending where our managers find the greatest potential.</P>

trends, and other factors.  In general, stock prices are
among the most volatile over short time periods, making
mutual funds that invite in them best suited for those 
who are prepared to make a longer term investment.  
Each of the Growth Funds will fluctuate in value and 
your investment may be worth more or less than your 
original cost when you redeem your units of a fund. These
Funds do not place any emphasis on dividend or interest
income but may make temporary investments in high quality 
fixed income securities when, in the judgment of the
investment managers, economic or market conditions warrant.
Each Canadian Growth fund may hold foreign securities 
within the limits set out in the Income Tax Act (Canada) 
(the "Tax Act") for registered investments.

<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Cedric Rabin</PERSON>, B.A., 30
Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Quarterly

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>1.41%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To produce current income for its investors, 
with moderate capital appreciation and volatility.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The fund invests its assets primarily in short-term
or long-term high yield fixed income securities such
as bonds and convertible securities but may from 
time to time invest in high dividend yielding equity
securities.

<DT><B>General Risks:</B>
<DD>The Growth & Income Funds may be appropriate for
you if you are seeking to balance current income 
with long term growth of capital.  Growth & Income 
Funds generally have higher price volatility than the 
Income Funds but should not normally be as volatile 
as the Growth Funds.  The performance of these Funds 
will be subject to the same general risk factors 
affecting the Income Funds and the Growth Funds.  
Growth & Income Funds may hold foreign securities 
within the limits set out in the Tax Act for registered 
investments.

<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Will Sutherland</PERSON> B. Comm, C.F.A.,
19 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Quarterly

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>1.00%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To achieve a reasonably high return 
(higher than that for five-year guaranteed 
investment certificate) and constant 
income for the investor.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund invests primarily in high quality
government and corporate bonds.  However,
investments may include equities in whatever
proportion the investment manager may decide.

<DT><B>General Risks:</B>
<DD>The Income Funds may be an appropriate investment for
you if you are prepared to accept some fluctuation in 
principal in order to earn a potentially higher level 
of interest income and potential capital gains than is
normally available for money-market type mutual funds. 
The market value of the securities in which these Funds
invest will fluctuate as the level of interest rates in
the marketplace changes and accordingly, the value of
your Units in these Funds will go up and down.  In 
general, as prevailing interest rates fall, the price
of fixed income securities such as bonds and mortgages
will rise.  When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed
income securities will fall.  In general, the longer the
maturity of a debt security, the higher its yield and the
greater its price variability.

In addition, in the case of Global Income Fund and Global
Bond Fund, the Funds will be affected by fluctuations 
in currency exchange rates against the Canadian dollar.
The Funds may use forward currency exchange contracts 
to hedge against changes in foreign currencies.  
Hedging against changes in currencies does not eliminate
fluctuations in the prices of the portfolio securities
or prevent losses if prices of such securities decline.
It may also preclude the opportunity for gain if the value
of the hedged currency should rise.

14 Years Investment Experience

<DD>New Fund

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To maximize income while simultaneously
preserving capital and liquidity.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund invests primarily in debt 
obligations issued or guaranteed by the
Canadian federal or provincial governments,
or any agency of such governments, or the 
federal government of the United States or any 
agency thereof.  The Fund will seek to manage 
interest rate risk by limiting the Fund's 
weighted average to maturity to three years.
The Fund will be actively traded to realize 
capital gains when available. 

<DT><B>General Risks:</B>
<DD>The Income Funds may be an appropriate investment for
you if you are prepared to accept some fluctuation in 
principal in order to earn a potentially higher level 
of interest income and potential capital gains than is
normally available for money-market type mutual funds. 
The market value of the securities in which these Funds
invest will fluctuate as the level of interest rates in
the marketplace changes and accordingly, the value of
your Units in these Funds will go up and down.  In 
general, as prevailing interest rates fall, the price
of fixed income securities such as bonds and mortgages
will rise.  When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed
income securities will fall.  In general, the longer the
maturity of a debt security, the higher its yield and the
greater its price variability.

In addition, in the case of Global Income Fund and Global
Bond Fund, the Funds will be affected by fluctuations 
in currency exchange rates against the Canadian dollar.
The Funds may use forward currency exchange contracts 
to hedge against changes in foreign currencies.  
Hedging against changes in currencies does not eliminate
fluctuations in the prices of the portfolio securities
or prevent losses if prices of such securities decline.
It may also preclude the opportunity for gain if the value
of the hedged currency should rise.

<DT><B>Portfolio Manager:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Robert Marcus</PERSON>,  B. Sc., 12 Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Quarterly

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>1.33%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To provide investors with superior investment returns 
over the long-term, having regard to safety of capital.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund invests primarily in Canadian Debt securities 
to obtain both interest income and capital appreciation, 
but can invest in high quality foreign currency-denominated 
debt obligations.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>General risk factors such as that the value of common
stocks is subject to a number of general economic and 
financial market conditions including the level of 
interest rates, stock market trends, corporate earnings
trends, and other factors.  In general, stock prices are
among the most volatile over short time periods, making
mutual funds that invite in them best suited for those 
who are prepared to make a longer term investment.  
Each of the Growth Funds will fluctuate in value and 
your investment may be worth more or less than your 
original cost when you redeem your units of a fund. These
Funds do not place any emphasis on dividend or interest
income but may make temporary investments in high quality 
fixed income securities when, in the judgment of the
investment managers, economic or market conditions warrant.
Each Canadian Growth fund may hold foreign securities 
within the limits set out in the Income Tax Act (Canada) 
(the "Tax Act") for registered investments.

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>New Fund

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To provide long term investors with income and
capital growth.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>To achieve its objective, the fund will invest primarily
in debt instruments, including convertible securities and
preferred shares. The majority of the fund's assets will
be invested in lower quality debt instruments issued by 
domestic and foreign corporations, and those issued or 
guaranteed by the governments of developing countries. 
The fund may hold Canadian or U.S Treasury Bills from 
time to time for liquidity purposes. The fund will 
emphasize debt instruments issued in U.S dollars or in 
currencies of other industrialized countries.

<DT><B>Additional Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>The fund invests in lower quality debt instruments 
which may be considered speculative and present a 
substantial potential for a loss as well as gain. 
As a result the funds unit price could be volatile,
and the fund is suitable for long-term investors who 
are willing to assume a high degree of risk in order 
to maximize their returns. Lower quality debt securities,
sometimes referred to as junk bonds, are considered to be 
speculative and involve a greater risk of default on
interest and principal payments, or price changes due 
to interest rates going up or down, economic conditions 
and the issuer's credit worthiness. As a result, their 
market prices fluctuate more than higher quality debt 
securities.

<DT><B>Portfolio Managers:</B>
<DD><PERSON>Barry Allan</PERSON>, B.A., M.B.A., 13 
Years Investment Experience

<DT><B>RRSP Eligible:</B> 
<DD>100%

<DT><B>Distribution:</B> 
<DD>Quarterly

<DT><B>Management Expense Ratio:</B> 
<DD>1.84%

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To provide investors with income and long-term capital growth.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>
The Fund invests primarily in high quality fixed income
securities issued by Canadian issuers or certain 
international development agencies denominated in 
currencies of major industrialized nations.

<DT><B>General Risks:</B>
<DD>The Income Funds may be an appropriate investment for
you if you are prepared to accept some fluctuation 
in principal in order to earn a potentially higher 
level of interest income and potential capital gains 
than is normally available for money-market type mutual
funds.  The market value of the securities in which these
Funds invest will fluctuate as the level of interest rates
in the marketplace changes and accordingly, the value of 
your Units in these Funds will go up and down.  In general,
as prevailing interest rates fall, the price of fixed 
income securities such as bonds and mortgages will rise.
When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income 
securities will fall.  In general, the longer the maturity 
of a debt security, the higher its yield and the greater 
its price variability.
<P>In addition, in the case of Global Income Fund and Global
Bond Fund, the Funds will be affected by fluctuations in
currency exchange rates against the Canadian dollar.  
The Funds may use forward currency exchange contracts to 
hedge against changes in foreign currencies.  Hedging against
changes in currencies does not eliminate fluctuations in the
prices of the portfolio securities or prevent losses if 
prices of such securities decline.  It may also preclude 
the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency
should rise.</P>

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>To invest in a diversified basket of interest
bearing securities denominated in a variety of
currencies, thereby reducing the risk inherent
in holding securities denominated in only one
currency.

<DT><B>Investment Policy:</B>
<DD>The Fund invests primarily in securities regarded
as senior investment grade money market 
instruments of issuers located mainly in Canada,
including debt issued or guaranteed by a government,
obligations of banks and other financial institutions,
and high quality short-term corporate obligations.

<DT><B>General Risks:</B>
<DD>The Income Funds may be an appropriate investment for
you if you are prepared to accept some fluctuation in 
principal in order to earn a potentially higher level 
of interest income and potential capital gains than is
normally available for money-market type mutual funds. 
The market value of the securities in which these Funds
invest will fluctuate as the level of interest rates in
the marketplace changes and accordingly, the value of
your Units in these Funds will go up and down.  In 
general, as prevailing interest rates fall, the price
of fixed income securities such as bonds and mortgages
will rise.  When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed
income securities will fall.  In general, the longer the
maturity of a debt security, the higher its yield and the
greater its price variability.

<P>In addition, in the case of Global Income Fund and Global
Bond Fund, the Funds will be affected by fluctuations 
in currency exchange rates against the Canadian dollar.
The Funds may use forward currency exchange contracts 
to hedge against changes in foreign currencies.  
Hedging against changes in currencies does not eliminate
fluctuations in the prices of the portfolio securities
or prevent losses if prices of such securities decline.
It may also preclude the opportunity for gain if the value
of the hedged currency should rise. </P>

<p><H3>Todays CashPerformer rate is 2.50%.</h3></p>
<P>CashPerformer is a daily interest savings account with a bank or trust
 company available through Altamira. It is as safe as your own personal 
 savings account and may offer a higher rate of interest. You can use
 CashPerformer:

<UL>
<LI>as a place to deposit interest payments from other investments, such as
GICs. 
<LI>for savings that you would normally carry in a personal savings account. 
<LI>as a place to deposit money while you think about future investment
decisions.
</UL>
</P>

<P><H2>Here's how CashPerformer works:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>We make deposits on your behalf to a financial institution selected by us.
<LI>There is no minimum balance required, but your CashPerformer cannot be
  overdrawn. 
<LI>We calculate interest each day and pay interest monthly. 
<LI>The rate of interest is the financial institution's prime rate minus 2.25
  percent.
<LI>Your quarterly statement shows your CashPerformer balance, and you receive
  written confirmation of each deposit on withdrawal. 
<LI>You can withdraw money from your CashPerformer by giving us 24 hours notice.
<LI>There are no service charges for the use of CashPerformer, but we apply a
  NSF charge on any deposit cheques returned because there weren't sufficient
  funds in your account. Altamira performs certain administrative services
  with respect to Altamira CashPerformer on of the bank or trust company 
  and is compensated by the institution for these services. 
<LI>Your CashPerformer is treated in the same way as any deposit account 
opened directly with the financial institution. The Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce is a member of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and thus 
your CashPerformer qualifies for coverage provided by the rules and regulations
of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
</UL>

<P>GICs are issued by several financial institutions. Here's
how they work:
<UL>
<LI>We obtain the GICs on your behalf as agent and hold them in 
  your Altamira account.
<LI>We confirm the terms of your GIC in writing shortly after we receive
  your money.
<LI>GIC's are guaranteed by the issuing financial institution, not 
  Altamira. 
<LI>There is a $1000 minimum investment for GICs with one to five year terms.
<LI>There is a $5000 minimum for six month GICs or for those with monthly
 interest payments.
<LI>Amounts paid to you when the term of your GIC expires will be 
  deposited into your CashPerformer unless you instruct us otherwise.
<LI>If the GIC has a term of one year or more, we will notify you
  prior to the date the GIC matures.
<LI>GICs cannot be sold or transferred to someone else before they mature. 
</UL>
</P>

<H2 ALIGN=left>Interest</H2>

<UL>
<LI>You receive interest on your GIC at the rate set by the financial 
  institution on the day we receive your money.
<LI>You can tell us to deposit the interest either monthly or annually into
  your CashPerformer account, or have the interest compound annually.
<LI>If you chose to compound the interest, or if the term of your GIC is less
  than a year, your original investment plus interest will be deposited 
  into your CashPerformer when the GIC matures. 
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN=left>Fees and Service Charges</H2>

<UL>

<H3><A NAME="RRSP">Registered Retirement Savings Plan</A> (RRSP)</H3>

<P>An RRSP is the best way to save for your retirement while sheltering your
income from taxes. The money you save and the income it generates can be
left to grow tax free until you withdraw it from the plan. All 25 of our
mutual funds qualify for investment in an RRSP. Fifteen (15) of these funds
are 100% RRSP eligible while our nine (9) Global Growth Funds and one of
our Global Income Funds are classified as foreign property. You may only
hold up to 20% of the total book value of your RRSP portfolio in any
combination of our foreign funds.</P> 

<P>When you open your first Altamira account you pay a one time set up fee of
$40. Thereafter, you can open any number of other Altamira accounts
absolutely free. For RRSPs only, you must also pay an annual trustee fee of
$35 which is remitted to the trustee of your RRSP. Under Canadian income tax
laws, all RRSPs must be registered in the name of a trustee.</P>

<P>And if you wish to transfer your RRSP from another institution, we will do
all the necessary government-related paperwork , saving you valuable time.</P>


<H3><A NAME="Self">Self Directed RRSP</A></H3>

A <A HREF="/altamira/96/services/self.html">self directed RRSP</A>
allows you to take charge of your own RRSP portfolio.
You can hold a wide range of different mutual funds, stocks, bonds and other
eligible investments in one account. It is a convenient way of bringing all
your RRSP investments under one roof, giving you full control of your
retirement savings. We will execute and report all your transactions, as
well as provide you with periodic statements, research updates, newsletters,
market commentaries and timely information to support you investment decisions.

<H3><A NAME="RESP">Registered Educational Savings Plan (RESP)</A></H3>

<P>Our RESPs enable you to start planning now to ensure that your child or
grandchild have the opportunity to attend college or university. An RESP is
one of the best ways to save for higher education. Our RESPs allow you to
decide on how your money is invested and offer you the flexibility to make
lump sum or regular contributions, change the beneficiary of the plan, and
make withdrawals of your contributions at any time, without tax liability.
And you do not have to pay any commissions on your transactions, allowing
all your contributions to go to work for you immediately.</P>
 

<H3><A NAME="RRIF">Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)</A></H3>

<P>A RRIF is the ideal vehicle to control your retirement income while keeping
the proceeds from your RRSP sheltered from tax. With our RRIFs you are still
in full control of your investments and can decide how to invest your funds
and maintain the asset mix that is right for you.</P>   
 
<H3><A NAME="Group">Group RRSPs AND Group RESPs</A></H3>

<P>Altamira provides <A HREF="/altamira/96/services/group.html">Group RRSPs</A>

superior investment management skills and solid returns.</P>

<P>You can open three types of accounts with Altamira:<BR>

   <OL TYPE=i>
	<LI><A NAME="Investment"><B>an investment account</B></A> in which you can hold any of our mutual funds, 
	CashPerformer, and GICs. All gains made in this account are fully taxable.
	You have no restrictions or limitations as to the amount or type of investments 
	you can hold in an investment account.<BR>

	<LI><A NAME="Registered"><B>a registered account</B></A> in which you can hold any of our mutual funds, 
	CashPerformer, and GICs. However, you can only hold up to 20% of the total
	 book value of your investments in our foreign funds. As well, your gains in this
	account are sheltered from taxes until withdrawn. This type of account is used for 
	your RRSPs and to save for your retirement.<BR>

	<LI><A NAME="Intrust"><B>an in-trust-for account</B></A> is held by a person acting as trustee for
	another individual. This type of account is used for products like RESPs
	which allows you to save for your childrens education. The account
	registration will thus 	read "Jane Smith in trust for David Smith". The tax
	and investment guidelines are similar to that of an investment account.<BR>

<H1>HELPFUL INFORMATION</H1>
<h6><CENTER><IMG SRC="/altamira/icat/gifs/line_col.gif" ALT=""></CENTER></h6>
<H2><A NAME=H1>Retirement Income Tip</A></H2>
<I>Most people find that 60% to 80% of their current annual income
is necessary to maintain a comfortable retirement lifestyle.</I>
<p><A HREF=#Q1 >Go Back to Question 1: Retirement Income </A>
<h6><CENTER><IMG SRC="/altamira/icat/gifs/line_col.gif" ALT=""></CENTER></h6>
<H2><A NAME=H4>RRSP Income Tip</A></H2>
<I>Choose a value between 15% - 30% if you have a company pension and
50% - 65% if you do not.  Choose a higher percentage the more skeptical you 
are about the future availability of government pensions.
</I>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/altamira/icat/gifs/bs_chart.gif" width=100% ALT="rate of return (GIF)"></CENTER>
<p>
<I>If you are more aggressive with your investments, choose your return
accordingly.  A rate of 8% higher than inflation for the long term aggressive
investor is not out of the question.
</I>

<h6><CENTER><IMG SRC="/altamira/icat/gifs/line_col.gif" ALT=""></CENTER></h6>
<H2><A NAME=H6 >Inflation Tip</A></H2>
<I>Long term inflation in Canada has been approximately 5%. Our feeling is that
4% inflation is an appropriate level as the government is pursuing a long term
inflation reduction policy. </I>

<h6><CENTER><IMG SRC="/altamira/icat/gifs/line_col.gif" ALT=""></CENTER></h6>
<H2><A NAME=H7 >Rate of Return After Retirement</A></H2>
<I>Over the long term the most conservative investment types have been on average 4% higher than the inflation rate. During retirement our investments
are usually on the conservative side.  Your net after inflation return during retirement should probably be conservative.</I>

<H3>MORTGAGE TIPS </H3>

<UL>
<LI>When shopping for your mortgage, try your negotiating skills. Most lenders
are willing to offer mortgages at rates below those posted.
<LI>Where possible, consider increasing the frequency of your mortgage payment,
and prepaying a portion of the principal on the anniversary date. These two
options will help reduce the overall life of your mortgage.
<LI>Evaluate all aspects of your mortgage. The term is not the only
consideration. Look at whether the mortgage is transferable, and portable to
name a few.  Chose a mortgage that suits your needs, and  one that you are
comfortable with.

<DD>New Fund

<DT><B>Objective:</B>
<DD>The objective of this fund is to achieve long-term 
capital appreciation.

<DT><B>Investment Strategy:</B>
<DD>To meet its objectives, this fund will generally invest in
equities of companies with market capitalization of less than $2 billion.
The fund will primarily invest in more developed markets such as Canada,
the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Australia but may
also invest in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, 
Eastern Europe, and Africa. The fund may also from time to time 
invest in debt instruments issued by governments and corporations.

<DT><B>Risk Factors:</B>
<DD>The Fund will be influenced by global economic and political
factors and foreign stock market conditions generally in countries
where investments have been made. The fund will be affected by
changes in the exchange rate of currencies in which companies
are purchased relative to the Canadian dollar.
The companies thet the fund invests in are small. They may
have short operating histories and limited products,
markets, and financial resources making them more vulnerable
to changes in economic and market conditions. Small companies
can also suffer from loss of key employees and the
securities of these companies may be harder to sell than 
the securities of larger companies.

 bond yields. One basis point is one one hundredth of a percentage
 point i.e. 100 basis points = 1%.

<DT>Bear Market
<DD>A declining stock market over a prolonged period, usually lasting 
 at least six months and normally not more than 18 months. Usually

 depressed corporate profits.

 common stock with a record of continuous dividend payments and
 other desirable investment attributes.

 distributed to unitholders at least annually. Unitholders can also 
 earn capital gains by redeeming their units at higher prices than
 they originally paid.

 of goods and services is declining.

<DD>A term used to describe protective manoeuvering by an investment 
 manager. It is intended to reduce the risk of a loss from a 
 specified event; e.g., hedging a currency to protect against 
 detrimental currency movements that would reduce the portfolio
 return. In a currency hedge, for example, the fund manager who held
 Yen-denominated stock would buy the Canadian Dollar and sell the
 Yen exposure (through a forward exchange contract) if he/she
 favoured the outlook for the Canadian Dollar against the Yen. This
 in effect protects or "hedges" the currency, while maintaining the
 Japanese stock market exposure. 

<P><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=20% ALIGN=Center></P>

<DT>IPO
<DD>Initial Public Offering.

<DT>Index
<DD>A statistical yardstick tracking the ups and downs of a particular
 market by monitoring a certain group of securities over time. 

<DT>Inflation
<DD>Increases in the general price level of goods and services; i.e.,
 your dollar won't buy as much as it used to. Inflation is commonly
 reported using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a measure.
 Inflation is one of the major risks to investors over the long
 term as savings may actually buy less in the future if they are not
 invested with inflation as a consideration. 

<DT>Interest Rate Driven
<DD>Refers to a point in the business cycle when interest rates are
 declining and bond prices are rising. This is usually enough to 
 inspire a stock market rally as money shifts from interest rate 
 instruments to equity based instruments. (See Earnings Driven)

<DT>International Finance Corporation Investable Index (IFCI)
<DD>A benchmark against which portfolios invested in emerging markets 
 can be compared. "Investable" means it accounts for foreign 
 ownership restrictions that are in place in various countries. 

<DT>Inverted Yield Curve
<DD>A situation where short term interest rates are higher than long
 term rates. Normally, lenders earn higher yields when committing
 money for longer periods; this is a positive yield curve. Inverted 
 yield curves occur when surging demand for short term credit drives
 up short term rates. Usually a sign of increased inflation 
 accompanied by low levels of confidence in the economy. 
 Historically, this has preceded a recessionary period.

<P><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=20% ALIGN=Center></P>

<DT>Leveraging
<DD>A strategy that uses borrowed monies to purchase financial assets 
with the objective of increasing returns.

<DT>Liquidity

 concern for any monies that may be required on short notice,
 whether for emergencies or for planned purchases.

<DT>Management Fee
<DD>The fee paid to the manager for its services. Usually paid by the
 mutual fund itself, the management fee is generally stated as a
 percentage of the Net Asset Value of the fund.

<DT>Market weighted
<DD>When a portfolio sector- or stock- weighting matches the weighting 
 held by a market index, we say that the Fund is "market weighted"
 in that sector or stock. For example, at December 31, 1994, the 
 Equity Fund was "market weighted" in Financial Services, in

TORONTO-(October 29, 1996)--Manulife Financial today announced it is distributing an offer to purchase, at $32 per share, the outstanding shares of Altamira Management Ltd. currently held by Almiria Capital Corp., Altamira management and directors.

Commenting on the offer, Frank Mersch, Altamira's Vice President, Equities, said, "The reinvestment of the management group's cash into the funds means that we're going to be even more significant investors alongside our unitholders.

<h3>Managers Meeting</h3>

<h4><b>Chuck Bastyr, Manager</b></h4>

<b>Altamira Global Small Company Fund</b>
<br>Tuesday, October 15, 1996, 8:30 am</center>
<p>
<b>Chuck Bastyr:</b><br>	I am much more a value investor than a growth investor and I choose my stocks as a bottom up style. I really spend a lot of time on company attributes and there are three critical factors that I focus on.  <p>
The first thing I look at is valuation. I tend to like the low P/E, low priced, and high dividend yielding stocks.  What I am trying to do is find anomalies. If you search long and hard enough, sometimes you find anomalies out there where the local market misprices the securities.  In the equity markets in the short term it may be a different story, but in the longer term, value is the best way to go.  When you get multiple expansion, you can really pick up a lot of ground.<p>
The second thing I look at is probably the most important and that is the competitive position and management strength.  I visit 150 to 200 potential companies a year. I find out who runs the company, who owns it, and whether the owners are efficient.  If I can use a chess analogy, I would rather have a company that is going to checkmate its opponents rather than the other way around.  We are trying to find those companies that have a strong competitive position.  <p>
I have always liked small niche companies that do one or two things extremely well, operate in a well defined market niche and have very little competition.  These are the type of companies that, over the long haul, tend to produce above average returns.
It is very important to visit the company as well as visit their competitors.  We also visit some of the customers to get a feel for whether this company is a company you want to own.  This is especially important with small cap companies.  I spend a lot of time on the valuation in terms of command position and management.<p>
The last factor I look for is growth or recovery in earnings.  This is what really drives companies over the long haul.  To summarise, there are three critical variables I assess:  valuation, command position, and growth.  When you find all three of those together, you have found your anomaly.<p>
Right now, the fund is building up quite nicely for us to about $10 million.   I have not become fully invested yet and am probably only 50% to 60% invested.  This has actually helped because the Canadian dollar has picked up about 1% or 1.5% and the US dollar has risen as well versus the Yen and versus the European currencies. So having a decent cash portion has really helped us out.  Over time I plan to run the fund with a 5% to 10% cash position.<p>
In terms of geographic exposure, one of the goals of this fund was not to impinge on the funds that we already have at Altamira.  As a result, I have had no Canadian equities.  I am going to have a fairly small US weighting in the portfolio (less than 20%) and will pretty much be staying away from emerging markets.  I did, however, leave room to put about 10% of the fund in emerging markets where I see fit.  We have set a $2 billion US market capitalisation limit for average market cap and we are currently at about $1.4 billion.  The fund will be somewhere in the range of $1 billion and $2 billion.<p>
I am going to have a variety of companies.  You have strange categories for small caps in different markets.  In Japan, for example, the market cap is very high; so a small cap might be a US$5 billion company.  If you go to a small market like Finland or Norway, a US$2 billion dollar market cap company could be a large cap and one of the top ten stocks in that market.<p>
I will give you an idea of a few companies that we like or some of our largest weightings in the portfolio.  The largest weighting right now is a company called VAE in Austria.  It is a rail equipment provider with specialised products.  It also makes hot box detectors to see if axles are overheating on trains.  It is very much a niche company and it is picking up a tremendous market share.  The management is focused and they have very little competition.<p>
This company is very cheap.  It is going to be growing extremely quickly in the next five years.  It has a great market position and a very focused management. I think this stock has the potential to double over the next couple of years.  Several Austrian analysts have said that this is the top pick in the Austrian market.  They cannot believe how low it is.<p>
The Global Small Company Fund might be a bit slow to start but it is not going to be a real hot flyer, at least initially.  Stocks that I put in the portfolio have to germinate.  These companies have a story although they do not get a lot of press.  However, when they come out with their annual results or financial statements or announce a joint venture, then they tend to rise significantly.  So basically, you plant a seed and you just have to let it grow.  You never know when these things are going to take off but when they do, they can be really significant.<p>
I tend not to buy turnaround companies because they are very difficult to get right.   However, our second largest position is a turnaround company called Burns Philip & Company Ltd..  It is in Australia and the company does two things -- one that they do extremely well and one they do extremely poorly.  <p>
The thing that has really crushed them has been their spice business.  They are the number 2 spice company in the world after McCormicks.  This company basically went head to head with McCormicks and McCormicks won.  Though spices do have value and the price war appears to be over, Burns Philip is still feeling the effects which is why the stock has come down so far.  <p>
Burns Philip is also in the yeast business.  They are the number 1 producer of yeast in the world.  There are about 5 to 6 billion people in the world today and only about 2 million eat bread.  Right now, Burns Philip is the only company selling yeast into China and India.  The two countries combined have about 2 billion people and very few of them eat bread. They have the best product and the best network.  It is a fabulous part of the business.  <p>
Another stock that I like is a company called ICB Shipping.  I have liked the shipping industry for about three or four years.  I think I am going to be accused of crying wolf, but the shipping industry is perceived to be a no-growth industry.  Why would anyone invest in a no-growth industry?  Shipping is a twenty year cycle and out of every twenty years, you probably have two good years where the industry booms.  The industry started in the mid 70s right after the middle east crisis in oil, the shock of 72, or 74.  The supertankers were being built at a rapid rate to transport oil from the middle east to the rest of the world.  <p>
There was tremendous over-building of tankers because it was relatively cheap.  If you bought a new tanker and took two round trip voyages from the middle east, it was paid for. It was a tremendous return on your investment and as a result, people went way overboard and built so many tankers that they had 50% over capacity.  The effects of this overbuilding would have to wash through the system over the 20 year cycle.  <p>
Day rates have been very low for the last ten years.  If you look at the industry, no one is building because there is no return on investment.  The average rate to charter a tanker right now is about $30,000 a day.  To build a new tanker and to get a return on investment, you have to make at least $40,000 a day.  <p>
In these long term capital goods stories, there must be a catalyst for rates to go up.  The reason that the building occurred in the 70s was that on an inflation adjusted basis you were getting $200,000 a day to run a tanker versus $30,000 today, a factor of 6.5.  I am not saying that rates are going to go back to that level but they will certainly go over $40,000 a day.  Otherwise, we will not have a fleet capable of transporting oil into the next decade.  <p>
Right now the fleet averages about 18 years of age.  These tankers are single hulled, and they have got sulphur which eats the steel from the inside and the ocean water from the outside.   As these ships become old and neglected, they start getting thinner and thinner.  We saw one of these huge ULCCs (Ultra Large Crew Carrier) steaming in the North Sea last year which burst because the steel was so thin.   A lot of oil was lost off the coast of Scotland.<p>
A lot of these tankers are unsafe because rates are very low and maintenance is expensive.  The state of most of the fleet is very poor and a two tiered market is developing.  People are willing to pay for quality.  They do not want to take on the potential liabilities of these huge oil spills.<p>
I like the industry and the last time I saw something like this was back in 1991 with the oil rig market in Norway.  Day rates did not justify building new rigs.  The rigs surplus was very low and there was a lot of oil drilling going on.  And these stocks went up anywhere between 4 and 8 times in a year or two after that.  Its the same type of situation. I like the tanker business. I think it is due for a positive move upward here and it is all small cap stocks.<p>  Those are the themes that I like.  We are going to have a lot of long term positions here because they are great companies that can do very well when they get recognised.  
This fund is not going to move broadly when the markets move broadly.  I believe it is going to be a case of individual stocks coming to the forefront.  The markets are very buoyant and what tends to happen, at least in these international markets, is the blue chips get the first focus.  Once valuations start getting extreme on the blue chip stocks, investors start moving down the market capitalisation scale trying to find something better and cheaper.  So when you see the markets up big overseas it does not necessarily mean we are going to be up as well, just because of this lag effect in the markets.<p><p>

<strong>Question:</strong><br>	Do you have a target for the number of specific stocks you will hold in the portfolio?<br>

Probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of 40 to 50.<p>

<strong>Question:</strong><br>	What is you country allocation going to look like?<br>

It is going to be anywhere from 10% to 20% US, probably 60% to 70% in Europe, and then the residual is going to be Asia, Japan, Latin America.  And we are probably going to invest in some emerging markets.  I was in Israel last week.  There are some tremendous technology companies there that are very interesting.  I was in Hungary and they fit the small cap criteria.  What we want to do is get a consistent fund.  For now we will just keep this fund fairly stable with an upward bias.  
I am looking at this fund as more of a marathon runner.  It is not a sprinter.  We are going to move along nicely.  One thing is for sure, I am going to be investing as much of my own money into this fund as I can.  I am a very strong believer that you have to put your money where you mouth is and if the fund disappoints investors, I want to be the most disappointed person.<p>

<h2>Manager Commentary  November 1996</h2>

<h3>Managers Meeting</h3>
<h4><b>David Taylor, Manager<br>
The North American Recovery Fund<br>
The Resource Fund<br>
The AltaFund</b></h4>


Tuesday, October 22, 1996, 8:30 am</center>
<p>
<h3><strong>The North American Recovery Fund </strong></h3>
<p>
This is a high volatility portfolio.  There is absolutely no correlation to the TSE on a daily basis.  The TSE could be down 100 points and this fund could be up 1% because there are no proper sector weightings.  It is all stock specific.
<p>
I wanted to spend time looking at companies outside the resource sector.  I wanted investors to be able to buy something that was a little bit different and that is exactly what the Recovery Fund is.  The fund is looking for turnaround situations, which may be high risk companies that either work or dont work.  If they do not work, then hopefully, the worst case scenario is a 20% downside because of their book value and cash flow support.  If they do work, these companies can go up 3, 4, 5 times.  If I do my job well, this fund could be at the top of the first quartile and obviously that is where I am shooting.  It is the most liquid Canadian equity fund at Altamira.  I can get in and get out very quickly.  There are no penny stocks in the Fund and I have put a lot of my own money into it.
<p>
<h3><strong> The Resource Fund </strong></h3>
<p>
There are two main points I would like to stress.  Ive been saying that the junior gold sectors bubble would burst. The valuation of the junior golds concern me.  For the first six months of the year precious metal funds were far better than most resource funds.  They had done significantly better and now we are seeing a narrowing of the gap. The average precious metal fund was up 80%.  The average resource fund was up 20 - 25%.  Recently the precious metal funds have significantly underperformed broader based resource funds.
<p>
I would also like to mention that while resource funds as a category have done well, the resource sectors have not outperformed the TSE 300.  That is the most important thing that you should tell any client who owns the Resource Fund or any resource fund.  The TSE is up 18% so far year to date.  Only the oil sector has outperformed the TSE 300.  The base metals, the gold, and the mining sectors have underperformed the TSE 300.  If you put them all together  and weighted them appropriately, the resource sectors have underperformed the TSE 300.  So we have not even seen the move we are looking for. 
 <p>
We are seeing what you typically see in the last stage of a resource boom in an economic cycle.  If you believe in an economic cycle which usually lasts seven years, and if you think you are in the last 2 or 3 years, then the paper and forest, the oils, and the gold stocks always outperform the interest sensitives. The interest sensitive sectors include the banks, the pipelines, and the telecommunications.  Resource stocks will also beat industrial products companies.  We have not seen that yet but the stage is set.
<p>
While the Resource Fund has done well, it has not done great yet.  I do not think it has done as well as it can because most importantly the sectors have not outperformed the TSE 300 and the commodities have not moved.  If you think about it, the only commodity that has moved is oil.  Not gas.  Gas is basically unchanged.  Base metals are down 33% in price since the beginning of 1995.  They have been a disappointment and gold has not moved. The Altamira Resource Fund is built for five year performance.  It is not going to be a one year wonder.  The objective of the Fund is to beat the TSE by a wide margin over a five year period.  The stocks I am buying are long term, value stocks that are growing based on strong exploration but supported by cash flow, book value and reserve growth.  That is most important to me.  I think the Resource Fund is a long term hold in any portfolio.  It is something that you should always be in as far as I am concerned.  Canada is resource based and this fund should outperform the TSE 300 over a five and ten year basis.
<p>
Going through the sectors, I am still significantly underweight in the forest products and that has been a good decision so far.  I thought that we would see a turnaround and in the beginning of 1996, I was overweight in this area.  Since the fundamentals looked bad and the prices continued to fall, I sold them out and thank goodness because this has been the worst performing sub index of 1996 -- the weighting is about 5% right now.  <p>
I think in 1997 lumber stocks will be the turnaround sector.  Prices have bottomed and they are starting to turn.  Newsprint prices are still falling.  Lightweight coated fine paper prices have bottomed and they are also starting to turn.  Lumber prices are high but the stocks are dirt cheap.  It does not matter how cheap a stock is, if the commodity is going against you then the stock will not go up.  We have a combination of two things which will help demand.  We have a strong world economy which looks like it will be stronger in 1997 than it is in 1996 and we have a turning commodity scenario.  Once I am convinced that newsprint has bottomed and pulp has bottomed, then I am going to shift out of the oils, where I have got a triple overweight, and move into the paper and forest stocks.  That will happened some time soon, maybe the first quarter of 1997, maybe the fourth quarter this year. 
<p> 
In the middle of 1996, I have had a significant underweight in base metals. I have a small weight in Noranda and Falconbridge but the rest are juniors.  The most important aspect in those stocks is the trend in commodity prices:  copper, nickel, aluminium, zinc. The prices we saw in the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996, were low for all basic commodities and I thought that around the end of 1996, we would see a spiking in commodities.  To get a spike, you need a shortfall.  You need demand in any time period to exceed supply such that inventories reach a critical level.   In 1995, demand and supply basically were in line with each other.  The inventories were near the critical level but never crossed.  While they did not get worse, they did not get better.  
<p>
The reason for this was the economies in Europe, which really drive a lot of the demand for base metals, did not do as well as the economists thought.  In Germany, the GDP numbers in the beginning of 1995 and the estimates for 1996 were 3 to 3 1/2 %.  I think now they are closer to 2%.  The intensity of use for base metals in Europe for 1996 appears to be a lot less than what they thought they were going to be versus 1995.  It does look like 1997 is going to be higher than 1996 if the economies are strong and inventories are level, I think this is going to be a great area of growth.  So, all said, I have begun in the last week to increase the base metal weight.  
<p>
The consensus on the oil sector (youve always got to know the consensus because the consensus is usually wrong) was once Iraq came on, oil prices would fall.  Well the funny thing was for those who remember, once Iraq came on, oil prices went up.  The world needed Iraqi oil.  Oil is now around US$26.00.  In Canadian dollars, oil is $32 or $33 a barrel.  A year ago these companies were getting $22 a barrel.  My oil weighting is about 35% to 45% in the Resource Fund and the AltaFund is very similar to that.  
<p>
I am not going to call gold prices.  There are too many unknowns.  The central bank selling is just something that you cannot pinpoint.  It is as simple as that.  All the fundamentals are in place.  Again, I am buying companies that have production growth.  The biggest weightings are companies like Detrol Gold, TVX Gold, Gretz out of Australia, Eldorado, Triton Mining, the young companies that do not need higher commodity prices.  That is what we will continue to do.  We do not need higher gold prices to justify buying these gold stocks.
<p>

<h3><strong> The AltaFund </strong></h3>
<p>
I have a big cash weighting in the AltaFund.  So, I have spent quite a bit of money in the last little while buying Canadian Occidental.  That is now a 5% weighting in the Fund.  It is a cheap stock so I will have a big weighting.  I am now increasing the base metal weighting so you will see some new stocks show up in the AltaFund.  There are a couple of interesting western Canadian based industrial products companies that I am looking at now that you will see in the portfolio.

<h2>Manager Commentary  November 1996</h2>
<h3>Managers Meeting</h3>
<p><h4><b>Susan Coleman, Manager</b>
<br>
<b>The Special Growth Fund</b></h4>
Thursday, October 24, 1996, 8:30 am</center>
<p>
<b>Susan Coleman:</b><br>	The performance attribution for small caps is 90% stock selection, with the exception of a few groups:  gold, oil, biotech, hightech.  There are a few of those that move as a group but for most part it is stock specific.  Last time, we talked about increasing the weight in the oils and junior oils as they were very cheap.  We did and that has helped our performance.  They no longer look that cheap.  The higher quality junior oils are trading at 8 times the cash flow multiples. 
There really is not much to say on a macro level in terms of strategy with this fund. It is primarily stock selection.  We are still defensive and are trying to improve the liquidity of the portfolio.  Some of the competitors with the really aggressive portfolios are having trouble getting bids on some of their stock.  When good drill results come out, the stock holds.  When bad results come they collapse.  They very seldom go up unless it is a tiny little junior that no one owns anyway. 
 <p>
The whole group has become much more stable.  Small caps have underperformed a lot against the TSE.  The TSE has been driven primarily by the banks.  In the  last few days there has been a shift in the market and it has been to the mines.  In the gold it has been the seniors, not the juniors.  So there is a shift back to those larger cap names and that is to be expected.  We have been holding our own thought and this month even though the numbers are well below the TSE, we run a proxy against Nesbitt-Burns small cap index internally and it looks like we are still ahead of the Nesbitt-Burns.  As far as the performance goes it has been good.  As at the end of September, we are about 7% ahead of the Wood Gundy small cap index on a 1 year basis.  The really speculative stocks have slowed down.  A problem now is that there is a real premium being  paid for quality.  We have moved into some stocks that are sort of boring but good, stable, predictable performers like the Unicans and Vanhoot and names like that. There is such a divergence between the quality stock in terms of multiples and the speculative stocks.  When you are trying to build a quality portfolio, you have got to pay  a premium for it.  So what we are trying to do is fine tune the Special Growth Fund.  It may seem like we are really hunkering down but it is more trying to get where the market wants you to be and not get hurt if there is a change in the market direction.  It think that is really our strategy. 
 <p>
We are not too far off the Wood Gundy small cap index in terms of our sector weighting but that is more coincidence than anything else.  We are a little overweighted in the mines but that includes names like Global Stone which is a quality industrial company.  They are a major drilling service for mining companies.  We are underweight with the golds now.  We are moving toward an underweight in the oils because a lot of them had really good moves and they are getting a little expensive.  We are still underweighted in technology.  Again, there is really no top down theme or anything you can talk about except for this quality theme.  The quality of the company is really becoming most important.  New issues are coming out constantly. 
<p>
The other big group is the financial services.  We have got a fair number of those:  Newcourt, Pembridge.  We have got a fairly good weight in the financial side and it is a group that traditionally, we are not really in.  We are a little overweighted on the resource side, but that is coming down and that has been coming down between the junior golds and the oils.  Utilities have been a very strong group.  It is a very small group, approximately 0.4% of the whole Wood Gundy.  We do not have anything in that group.  There are about 4 names on the small cap side that are very hard to play because they are moving like the big cap utilities are.  They have been very strong but it has not really affected the index that much.  
<p>
We are still underweight with the merchandising.  We have looked hard at that group trying to find names that have not moved but look like they are improving.   We bought Future Shop too early, but it is a very small position in the fund and the same store sales continue to decline even though the top line are okay.  We have talked to a number of different companies and they are still under margin pressure.  The names we have are things like Rent-to-Own where you rent furniture, dishes, curtains, and carpets cheap.  You can rent everything.  We have tried to get a little bit into the detail side but as I say it is really hard on the margins.  We have looked at real estate and we are concentrating on domestic real estate and housing real estate as opposed to commercial or retail. 
 <p>
If you like retail, you would investe in the shopping centres but the retailers are only just beginning or will start to begin to look a little bit better and it will be a long time before we go to the commercial side.  We have bought some of Monarch which is a housing company and we are looking at a few more housing companies.  The banks  have cut mortgage rates once again.  I think that is one play on the domestic side.  With the higher dollar and low interest rate.  Everybody is waiting for that push in the domestic economy, but it is still very much an employment story.  We have tried to play the low interest rates on the lumber side and increase our lumber quite a bit over the last six months and that was a good decision.  But to play the domestic economy in the small caps side, you cannot invest in the banks in the same way that a large cap fund can.  The retailer are going to get hurt again this Christmas because they are under-inventoried.  They think it is going to be a lousy Christmas so they are under-stocked.  Even if it is a good Christmas, they will not have the inventory.  It is going to be another bad year for them.
<p>
<strong>Question:</strong>	What is your average market cap?<br>
It is around to $250 million, which is big for this fund.  It is usually around $140 to $150 million.

<P><I><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT>: How does reinvestment of distributions work?</B></I></P>

<P>Mutual funds pay distributions usually monthly, quarterly, 
semi-annually or annually. Most funds allow distributions to
 be automatically reinvested to purchase additional units. 
When a distribution is paid, the unit price of the fund generally 
declines by the unit amount of the distribution. If you reinvest
 your distributions, the total value of your investment does not 
change but the total number of units you hold increases. The example
 below provides an illustration:

   <OL TYPE=i>   
   <LI>Let us say that before a distribution is made you hold 100 units of 
	a fund, valued at $11 per unit. The total value of your investment is $11 
	x 100 = $1100.<BR>
   <LI>The fund makes a distribution of $1 per unit. You will earn $1 x 
	100 units = $100. The unit price of the fund will fall by $1 in dividends 
	paid to $10: $11 - $1 = $10.<BR>
   <LI>If  you reinvest your earning of $100 at the new fund price, you will 
	buy $100 / $10 = 10 additional units. You will now own 100 + 10 units = 110 
	units at $10 each. The value of your investments will remain at the 
	pre-distribution level, $10 x 110 = $1100.<SUP>*</SUP><BR> 
   <LI>You now have the benefit of earning income and capital appreciation 
	from 110 rather than 100 units. This is how you achieve "compounded" growth.<BR>
   </OL>
<B><SUP>*</SUP> Note</B> that on the day of distribution, the reported
 unit value of your fund may vary by an amount that differs from the value 
of the distribution because of fluctuations in the market value of the 
investments in the fund on that day.</P>

<h2>Manager Commentary  December 1996</h2>

<br>
<strong>The Precious and Strategic Metal Fund</strong><p>

<i>Thursday, December 12, 1996, 8:00am</i><p><p>
</center>

Although I don't see the price of gold skyrocketing over the next few years, I believe there is strong support for it.  I don't see it collapsing below US$300/ounce as some analysts are forecasting and that is mainly due to the demand that we are going to see coming out of the developing countries.  South Africa has been the biggest gold producer for years, but their production has been falling off lately.  The main reason for this decline is that their mines are getting a lot deeper, and in turn, the cost of extracting the gold is a lot higher.  As well, the miners in South Africa are starting to demand wage parity now that apartheid has ended.  They are seeking higher salaries and they're getting them.  Mines in South Africa are becoming uneconomic.  This trend is expected to continue as South Africa's economy improves and the Rand (local currency) appreciates.  Since gold is priced in US dollars, when the Rand strengthens versus the US dollar, it impacts the profits of South African mines - the mines will realize profits in US dollars and will have to convert them into a stronger local currency.  
<p>
In North America, production has been pretty stable and is predicted to continue that way.  Oceania (Australia, Philippines, Indonesia, Southeast Asia) has had increasing production, a trend that is also likely to continue.  Total gold supplies for 1996 are approximately 2,654 tons (a ton is about 32,000 ounces of  gold) and that includes everything from production and recycling, to scrap.  The 1996 total demand for gold will be approximately 3,005 tons.  The supply-demand gap is therefore 351 tons of gold.  That gap is being filled by Central Bank selling and by gold companies hedging their future production.  Where is the future demand for gold going to come from?  The developing, high growth countries like India and China.  Twenty years ago, the developing countries only had 100 tons of demand for jewelry whereas the developed countries had 500 tons.  Now demand for gold in the developing countries has topped 1,500 tons while demand in the developed markets is about 700 tons.  Demand growth is expected to continue as economic conditions continue to improve in the developing markets.
<p>
Investors are asking "Why is gold weak right now?".  A lot of it has to do with rumours that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plans to sell part of their gold reserves.  As well, Central Banks have been selling gold.  The IMF has stated that they would like to sell part of their gold reserves to help pay off some of the debt accumulated by Third World countries.  When analyzing it, however, the IMF said they were only going to sell about 5 million ounces over a three year period.  They also said that they wouldn't sell any of their gold for three years because they have enough cash reserves right now to fund any immediate needs.  Therefore, the IMF gold sale is being discounted today even though it will not happen for three years.  The IMF is smart enough to spread the sale out and not allow it to effect their other gold holdings.
<p>
The second factor that is driving the price of gold down is the rumour that European Central Banks are selling.  One of the requirements that is set for entry into the European Monetary Union (EMU) is that each country's deficit cannot exceed 3% of GDP.  There have been rumours that a lot of these European countries are going to sell some of their gold holdings to reduce their deficits.  European Ministers discussing solutions to the problem, however, have indicated that they don't want a "Band-Aid" solution.  They are looking for a longer term deficit reduction program.  A country's financial position is not improved just by selling one asset quickly - the more serious problem of why there is a deficit still remains.  EMU guidelines will lead to some Central Bank selling, but not quite to the extent of what investors expect.
<p>
Investors ask "Why should we hold the Precious and Strategic Metal Fund now?".  Typically we have a seasonal move in gold in the fourth and first quarter of the year.  We haven't seen that so far in the fourth quarter of 1996.  A move in gold also occurs going into holiday periods due to demand created by gift-giving.  Fabricators are adding to their stocks and have been doing so for the last several months due to the Christmas season, Ramadan and the Chinese New Year.
<p>
Another reason why we feel there will be a strong gold market is that the large companies that were financed over the past two to three years are now making big discoveries. The money that has been made off these discoveries is being put back into the market in other gold stocks which will fuel the price of gold stocks and other exploration companies for the next few years.  An exploration company which makes a large discovery sees its stock price rise exponentially.  We invest in these types of companies.
<p>
We don't need a high gold price for the Precious and Strategic Metal Fund to do well.  Typically we look for stocks that have one of three clear advantages.  Either they can produce cheaply, they can replace existing reserves through new discoveries, or the company is undervalued, based on the assets that it has in the ground. If all three of these conditions exist together, it makes the company a takeover candidate.  Barrick is a company that exploits some of these advantages.  They are producing 3 million ounces a year and may only have another fifteen years worth of production.  They continually have to replace the 3 million ounces a year that they are mining, otherwise the market will penalize them as it is a depleting asset.  There are different ways that Barrick can increase its gold reserves.  They can explore for themselves, which may take a number of years.  If exploration starts today for example, it may take a couple of years to make a discovery, and then another four or five years to develop the mine.  Another option would be to go out and buy a company that has already put time, effort and money into exploring.  If they have a proven reserve, it may take as little as two years to bring it to development.  You've then eliminated the exploration risks and the time involved in bringing the mine to the development stage.
<p>
The subsectors of the TSE all started at 1000 in 1974.  Gold has been the best performing sector since then, even if you take dividends into account.  The Banks come the closest to that kind of performance if you include all their dividends reinvested.  The gold sector is one of the more volatile ones as well though, and investors have to appreciate that.  It's usually either top quartile or bottom quartile - never in between.  Over the long term, we usually advise clients not to put any more than 10% of your holdings in gold.
<p>
What's happening with Bre-X?  We basically sold out of our positions in Bre-X two to three weeks ago (late November).  We had a meeting and analyzed the upside potential versus the downside risk.  If they lose the deposit totally and don't get paid anything you're looking at a $3 stock, whereas the up side is $21 to  $22.  We decided that it wasn't worth holding.  A letter has been sent to the President of Indonesia by Bre-X asking for permission allowing Bre-X to continue developing the site.  Bre-X claims they've employed so many people and that they've put $20 million into the ground and they are good for the Indonesian economy.  The Indonesian government stated that they had canceled Bre-X's contract of work (which is the right to mine the deposit - it sets out the terms, what the taxes are, what conditions there are in terms of infrastructure that must be built).  This contract had been approved by the parliament but the government overruled them and canceled the contract when a government imposed deadline was missed.  The government feels that Bre-X has failed to live up to certain terms of their exploration permit.
<p>
There has just recently (Dec.16/96) been news of some type of agreement being made involving Bre-X,  Barrick and the Indonesian government.  Apparently, the two companies have agreed on a split under which Barrick will get 67.5% of a new joint venture, Bre-X 22.5% and the government 10%.  There are still several outstanding questions that have to be resolved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.  Among the questions still to be resolved is the status of Askatindo Karya Mineral (one of Bre-X's Indonesian partners involved), how Bre-X will be compensated for Barrick's 67.5% 'takeover', and finally, if there will be any resulting lawsuits - namely against Barrick.  The Indonesian investment climate could get hit hard if there are lawsuits involving the government and/or Barrick.  Junior mining companies who are now raising money for exploration will likely reconsider, as the possibility of expropriation by the government presents a very unfavorable risk/return relationship.  It may even have a negative spillover effect into some of the other junior companies operating in some of the other politically risky countries, like some of the former Soviet Republics and South American countries.
<p>
<strong>Q. 	What are some of the differences between the type of gold companies found 	in the Equity Fund versus the Precious and Strategic Metal Fund?</strong>
<br>
The Equity Fund will concentrate primarily on the larger companies.  In the Precious and Strategic Metal Fund, I can buy more of the exploration stocks which are takeover candidates - the ones that we think are undervalued.  With that comes more risk - some of these companies may not find anything and may go bankrupt.  Right now we're probably running about 40% seniors, 35% junior companies (exploration and small producers), 15% cash with the balance in diamond stocks.  We've been looking at a lot of the junior diamond producers that are moving into African countries that have huge reserves.  On a valuation basis the diamond mines are so much cheaper than the gold mines are currently.  Cash flow is substantially higher for diamond mining companies than for gold producers which means they will be paying back their mining costs in a year or two.  Our weighting is probably about 7% or 8% right now but we plan to take that up to about 15%.  Diamonds are  seen as a diversifier and also as a hedge against falling gold prices.
<p>
<strong>Q. 	Where do you see bullion prices going? </strong>
<br>
I think we are going to bounce from here.  The price of gold is quite low right now - it is at about US$370/ounce.  I think over the next few months we'll be at US$390/ounce to US$400/ounce again.  I'm not one who sees gold at US$450/ounce or US$500/ounce.  If gold does get to US$450/ounce or US$500/ounce you will see Central Bank selling, and producers forward-selling (taking out gold loans and putting more gold into the market).  These factors will depress the price.  You have to remember that we don't need a strong gold price for the stocks we're buying to do well.
<p>
<strong>Q. 	In recent years and looking at projections, it appears that the supply/demand 	gap is narrowing.  Is this a concern? </strong>
<br>
The gap is narrowing, but a lot of that has to do with the increase in supply we're seeing.  As I said before, all the companies that have been discovering gold, will be coming into production over the next two, three or four years.  A lot of that is occurring in new countries that were not open to development before.  These countries have changed their mining laws and are now accepting foreign investment.  The supply of gold is increasing, but there is still a large gap between supply and demand.
<p>
<strong>Q.	 How big is the universe of all gold stocks? </strong>
<br>
If you look worldwide at every gold company combined, they only have a market capital of US$65 billion.  Coke itself is about US$120 billion and Philip Morris is probably about US$80 billion.  If investors do start to favour golds again, like they did earlier this year, they will rush in to buy.  With only a small amount of stock available, there may not be enough stocks to satisfy the demand.  All the senior stocks will move, for example, Barrick, Placer Dome, etc.,  as the major US funds start getting back into the big names.  This will then have a trickle down effect into second tier stocks.

<h3>Market Commentary  October 1996</h3>
<p>
<h3>Frank Mersch, manager Altamira Equity fund</h3>
<p>
</center> 
<p>
<b>Frank Mersch:</b>	On September 15  the Equity Fund was half a point ahead of the index.  Now it is 5 points behind the index .  For the month of October, Equity is up about 2.25, but finished down in September.  All of that differential in the past one and a half months is attributable to our lack of exposure to banks in the portfolio.  Metals and the golds were off, banks were up, and the combination has damaged the performance of the Equity Fund.  We hope that the rotation will start to move to other sectors but as of yet, it continues to go the other way.
<p>
Both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) numbers came in this week and they are still weak.  Inflation does not look like it is much of an issue.  It is likely to be another month to a month and a half before we see a rotation to metals and resources stocks in general.
<p>
Where do we see the fund going forward?  Interest rates continue to decline globally and therefore, I do not see a major risk of a large correction.  There may  be small corrections of 7% or 8%.  Given current market trends, I do not see a lot of downside risk in the market.  Just as you have had a period where the banks have risen 20%, you are probably going to see a period where other sectors will jump 20% very quickly, just like the gold stocks did in January.  Due to the strength of the Canadian dollar, the Canadian government continues to use a very easy monetary policy.  Canadian short term rates are 1.5% lower than US rates.  That is not sustainable forever, but for now it is the norm.  I believe that the Canadian dollar will continue to rise and have tendency to get back to the 78 - 80 cent levels which, again, is good for financial services, like the banks.  Low interest rates are causing a flood of money out of fixed income instruments primarily at the short end.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	I noticed you have recently added to your gold position in the Equity Fund.
<p>
<b>Frank Mersch:</b>	Correct.  I increased the golds because the sector has under-performed.  Core inflation continues to rise such as the hourly wage and price of oil.  Though I do believe some of the numbers are being manipulated prior to the US election, I have the gold in the fund because it is a counter-cyclical against any corrections at this time.  We will be counter-cyclical to everybody else, so when things turn, we will come back faster and harder.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	What do you think about copper?
<p>
<b>Frank Mersch:</b>	The reality of copper is that there was an overhang.  Inventory levels are correcting but within the next year to two years there is going to be a lot of new capacity coming on line, primarily from South America.  Copper prices should remain low.  They could get as high as $0.92 or $0.93 and then will probably edge back down.  Prices should move higher, however, in aluminium, zinc, and nickel.  This market is fairly extended.  We are looking for a consolidation in the short term.  Then we expect our sectors to start to develop.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	You often talk about the stock markets being in an extended cycle.  Why do you believe this cycle will be extended further?
<p>
<b>Frank Mersch:</b>	The reason it is being extended is the slow recovery of Europe and the Far East.  Because of the slow recovery on a global stage, there are not a lot of wage restraints or inflationary pressures.  This is a market that I have never seen before in that it is self-correcting.  The golds have corrected 20% and the banks have gone up 20%.  In the next rotation, the banks could correct 20% and the golds could go up 20% leaving the market the same.  We have seen big corrections in the high tech area (50%-60% corrections) and now they seem to be coming back.  This market is very self- correcting and quite resilient.  Canadian interest rates are at 3% at the short end and the after tax yield for a top marginal tax bracket is 1.5%.  In other words, you get a negative real rate of return with the interest income from T-bills investments.
<p>
You have to keep in mind that this business cycle started in 1991.  I do think that given the current interest rates and the unlikeliness of rising interest rates in the near term that the economy will not slow.  Intel is talking about record orders in September.  The economy looks like it has adjusted to these interest rate levels.  I do think that there will be weaknesses in certain areas, but generally, profit numbers are encouraging from the majors: GM, Chrysler, and Ford have posted good numbers. Intel and IBM are continuing to move forward.  The pundits are saying the economy is going to weaken, but it may weaken from a 5.5% growth rate to a 3% growth rate which is still good growth.  If we can get some growth in industrial production in Europe, then we have a good environment for base metals prices.

<h3>Market Commentary  October 1996</h3>
<p>
<h3>Ian Ainsworth, Manager U.S Larger Company and Science & Technology Fund</h3>
<p> 
</center> 
<p>
<h2>US LARGER COMPANY FUND</h2>
<p>
<b>Ian Ainsworth:</b>  	The US Larger Company Fund had a good year last year but has underperformed this year relative to its benchmarks.  I believe what is in the portfolio is good value and will get recognised when the rotation comes around from where it is  today.  
<p>
The focus right now of the market is financial services and we are there but we are only about market weighted.  Our stock selection in the financial services group is very good.  We have companies like Citicorp and Bank of Boston.  We also have The Bank of New York which has done really well; so we have kept up in the financial services sector.   
<p>
The other area that is doing very well is the consumer nondurable areas with companies like Coca-Cola.  We have missed out there.  I have not focused on the fact that when markets get to new highs,  everything goes up.  Everything has its turn to lead but as it gets higher and higher, people get more and more nervous.  The big institutions have been shifting from bonds over the last two years.  People are more worried now that rates are going to go up and are shifting out of bonds into safe, liquid, well-known, quality name-brand stocks.  
<p>
We do not have a large position in name-brand companies which have performed well. Generally in a low inflation environment with a consumer that is more value conscious and more savings oriented, name-brands should suffer.  As a result, the name-brand stocks should also suffer.  This has not happened.  Instead, people have run to the safety of those names. This is one sector where we have not been weighted and we should have been.
<p>
I guess the other sector is the oil and gas group which we have very little exposure to -- in fact zero exposure except through the drilling sector.  I think the oil and gas group has done well because in effect it is really like the financial service sector.  It has high yields and the commodities are doing well.
<p>
Companies like Slunber, Day & Dresser are drilling companies that really are not sensitive  to economic cycles.  One way of hedging against a slowdown that turns into a recession is buying companies that have their own cycle.  For example, the drillers in the US have gone through a period of very depressed drilling rates.  Now there is a shortage of rigs and a shortage of facilities; so the existing platforms are charging higher rates.  These companies are starting to see their profits accelerate, a trend which will continue until they get to point where the cost (the day rates) justify replacing the assets.
So I have played the energy sector well through that group because they have outperformed the rest of the energy group.  I only had about a 4% or 5% weighting, though, whereas the energy sector benchmark is about 10-12% which put us back a bit.
<p>
Our technology weight has not been as high as it was last year; however, our technology weight includes companies that are not really technology companies.  We classify BBN as a technology company but it is a service provider.  It provides people with Internet access service in the same way that people get long distance telephone service. Although BBN takes advantage of technology, it is not strictly a technology sector company and if you take BBN out of our portfolios, we are weighted at only about 18% of technology where the rest of the market is around 15%.  We have not been overweighted in technology to the degree that we have been in the past because I have felt that the Science and Technology Fund is the vehicle for people to play technology.  
<p>
We are basically focused on the better names in technology.  Names like Cisco, Informix, Intel and Microsoft are good positions for us.  We have not done too badly.  Some of the companies have lagged, like Amphenol, but they will have their time.  We will continue to focus on technology as a core part of this fund because looking forward, we believe that technology will be an area of continued growth and change.
<p>
The United States leads in the technology industry and we are going to play that sector with a lot of focus.  We probably made the most mistakes in the consumer services area of technology or the cable area. It does not make any sense for anyone who knows technology to be in cable stocks, because they are under threat from the satellite dish companies.  The satellite companies are now accelerating their push and really putting pressure on the cable group.  This is about five percent of our portfolio and that really has been hit hard.  
<p>
Right now, Tele-Communications Inc. is down to around $15.  This stock was a take-over target  at $40 about four years ago by Bell Atlantic and when the deal fell through, it dropped down to $13.  It is now trading at its lowest ratio to cash flow ever.  The recent Telecommunications Act deregulated the industry allowing companies such as Tele-Communications Inc. to start offering services without worrying about what rate they charge.  As a result, they no longer have the pressure of the regulators on them anymore driving down their earnings by keeping rates down.  They are now looking at rolling out new services using cable modems, using digital set top boxes which will make them competitive with the satellite companies.
<p>
It is not the time to sell these stocks because the cable modem sector is evolving right now and the digital set top boxes rollout is happening right now.  It may be painful for the next couple of weeks because AT&T has been out there marketing the satellite dishes, giving them away because they know they will get their monthly rates to offset the upfront capital outlay.  We are going to see some big penetration rates for satellites in the next little while, but we are also going to see the cable modems strategy working and the digital set top boxes exploding.  The cable TV companies are really pushing this area pretty hard.  
<p>
So it is going to be a battle.  We are in the cheaper sector not the leading edge sector.  We will offset this a little bit at the end of the quarter by buying a small amount of the satellite companies which are expensive but are at the very leading edge of technology.  I think there is room for the cable companies to move up a bit and the satellite companies will fundamentally keep going.
<p>
We have basically focused on the growth opportunities.  The idea is to give a focus to the portfolio on large growth stock positions and that includes Cisco and Microsoft.  On the consumer side, companies like Sun International Hotels (which is building a large casino on an Indian reserve in Connecticut) has been a big winner for us. This will be a few miles down the road from the most profitable casino in the world which generates something like $500 million a year in profit.  What we are trying to find are companies that can grow.  We are not looking necessarily at a value situation because it takes forever to pay off.  We are really looking at companies that can grow as the economy slows down.  If the economy slows down and you are not in companies that are growing but look valued, they will be impacted even more.  We want companies that will continue to grow should the economy slow down.  
One of the big areas we are looking at is the evolution of communications networks.  In the past we have used self-switch networks. Self switch networks have voice switches that are connected by telephone number to each other over a direct telephone wire.  For every call one wire is monopolised.  This is extremely inefficient because in every conversation, there is a large amount of dead air or quiet space.  
<p>
Now, the world is moving toward packet push networks. Packet push networks make maximum use of one line by pushing voice or data packets in the empty space that occurs in the average voice communication.  The caller is unaware that the packets are sharing the same line.  These packets are all meshed together and are sent out to people who need them as if they were thrown from a spinning wheel. Users will think they are talking on a dedicated line but effectively one-tenth of the wires will be used to deliver the same voice services.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b>  	One concern that comes up a lot with clients is the current level of the US market.  What would your advice be to somebody who A) was looking to buy or B) somebody who was holding US Larger Company Fund?
<p>
<b>Ian Ainsworth:</b>	You have a low inflation and moderate growth environment.  There seems to be no engine to drive growth to extreme levels.  Consumers are debt laden.  Governments are downsizing.  Legislation has liberalised corporations so that they can consolidate and companies are going to be buying each other, particularly after the elections.  So you are going to see continued pressure on wages from downsizing. Youve got a disciplined Fed as well as a disciplined G7.  Where is the growth that would drive inflation?
We have believed that the US has low inflation and there continues to be a trend toward productivity improvement.  You have liberalisation of industries so that they do not have to deal with red tape.  They can hire, fire, and consolidate.  They can enter new businesses.  That is a major drive into productivity.  The telecommunications field, the retail sector and all those areas we have talked about in the past will continue to drive productivity.  The United States right now, for the third year in a row, has the most productive economy in the world.  They can produce steel in the United States with less manpower than anywhere else in the world.  I believe that what we are grasping onto is not merely a cyclical phase.  This is a secular change.  The globalization of the world.  The Americans have the brand names and have the technology to execute globalization where a lot of other countries do not.  
<p>
America could be in the same kind of productivity phase we saw in Japan in 1979-1980.  You would have to go back to the 60s and 50s to see the same kind of growth and prosperity we see in the United States today.  It has a much more efficient economy.  People are very focused.
<p>
Today, how do you judge when you get in and out of a market? IBM is at 10 or 12 times earnings, Compac is at 10 or 12 times earnings, Intel maybe 14 or 15 times earnings.  Those are not outrageous multiples, but on the other hand youve got Microsoft and Coca Cola trading at 35.  My advice is to stick with the trend because there is a secular fundamental change going on.
<p>
I cannot think what necessarily would cause a sell off unless it was lower corporate earnings.  But lets go back to that issue.  What causes sell off pressure?  Interest rates going up? No.  We do not see this because we do not see the corresponding growth drive.  Inflation pressures?  No, that is not a problem because the industries are liberalising and laying off staff.  If the market does correct, it will only be minor and all those foreign buyers will want to buy in.  You have corporations in a slow growth environment who are looking at how to continue growing.  They are considering acquisitions and they are waiting for stocks to come down a bit.  Then they will go in and buy.
<p>
Any correction is a great buying opportunity.  Companies will move in and foreigners will buy into that opportunity and that will help support the market.  So I think the issue comes back to whether corporate earnings are going to continue growing and I can see corporate earnings continuing to grow.  They continue to surprise us on the upside this year.
<p>
<h2>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUND</h2>
<p>
<b>Ian Ainsworth:</b>	We are really focused on trying to buy the right companies in the right sectors.  In the last part of 1995 we decided to get out of syndicate numbers and the cyclical component of this technology business and stay with the networking and software companies.  As a result, we ended up making big gains on our competition.  We believe in the Internet.  We picked up about 6 points on our competition going into December.  We were doing really well coming into the new year but we got hit in July as the Internet stocks corrected.  Netscape and all these software companies related to the Internet all went down and the funds performance suffered.  That was July/August.  At the same time there were signs that the PC business was better than people expected.  
Where are we?  Well there are a lot of opportunities in technology.  It is just the most exciting area. We are going to get hit every once and a while but we are going to try and be in companies where we feel we know the fundamentals well enough that we can buy on any corrections.
<p>
The Internet is one of the focuses that we have.  We own Netscape.  We own some of the networking companies that are benefiting from the build out of these IT networks, companies like Cascade and Cisco.  We own some of the component companies that are selling the microprocessors that go to the networking companies which build the networks that deliver Internet technology.  That is the whole chain and we are there right across the board from Altira to Cascades to BBN to Netscape, that puts the software on those networks.  That is the Internet and probably when you look at it, it is driving a lot of technology today.
<p>
We also like wireless and the opportunity to build these new PCS networks in the United States.  The world is going wireless.  The Washington trials of PCS got three times the subscribers that they had expected.  So we are playing that through companies like P-COM which makes antennas that deliver high speed traffic between cellular cells or PCS cells.  So P-COM is a growth stock for us.  Spectrian is another company that makes antennas.  QUALCOMM is the company that invented CDMA which is the new technology in wireless.  That is a good position for us.  QUALCOMM hasnt taken off yet. We are struggling through some weak quarters and we are actually down on our position but if CDMA takes off like we think it will, then QUALCOMM will really benefit.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	What is CDMA?
<p>
<b>Ian Ainsworth:</b>	Code Division Multiplexing.  CDMA is the alternative.  Right now everyone is using a digital cellular world instead of CDMA and it does not allow you to deliver as many circuits as does CDMA.  CDMA is much more dense and effective method of communicating.  The trouble is that it does not have the same voice quality and so because PCS companies pay $15 billion for licenses, they want to have certain technology to roll out.  Now most of these guys have already gone CDMA before we even had handsets, that is how attractive the technology is.  
We are also targeting companies that are taking advantage of this whole world of objects. We are now moving into the object world:  Java and P-COMM.  We are moving into a world where people are going to write software by stringing objects together.  Effectively, Java is pre-written code that incorporates a whole bunch of functionalities in one object and with which you can read graphical systems, graphical user interfaces to write software.
<p>
Java speeds up the process of writing software dramatically.  It also allows you to download objects on the network.  We do not know how big these objects are going to get but effectively what it means is that you no longer need a big PC.  You just need these objects floating around the network all the time.  They are little pieces of component software that you can build to make mission critical applications.
<p>
This is a great opportunity and the companies that are leading in it are companies like Rational Software.  Rational Software has 90% of market share in the tools needed to build these little objects.  Informix is a company that we own and Informix is exciting because they are the first company to deliver a database system that does not relate line of code to line of code in tables like the old relational database format, being able to slice through data by column or by row.  That is gone.  Now it is objects, relational objects.  Being able to relate a video with a sound track with a text object.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	What will you be overweighting in the Science and Technology Fund going forward?
<p>
<b>Ian Ainsworth:</b>	We will continue overweighting the Networking opportunities and that includes software related to the Internet, the Internet itself, providers, companies that provide hardware to the Internet and companies that provide components for the Internet.  The Internet is the big story and when we talk about the Internet we are not talking about small stocks, we are talking about Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel.  We are talking about exposure to wireless opportunities that affect the world globally.  We are also in the health care business.  We have positions in a lot of health care we did not talk about.  We are 15% biotechnology and we will stay at least 15% biotechnology.

<h3>Market Commentary  October 1996</h3>
<p>
<h3>Barry Allan, Manager Altamira Short Term Global Income Fund,
<p>
Altamira Global Bond Fund and Altamira Speculative High Yield Bond Fund</h3>
</center> 
<p>
<b>Barry Allan:</b>	I will start with the Short Term Global Income Fund.  One of the most important aspects of the performance of that fund is the movement of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar.  The other important factor is what the US dollar is doing against the other major currencies, the Yen and the Deutschemark.  
The Canadian dollar is a pretty low volatility currency and you do not get 15% to 20% moves.  A big move for the Canadian dollar is 4% or 5% and our view is that the Canadian dollar is poised to accelerate.  It is quite undervalued plus there is no argument against the suggestion that the Canadian dollar is cheap and the fundamentals of Canada are very attractive.  The strategy for the Fund will change a little bit but I do not necessarily think the US dollar is going to go up by a large amount against the Yen and the Deutschemark.  
The strategy of the fund will change to hold the maximum amount of Canadian dollars (which is 25%).  Historically, we generally do not hold any Canadian dollars because people put money in that fund to move it outside of Canadian dollars, but we set a maximum of 25% and I will probably hold it up to that point.  Other dollar block currencies that tend to go up with the Canadian dollar are the Australian and the New Zealand dollars.  They are a way to invest and benefit from a strengthening Canadian dollar.
I am neutral on the Short Term Global Income Fund.  Even if the Canadian dollar goes up, I do not think the fund will get hurt too badly and I think there are opportunities to make money with this fund.  My goal is to outperform Canadian Treasury Bills which are yielding 3.4% right now.  For the investors that have money in this fund as a diversification exercise, I think it is still a valid one.
The message here is I do not think you should be particularly afraid of a rising Canadian dollar with this fund, though it is not optimal.  If the Canadian dollar goes down, it is a lot easier to make money in that fund but I do not think it will because of what the other currencies are likely to do against the US dollar. There are opportunities to own currencies that will keep pace and even outpace the rise in the Canadian dollar against the US.  
The major reason for this is that other currencies tend to be a lot more volatile.  If the Canadian dollar goes up 4% or 5%, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and UK Sterling can easily move 8% or 10%.  I think if I were holding this fund in a diversified portfolio I would consider it neutral.  I do not see it being a fund you would load up on or something you would sell if it is there for diversification purposes.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	What is the target for the Canadian dollar after six months?
<p>
<b>Barry Allan:</b>	In six months, Id say probably US$0.76 which is about another $0.02 from where we are now.  So, that sounds like it might be a lot but it is really only 2.5% increase.
Canada always had higher interest rates so there was the chance of getting hit twice.  If you invested in another currency you always had to give up the yield and then if the Canadian dollar appreciated on top of that, you lost on currency as well. We are picking up yield on just about any other currency that we are going into; so we have a 2% to 3% interest cushion to protect us unless it is Deutschemarks or Yen or a similar currency.  So if the Canadian dollar went up 2% you would still break even against the US.  You cannot forget that yields drive performances of this fund as well as currencies.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>		How are you positioning the portfolio going forward?
<p>
<b>Barry Allan:</b>	We are going to continue to hold Australian and New Zealand dollars which are dollar block and tend to move with Canada but they have much higher yield.  We also hold Sterling which is another currency which has relatively high short term interest rates and tends to move with the US dollar. The US dollar is kind of in a neutral range.  Those are all kinds of dollar block currencies and if we think the US dollar gets a little overvalued we will move into Yen and Deutschemarks for trading positions.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	Is the appreciation of Canadian dollar part of a longer term trend?
<p>
<b>Barry Allan:</b>	The Canadian dollar, I think, has just started a fairly long term climb against the US and it will probably continue to climb until we go into the next recession which in my view is probably 2 or 2 years away.  The Canadian dollar might get to US$0.80 by the end of next year.  I do not really see it getting back to US$0.90 like it did in 1990 or 1991 because the interest rate environment was different back then.  Three month Treasury Bills in Canada were yielding 14% and three month Treasury Bills in the US were yielding 8%. Canada had a 600 basis point interest spread, so it was no wonder our currency went up.  Now we have got a 200 basis point negative spread.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	Do you think the Bank of Canada supports a cheaper Canadian dollar?
<p>
<b>Barry Allan:</b>	My view of the Canadian economy is that the domestic component of the Canadian economy is getting stronger and therefore there is less and less need for the Bank of Canada to keep the currency cheap to support the export portion of our economy (which is the only portion of our economy that has existed for the last five years).  But economic indicators such as retail sales, consumer confidence, and the employment numbers show that we have gone through five years of restructuring.  Everybody who was getting laid off, got laid off.
People get tired after five years of saving and saving and saving.  Pretty soon they start to spend.  Look at housing prices:  What houses are selling?  They are all first time house buyers.  People have been saving for ever and now they are saying, Okay, houses are cheap; mortgage rates are cheap.  Now we have to spend some.  So I think you will see the domestic component of the Canadian economy accelerate fairly rapidly.
In that scenario there is no particular reason for the Bank of Canada to lower rates dramatically just to keep the Canadian dollar cheap.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>	A lot of clients right now are going into cash because they fear that after the US election interest rates will increase.
<p>
<b>Barry Allan:</b>	I think that is a definite risk right now and I am not sure whether it is going to happen.  I thought it was going to happen.  I thought they were going to raise rates in July and they didnt.  I thought they were going to raise rates in August and they didnt.  If they didnt do it in July and August, there is no point for them to do it in September, the last chance before the election.  
So then I felt that they were waiting for the election to pass and then they were going to raise rates.  If the Fed raises rates in November, though, right after the election, then clearly they are saying that there is a political element in their thought process which is not supposed to be there.  So they have to wait until December when everybody is on holidays.  In the meantime the economic numbers out of the US are starting to slow, which is what Greenspan has been saying all along.
I am not certain it is going to happen.  We have to see how the numbers come out in another month or so.  On the other hand, if that happens, it would be a great buying opportunity in my mind because the US is not going into recession and the rest of the world continues to come out of a recession.  Global growth is much stronger than people believe and it is really early in the economic cycle.  The US has been the only economy in the world in the last three or four years.  The rest of the world is finally kicking in now.  I find it difficult to believe that the US is going to go into recession when the rest of the world is just starting to grow.  
What is going to cause recession?  In my mind there are only two things that will cause recession.  One is inflation rising dramatically in the US which I do not think it will.  It may cyclically pick up but I do not see it being strong enough that the government has to raise interest rates, invert the yield curve, and induce a recession to beat down inflation.  The other risk of the US going into recession is the Japanese financial system blowing up.  The Japanese would have to sell all their US Treasury Bonds, which would drive interest rates in the US up hugely like we saw in 1987 and then everything was just collapsing.  If they raise rates 50 basis points in the US, the stock market probably will not take it well.  You would probably get a 10% correction and then everybody will buy in again.  I have a pretty optimistic view of equities over the next couple of years.
<p>
<h3>GLOBAL BOND FUND</h3>
<p>
The Global Bond Fund does not have the same restrictions regarding the Canadian dollar as the Short Term Global Income Fund.  We can hedge all the currency back to Canadian dollars if we want, as long as we hold the assets in foreign bonds.  I do not think I will take it to 100% Canadian.  It is about 25% Canadian dollars right now and I think I will take that up to 50% and maybe higher.  
You are going to have a hard time beating Canada in the next quarter.  With the exception of the US, it looks to me like interest rates are going down or staying flat in the rest of the world.  In Japan, you probably cannot make a lot of money, because rates are so low, but you can in the European bond markets.  There are still a lot of opportunities in Italy, Spain, and Sweden and I do not think rates are going up in Germany.  In fact, I think they are going down. It is always, historically, hard to beat Canada because interest rates are always higher in Canada than everywhere else.  That situation is reversing itself and it takes about a year for that to happen.  
I think bond funds in general have seen the worst in the first nine months of this year.  US bonds did terribly and I think you are going to get pretty good returns out of these markets going forward because I see growth picking up and I do not see interest rates rising.  In Italy, for example, the 10 year bond is up about 27% this year while the US ten year bond is down about 10 points.  There are tremendous opportunities in European bond markets.  Those economies are not poised for rates to go higher, that is for sure.
<p>
<h3>THE SPECULATIVE HIGH YIELD BOND FUND</h3>
<p>
This is a fund whose performance is driven more by equity returns than interest rates.  It is not interest sensitive and to me, it shouldnt be called a bond fund.  It should be a speculative high yield fund not a speculative high yield bond fund because a bond fund is interest sensitive and this fund is not interest sensitive.  
If we go into recession, I can guarantee you this fund will not do that well.  It would probably beat core equities but it would not beat bonds in that situation.  But we are in an economic environment where I think that high yield bonds will beat bonds and it will beat core equities.  It is not going to beat speciality equity funds because, in good equity markets, speciality equity funds are always the biggest winners.  From a risk/reward standpoint, this asset class is extremely favourable in the next two years.
Take a look at the Brady bonds which are all Latin American, and Eastern European.  The JP Morgan Brady Bond Index this year is up about 25% and that is a lot more than US or Canadian equities.  If the industrialised world is growing, that means that people are producing goods in low cost countries in the emerging markets of Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe and sending them to the industrialised world.  
As a result, these economies are growing two to three times as fast as the industrialised world.  The G7s growth for 1997 is about 2 to 2.5%.  The emerging markets are at 6% or 7%. Brady bonds are basically the equity of these countries.  If the economy in Brazil is strong, then Brady bonds are up 30%; if theyre weak , theyre down 30%.  It is like buying equity in an emerging country.  When interest rates are sitting at 3% everywhere in the world, where does money flow?  Money flows toward the highest yielder.
The high yielders are really Brady bonds and we have about 30%.  We have Brazil and Mexico.  We are looking at Venezuela and we have Poland because we want to have some exposure in Europe.  We also have 40% in high yield companies.  High yield debt of companies of which we like the equity.  So if we own the equity in our Resource Fund or Equity Fund, then we will hold high yield bonds on companies like Tempex and Algoma Steel in the High Yield Bond Fund.  Many of the resource based companies that our equity funds hold will be found in the Speculative High Yield Fund as well.
The third component to the fund is commodity exposure due to our strong view of global growth.  The demand for commodities is going to be high and the return on commodities directly this year has been higher than the returns on the resource stocks. For example, we have an oil note that we put into the Resource Fund which is up 100% when most oil stocks are only up about 15% to 20%.  
This is a fund that should do well over the next couple of years.  It is not something that you put 50% of the portfolio in, but I think it should be part of every core portfolio.  If you think the economies are going into recession then you do not want to own this fund, but if you believe in our theory of global growth then the risk/reward of high yield bonds is tremendous.  It is a new asset class and this is the right time in the economic cycle for a fund which is going to have a high yield component to it.
I was looking at the statistics in the US market and I had always thought that in good economic times equities would perform best, followed by high yield bonds, and finally Treasury Bonds.  It didnt turn out that way.  It turned out that high yield bonds beat the core equity and bonds.  It is an emerging asset class so most investors do not have a lot of exposure to it.  When large amounts of money flow in and when investors start realising the risk/reward is favourable, they will start allocating more funds to this asset class. We will then have more money chasing a small amount of bonds.

<h2>Peter Everington</h2>
<h3> Asia Pacific Commentary - September 1996</h3>
<p>
<h3>Altamira Asia Pacific Fund</h3>
</center>
<p>
In light of the concerns expressed by unitholders over the performance of the Asia Pacific fund, I would like to take this opportunity to share my views.   While it is not possible to answer all questions individually, I hope the following will deal with most of the issues that have been raised. Specifically,  I will explain my strategy, what I have done wrong and where I see things going in the next few months.
<p>
I am very conscious of the fact that my performance has been poor over the past year.
Although my recent performance has been poor, my compound return investing in the Asian markets over the past ten years exceeds 20% per annum (My total return over the 14 years I have been running funds exceeds 1300%).  However, managers do go through bad patches from time to time and that is why we have decided to change the management arrangements for the fund to inject some new perspective.  Jim Mellon, Chairman of Regent, who was closely involved with the management of the fund in its early days, is rejoining the management on a day-to-day basis.  In addition, Charles Howlett, who has been primarily responsible for the excellent outperformance of the Japanese Opportunity Fund is taking an active role.  I am not giving up responsibility for the fund but I believe that the assistance of fresh blood will be good for performance.
<p>
The current disposition of the fund is as follows:
<p>
<table>
	Japan		19%		Singapore	  3%
	Korea		36%		Thailand	  2%
	Taiwan		12%		Australia	  4%
	Hong Kong	  5%		Sub-Continent	  6%
	Cash		13%
</table>
<p>
This reflects a deliberate focus on North Asia, a higher than usual cash level reflecting short term caution as the markets have been correcting lately, and (relative to other funds) an overweighting of Korea and Taiwan and underweighting of Hong Kong.  It also reflects a conscious desire to avoid markets that are closely correlated to the US.
<p>
There are two reasons behind my desire to avoid US correlation.  Firstly, most investors in the fund will have the majority of their investments concentrated in Canada where correlation with movements in the US market is high.  Overseas diversification is meant to reduce risk so there is little point in buying markets that are really just a proxy for the US.  Secondly, I believe that the rise in long term interest rates in the US from 6% to 7% so far in 1996 is a reflection of an overly strong US economy and this increases the risk for the US markets particularly after such spectacular gains in the past eighteen months.  While the US stock market has thus far been surprisingly resilient in the face of higher rates, the same cannot be said for Asia where the higher rates have definitely been taking a toll.  I am also mindful of the fact that although short term interest rates in the US have not increased as yet because the Fed has not seen fit to raise rates, the eurodollar markets are quite clearly signalling their expectation that the Fed funds rate will rise above 6% within the next six months.  At the very least, that suggests it would be prudent to reduce investments that are too closely dependant on a continuing US bullmarket.
 <p>
Within Asia, what are the themes that are driving our strategy?  Firstly it is my belief that the Japanese banking system is in a more precarious state than the US system was in the late 1980s.  The Bank of Japan is fixing the problem with the same rescue mechanism used by the Fed, namely printing money like it is going out of style.  This is having the virtuous side effect of causing financial inflation evidenced by a rising market and falling currency.  For the fund, we are bullish on Japan but have hedged the Yen currency exposure and this has been working well for us.  To be fair, we have been a little cautious on the Japanese market in recent weeks mainly because there has been a huge amount of equity issues hitting the market.  This led us to cut back on Japan and that money has been temporarily sitting in cash.  The Nikkei index has fallen from 22,000 and is now close to 20,000.  We actually believe this correction will take the market briefly below 20,000 at which point we will be increasing our exposure again.
<p>
For the rest of Asia, we have been working on the premise that this economic up-cycle that initiated in late 1992 (when the global economy began to revive) will begin to slow over 1996 and into 1997.  This should have given us broadly favourable stock market conditions from 1993-96.  In reality, the take-off in 1992/3 was so spectacular (many Asian markets almost doubled in 1993) that by end 1993, markets had risen into dangerous bubbles following which a serious hangover was inevitable.  While many Asian stock markets have suffered indigestion from 1994-1996, the Asian economies have been storming ahead as expected and are only now beginning to slow as this cycle matures.   It is this apparent divergence between the Asian economic miracle and what the stock markets have been doing that has left many people disenchanted with Asia.  They forget that the stock market gains that rightly belonged to 1994 and 1995 were actually already generated in 1993.  Looking at all the mainstream Asian markets (excluding Japan which is a separate story), every single one lies well below its peak seen right at the end of 1993.  The declines from those peaks range from 12% for Hong Kong to 35% for Thailand.  Korea and Taiwan are exceptions in that they did not elevate to such bubble levels in 1993.
<p>
Korea is the market where we have been too bullish, too early.  While overweighting Korea was absolutely correct in 1994 (which is the main reason why the fund did well in what was a very difficult year for most Asian funds), we did not cut back sufficiently and then increased exposure again in expectation of a renewed bullmarket in Korea going into 1996.  Our enthusiasm for Korea has been based on the fact that it is the cheapest market in Asia by far on any reasonable valuation yardstick.  This does not mean we are always bullish but rather that we are happy to overweight Korea anytime we see the cycle turning up in our favour.  In late 1995, with the Korean market having corrected down by nearly 20% from its high and temporarily oversold as a result of a corruption scandal involving two former Presidents, we decided that the timing was good for an increased weighting to Korea.  Subsequently, in early 1996, semiconductor prices worldwide collapsed and this has had a bad effect on profits for that important sector as well as for Koreas overall trade figures.  This has extended the market sell-off and deferred the upturn.
<p>
Our view on Korea is that our error was one of timing rather than analysis.  Although we became too bullish, too early we believe the low valuation of the market justifies sticking with the investment itself.  Two anecdotes might be useful in illustrating the point:
<p>
We recently visited a transportation company selling at around stated book value.  Real book value is around 2.5x stated thanks mostly to a large container yard in the centre of Koreas second city, Pusan.  This yard is currently being relocated to the city outskirts and the old site is being redeveloped.  This will obviously realise the hidden asset.  As such, the shares sell at just 40% of asset value.  However, the company also has preference shares which trade at a 68% discount to the ordinary shares.  These shares have the same economic interest but no votes.  As such, purchase of the preference shares represents an investment at 13% of asset value, 6x earnings and 1.8x cash flow.
<p>
We are also interested in another company with a market capitalisation of C$1.8bn.  It owns a plot of land in Inchon (Seouls port) worth C$1.8bn at market value based on agricultural use.  Book value of the land is a mere fraction of this figure.  The site is right in the centre of the port and the local authority is keen to re-zone for industrial use.  As an industrial site, the land would be worth around C$7bn.  Obviously some of the benefit of rezoning would have to be given up but the figures give some idea of the magnitude of the hidden assets involved.  Quite separately, on an operating basis, the stock sells for less than 10x cash flow; not as cheap as others but certainly not excessive.
<p>
Turning to Taiwan, here our bullishness is being well vindicated.  The market was depressed late in 1995 by the missile crisis with China.  This dispute passed with the presidential election in March and the market has been rebounding since then.  We have raised the funds Taiwan exposure significantly.  Although 12% exposure may not seem large when compared to our position in Korea, we are restricted by foreign investment limits.  However, new rules recently passed will allow us to invest up to 10% of the fund directly into Taiwan and we are now seeking the necessary permission from the authorities to do this.  So long as we are able to gain  permission before the market rises too far, we will further increase our Taiwan exposure in due course.
<p>
A very positive factor for both Korea and Taiwan is the fact that the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) Asian indices have just been re-weighted effective September 2nd.  From now on, both Korea and Taiwan are to be given a weighting in all MSCI regional indices equivalent to 50% of the respective capitalisation of each market to reflect the significant steps taken recently to open up access to foreigners.  Previously Korea was accorded only a 20% weighting while Taiwan was zero weighted.  The effect of this on the widely followed MSCI Far East Free (Ex Japan) index is as follows:
<p>
<table>
				 
<b>Before</b>	Korea			3.5%Taiwan  zero		 
 <b>Now</b> Korea	  8%  Taiwan	11%
 </table>
<p>
Up to now, investing in Korea and Taiwan has been mostly confined to specialist funds with little exposure held by the far larger regionally invested funds.  Such funds are heavily influenced by the weightings in their respective benchmarks which have just changed dramatically leaving such investors significantly underweight in both markets.  A recent visit to Morgan Stanleys own small asset management division based in Singapore revealed that they alone would have to invest around C$800m in the two markets just to bring themselves up to a benchmark weighting.
<p>
Finally turning to Hong Kong where we were wrong to be so underweight in 1995.  Back in late 1993, we perceived that Hong Kong had elevated itself into a tremendous stock and property market bubble and we eliminated all our investments in Hong Kong as a result.  This decision hugely benefited our performance in 1994 as the Hong Kong market fell by 45% from its elevated high.  The Hong Kong stockmarket is primarily based on property and the Hong Kong Dollar is fixed to the US Dollar.  Both these factors make this market unusually sensitive to the direction of US interest rates.  The sharp fall in US rates revived the Hong Kong market in 1995 from its 1994 fall.  However, since February 1996, US rates have been on the rise and the Hong Kong stock market has stalled as a result.  Whereas it is true that we were wrong not to re-enter the Hong Kong market in 1995 after the sharp fall that we had correctly anticipated in 1994, the market has gone sideways now for the past seven months in 1996 as you would expect given what has been happening to US rates.  In other words, if we are correct about the continuing risk on US rates, then it will prove right to avoid Hong Kong in 1996.
<p>
To sum up, we did well in 1993 and 1994.  Possibly that caused us to overstay that successful strategy when we should have reversed early in 1995 at the time of the Mexico crisis.  Certainly we did poorly in 1995 as a result.  As is the case in this business, your mistakes often come to haunt you long after the fact.  While we still have to recover from 1995, I believe the investment background has again reversed over the past few months in our favour.  Korea has lagged thus far for reasons that are painfully clear with hindsight.  Our other calls in 1996 have been correct at least relative to an environment for the Asian markets that has been universally poor.  If we are correct in our expectation that US rates are set to rise further, then it will be right to avoid markets closely correlated to US interest rates as we are doing.   At the same time, Korea and Taiwan are in cycles of their own.  Taiwan has definitively started its market upswing, Korea has yet to do so.  Our belief is that it will do so soon.  Although the changes to the MSCI indices are one catalyst, another is the rapid pace of deregulation now sweeping Korea.  New accounting rules now being introduced will greatly increase the transparency and visibility of hidden assets while deregulation of securities laws set for 1.1.97 will allow for merger & acquisition activity for the first time.  This is already promoting the hunt for undervalued companies in Korea and that is precisely where we are positioned.

<CENTER><H2>Up-front investing with David Taylor, Manager, AltaFund Investment Corp. and Altamira Resource Fund</H2></CENTER>
<p>  
<center><h3>August 1996</h3></center>
<BR>
<strong>General Overview</strong> 

<p>

David Taylor, Manager, AltaFund Investment Corp. and Altamira Resource Fund, recently met with our<b> Mutual Fund Specialists</b> to review the performance of the two funds he manages, discuss his investment strategy, and provide his outlook for the next six months. We are pleased to present an edited version of Davids presentation. 
<p>
When we met a few months ago, I told you that my main aim was to reduce the volatility of the Funds because I was given the responsibility to make their returns more predictable. And thats really the way Ive built the portfolios of both the AltaFund and the Resource Fund.<p>
I want consistent performance. I do not want to tell investors that now is a good time to buy the Resource or the AltaFund and that some other time is a bad time to buy the Funds. So Ive reduced the risk profiles of the Funds. 
If you take a look at the average market capitalization of the AltaFund and the Resource Fund, youll find that its significantly higher than that of any other mutual funds in their peer group. The last time I checked, the AltaFund had a market cap of about $1.8 billion and the Resource Fund about $1 billion. Thats quite large. If you take a look at similar funds offered by say, a lot of the competition, theyve got an average market cap of significantly less than that.<p>

I guess another reason why Ive structured my portfolios this way is because I dont want to be there in a bad year to tell investors to sell. So my portfolios have always been designed to do well over a 5 year time period as well as over shorter periods (e.g. one year). The AltaFund and Resource Fund are investments that you can buy and hold. Thats the way Ive always managed money. The most important thing in the way that I run money here is that I am a value investor, Ive always known the company Ive bought. 
There are many resource stocks which are indeed quite speculative. If you want to speculate, you might as well take your money and go down to the race track or to Las Vegas and put it on a number because thats what youre really doing. Theres no valuation being done. Frankly I dont have the skill set designed to speculate and I dont think thats what investors want. <p>

The money being made right now is too easy. About six months ago I sat in this room and said that the special warrants and the junior gold deals which were being done at incredible valuations have got to come to an end because they were absolutely crazy. The euphoria has come to an end and its over now - just like the junior oils in 1992 and 1993. There are no ifs and buts about that. Craig Porter (one of our analysts) has helped build a good portfolio in our Precious Metals Fund. Hes got larger cap names, hes got a good cash position. But as I said before, the markets too speculative, so thats a long way of saying Im building these funds for great 5 year numbers. I want to beat the TSE by 1,000 basis points (i.e. 10%) over a 5 year basis. I think I can do it. But I dont want speculative highs and lows on any given yearly basis. 
<p>
<strong>AltaFund & Resource Fund</strong>
<p>
In AltaFund Ive got a large cash position and the only reason I have that is because I think well be able to pick up some good names in the fall. As I said, if the market weakens, its to our advantage. Theres no reason to chase the market. Sitting at close to 20% cash, Im not going to fall significantly behind the TSE 300. Neither am I going to significantly outperform it but Ill be there when the market corrects. I really believe its going to happen. So Ill be there and well be able to pick up some stocks at great prices and then the latter half of the year should show improvement. 
<p>
As far as my strategy goes, I use a stock by stock basis. I dont look at the sectors in the fund. I do not use a top down approach. Ive never been a top-down manager. Im just trying to find good stocks at good prices and once in a while we will pick up a big block and make a big bet. Every now and then I will pick something off the wall that isnt a gold or oil or cant fit into a general category but just looks good. Then Ill just make a big bet and youll see a 2% or 3% position. But I cant sit here and tell you what sector weightings are going to look like. 
<p>
You wait and see, sticking to your targets. Youve got the 20 stocks that youve identified that are cheap but not just cheap enough and you sit back and wait. Thats all you do, you just wait for some sort of bad news, you wait for somebody to capitulate and you step in, and thats really how I built the portfolio. 
<p>
As far as the Resource Fund goes - in my view its risk is low compared to other resource funds. It seems that every time I try and perhaps add some sexiness to the fund I get completely annihilated. Anytime I try and add some risk and speculate, it doesnt work. Its crazy and thats what this market is right now. Its absolutely crazy on the junior resource side. In December, I thought the trees looked good. Come January, prices continued to fall and we gave back a lot of the profits we made earlier. I thought there was a chance the sector was going to rebound but it did not happen and I quickly moved to reduce our exposure to this sector. I think we were at about 18% Paper and Forest at the beginning of the year and today its only about 9%. Most of it is lumber which has done well. That action saved the Fund considerably. 
<p>
Same with the AltaFund. I sold most of the Paper and Forest stocks and the sector will probably be dead until the fourth quarter. On the oil side, the oil weighting is quite high. In the AltaFund, its 28.5% and in the Resource Fund its 40%. Oil is a great safety net and its a very good sector to be in, extremely defensive. Oil prices are strong, gas prices in the US are strong and the stocks arent that expensive. Theyre sort of half way. You buy it at 4 times cash flow, youll sell at 8. Theyre at about 5.5 right now. I watch the valuations very closely. So thats a great place to be in and that sectors done quite well for both Funds. 
<p>
On the gold side, the AltaFunds weight was 21% in the first week of January. When gold went into backwardation (i.e. spot price higher than future price), I made a quick move and put gold at 20% for the AltaFund and 35% for the Resource Fund. We took profits along the way and the AltaFund today has 15% gold with 3% in Teck while the Resource Fund has 25% of which 4% is Teck. I think that the gold sector and gold valuations got way out of hand. I think its going to be dead for the summer and I believe that gold will continue to fall. I dont own any Barrick, I dont own any Inco or Placer Dome. These stocks are still overpriced. 
<P>
The base metal weighting in AltaFund is 8.5%, in the Resource Fund 18%. Relatively low compared to the big weightings right now in the oils. Again, oils are defensive, have good valuations, and are not speculative at all. 

<p>
<strong><h4>Questions</h4></strong>
<p>
<strong><i>Q. Which of the two areas do you favour - oil or natural
gas?</i></strong>
<p>

Right now its oil. We were bullish on oil prices so I wanted to stretch the portfolio that way. It so happened that they were cheaper. The problem with gas right now is that prices are unbelievably high in the US. Its the highest its been in years. In Canada theres so much gas, they cant get it out of Alberta. So the companies dont show much earnings, their cash flows half decent but gas companies arent making much money. Until you get a pipeline taking the gas out of Alberta into the US market, which we wont see until the first quarter 1998, gas prices wont do all that well. 
<p>
<strong><i>Q. Why do you have such a heavy weighting in Wascana?</i></strong>
<p>
Ive been waiting for somebody to ask about the Wascana weighting. Its about 7.5% in Resource Fund which is the largest weighting. Thats the cheapest oil stock out there right now. Im convinced that it will be taken over. You just dream of the stocks great balance sheet and the company is trading below net asset value, 4.5 times cash flow. Thats the kind of stuff I buy. Downside risk is $1 and the upside is maybe $6. For speculative oil stocks, you end up paying for wells that theyre going to be drilling for the next 10 years. Its already in the stock price, but if you can find a stock thats trading on todays valuation tied into todays production, and all exploration you get is for free, then youre not paying anything for the stock. You jump all over it. Thats the kind of stuff you see in the two funds.
<p>
<strong><i>Q. After the Sumitomo copper scandal, are commodities still in backwardation?</i></strong>
<p>
It still seems to be in backwardation, (backwardation is when the spot price is higher than the future price). The reason you have that is because if you need copper today, that is if say youre a fabricator, you must get copper today. Frankly it doesnt do you good if the mines going to come on in a years time and theres going to be tons of copper hitting the market. For that reason youre willing to pay the spot price.
I have no copper weighting in either fund other than Freeport which is sort of a copper and gold company. I thank heavens I had absolutely no copper. No Inmet, no Rio Algom, no more Princeton - nothing that got hammered.
<p>
<strong><i>Q. Where do you see gold prices heading?</i></strong>
<p>
The fundamentals still havent changed when we talk about supply and demand. Month after month we see the production numbers coming out of South Africa fall and we see demand rising. We saw prices take off in the first quarter. The demand for gold is extremely price sensitive - when the price rises the purchasers of gold for jewellery tend to pull back and just pull right out of the market. Also, the South African Rand has fallen significantly and the price of gold in US dollars has gone up so much that the South African producers sold gold forwards to take advantage of high prices in the first quarter. So all thats happened is delaying the inevitable - instead of gold going up today, it will rise later. The producers have taken all their production and moved it forward, selling at todays market. So gold that was going to hit the market two years out, is now hitting the market today.

<CENTER><H2>Robert Furdak comments on Emerging Markets</H2></CENTER>
<p>
<center><h3>July 1996</h3></center>
<BR>
Emerging markets rebounded from a two-year slump towards the end of 1995. Since then they have shown signs of renewed strength and  are today poised to perform well going forward. Ill firstly discuss some of the reasons as to why now is an excellent time to invest in emerging markets. I will then review where the portfolio is positioned, why weve invested in specific countries and why were not in certain countries.
<p>
We currently follow 27 emerging markets.  They are located in different regions around the world -  Latin America,  Europe, Middle East and Africa (this region is probably one of the fastest growing regions in terms of number of countries), and Asia  -  East, South East and the sub-continent. We are planning to follow two new countries, Russia and Israel. Russia possesses tremendous potential but is quite risky while Israel has many opportunities but its strong economic indicators place it out of the emerging league. 
<p>
Why is now a great time to invest in the emerging markets?  First of all, these  are the most rapidly growing economies in the world right now and its important to capitalize on this growth in your portfolio.  Another reason is the importance of the world economy and the trend towards globalization.  Next, emerging markets have attractive valuations - ratios like P/E multiples and price to book ratios are in particular very good, relative to historical averages. These ratios have come down as a result of the weak performance of these markets over the last couple of years.  Price multiples are now 70% to 80% of what they have been historically.  Finally, diversification benefits continue to be strong in emerging markets and thats something that I think is a real selling point.  People have this preconceived notion that emerging markets are risky and thats true, but diversification reduces that risk.
<p>
Just some statistics in terms of growth.  Over the last 5 years, growth has been 1.9% in the developed countries and 2.2% in emerging countries.  If you look at the forecast for growth over the next couple of years, growth in emerging markets is expected to be much stronger than in the developed markets. There is a positive relationship between high economic growth and high stock market returns.  Since emerging market economies are expected to grow more quickly, their stock market returns should be higher.  So, thats really what were trying to access through the emerging markets.
<p>
However, from an investment point of view its important to realize that economic growth isnt the same as earnings growth and you have to make sure that companies can convert economic growth into corporate profits and earnings growth. There are a lot of inefficiencies in these markets, including things like bribes, kick-backs and governments skimming profits off the top. 
<p>
There are two types of diversification benefits that you should hope to catch in emerging markets. The first one is the diversification across the spectrum of emerging markets. Individual countries are very volatile - they have high standard deviations and can go through large swings. So when people say the emerging markets are risky,  thats true in isolation - any one country is very risky.  
<p>
The benefit of diversification is further enhanced when you combine investments in these countries with investments in developing countries which are going through a different stage of development in the economic life cycle. One country may be experiencing tremendous growth whereas another country may be going through a recession or a even a coup. You can combine these volatile countries into a portfolio that actually has pretty tolerable risk characteristics. We pay particular attention to the risk characteristics as well as the return potential of the markets we  invest in.  
<p>
The second type of diversification stems from diversification of the emerging markets portfolio relative to the Canadian market.  Historically, the correlation has been about 0.4% and right now its about 0.41%.  So there continues to be low correlation between the emerging markets and the Canadian market.
<p>
Another major theme supporting emerging markets is their importance in the world economy. Emerging countries produce 45% of the worlds goods and services and their slice is growing more quickly because their growth rates are higher.  But the emerging markets only make up 9% of the worlds stock markets, yet they produce 45% of the worlds goods and services.  
<p>
So if you think of the typical consumer, whats represented in the basket of goods that they purchase?  They buy shoes from Brazil, clothes from Taiwan and China, steel from Korea, electronics from Korea, light bulbs and pharmaceuticals from Eastern Europe. But if you look at the stocks that they own in their portfolios, they own very few stocks in those particular markets.  It seems to make sense from an economic point of view that the basket of goods they consume should be approximately equal to the basket of stocks that they have in their portfolios.  Thats why I think that the importance of the worlds economy to the emerging markets and the under representation of the stocks within the worlds markets, is  one of the driving forces behind investing in the emerging markets.  
<p>
What will cause market capitalization to increase in the emerging markets?  Firstly,  stock markets are going to grow more quickly, so as prices go up, capitalization will go up.  Secondly, through privatization of state enterprises.  In  a lot of emerging markets, the governments still own a significant portion of the industrial sector.  They own the telephone company, the electric company, a lot of the big retailers, and the airlines. But as governments realize that they cant run these industries efficiently, theyll sell them to the public and that will increase the capitalization.  
<p>
There are also a lot of minor themes in the emerging markets such as cheap labour which is really where the production is.  Production is moving to Mexico, China, South East Asia, and Eastern Europe.  Secondly, political stability.  You may pick up your newspaper every morning and look at whats going on in the world and say, well it doesnt seem like political stability to me - lets see, bribes and bomb explosions in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, a big election in Russia, or Chinese war ships going through the straits of Taiwan.  But if you compare the political scene today versus the political scene 10 or 15 years ago, there really is much more stability.  
<p>
Some of the steps along this evolutionary process that we look for in the emerging markets include a democratically elected president, a set of economic principles that shows that countries are willing to put their economy first above political agendas and things of that nature. Regimes are being kicked out and market oriented economies are really starting to take hold, especially in Eastern Europe.  In Latin America, 15 years ago almost every country was ruled by a dictator, often times a military dictator.  If you look at the real success stories - the economies of Latin America like  Chile and Argentina - have had a very strong military past but the tide has really turned towards consumerism and liberalization. So I think that there really is a sense of political stability in these markets and thats going to be beneficial. 
<p>
In fact, there may be some hiccups along the way and some violence, but often times you need violence to throw the old authoritarian regimes out and have new democratically elected regimes take their place.  So we dont necessarily see violence in a country as a bad sign. Often thats a good sign for change.  
<p>
One of the main reasons why emerging markets have had such a strong run so far this year is that there have been very large capital flows into their equity markets.  The major difference between the strong increase in returns this year versus 2 or 3 years ago or 3 or 4 years ago, is that the capital thats being attracted to these markets now is more stable, long term oriented capital. Whereas in 1993 when the markets were up 70% or 80%, the capital that was flowing in was more transient, short term oriented capital, primarily from big hedge funds.  The hedge funds have increased their capital commitment to the emerging markets, but not nearly as much as long term, stable capital from either  direct investment or corporate pension plans that tend to have a much longer time frame versus hedge funds whose time frames are by the day, week or  by the month.  The large corporate pension plans are taking 3, 4, 5 year time frames on the investments theyre making in the emerging markets.  So I think thats a good sign and one that will eliminate the pulling out of the rug effect when the capital tends to be withdrawn.
<p>
The real by-product of deregulation in the emerging markets is the increased efficiency that allows companies to control their own destiny, to set their own pricing guidelines, and entering markets they want to access without having the invisible hand of government entering into the equation.  Another point, and a real important one is the increased global trade and decreased trade barriers. I think that this is something that benefits everybody.  Trade accords like NAFTA will have a positive impact which will be even greater if expanded to include other countries like Chile.  
<p>
Other trade accords in South East Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America are beneficial because they support decreased tariffs and trade barriers which result in increased corporate profits. Decreased trade barriers not only increase profits, but it allows a country like Brazil, for example, to access Argentinean markets whereas in the past a Brazilian company would never sell its goods to Argentina because it would have to pay 100% duty.  Another factor to consider is the expanding middle class. As countries develop, more people earn money and  they demand more consumer goods which creates the spiral of consumerism. This is more of a stabilizing force as you have a middle class that own stocks and is involved in the economy.
<p>
<strong>Q.  Do you manage all your portfolios that way?</strong>
<p>
Yes.  In fact we have some portfolios that involve pure country selection plays, wherein we pick the countries and then we index within each country. In the emerging markets, more so than in the developed markets, the country allocation decision is very important.
<p>
<strong>Q.  How much emphasis do you place on industries within the countries after the country decision has been made, that is, your strategy to get broad exposure where there may be specific industries that have the most potential, whether it be infrastructure or financial services?</strong>
<p>
Well, once we make the country decision we want broad exposure to all the major industrial sectors within a given market.  If we view one sector as being very attractive, we may have a higher weight in that particular sector than the next market were being compared against. Generally, the deviation is not significant.  If we like natural resource companies and were in Indonesia, were not going to have 50% of our Indonesian portfolio in Indonesian timber companies.  The timber sector only makes up 15% of the market. So we may have 17% to 18% if we like the timber sector but we wont go to 35% or 40%.
<p>
Also, a disciplined approach is very important in the emerging markets as these countries go through economic swings.  Just because there may be some bad news in a particular country may not be a bad time for the market. In fact, if the market over reacts to that bad news, that may present a very good buying opportunity.  When everyone else is selling and it looks like a horror show in the market, you have to possess a lot of discipline to go in and buy during those uncertain times.  But the big money to be made in emerging markets is when the markets go from terrible to bad, not when they go from bad to good.  So youre often  buying markets when theres been bomb explosions or devaluations.
<p>
We also strive for broad diversification both across countries and within countries and we also control risk and trading costs.  Trading costs are very high in the emerging markets, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3% every time you buy and sell a stock. So if you own a stock and you see another stock that you like better, chances are youre going to have to pay on average 3% to sell the stock you have and 3% to buy the stock you want.  Thats a 6% hurdle that youd have to overcome.  So you have to be pretty sure that you like this other stock better.  Thats something that we take into account in terms of trading costs.
<p>
<strong>Q.  Are your country weights relative to the International Finance Corp.    investible Index or are there no parameters?</strong>
<p>
Its the IFC Investible plus or minus a certain amount which depends on the country, what weight it has on the benchmark, whats the liquidity of the market, whats the risk profile of the market and so on.  So there are a lot of factors to consider, not just plus or minus 5% or plus or minus 10%.  Almost all countries will go to 0 and in some countries we can go as high as 30% or 40%.  It just depends on the country. 
<p>
In terms of the two ways that we evaluate a country, one is on a valuation perspective, that is, how much do you have to pay per unit of earnings or access or cashflow? Since growth plays such an important role in the emerging markets, we are willing to pay a higher price multiple for a particular country or a particular company if the growth warrants a higher price.  So we like countries that trade at low price multiples and have high forecast earnings growth.  Thus countries like Brazil, Hungary, Portugal look attractive and countries like Turkey, Malaysia, Venezuela, Indonesia, Philippines look unattractive.
<p>
But there are also other things that enter into the equation, things like interest rates, inflation rates, political risk, structural reforms, the tax situation and the changing tax desire of the particular country.
<p>
In Latin America were overweight in Argentina and Brazil. We  are bullish on Brazil because it is attractive on both a valuation and a growth forecast perspective.  So we have a pretty sizable overweight about 2 times the benchmark weight, the benchmarks about 10% and we have about 20% of the portfolio in Brazil.  It has had a pretty strong return year to date, up 16% through the first 5 months of 1996 in Canadian dollars.  
<p>
Were not quite as optimistic about Argentina but still have an overweight position in this market. Were underweight in Mexico although the market has done fairly well this year. However, we dont think that the impact of the Mexico peso devaluation has really found its way to the Mexican market.  Corporate profits are still expected to be pretty weak, interest rates are still high, in the neighbourhood of 30% to 35%, although theyve come down pretty significantly. In terms of East Asia, the two positions there are both overweight positions.  Korea is one of our favourite markets and really stands out in Asia as being very attractive although the performance has been disappointing this year, down a little over of 3%.  Thats due primarily to the fact that theres been a lot of political turmoil in the market - 3 of the last 4 Korean presidents have been thrown in jail for extortion, slush funds and other incidents of similar nature. But we think potential is still there in Korea. 
<p>
Were positive on the whole Asian subcontinent.  India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka all pretty small markets but we have overweight positions in all three. These markets have been hammered in the last 2 or 3 years and were all  down over 35% last year.  Historically, the markets have traded pretty rich and now they look relatively attractive, even though on an absolute basis, price multiples seem to be pretty rich.  The markets have really rebounded, Indias up over 25% thanks to a successful election.  Pakistan has rebounded as well.  Sri Lanka still has a few troubles but were gradually buying into the weakness in this market.  
<p>
In terms of the broad region of Europe, Mid East and Africa, its a region that were really positive on, especially Eastern Europe.  We have overweight positions in the 3 Eastern European countries - the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary and you can see that all 3 of those counties have had pretty strong returns; Czech Republic up 24%, Hungary up 66%, Poland up 49%.  These are the kind of returns that you can see in a pretty short period of time in the emerging markets and the markets can go up or down in a hurry. These are 3 markets that have really been out of favour for a long time but are starting to rise again.  Also,  were pretty high on Portugal and have an overweight position there.  Russia is a newly established position as of a few weeks ago and we have about 1.5% in that market.  Russia is not in the benchmark but it offers incredible value despite its risks.  Companies trade anywhere from 1 to 5 times earnings, ridiculously cheap relative to their asset values.  The big oil companies trade at 20% or 30% per barrel of proven reserves compared to multinational oil companies like Shell or Exxon or Amoco.

<h2>Historical Returns and Market Timing Revisited</h2>
<p>
The chart below shows the value of $1 invested in various types of investments covering the period 1957 to March 1995 (reliable data is not available prior to 1957).
<p>
As you can see, although Canadian stocks are more volatile (i.e. have more risk) than the other types of investments, over the long term they produce a better rate of return.
<p>
<center><img src="/altamira/gifs/37yrs.gif"width=60%></center> 
 
Longer-term investors who are saving for retirement should take advantage and always have a portion of their assets in stocks. Investors should ignore the short term volatility of stock markets and remember that they are investing for the long term.
<p>

 
Investment experts agree that there is never a "best time" to begin investing in the stock market. The key is the length of time you are prepared to invest, not when you begin. Most professional investors will agree that using market timing as an investment tactic is extremely difficult. The historical record tells a sobering tale: if, for example, we looked at the Equity Fund and you had been out of the market on its best 40 days, your average annual return would have been only 14.3%. But if you had stayed in for the full 7 years, riding the market's ups and downs  your average annual return would have been 22.7%!
<p>
Many of the best returns in the stock and bond markets occur within a very short time frame, and accordingly, any attempts to time market peaks consistently are almost certainly doomed to failure.

There is <i>no front or back-end load</i> charged on Funds offered by
Altamira. Ever. Because we deal directly with you, <b>no sales
commission is charged when you buy or sell investments.</b> You can

all fees charged by Altamira)<p>
By investing directly with Altamira, <i>every dollar you contribute to
your portfolio goes straight to work for you.</i> And when you need

<font size=+2><li></font><a name="step3"><b>Stay informed on financial planning and investment issues with <i>Portfolio</i></b></a><br>
Altamira's quarterly investment newsletter, <b>Portfolio</b>, will keep
you informed on the latest developments in investing and personal
financial planning.<p>
Mailed to you on a complimentary basis, <b>Portfolio</b> is fast-paced and
well-written. You'll find it a useful resource to help you make
investment decisions, and keep up-to-date with new legislation and
tax changes that will affect you throughout the year.
<hr width=20% align=center>
<font size=+2><li></font><a name="step4"><b>Balance your portfolio - make sure your investments continue to perform as the economy changes</b></a><br>
 
 Over the period of an investors lifetime, the economy changes.
 The simple fact is, there are prosperous times and there are periods
 of recession and inflation. Furthermore, depending on the prevailing
 economic cycle, some asset classes will perform better in a recession
 than they will in prosperous times.

 At Altamira, we believe that if your portfolio is well balanced-- that is,
 includes a number of different types of assets ( bonds, stocks,
 real estate, and cash )---your investments will be protected during
 changing economic cycles.

<h3>YOU SIMPLY CAN'T COUNT ON MARKET TIMING.</h3>

 Historically, individual investors and even professional managers who 
 try to capitalize on "market timing" ( for example, switching between 
 stocks, bonds, cash depending on the economic climate) are usually
 disappointed.  They just aren't in a position to take advantage of
 opportunities when they arise. But a well-diversified portfolio,
 that is rebalanced from time to time does produce results.

<h3>REBALANCE--- POSITION YOUR PORTFOLIO TO PERFORM CONSISTENTLY.</h3>

Rebalancing your portfolio is a powerful disciplinary tool that allows
 you to manage your investments for profit, by selling high and buying low.
 For example, you may have decided originally that an investment mix of
  60% in stocks and 40% in bonds met your objectives. However, due to a
 prosperous period in the economy, you find that the stock component 
of your portfolio grows to 75% while bonds now represent only 25% by value.
 In this case, we would advise you to take profits and rebalance back
 to your original mix so that when the economic cycle reverses-- as it 
always does--- you will be positioned to take advantage of the change. 
<hr width=20% align=center>
<font size=+2><li></font><a name="step5"><b>Identify your financial goals and invest in your future</b></a>
How far away are you from achieving your financial goals? And when
do you expect to use your investment?<p>
Whether you plan to start your own business_ buy vacation property_
change careers_ travel_ or simply even slow down and start enjoying
a more leisurely lifestyle, answering these questions is <i>vital</i>
toward developing the best asset mix for your portfolio.<p>
Generally, the further you are from your goal, the more growth
assets you should include in your portfolio. The closer you are to
your goal, the more fixed-income and guaranteed investments you
should include.<p>

<a name="howmuch"><h3>Your retirement: How much income will you need?</h3></a>
As governments take an increasingly hard look 
at universal social programs and growing deficits, 
Canadians are becoming more and more concerned about their ability to meet their individual income 
needs during retirement. 
<img src="http://www.altamira.com/altamira/gifs/dn-lifes.gif"width=45% align=right border=2> 
This chart shows how your income must grow in the coming years to maintain your current purchasing power after the effects of inflation (calculated in this example at  four and six percent).  While inflation is currently at extremely low levels, you should keep in mind  that over the last 20 years, inflation has averaged around 5%.  
It is also useful to examine how great a difference your cash needs will be on the basis of a mere two-percent difference in inflation rates over the span of the next ten, twenty and thirty years.
For example, assuming four percent inflation, today's income of $60,000 must grow to almost $200,000 in 30 years to stay even in real purchasing power.  If the average inflation rate over that same period were six percent, you would need almost $350,000 a year to live as you do today - a difference of almost $150,000 a year.
Despite the numerous articles published extolling the benefits of RRSPs, recent studies have shown that only about 50 per cent of all Canadians own an RRSP.  This is surprising, given the widely held belief that government pensions will be at best insufficient, and at worst nonexistent, when today's thirtysomethings reach retirement age.
People are most likely to begin investing in RRSPs as they approach the age of 40, when the prospect of retirement becomes more real to them.  In recent years, however, the average age of contributors has fallen somewhat as younger investors have become more concerned about the state of the economy and their own career prospects.

<a name="history"><h3>The History of RRSPs.</h3></a>
Registered Retirement Savings Plans came into 
being  in 1957.  Since then, all Canadians who have an earned income under the age of 69 have been allowed to contribute to an RRSP, make contributions to a pension plan, and to deduct those contributions from their taxable income. The government's intention was 
to encourage Canadians to save for retirement and 
thus, reduce the eventual burden on the public purse. Previous to this initiative, only employees who 
belonged to company-sponsored pension plans were allowed to deduct pension contributions from their taxable incomes.
In the early years, the dollar amount of funds 
deposited into RRSPs grew slowly. During that period, RRSPs were only offered by insurance companies. But, in the mid-1960s, the mutual fund industry began offering RRSPs, and by 1975, the chartered banks had jumped on the band wagon. Since then, competition has grown each year and growth has been dramatic: in 1968 less than $175 million was held on deposit in RRSPs. By 1988, more than 20% of Canadian taxpayers, or approximately 3.8 million people, had opened RRSPs, contributing over $10.5 billion. In 1989, contributions had jumped to $30.3 billion. And by 1991, total RRSP holdings were approximately 
$129 billion.
One of the major growth factors for RRSPs over the years has been legislative increases in contribution limits. Total RRSP contributions more than doubled from 1971 to 1972, the first time the limit was raised. In 1976 and 1986, when limits were again raised, contribution levels soared in response. In every case, such increases have led to greater participation and higher average contributions. The contribution limit for RRSPs will continue to rise significantly until 1996, when it will be indexed to the growth in the average industrial wage. For this reason, RRSP contributions are anticipated to continue their rapid growth over the next few years.  
However, this trend may be offset by the introduction of a system of pension adjustments (PA) for 
people who belong to company-sponsored pension plans.  These people may find their RRSP contribution limits significantly reduced or even eliminated as 
the government searches out new tactics to fight the national deficit.
<a name="sources"><h3>Sources of retirement income</h3></a>
Most people planning for retirement realize that government pension plans do not pay enough for them to maintain an adequate lifestyle after they leave the workforce. They also realize that responsibility for 
building a retirement nest-egg rests with themselves 
_ and no one else!
In some cases, company pension plans will cover the basics, but unless they include generous indexing provisions, other sources of income will also be needed. Those without company pension plans, for example professionals and small business owners, are in even greater need of retirement planning.
<a name="pension"><h3>Pension income options</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>Government pensions</b>
<dd>The primary sources of government pensions are the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), and the Old Age Security Plan (OAS).
CPP/QPP benefits depend on the individual's contributions to the plan and the number of years he or she has contributed. Based on 1992 figures, the Canada Pension Plan paid a maximum of $7,633.32 per year. OAS benefits are paid to all Canadians who meet the age and residency requirements. For 1992, the maximum Old Age Security paid was $4,509.03, so the combined maximum available from government pensions that year  was $12,142.35.
<dt><b>Company pensions</b>
<dd>Most companies with 500 or more employees provide company-sponsored pension plans. Fewer than 20 % of those working for companies with 200 employees or less have such coverage. Since over 99.8% of Canadian companies are small businesses, clearly the vast majority of employees need to make their own arrangements for ensuring that they receive an adequate income on retirement.
 The major types of company-sponsored pension 
plans are: 
<dl>
 <dt><b>Registered Pension Plans (RPPs)</b>
<dd>The term "Registered Pension Plan" refers to Defined Contribution Pension Plans or Defined Benefit Pension Plans which are accepted by Revenue Canada for registration under the Income Tax Act.
<dt><b>Defined Benefit Plans (DBPs)</b>
<dd>Defined Benefit Plans incorporate a promise to pay retired employees a regular income stream calculated according to a predetermined formula.  The employer (also referred to as the "sponsor") carries the risk of 
the promise.
<dt><b>Defined Contribution Plans (DCPs)</b>
<dd>DCPs (also referred to as "Money Purchase Plans") define the annual contributions required by the employer and/or employee.  The size of the pension depends on the amount of accumulated contributions and earnings in the plan.
<dt><b>Deferred Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs)</b>
<dd>A Deferred Profit Sharing Plan is a trust arrangement registered under the Income Tax Act in which an employer contributes a portion of the company's profits for the benefit of employees.  Employees are not allowed to make contributions to a DPSP.
</dl>
</dl>
<a name="nonpension"><h3>Non-pension income options</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>Home equity</b>
<dd>There are two ways in which home equity can be used to finance retirement:
<ul>
<li> proceeds from the sale of a home or cottage can be 		invested to provide a retirement income, 
<br><i>or</i><br>
<li> equity which has built up in a home can be 			converted to income using a reverse mortgage.
</ul>
<dt><b>Sale proceeds</b>
<dd>Many people hold the majority of their assets 
as equity in their homes and assume that, when they retire and with the children gone, they will sell the family home, buy or rent a smaller place, and still 
have a great deal of money left over to finance a comfortable lifestyle.
However, when they do retire, reality is often quite different. Real estate may no longer be a "sure thing". Today, values have plummeted in many communities across the country. 
Many retirees discover that they like being close to their families, they feel comfortable in their neighbourhoods, and they don't want to move _ so they don't. But their standard of living may decline considerably as they try to get along without the funds they had planned  to receive from the sale of their home. Moreover, without solid retirement financial planning they may find themselves struggling to pay rising taxes and increasing utility and maintenance bills for their homes.
<dt><b>Reverse mortgages</b>
<dd>Homeowners who have built up substantial equity in their property may be interested in obtaining reverse mortgages. It is an option that allows them to access their equity to supplement their retirement income, yet continue to reside in their own homes. This option more often appeals to individuals who are not concerned about whether the property passes into their estate intact.
There are two basic types of reverse mortgages 
available: the straight reverse mortgage, and the reverse annuity mortgage. A straight reverse mortgage pays the homeowner a monthly payment over a specified term. These payments build a mortgage against the residence. When the agreed-upon term has expired, the mortgage comes due and the homeowner must 
repay the mortgage in full, usually through the sale of the home. 
With a reverse annuity mortgage, the homeowner uses a portion of his or her equity to purchase an annuity with a term matching that of the mortgage. As with other annuities, the income the homeowner receives is based on the individual's life expectancy, sex, marital status and prevailing interest rates. When the home is sold, (or  upon the death of the homeowner) the homeowner (or estate), receives the difference between the sale price of the home and the income received from the reverse mortgage. 
Reverse mortgages are, generally, best suited to individuals who want to generate extra income on a temporary basis. They must be prepared to sell their homes within a few years, or anticipate receiving income from other sources that will allow them to repay the mortgage debt they will build up.  Homeowners who wish to receive long-term income via this option should recognize that, on their deaths, there may be little or no residual value from the home available to their estates after the reverse mortgage has been repaid.
<dt><b>Non-registered investments</b>
<dd>Aside from home equity and registered investments, many individuals also have a portfolio of investments which are unregistered. Perhaps they have been buying Canada Savings Bonds through a payroll deduction plan. Maybe they have been investing in mutual funds. Or perhaps they have GICs or a rental property or two, which can provide a regular income. Invested wisely, these assets may provide the additional income needed to supplement their pensions.
</dl>
<a name="why"><h3>Why people buy RRSPs</h3></a>
While the primary focus of an RRSP is to save 
for retirement, Canadians buy RRSPs for a variety of reasons: 
<dl>
<dt><b>Deferring taxes</b>
<dd>The full amount contributed to an RRSP (up to an annual legislated limit) can be deducted from the income of the contributor for taxation purposes.  No income tax is paid on these funds (or any earnings from them) until they are withdrawn from the plan.
<br>Example: <br>
Patty Martin  invested $7,500 in a non-registered mortgage fund earning interest of 10%, or $750, annually. Her marginal tax rate was 46%.  As a result, she paid tax of $345 (i.e., $750 x 46% ) on the interest she earned, leaving her with an after-tax net gain of $405 to reinvest. Of course, any returns she receives from reinvesting these funds outside an RRSP will also be subject to taxation at her top, marginal rate.
Patty's sister, Margaret, invested $7,500 in an RRSP Bond Fund which earned 10% annually. She, too, earned $750 in interest. However, all the interest Margaret earned will remain tax-sheltered as long as it's held in the RRSP. This means her RRSP will have the full $750 to reinvest. Moreover, any gains that these funds earn will not be taxed so long as the proceeds remain within the RRSP. At a marginal tax rate of 46%, Margaret will also see her tax bill reduced by approximately $3,450 for having made her RRSP contribution ($7,500 x 46% = $3,450).  In other words, Margaret's  $7,500 investment in an RRSP will have actually earned her a return of $4,200 in the first year ($750 + $3,450 = $4,200) and will continue earning tax-free income so long as the proceeds are reinvested within the RRSP.   

The following chart demonstrates the growth of an RRSP when annual contributions of $5,500 and $12,500 are made each year earning a regular rate of return of 8%, 10% and 12%. As you can see, the RRSP's ability to compound on a tax-free basis means significant growth over the long term.
<dt><b>Tax-averaging</b>
<dd>People who leave the work force to return to school, to start families, or as a result of layoffs will have periods where their income flows are significantly reduced. These people can take advantage of an RRSP's tax-averaging abilities.
While any funds removed from an RRSP are fully taxable in the year they are received, there is no penalty for collapsing or making early withdrawals from an RRSP. As a result, many people contribute to an RRSP during high-income years when their marginal tax rates are highest and make withdrawals in  years when both their incomes and marginal rates of taxation are lower.
<dt><b>Income splitting</b>
<dd>Individuals can make tax-deductible contributions to a spouse's RRSP as well as their own, as long as the total of both contributions does not exceed the contributor's RRSP Contribution Limit. Using a Spousal RRSP as an income-splitting vehicle allows people to reduce the amount of income tax paid on the proceeds from their RRSPs once withdrawals begin.
If, for example, a wife contributes to a spousal RRSP for her husband, the funds will accumulate in his name. When the RRSP matures, the money withdrawn will be taxed at his lower rate, assuming he has less taxable income than she does. 
Using this tactic, husbands and wives can mature their plans separately, pay tax on the funds separately, and reduce the overall amount of tax they jointly have to pay. This approach may also reduce the likelihood that Old Age Security benefits will be subject to clawback. 
Finally, a spousal RRSP will provide the spouse with a source of income which qualifies for the pension income tax credit.
Please refer to Booklet Number 5 for more information on Income Splitting.
<dt><b>The Pension income tax credit</b>
<dd>Income from a converted RRSP (e.g., an RRIF or annuity) qualifies as retirement income.  As a result, it  qualifies for the $1,000 pension income tax credit _ the first $1,000 in pension income earned each year is tax-free. If both spouses have RRSPs, each can take advantage of this pension income tax credit. Without a source of pension income, however, this tax credit cannot be used.  
</dl>
<a name="planning"><h3>Planning actively for retirement</h3>
Last, but by no means least, by using RRSPs, Canadians can achieve a greater sense of well-being by actively planning for their own retirement. They will not have to rely solely on government and company pension plans for their future financial security. Instead, they can take direct action to achieve the level of retirement income they will need to meet their specific needs.
<a name="unique"><h3>A unique savings opportunity</h3></a>
As you can see, the reasons people buy RRSPs are as unique as the individuals who buy them. For some, company pension plans may be insufficient to meet all their retirement needs. Others may have no company pension plan and an RRSP will help them to ensure that they do not have to rely solely on government pensions.
RRSPs provide Canadians with a unique and highly effective way to save for retirement. By maximizing the tax benefits that can be achieved through income-averaging and income-splitting, RRSPs provide one of the last remaining vehicles which allow Canadians to reduce their income taxes. They should be an integral part of every Canadian's personal financial plan.

<h2>The Advantages of an Altamira Self-Directed RRSP</h2>
<BR>

those offered by other financial institutions and you'll find

telephone, toll-free, any weekday between the hours of 8:30 a.m.
and 5:30 p.m.  Our representatives can provide up-to-the-minute 
quotes, update the current status of your account, execute your 
orders, or answer any questions about the plan.</P>

<P><b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSPs</b> are facilitated through FMSL.

This crucial factor can help you achieve maximum wealth 
creation for your self-directed RRSP portfolio.</P>

an <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSP</b> can offer substantial 
savings compared to the cost of a full service broker.  
Our representatives give you access to every major stock 
exchange in Canada and the United States and you are assured
of timely and accurate execution of trades.</P>

<h3>Consolidate all your RRSPs</h3>

<P>The <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSP</b> plan allows you to

and important way to ensure that your total portfolio remains

through foreign securities.  An <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSP</b>

to achieve maximum foreign exposure.</P>

<h3>Profit From Information</h3>

<P><b>Altamira</b> offers you full access to FMSL research including 
Investor Outlook, a monthly newsletter with Equity and Fixed 
Income market comments.</P>

<h3>When should I convert my RRSP to an Altamira Self-Directed RRSP?</h3>

<P>As your RRSP assets grow you will need to diversify your portfolio.
An Altamira Self-Directed RRSP enables you to simplify your recordkeeping
by allowing you to deal with one institution; with one low annual fee!</P>

<h3>Financing Your Contribution</h3>

<P>Contributing the maximum each year to your <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSP</b>
is not always easy.  To help you get the most out of your RRSP, here 
are two ways you can maximize your contributions:</P>

<h3>You Can Make Non-Cash Contributions</h3>

<P>Instead of cash, you can contribute any qualifying security to 
your <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSP.</h2>  The dollar amount of your
contribution and tax receipt will be equal to the market value 
of the securities on the day of deposit or transfer into your plan.
Of course, any securities deposited as a new contribution must be
within your contribution limit.</P>

<h3>You Can Make Automatic Contributions</h3>

<P>Your <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSP</b> can be set up so that
contributions are deducted regularly from your chequing 
account for any mutual fund purchase.  This method is convenient
and, at the same time, it addresses the problem of  "when to invest".</P>

<h3>Call Now</h3>

<P>To  receive more information on <b>Altamira Self-Directed RRSPs</b>
and Altamira No-Load Mutual Funds, call our Altamira Personal Service
Representatives at 1-800-508-9176 or, in the local Toronto area,

<h2>Questions & Answers</h2>

<OL>
<LI><P><I><B>How do I open an Altamira Self-Directed RRSP?</B></I></P>
<P>At your request, Altamira will supply you with the necessary forms
and will be happy to discuss appropriate investments for your
financial goals and risk tolerance.</P>

<LI><P><I><B>How do I transfer existing RRSPs?</B></I></P>
<P>Simply return your signed authorization for the requested 
transfer to an Altamira representative and we will do the rest.</P>

<LI><I><P><B>Can I open a Self-Directed Spousal RRSP?</B></I></P>
<P>Yes.  Your contributions are subject to your personal annual
contribution limit (the tax receipt will be issued to you 
as the contributor).  You benefit from income splitting at 
retirement when your tax rates are likely to be lower.</P>

<LI><I><P><B>When May I Contribute?</B></I></P>
<P>Although we recommend contributing as soon as possible each 
year so that you maximize your investment term, contributions 
for any given year can be made during that year and the first 
60 days of the following year.  Note, there is a seven year carry
forward provision for any unused contribution allowance.</P>

<LI><I><P><B>How do I keep track of the foreign holdings in my RRSP?</B></I></P>
<P>First Marathon Securities Limited monitors the foreign content 
proportion of your account to ensure that you are notified when 
foreign holdings exceed the allowable foreign content limit.</P>

<LI><I><P><B>Can I open a RRIF?</B></I></P>
<P>A Registered Retirement Income Fund is a way to pay yourself 
the funds from your RRSP at retirement.  By paying yourself in
small increments, you reduce your tax burden at that time.  You
can transfer an existing RRIF or RRSP to Altamira Securities.  If you
don't need a RRIF now, we will help you convert you RRSP to a 
RRIF when required.</P>

<LI><I><P><B>How secure are my holdings?</B></I></P>
<P>The cash component of your Altamira Self-Directed RRSP/RRIF, 
other than Altamira CashPerformer, is held by SunLife Trust 
(wholly-owned by SunLife Insurance Company).</P>
<P>Securities will be held at First Marathon Securities Limited.
With more than $250 million in equity capital, FMSL provides 
additional insurance up to $2,000,000  above the maximum $500,000
coverage provided by the Canadian Investor Protection Fund.</P>

	<H1>Consider The Benefits of a Group RRSP</H1>
	</center>	


<BR>

<P>The growing popularity of Group RRSP's is due to many factors.
Not the least of which is the increasing burden of cost and 
administration which a traditional pension plan places upon the
employer.  Whether offered as a supplement or as an alternative
to a company pension plan ,a  Group RRSP offers both employers 
and employees a large number of benefits.</P>

<h2>EMPLOYER BENEFITS</h2>

<P>As a primary benefit to the employer a Group RRSP is considerably
more flexible and significantly less costly than an RPP.</P>

<P>To list just some of the advantages to the employer:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>There are no actuarial fee's on a Group RRSP.</P>
<LI><P>Legislation is standard across Canada.</P>
<LI><P>Employer funding costs (if any) are known and cease if 
any change occurs in an employee status.</P>
<LI><P>And the employer can claim corresponding tax deductions,
because contributions are a taxable benefit.</P>
</UL>

<h2>EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</h2>
<P>At the same time the benefits to the employee are also significant.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Unlike more traditional pension plans, the Group RRSP gives 
employee's the ability to custom tailor their investment program.</P>
<LI><P>Regular statements enable employee's to monitor performance.</P>
<LI><P>Retirement savings may be rolled into a RRIF, rather than
the employee being forced to annuitize.</P>
<LI><P>Other RRSP's may be transferred into a Group plan to
consolidate retirement savings, and</P>
<LI><P>Non-payroll contributions and spousal plans are permitted.</P>
</UL>

<h2>ADVANTAGES OF AN  ALTAMIRA PLAN</h2>

<P>The advantages of a Group RRSP become even more significant 
when it is a Group RRSP from Altamira.</P>

<P>The following are some of the key advantages that an Altamira
RRSP can offer your group.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>Over 25 years of investment experience. Altamira has been
managing pensions and other institutional portfolios since 1969.
Altamira's portfolio managers are all partners in the firm and
are recognized industry leaders.</P>
<LI><P>No-Load investing. Participants never pay a commission to 
buy, sell, or switch investments in the Altamira plan.</P>
<LI><P>A family of mutual funds. Altamira provides participants 
with a wide range of investment products to satisfy the investment
objectives of both sophisticated and novice investors.  
The product line is carefully designed to allow investors 
to build a well diversified portfolio custom tailored to 
the individuals specific needs.</P>
<LI><P>As an added advantage, the administration and service
extended by Altamira is unmatched.  Altamira's in-house
computer system and proprietary software provide efficient 
daily processing, on-line accounting information.</P>
<LI><P>Altamira has offices across Canada to service clients,
and participants are free to visit any of the investor 
service centers or may deal with their local office entirely
by phone, fax, or post.</P>
<LI><P>Altamira's salaried investor services representatives 
provide expert, unpressured investment advice free of charge. 
It's just a phone call away.</P>
<LI><P>Altamira's toll free hotline allows investor's to instantly
access Service Representatives and receive advice, access 
on-line account information.</P>
<LI><P>And Altamira's Moneyline Service enables participants 
to conduct business by telephone, to chose which funds they 
wish to invest in and to electronically transfer funds between 
their Altamira Account and chequing account at no charge.</P>
<LI><P>Once an Altamira Group RRSP is set-up , Altamira provides
all participants with a detailed enrollment package containing
everything they need to invest. Representatives arrange employee
lunch workshops were investing and fund selection are discussed.
Follow up workshops are generally provided once a year. In 
addition to regular account statements, participants receive
publications at their home to continue the education process 
and to keep them informed.</P>
<LI><P>Participants can deal either directly with Altamira or 
through your company's human resource department.</P>
</UL>

        <H1>Mortgage Calculator - Help</H1>
        </CENTER>

<HR size=2 WIDTH=90% ALIGN=center>
<BR>
The Mortgage Calculator is designed to cover many of the financial aspects of holding a 
mortgage.  The different variables are explained as follows:
<DL>
<DT>Principal
<DD>Allows you to calculate the size of the mortgage attainable, given the interest rate,
and the payment amount that you feel comfortable with.  
<DT>Interest Rate
<DD>Given the size of the mortgage, the payment amount, and the frequency of payment, 
you will be able to see the interest rate required to meet this obligation.
<DT>Payment Frequency
<DD>Frequency refers to the timeliness of your mortgage payments.  By increasing the speed
of your mortgage payments, you can save considerable time and money over the term of your
mortgage.  By altering the frequency of payments you can see the difference.<BR>
eg. bi-monthly vs. monthly
<DT>Amortization Period
<DD>The amortization period refers to the length of time the mortgage is outstanding.  Most
traditional mortgages are amortized over 25 years.  By altering the inputs, you can see the
effect this will have on the mortgage.
<DT>Prepayments
<DD>Most mortgages allow the holder to prepay a certain amount of the mortgage on its
anniversary date.  Over the life of the mortgage, prepaying can substantially shorten
the life of the mortgage, and reduce the total interest paid over that same period.
The calculator allows you to compare different scenarios by entering different prepayment
amounts, or none at all.

        </CENTER>

<HR size=2 WIDTH=90% ALIGN=center>



Capital Builder will aid in calculating Present Value, Future Value, return requirements,
and time horizons to name just a few.  Listed below are various senarios you may find useful
in conjunction with your own financial goals.
<DL>
<DT>Future Value Calculation
<DD>Many investors set aside periodic savings to accommodate their future plans.
Given the length of time these payments are made, and the projected return on these
payments, the Capital Builder will calculate the final value of this stream of payments.<BR><BR>
<DT>Payments Calculation
<DD>The payment calculation will help you determine how much you need to save to meet a given 
financial objective.  For example, you may want to make a purchase in 5 years requiring
capital of $20,000.  Capital Builder will tell you the required payment to meet this goal.
Simply plug in your present savings, future amount required, are rate or return assumption,
and the calculator will supply the payment required.<BR><BR>
<DT>Present Value
<DD>Present Value refers to the value today of a payment or payments to be received at a 
future date.  Capital Builder will allow you to value future cash streams such as an Annuity
or any other future sum.  Simply plug in the missing variables such as future value, inflation
assumption, and time frame for the payment.<BR><BR>
<DT>Rate of Return
<DD>The Rate of Return calculation will tell you the rate of return required to meet a certain
financial goal.  For example, you may be investing $5000 today, in hopes of having $15,000 in
10 years time.  By plugging in $5000 as the present value, $15,000 as the future value, and 10 
years as the time horizon, the calculator will tell you the return you must achieve to reach your
goal of $15,000.

<BR>
Most Financial planners say "Pay yourself first".  A good rule of thumb to managing your
cashflow is to pay yourself 10% of your gross salary before other monthly expenditures.
The Cash Management Calculator will help you gauge how much you are spending, and on what
items you are spending the most.  By tracking your expenditures, you will be in a better
position to see where additional savings may be achieved.  We hope this is a useful tool in
managing your current and future expenditures...<BR>

<pre>
The rates of return for the periods ended December 31, 1996, and are the simple rates 
of return ( 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year) or average annual compound rates of return
( 2,3,4,5 and 10 years) including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions
and do not take into account any optional charges payable by any unitholder which would 
have reduced returns.  Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
Mutual Funds are sold by prospectus only. The simplified prospectus contains important
information which you should read carefully before investing. Also note pages two and
three of our prospectus for all fees pertaining to our funds. As with all Altamira Funds 
there is no front or back-end loads; only a one-time forty dollar set-up fee.</pre>

<H2>Beyond the front-lines</H2>

<P>Most of you are familiar with our <I>Mutual Fund Specialists</I> and 
Portfolio Managers who are at the forefront of our operations. 
However, beyond the frontlines is a dedicated team of support 
staff from the Administration Services Department whom you may 
never speak to, but whose role is to ensure that you obtain a 
superior level of service.</P> 

<P>The department is always a hub of customer-related activities,
 working in seamless combination with other departments to set 
up new accounts, process investment transactions, maintain customer
 records, transfer RRSPs, and ensure that investors are informed about 
their account activities.</P>

<P>"I love the pace", claims Ramya De Silva, a senior account administrator. 
"There's always something to do for our clients which cannot be put-off 
until tomorrow", she continued. "Working long hours and on weekends during
 high-volume periods like the RRSP season is quite normal", added Beverly 
Stuart, a quality control administrator who has been with Altamira for ten 
years. "Fresh challenges emerge regularly, allowing me to draw upon my
 experience. Resolving customer-related issues each day gives me a sense 
of achievement and fulfilment that is difficult to put in words," she further
 enthused.</P> 

<TABLE ALIGN=left BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=20>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="jane.gif" ALT="Jane Stephenson Photo" WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=261 BORDER=0><BR>
Jane Stephenson<BR>Manager Administration Services</TD</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Speed, timeliness and accuracy are essential in the demanding
 operations environment. "We always strive to do things right 
the first time to meet our investors'  expectations," said Esther
 Stoller-Herman, a supervisor. "That's why we have a number of
 checks and balances in place to catch errors", added Tina Tran,
 who oversees new accounts processing. Our staff's strong sense 
of commitment and teamwork have earned Altamira the enviable 
reputation of having one of the best mutual fund operations 
departments in the industry.</P> 

<P>Training plays a crucial role in the Department's success, 
with an emphasis on cross-training. The trained and versatile
 staff are required to have knowledge of a range of inter-related
 issues and processes. "This is because we deal with the entire 
lifecycle of a transaction and one action impacts upon another",
 explained Jane Stephenson, the department's manager. Altamira 
devotes considerable human and financial resources to training
 and development so that our staff can provide quality services
 to our valued investors, and also to promote mobility within 
the company. Staff are encouraged to regularly upgrade their 
skills by taking industry-related courses for which Altamira 
bears the full cost.</P> 

<P>Esther Herman-Stoller was once a member of Altamira's front-line
 team of Mutual Fund Specialists. She now enjoys the challenge 
of being behind the scenes. "I put myself in the investor's shoes
 and try to imagine what kind of service I would expect", she said,
 summing up the outlook of the entire department.</P>

<H4>The President Comments...</H4>

<H2>Long term investors need not fear market volatility</H2>

<UL>

<P>As we go through periods of volatility in the 
financial markets, I encourage you to keep a 
long term perspective on investing and not to over-react 
to short term market gyrations. Over and over again we have
 seen investors lose out on substantial gains by allowing short 
term fluctuations to influence their investment decisions. 
There is overwhelming evidence to show that investors who 
ride through the periods of volatility end up gaining when
 markets stabilize and re-establish their long term upward 
trend.</P>

<P>Mutual funds were created to help smaller investors pool 
their resources and invest in a diversified portfolio that
 is professionally managed at a reasonable cost. Prior to 
the advent of mutual funds, smaller investors did not have
 access to these managers, as well as to certain asset classes
 like foreign equities, which were only available to institutional 
investors such as pension funds.</P>

<P>I have found that too many investors have unrealistic 
expectations as to what rates of return they should get 
from a diversified mutual fund portfolio. Some investors
 believe that mutual funds are like individual stocks and
 expect to find another "Bre-X" in their fund investments.
 This is unrealistic. Instead, what you should expect from 
a long term investment in mutual funds are returns superior 
to those provided by "risk free" investments such as T-bills
 and GICs.</P> 

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="indice.gif" ALT="Indice comparisons" ALIGN=middle WIDTH=552 HEIGHT=292>
</CENTER>

<P>Over the last 20 years, for example, if you had invested 
in T-bills, your return would have been 9.66%, stocks 12.13%
 (based on the TSE 300), and bonds 11.38% (based on the
 ScotiaMcLeod Universe). Professional management of your
 money provides an opportunity to increase these returns,
 especially if you stay invested for the long term.</P> 

<P>Some investors chase short term performance numbers rather 
than concentrate on their long term goals. Funds should not
 be purchased based on "hot" short term results. All too often 
investors who buy funds with "hot" short term numbers are 
disappointed or confused when those results are not repeated 
quickly. Their unfulfilled expectations then lead them to cash 
out their positions or make the same mistake again by switching
 to the next "best" fund, only to be disappointed once again.</P> 

<P>Just as it is important to stay the course with your funds, 
it is also important to stay the course with your savings plan.
 Successful investors pay themselves first, invest consistently
 in good, long term investments, and allow time - not market 
timing - to produce good, solid returns for their portfolios.</P>

<P>You should take advantage of the professional management and 
diversification provided by mutual fund investments by 
disciplining yourself to save consistently. Your first goal
 should be to start saving, the second to keep saving, and
 the third is to invest your money to meet your goals. If 
these goals are long term, then I believe that well managed
 mutual funds are an excellent vehicle to allow you to meet
 them. You should pick the funds in which you invest based 
on their long term track records and fund objectives, and not
 based on "hot" short term performance which may not be repeated.</P>

<P>So rather than being afraid of volatility, you should take 
advantage of this market phenomenon. Start a disciplined savings
 program and stick with it. Do not let short term fluctuations
 force you into losing sight of your long term financial goals.</P>

<P>It obviously is a more intelligent strategy to take profits from
 those funds that are doing well and purchase those that have a
 good record but are weak perhaps due to the market conditions.</P>

<H2>Successful investors pay themselves first</H2>

<UL>

<P>Each of us has different investment goals with different 
timeframes for achieving them. For example, you may 
wish to go on a vacation next year, or would like to buy a 
new home in a few years, or you may be looking further ahead
 towards your retirement. Whether your goals are short term 
or long term, it is important that you save some of your earnings
 to achieve them.</P> 

<P>We have found that most successful investors achieve their
 goals by paying themselves first, no matter how much (or
how little) they earn. In other words, before they pay any 
other bills, they set aside a small percentage of their income 
for themselves. Saving then becomes like paying any other 
regular expense each month. The amount you pay yourself can 
be a sum you will hardly miss, especially if you commit
 yourself to doing it regularly.</P> 

<H3>Financial planning experts suggest that 
a reasonable amount to pay yourself is 
10% of your net income after tax each 
pay period...</H3>

<P>Once you have set up a regular savings program with clear
 goals in mind you must choose the right investment vehicles
 to meet your objectives. If you are saving for the short term
 you should invest in conservative vehicles like our CashPerformer
 or Short Term Government Bond Fund since you will want the value
 of your investment to be stable. On the other hand, if your 
objectives are long term we recommend that you invest your 
money to achieve maximum growth. Long term assets such as equity
 and fixed income mutual funds can provide your savings with 
superior growth relative to other low-yield conventional vehicles 
like deposit accounts and guaranteed investment certificates.</P> 
   
<P>Regardless of what your savings objectives are, Altamira offers 
you a convenient way of saving and investing in its mutual funds
 through AltaEasy, our automatic investment plan. With AltaEasy 
you gain the flexibility and benefits of investing regularly 
through pre-authorized withdrawals from your designated chequing
 account on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis. AltaEasy 
also allows you to change the amount or frequency of your 
investment at any time. Or you can switch between the funds
 to which you are allocating your savings or cancel the plan 
whenever you like. And remember, we do not charge any commissions 
when you buy our mutual funds, thereby allowing all your savings 
to go to work for you immediately. As well, we will always be
 available to guide you along the way in making the investment 
choices that best suit your financial goals.</P>  
   
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="dol-cst.gif" ALIGN=middle WIDTH=394 HEIGHT=292 ALT="Dollar Cost Averaging">
</CENTER>

<H3>.... and invest your savings to benefit from dollar cost averaging</H3>

<P>By investing your savings regularly, you can benefit from a
 strategy called "dollar cost averaging" which allows you to
 take advantage of fluctuations in the financial markets over 
time. Using this strategy, your savings will buy units in our 
mutual funds at different prices - more units when prices are
 low and less when they are higher. The average cost of each 
unit you hold can end up being lower over time, allowing you to
 benefit from price increases in the long term. In order for a 
"dollar cost averaging" strategy to work effectively, you must 
take a long term view (over 5 years) and discipline yourself to 
stick with the program through the ups and downs of the market.</P>

<P>Whatever your financial goals are, we encourage you to start saving 
and investing now. One of our Mutual Fund Specialists will be happy 
to show you how our mutual funds can maximize the growth of your 
savings. Give us a call, our advice is free and without obligation.</P>

<H2>Hands-on Investing with Will Sutherland</H2>

<UL>

<P>Most Altamira investors know who our fund managers are but we 
believe that it is also important that you have an understanding 
of what they do and their investment philosophy. To this end, we
 introduced Hands-on Investing as a regular column in Portfolio 
which allows you to meet our managers and get a sense of how they
 try to add value to your investments.</P> 

<P>Will Sutherland has been managing the Altamira Income Fund since
 1987. The Fund has consistently been one of Canada's top 
performing bond funds. Will has 20 years of investment experience
 and holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree and is a Chartered Financial
 Analyst. He is Altamira's Fixed Income Strategist and one of Altamira's
 four bond managers.</P> 

<P><B>Interviewer: Will, could you describe what a typical day is 
like for you?</B></P>

<P><B>Will Sutherland</B>: In order for you to understand my day
 you must be aware of the fact that the Canadian bond market 
is virtually a 24-hour market. It is open from about midnight 
Sunday to almost 7 p.m. Friday night. This is mainly because 
Canada does not have a sufficiently large domestic pool of capital
 to finance its investment needs and a significant portion of our
 bonds is owned by overseas investors. Thus a lot of price movements
 occur before 7 a.m. each day. On my way in to work, I will usually 
check market levels and overnight activity. At about 8.15 a.m. all 
the managers and analysts meet to briefly review global events and 
share relevant information which may impact on portfolio activity. 
Starting at 8.30 a.m., the bond managers are ready to trade their 
portfolios based on economic news releases and flows within the
 marketplace.</P> 

<P>During the morning we spend a couple of hours going through
 research reports or listening to presentations by various 
economists who apprise us of their forecasts for the fixed income
 markets. In the afternoon, the bond managers meet for about an 
hour to discuss their outlook, review their positions, and make 
any portfolio adjustments which may be necessary.</P>  

<P><B>Interviewer: What is the role of Altamira's bond team in 
making your investment decisions?</B></P>

<P><B>Will Sutherland</B>: Teamwork plays an integral role. Altamira
 has a lot of depth and a lot of breadth within its bond team. We 
have four bond managers, a money market manager, a foreign trader 
and a domestic trader. For example, we get input on foreign flows 
from Barry Allan and on domestic flows from Annette Cappa (our 
Canadian bond trader). Frances Connelly pays attention to short 
term interest rate trends while Robert Marcus focuses on term trends 
in the long end of the market. Edward Jong looks after money market 
instruments. Our decisions are based not only upon data which we
 receive from external sources but also from within the team. We 
try to divide areas of expertise according to the strengths of the 
individual team members, with each member following a specific 
sector closely - whether it be provincial bonds, mortgage backed 
securities or real return bonds. We all feel that it is more important 
to have original research and insight on the market rather than to 
rely exclusively on external sources.</P> 

<P><B>Interviewer: What reasons would you attribute to your success 
in consistently outperforming the competition?</B></P>

<P><B>Will Sutherland</B>: Over the last 10 years the bond market has 
provided many opportunities for all bond managers to achieve relatively
 high rates of return. We have done well at Altamira because we have 
successfully engaged in a strategy of interest rate anticipation 
instead of a buy and hold strategy practiced by some managers. Such 
managers were hurt, particularly in the early 1990s, when several 
real estate, industrial, and financial companies defaulted on their
 debt payments, leading to significant portfolio losses. We concentrate
 on high quality issues. Our interest rate anticipation style which can
 be called a "structured-active approach", has allowed us to benefit from 
persistent interest rate volatility over the past decade, thereby enabling
 Altamira to outperform its fixed income competitors. Like our equity 
managers, we are active traders and embrace market volatility. We tend 
to make our best gains when markets are moving.</P> 

<P>Altamira's strategy is built upon the rationale that during periods of 
rising interest rates, interest rate anticipators can own cash and are 
therefore not penalized by falling bond values. Alternatively, when 
interest rates are declining, interest rate anticipators can own longer 
term bonds and take the capital gains from long term bonds to enhance the
 portfolio values. The prices of longer term bonds are more sensitive to 
changes in interest rates. For example, over the last 3 years interest rates
 have moved by over 2% in each year. On a 10 year bond this is equivalent 
to a 15% price change, and on a 30 year bond it is more like a 20 - 25% price
 change. Given such interest rate movements, even if we are able to capture 
only half of the resulting gains, performance can be significantly enhanced. 
With swings of 20% to 30% over 8 times in the last 10 years, we have had 
ample opportunity to outperform the index and our competitors.</P>

<P><B>Interviewer: What is it like to work in an environment in which 
equity investing tends to overshadow fixed income investing?</B></P>

<P><B>Will Sutherland</B>: I have never felt that equity investing 
overshadowed fixed income investing. Fixed income investing is a market
 unto itself, much the same as equity investing is a market unto itself.
 Twenty years ago it was well recognized that equity investing could provide
 higher returns than fixed income investing. However, many people do not 
realize that fixed income investments have significantly outperformed equity
 investments in the last 5, 10 and 15 year periods in Canada. Equity investing
 has produced a larger dispersion of returns while fixed income returns are 
quite homogenous. Historically, fixed income funds will all generally make 
between 10% and 20% in a given year while equity funds will generate between 
-10% and +50%. I think that when it comes to investing, money managers are 
limited only by their imagination, and their ideas should allow them to
 outperform the market.</P>

<P>Altamira has received a lot of positive press because of the top performance
 of our equity managers. Some may feel that the firm is more of an equity
 house than a fixed income house. Few people realize that Altamira originated
 as a fixed income house in early 1969 and developed a very good reputation 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s in this market. Investors were not offered 
equity management until late 1987. I would say that our performance within 
the fixed income community is as good as it is in the equity management community.
 I hope that it stays this way for the next 25 years.</P>

<P><B>Interviewer: What is your outlook for the fixed income markets in
 Canada?</B></P>

<P><B>Will Sutherland</B>: The fixed income markets in Canada will continue
 to provide outstanding opportunities as we go forward in 1996. We have 
always observed that both domestic and international investors continuously 
over-react to our fiscal and political problems. What we are seeing 
right now are real gains in controlling inflation, government deficits,
 and trade balances. We have to resolve our political problems and 
dependence on foreign capital. Fixed income investors continue to 
demand a risk premium on longer term debt securities while short 
term treasury bills trade quite close to US treasury bills. The further
 out that you invest, whether it be for 5, 10 or 20 years, the higher 
the risk premium. As we deal with our problems on a one to one basis, 
we expect that global fixed income markets will recognize that the true
 risk premium for Canadian instruments should be much closer to those 
of similar US instruments than the market currently realizes. The Canadian
 bond market will eventually benefit from a lower yield spread against US 
interest rates.</P>

<H2>Saving through Group RRSPs works to your advantage</H2>

<UL>

<P>Group RRSPs provide employees with a convenient 
and disciplined method to save for their retirement 
through regular payroll deductions. By participating in a 
Group RRSP, employees increase their cash flow by obtaining 
tax refunds at source and get the opportunity to invest their
 retirement savings consistently to benefit from tax free 
compounding of their investment returns.</P> 

<P>The chart shows how employees increase their take home pay 
by contributing to a Group RRSP. If an employee earns $30,000 
per year, a $200 per month contribution only costs $141 because
 the employee gets an immediate tax saving of $59. Similarly, a 
$200 per month contribution by an employee earning $55,000 per 
year costs only $110 since the employee immediately saves $90 in
 taxes.</P>

</CENTER>

<P>More importantly, however, is the fact that an employee 
participating in a Group RRSP gets the opportunity to build a 
solid investment portfolio which best suits their individual needs.
 Younger employees can choose a portfolio based on more growth assets
 while older employees can select a more conservative portfolio 
containing predictable fixed income products. An Altamira Group 
RRSP provides employees with the opportunity to invest in a full or
 partial selection of our family of mutual funds. We also offer 
employees individual advice and assistance in selecting the most 
appropriate mix based on personal circumstances. As well, we hold a 
seminar program and other educational sessions at the work place to 
ensure that employees are educated and informed about their Group 
RRSP and other relevant personal financial planning issues.</P>   

<P>Employees generally have complete flexibility to change the asset mix 
of their portfolios, switch among funds or leave the plan at any time.
 Contributions to a Group RRSP are vested immediately and are easily 
transferable to another employer's plan or RRSP should an employee 
leave his current employer.</P>

<P>Employers also benefit from the establishment of a Group RRSP.
 Employees are generally happier because they recognize that 
their employer is committed to their retirement security. That
 is why many small and large firms are today using Group RRSPs 
as an integral part of their benefits package or as a supplement
 to existing pension plans. The most successful plans are those
 in which employers participate by fully or partially matching 
employees' contributions. In other cases, employers may only bear the 
operational, administration or trustee costs of a plan, or simply allow 
the use of the payroll system for Group RRSP deductions.</P>      

<P>Group RRSPs are cost effective for employers since no actuarial valuations
 are required, funding costs (if any) are known, and unlike pension plans,
 legislation is standard across Canada. Altamira makes it even easier for 
employers by performing all administrative duties, monitoring regulatory
 issues, and providing comprehensive employee education and reporting. 
These services, combined with our outstanding investment management,
 top-performing funds and excellent customer relations, are designed to 
benefit both employees and employers.</P> 

<P>If you are an employer who has your employees financial security at 
heart and would like Altamira to show you how to establish a Group RRSP,
 please call Robyn Graham toll free at 1-800-263-4769. On the other hand,
 if you are an employee who would like to maximize the growth of your
 retirement savings, we suggest you speak to your employer and ask that 
they contact us immediately. We'll be happy to help!</P>

<H2>Starting to save today for your children's 
post secondary education</H2>

<UL>

<P>Frank and Cathy have two children, David, 5 and 
Carol, 2. They would like both of their children to 
have a post-secondary education when they grow up. Frank and Cathy 
recognize that they would have to start saving today to be able to 
pay for David and Carol's education which will cost about $20,000 
each per year by the time they are ready to attend college or university.
 More importantly, Frank and Cathy would like to invest their savings 
for maximum growth and take advantage of any existing tax benefits.</P>

<P>One of the best ways available to Frank and Cathy to save for David and
 Carol's education is to establish a  Registered Education Savings Plan
 (RESP) for each child.</P> 

<P>An RESP allows parents or grandparents to transfer a portion of their
 income towards their children's or grandchildren's education. The
 contributors to an RESP do not get a tax deduction for their 
contributions but all income and capital gains earned grow tax free
 until it is withdrawn by the beneficiaries, who in this case are 
David and Carol. Normally, the beneficiaries will not only pay income
 tax at a lower rate but will also be able to deduct their education 
credits and tuition fees against the income from their RESPs, thereby 
reducing or eliminating any taxes they may have to pay.</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE ALIGN=center BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=20 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="resp.gif" ALIGN=middle WIDTH=548 HEIGHT=351 BORDER=0><BR>
Based on monthly contributions of $166.67, an annual return of 12%
(compounded annually) and a marginal rate of 45%</TD</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>With the new 1996 budget proposals, Frank and Cathy can contribute an
 annual maximum of $2,000 to each of David and Carol's RESPs for a
 period of 21 years. This means that lifetime contributions to each
 RESP are limited to $42,000.</P>

<P>The income earned in an RESP must be used for post secondary education
 within 25 years from the date a plan is set up. For example, David who
 is now five years old must use up the income generated by his RESP by
 the time he is thirty. If David does not attend a post-secondary 
education, the income in his RESP can be transferred to Carol's RESP.
 Similarly, if for some reason Carol chooses not to attend university 
or college, the income in her plan can be transferred to David's plan,
 taking into consideration that David's plan must be wound up within 25
 years of inception.</P>

<P>If both David and Carol do not attend a post secondary education 
institution, Frank and Cathy can withdraw their contributions and 
donate the income generated to an educational institution of their choice.
 Or they can nominate another qualified beneficiary prior to winding up of
  David and Carol's RESPs. In both cases there are no tax implications.</P> 
   
<P>Investing in mutual funds is a good way to maximize the growth of David 
and Carol's education savings. If Frank and Cathy were to establish an 
Altamira RESP, they will have the opportunity to invest in Altamira's family
 of 24 top-performing mutual funds. Our funds will provide them with unlimited
 diversification and a choice among equity, fixed income and foreign investments.
 And they will not have to worry about taxes on income and capital gains or 
restrictions on foreign investments. In addition, they can make contributions
 to David and Carol's RESPs through AltaEasy, our convenient automatic investment
 plan.</P>

<P>Frank and Cathy will have total control over how their money is 
invested; the flexibility of choosing, changing or adding beneficiaries;
 and the facility to change or stop their contributions at any time. They 
can also withdraw their contributions at any time and allow the income
 generated to compound tax-free for the benefit of their children.</P>

<H2>Reaching Out</H2>

<UL>
<P>In addition to our corporate charitable donations, the Altamira 
Foundation donated over $350,000 to thirteen different charities 
last year. The Foundation was established in 1995 to give direction
 to the firm's charitable donations. It has identified four main 
areas of focus to channel its donations - prevention of child abuse,
 youth education, preparation of youth for work, and the promotion of 
safe and healthy communities. All of these areas have Canada's young
 people as a common beneficiary since we believe that youths are our
 most precious future resource.</P>

<P>Funds were provided for specific projects rather than for ongoing
 activities and operational and administrative expenses. The Foundation
 does not support charities which discriminate in their activities on
 the basis of religion, colour, race, nationality or creed. Individuals,
 government agencies and organizations are also not eligible for funding.
 We believe that by selecting unique projects, we will have the ability to
 evaluate the achievements of our contributions so as to ensure maximum 
impact. We are happy that we can put something back into the 
communities which have made us successful.</P> 

<P>Among the charities which received donations in 1995 were Ability 
OnLine, CFRB Hospital for Sick Children, Serve Canada, Interlink 
Cancer Nurses, Etobicoke Youth Without Shelter and Welcome Baby.</P>

<h1>The Performance Of Canadian Stocks--  
Lessons From A 75-Year Perspective</h1> 
---------------------------------------
<h3>by Steve Foerster</h3>
---------------------------------------
<pre>
 It is generally acknowledged that a well-diversified portfolio of equities
 is one of the best long-term investments you can make. While I remain
 a firm believer in this statement, I found that a recent examination
 of a long history of Canadian data provided some revealing lessons.
 I will focus on three simple questions related to stock market performance. 
</pre>
<pre>
* How has the Canadian market performed over the long term?  

* How do stock returns compare over various investment horizons
 (or holding periods)?

* How have stocks performed relative to inflation?

</pre>
<pre>
I examined 75 years of data of TSE Index levels. I began by examining
average annual price changes, or capital gains. (I will refer to this 
amount as the "return" although it excludes dividends.)
</pre>
<pre> 
 Over the 75-year period, annual returns (excluding dividends) averaged
 6.9%. This means that every dollar invested in a well-diversified
 portfolio of stocks in 1919 would have grown to $150 by the end of 1993.
 The average dividend yield of TSE stocks subsequent to 1956
 (the period of available dividend yield data) has been 3.5%, so average
 total returns over the 75 years were probably close to 10.5%.
 Annual returns (capital gains only) since 1935 have averaged 7.7%.
 These capital gains compare favourably with the average T-bill yield of
 4.9% over the same period.
</pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2>Lesson #1: Stocks offer the potential for solid gains and higher returns
 than alternative financial investments such as T-bills.</h2>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<pre>
Of course, few of us can hope to have an investment horizon of 75 years.
As John Maynard Keynes noted, "In the long run, we're all dead."
What picture emerges when we examine shorter horizons?  
Consider one-year horizons during the overall period.
</pre>
<pre> 
The five best years (and returns) were as follows:

 1933 (46.8%), 1950 (39.9%),1927 (39.0%), 1979 (38.4%) and 1945 (35.8%).
</pre>
<pre>
The five worst years(and returns) were as follows:

1931 (-37.2%), 1930 (-34.1%),1974 (-29.3%), 1937 (-26.4%) and 1957 (-23.5%).
</pre>
<pre>
There have been twenty years with returns greater than 20% 
(most recently in 1993), and seven years with returns less than -20%
(most recently in 1974). In other words, if history repeats,
you can expect one-year gains greater than 20% about one-quarter
of the time, and you should be prepared for one-year losses of
greater than 20% about one-tenth of the time.
If we consider longer horizons, an interesting picture emerges
for average annual compound returns (see Table 1), which leads 
to the following lesson:
</pre>
<p>
<b>table</b>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1

<h3>Nominal Returns
TSE Index Average Annual Compound Retruns (Capital Gains)</h3>

			Best	Average		Worst	Average	
Horizon		Years		Ann Return	Years	Ann Return
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 year		1933		46.8%		1931	  -37.2%
 5 years         1924-28	21.9%		1928-32	  -18.7%
10 years	1942-51		14.0%		1929-38	   -7.0%
15 years	1942-56		12.4%		1929-43	   -5.1%
20 years	1942-61		10.3%		1929-48	   -1.8%
25 years	1943-67		 9.0%		1929-53	    0.8%

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<h2>Lesson #2: You can feel more confident of earning a 
 positive return the longer your investment horizon</h2>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
<pre>
 While one-year returns have been quite variable, longer-period returns 
 have shown less variability. For example, since the Second World War,
 there have been only two five-year periods where the TSE Index has 
 ended at a lower level than it began (1970 to 1974 and 1973 to 1977).
 With the exception of the Great Depression years, no ten-year period
 has ended with the TSE Index at a lower level. Even including the
 Great Depression, no twenty-five-year period has ended with the TSE
 Index at a lower level. So by increasing your investment horizon, you
 can decrease your stock portfolio's risk. You can see this by looking
 down the "best" and "worst" average annual return columns in Table 1:
 the values in the two columns converge. You can also see this in the
 accompanying chart which compares return distributions based on 
 various holding periods.
</pre>
<pre>
 Of course, there is considerable variability of performance depending
 on the actual investment period. For example, the five-year period of
 1983 to 1987 offered an average annual compound return of 10.0%, yet
 during the more recent five-year period 1988 to 1992 period, average
 annual compound returns were only 1.2%. It is only with hindsight that
 we can identify when was the best time to buy (or sell), although
 this example clearly demonstrates the potential benefits available
 to individuals with superior market-timing skills.
</pre>
<pre>
 <h3>What about inflation?</h3> What should really concern you as an investor
 is whether you are ahead in "real" or inflation-adjusted terms. Over
 the 75-year period, the annual inflation rate in Canada (as measured
 by the Consumer Price Index) has been 3.1%. Consequently, stocks
 offered average annual real returns of 3.8% (excluding dividends).
</pre>
<pre>
 Table 2 presents best and worst horizons for real returns.
 There are similarities and differences with Table 1 (which examined
 nominal returns). While the best single year was still 1933, the
 worst year was 1974, a year when inflation was over 12%. Beyond a
 one-year horizon, while the best periods were similar for both
 nominal and real returns, the worst ten-year period was 1965 to 1974
 (with an average annual compound real return of almost -6%), and
 the worst twenty-five year period was 1966 to 1990 (-1%).
</pre>
<p>
<b>table</b>
<pre>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Table 2

<h3>Real (Inflation Adjusted)  Returns
TSE Index Average Annual Compound Returns (Capital Gains)</h3>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Best		Average		Worst	 Average
Horizon		Years		Ann Return	Years	 Ann Return
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 year		1933		48.6%		1974	  -41.6%
5 years		1924-28		22.2%		1937-41	  -14.2%
10 years	1919-28		11.5%		1965-74	   -5.8%
15 years	1942-56		 8.5%		1929-43	   -4.9%
20 years	1942-61		 7.1%		1929-48	   -3.1%
25 years	1942-66		 6.3%		1966-90	   -1.1%
</pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<h2>Lesson #3: Stocks tend to perform better during low inflationary times.</h2>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<pre>
The TSE tended to perform best with average annual inflation between
 2% and 3%. For example, the best twenty-five year period, 1942 to 
1966, occurred when inflation averaged 2.9%. The worst twenty-five
 year period, 1966 to 1990, occurred when inflation averaged 6.4%.
<pre>
 If low inflation is a good time for equity investments, is deflation
 even better?  During the Great Depression, between 1930 and 1933,
 consumer prices dropped by an average of 6.6% per year, yet stock 
 prices dropped (in nominal terms) by an average of 16.7% per year
 as well. Thus, the best environment for stocks appears to be moderate
 inflation, but not deflation.
</pre>
<pre>
 Understanding how the stock market has behaved in the past can help
 prepare you for what to expect in the future. While the past is no
 guarantee of the future, there are many valuable lessons to be
 learned from history.

<h2>RRSP Withdrawal Strategies and Outcomes</h2>
    ---------------------------------------
<h3>by Stan Tepner - "Canadian MoneySaver", March 1995</h3>
       -------------------------------------------------
<p>
Welcome to March. You have just survived another frenzied RRSP investment season, and are now entitled to return to your normal habits and pastimes.
<p>
Over the last few months, so much attention was paid to the many ways you could place money inside RRSPs. Have you ever wondered what happens when you take money out of an RRSP?
<p>
There are numerous reasons why money leaves RRSPs. Some of the most common are:
<p>
* RRSPs must be collapsed by the end of the calendar year in which a taxpayer reaches   age 71, either by transferring the assets to a RRIF, buying a life annuity, making   taxable withdrawals, or a combination of these choices;
<p>
* dipping into an RRSP to supplement one's income in periods of economic hardship;
<p>
* using RRSP funds to help purchase a home under the RRSP home buyer's program;
<p>
* withdraws of excess contributions;
<p>
* dividing up RRSP assets upon breakdown of a marriage;
<p>
* settlement of debts further to bankruptcy proceedings; and
<p>
* income timing strategies.
<p>
Don't be encouraged by this discussion to collapse your RRSP unnecessarily. This article contains no such recommendation.
<p>
You cannot rebuild RRSP contribution room by withdrawing assets from existing plans. This means that if your annual limit is $8,000, and you contribute the $8,000 then withdraw $2,000, your subsequent limit is not increased to $10,000 (the $8,000 limit plus $2,000 for the withdrawn amount). It remains at $8,000.
<p>
You should always maximize your efforts to build up your retirement plan, not tear it down. But if it must be collapsed, in whole or in part, here are some of the important things you should know.
<p>
<h3>Income Tax Withholding</h3>
     ----------------------
<p>
When RRSPs are de-registered, the trustee is required to withhold income taxes prior to distributing the money. The level of withholding is dependent upon the size of each withdrawal.
<p>
To minimize the tax withholding, it's wisest to keep individual withdrawals at the $5,000 level or below (please refer to the accompanying table). When RRSP withdrawals are made, the trustee issues a T4-RSP, and the taxpayer must include the full amount of the withdrawal in their income computation for the year. The resultant income tax may be higher or lower than the amount withheld at source.
<b>table</b>
<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE: Income tax withholding rates for RRSP withdrawals

				Up to		$5,001 to	Over 
				$5,000	 	$15,000	 	$15,000                        				----------------------------------------
Canada, excluding Quebec	10%		20%		30%
Quebec:	Federal portion		 5%		10%		15%
	Prov'l portion		16%		20%		20%
Non-residents			25%		25%		25%
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<h3>A RRIF Idea</h3>
    ------------
<p>
RRSP options for those turning 71 have been covered on a regular basis in "Canadian MoneySaver", so I won't repeat them here. 
<p>
However, there is a tax strategy that enables individuals under the age of 72 to access a greater chunk of their retirement capital without paying withholding taxes. 
<p>
If these individuals simply withdrew money from their RRSPs, they would naturally have taxes withheld at source. There are no taxes withheld, however, on the minimum required distributions from a RRIF. This means that an RRSP investor could make an early transfer of all or part of their RRSP to a RRIF, and receive the minimum RRIF payments free of tax withholdings.
<p>
Taxes will be withheld on all RRIF distributions above the minimum levels.
<p>
<h3>Dipping into the RRSP</h3>
     -------------------------
<p>
Regular RRSP withdrawals result in taxes being withheld. I don't advocate using one's RRSP for anything but a retirement savings vehicle, but there are times of economic hardship when it can be a vital source of capital.
<p>
There are other times when RRSPs are treated as seasonal piggy banks. RRSP managers notice that their peak withdrawal periods are during the weeks before Christmas and in the summer vacation period. There are better ways to budget one's expenses than to dip into an RRSP.
<p>
<h3>RRSP Home Buyer's Plan</h3>
     ---------------------------
<p>
This program enables RRSP investors to use the funds in their plans to assist in the purchase of a home. The rules are simple:
<p>
* the maximum withdrawal per person is $20,000;
<p>
* the RRSP must be repaid with at least 1/15 of the total withdrawn per year; 
<p>
* the home buyer cannot have occupied their own or their spouse's home for five years;
<p>
* for 1995, the withdrawal request must be made before January 1, 1996, and an agreement   to buy or build a home must be in place by October 1, 1996; and
<p>
* if contributions to an RRSP are made in the 89 days before withdrawal under the plan,   you won't be able to deduct the amount of the contribution that exceeds the value of   the RRSP after the withdrawal.
<p>

<h3>Withdrawals of excess contributions</h3>
       ----------------------------------------
<p>
If you have contributed amounts to your RRSP that exceed your personal contribution limit and the $8,000 over-contribution cushion, you'll be charged 1% per month on the excess in the plan. You can, however, take the excess from the plan without tax implications.
<p>
<h3>Marriage break-ups</h3>
     ----------------------
<p>
RRSPs may be viewed as communal property under family law, and could be part of the assets divided between departing spouses under a separation or divorce agreement. In this situation, a portion of one spouse's RRSP assets may be transferred, tax free, to the other spouse's RRSP.
<p>
<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
     --------------
<p>
RRSPs may not be immune from creditors, and could be collapsed under bankruptcy proceedings. Normal tax withholding rules apply, and after-tax amounts are distributed to the appropriate parties.
<p>
<h3>Timing strategies</h3>
    -----------------------
<p>
Many couples use spousal RRSP contributions as a way to split their incomes and pay less taxes during their retirement years.
<p>
Some couples take a shorter-term view of income splitting opportunities using spousal RRSPs. With these couples, the higher-income spouse makes spousal contributions to the RRSP of the lower or no-income spouse. After a full two calendar year waiting period (in which no further spousal contributions were made to the plan) the lower-income spouse collapses all or part  of their plan, and pays tax at a lower rate.
<p>
Another timing strategy can be employed when an individual faces a period of low or no personal income, such as a sabbatical from work. During this hiatus, if income is low from all other sources, it may be wise to make RRSP withdrawals and take advantage of the lower personal tax bracket.

        </center><h2>Self-Directed RRSPs & RRIFs Simplify Retirement Investments</h2>
      -----------------------------------------------------------
<h3>by David Gillians - "Canadian MoneySaver", March 1995</h3>
       -----------------------------------------------------------
<p>
Self-directed RRSPs and RRIFs will be the fastest growing type of retirement plan in Canada over the next few years.
<p>
As balances grow, investors will want to diversify their investments beyond the limited products of a single firm.
<p>
Many investment advisors call these types of plans "self-neglected savings plans". Although it's great to have choice, it is easy to become overwhelmed to the point where cash balances sit untouched or asset mixes are never modified when economic circumstances change.
<p>
The "self-neglected plans" are usually created by investors who think that they can dabble in the markets using a discount broker, without spending much time on research. They can also be found in small seldom-traded accounts at large investment firms where some clients assume their broker is going to spend a lot of time watching their account despite the fact that few trades are executed in the account.
<p>
<h3>CDIC Changes will Encourage GIC Investors to Shop Around,</h3>
    --------------------------------------------------------
Proposals to change Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation limits will encourage even the most timid investor to maximize coverage using several financial institutions. In a self-directed RRSP, investors can multiply their coverage within one plan by purchasing GICs from several institutions.
<p>
Record keeping and the renewal process is simplified in a self-directed plan because everything is on one statement. One phone call should be able to produce as many competitive rates as required, thus reducing wear and tear on shoe leather and gasoline.
As these investors become more sophisticated, the other fixed-income investments that have government guarantees, such as stripped bonds and mortgage-backed securities, will be considered viable alternatives with potential for higher yields. These can only be purchased in a self-directed plan.
<p>
Many financial institutions refuse to accept GIC investments in their RRSP programs that mature beyond the annuitant's age 71. Therefore, investors are forced to violate the cardinal rule for GICs, ie to reduce risk always diversify maturity dates. In a self-directed plan this restriction doesn't apply because the investor can transfer the assets, as they are, at any time, to a self-directed RRIF.

<h3>Self-Directed Plans Save Trustee Fees</h3>
     -------------------------------------
<p>
Self-directed registered plans can save money by reducing trustee fees. This is the extra charge that is sometimes levied annually by mutual funds to administer an RRSP or RRIF to offset the extra Revenue Canada administration. It's ironic that even the most fee-conscious investors can end up paying more in trustee fees than necessary.
Many RRSP/RRIF eligible mutual funds in Canada have an extra charge assessed for registered plans. Since they are charged to the fund itself rather than the individual, most investors tend to ignore the costs.
<p>
If investors want to have a variety of funds that are managed by different companies, they will have to establish RRSP/RRIF accounts with each of the companies, paying another trustee fee each time. The alternative is a self-directed plan which holds all the mutual funds under a single trust arrangement.
<p>
RRSP and RRIF trustee fees that are added to other management expenses within a fund can add up. For example:
<p>
* Royal Trust charges .02% of the net asset value of their funds,
<p>
* Altamira has an extra fee of $35,
<p>
* Trimark Canada charges .04% to a maximum of $50.
<p>
It pays to ask. Other companies such as TD Bank and CI Investments absorb the extra registered administration costs.
<p>
<h3>Self-Directed Plans Reduce Transfer & Redemption Charges</h3>
     --------------------------------------------------------
Most RRSP trustees levy a redemption charge of $15 to $50 when an account is closed or transferred. Since the RRSP/RRIF itself is unchanged when GICs mature or mutual funds are sold in a self-directed plan, investors don't have to be concerned about these irritating extra costs.
<p>
<h3>Expand Foreign Content Investments in a Self-Directed Plan</h3>
     ----------------------------------------------------------
In each RRSP/RRIF plan, the limit for foreign investments is 20% of that particular plan's book value. Therefore, the book value of all RRSPs owned may be $100,000, but if there is only $10,000 in a Trimark Canadian fund regular RRSP, only $2000 could be shifted into the international Trimark fund under that same plan.
<p>
In a regular RRSP/RRIF, if an investor wants $20,000 of Templeton Growth, there would have to be at least $80,000 in one of Templeton's Canadian funds which may run counter to your plans.
<p>
By consolidating all RRSP/RRIF investments into one self-directed plan, the investor could put as much as $20,000 into the Templeton Growth Fund, Trimark Fund or any other foreign investment, to boost possible returns and to diversify holdings.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
     ----------
Self-directed RRSPs and RRIFs offer investors more flexibility, more opportunities for better returns and when all costs are analyzed, they can be less expensive than the ordinary  mutual fund plans.

<h2>Should You Avoid IPOs?</h2>
 
<h3>Dale Ennis - "Canadian MoneySaver", May 1995</h3>
<pre>
 In earlier issues of "MoneySaver" we have cited three U.S. research
 reports regarding Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Each reference 
 revealed the lack of support for the purchase of these issues by 
 investors.
 
 Now, we have a comprehensive Canadian survey which reinforces the 
 findings for IPOs. The Investment Executive is Canada's national 
 publication for stockbrokers, mutual fund salespeople, financial 
 planners and investment executives. The following discussion is based
 on their findings for Canadian IPOs in 1993 (April 1995 issue) and 
 presented with their permission.

 The study examined the 1993 IPO performance figures (see the accompanying
 chart). With thorough examination of these figures, you would discover
 that only 27% had an annual return better than 10% (returns discounted 
 for the TSE 300 performance). Thirty-four percent outperformed the 
 TSE 300 composite index that year. As of February 28, 1995, thirty-nine
 percent of the 88 IPOs had higher prices than the initial offering price.


 Unless you, personally, can uncover supportive research material, you 
 will need to depend on your stockbroker. If the broker's firm is
 underwriting the IPOs though, you must question the objectivity of this 
 research.

 Firms that were lead underwriters (on at least 4 deals) were surveyed. 
 The top three firms (with their respective average returns) follow: 
 Marleau Lemire (14.9%), First Marathon (8.8%), and Levesque Beaubien 
 (8.4%).

 The lowest average returns (for 1993 IPOs) calculated for two brokerage 
 firms were -20.7% and -25.6%. After their merger, this new brokerage was
 the leading underwriter for 1994, earning estimated fees of 29.6 million
 dollars!

<h2>Making Your Mortgage Interest Tax Deductible</h2>

<h3>by Brian Quinlan - "Canadian MoneySaver", May 1995</h3>
<pre>
"I understand that if my home is used as collateral for a loan,
 the interest is tax deductible provided the loan is used for
 business or investment purposes. Is this correct?" 
 (S.S., Edmonton, Alberta)


<h3>Interest deductibility</h3>

Generally, interest is tax deductible if paid on a debt in which 
the borrowed funds were used for investment or business purposes.
The test for deductibility focuses on the use of the borrowed funds
rather than the collateral used.

Take the example of an investor who owns a home which is
fully paid for. The investor will be able to obtain a lower
interest rate if the home is used as collateral than if not.
Provided the investor uses the funds for investment purposes, ie.
to purchase a portfolio of stocks, the interest on the loan will be
tax deductible. If the funds were used to add an addition to the
home or to finance a vacation, the interest would not be deductible 
as the funds were used for a personal use rather than for an 
investment purpose.


Let's alter the example to a father who wishes to assist in the
startup of his daughter's business. Assume the father owns a fully
paid for home. The home is mortgaged to provide startup capital for
the daughter's business. Again, the mortgage interest is tax 
deductible.

<h3>Rental properties</h3>
 

An individual owns a rental property which is either fully paid for
or at least has significant equity above the current mortgage to 
allow for additional borrowing. The individual wishes to purchase a
new home (for personal use) and asks if the mortgage is taken
against the rental property, can the interest be taken as a
deduction against the rental income. 

 The answer is no. The use of the funds was to purchase a personal
 use property--not to purchase or improve a rental property. Here, the
 use of the funds cannot be tied to the earning of investment or business
 income.

<h3>Switching non-deductible interest to deductible interest</h3>
 

 An individual may own a fully paid for $100,000 investment portfolio and
 a home that has a $100,000 mortgage against it. The interest on the
 mortgage is not tax deductible as the funds from the mortgage were used 
 to purchase the home--not the investment portfolio.

<h3>What can be done?</h3>
 

 The individual sells the portfolio. The $100,000 generated from the 
 portfolio is used to pay off the mortgage. The home is immediately
 remortgaged for $100,000. The $100,000 is used to buy back the investment
 portfolio. As the new loan for $100,000 is used for investment purposes,
 the interest becomes tax deductible. 


 The individual continues to own the home and the portfolio. Nothing has 
 been changed except the interest is now tax deductible. This example has
 been simplified by ignoring income taxes, if any, generated on the sale
 of the portfolio, commissions and early mortgage repayment fees.

<h2>Investing, The Business </h2>
<p>
<h3>Dennis Anstett - "Canadian MoneySaver", December 1995</h3>
<p>
Thanks to all of the readers who phoned and wrote regarding my September article in MoneySaver titled "A Checklist for Success." The article illustrated how the rules for successful investing also apply to running a successful small business. It was rewarding to hear that the quote, "Time is an expensive commodity", rang true to so many people; that many of you are taking a step back to question the path you are on. After all, one's wealth (fulfillment) can't be measured by the size of a bank account. One caller said you have to wonder about making money just for money's sake. 
<p>
Still, our society dictates we earn a few pesos to survive. In the wake of corporate cutbacks which limit career options, people are becoming business people in an attempt to pay the bills and get ahead. The wolves come knocking on the door soon after you miss a mortgage payment. But after researching the business of running a business, my wife and I decided to work our capital instead. This article more fully explains why we prefer the business of investing over the "normal" types of enterprises.
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living gives you freedom.</h3>
<p>
While many small business owners never seem to have any spare minutes, taking positions or trading takes very little time. Just a phone call here or there suffices. More importantly, you work when you want. And when you don't want, you still make money by earning interest. An investor, in other words, has a choice. You can close up shop at will with few consequences. It's like you can play hooky, and it's okay to do so. How would you do that with a retail or manufacturing business, and still make a profit?    
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living gives you independence.</h3>
<p>
You don't need any formal training, licences or registration. There aren't any bosses to answer to. NONE! There aren't any government agencies probing your every move and issuing penalties for minor, insignificant infractions. The way things are going, you'll soon need a permit to walk on a city sidewalk. 
<p>
On the other hand, you can trade from anywhere and you can trade all over the world without government interference. You truly are outside "the system". Since you answer only to yourself, you just have to learn to ask yourself easy questions.  
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living carries no overhead.</h3>
<p>
Only cable TV and a phone line are needed to play. (Perhaps the more sophisticated also demand a computer.) Sure, trading requires capital, but the capital is always at work. Setting up a business venture also requires upfront funding - before the ball even starts rolling. Putting up collateral and borrowing money at high interest rates is not uncommon. There may be buildings, machinery, property (leasehold improvements), inventory, advertising and a proliferation of insurances to buy. And signing on all of the dotted lines then forces you to work. 
<p>
If you plow $100,000 into a business, for example, the business is already costing about $10,000 per year, assuming you could have earned a 10% rate of return on the capital. Furthermore, up-front money going into an enterprise is gone. It's all tied up. And you get it back only if the business is, in some way, profitable. Trading, when done wisely, doesn't come close to this level of risk.      
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living eliminates many taxes.</h3>
<p> 
You can forget about paying all of those municipal and provincial business and sales taxes. There aren't any. The GST doesn't apply either. There are no WCB, CPP, RPP or UIC payments. Group health and insurance plans aren't needed. There aren't any surtaxes, corporate taxes, flat taxes, transfer taxes, import taxes, export taxes, property taxes, education taxes, labour taxes, payroll taxes, vacation payments, severance payments, toll charges, lease charges, utility bills, water bills, union dues, office dues, user fees, social fees, subscription fees, membership fees, lobbying fees, environmental assessments and, last but not least, late-payment levies. Good grief! It's little wonder so many small businesses fail!
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living reduces expenses.</h3>
<p> 
When you work from home, the home now qualifies for write-offs. This means more money stays home. As well, the typical, working-type expenses are nearly non-existent. You avoid shelling out the nickels and dimes that add up to big dollars. These expenses can drain the piggy bank in a hurry. You don't need to travel back and forth to work, for example. This saves on parking fees, tickets, gas, oil and wear and tear on the old jalopy. This may even save the daily cost of the coffee-and-donut stop. In fact, you don't even need to own a car to trade. All those extra clothes a regular career requires you to buy are no longer needed either. You can work in your underwear if you wish. No more stupid ties! 
<p>
About the only expense that comes with trading is brokerage or commission fees. So, eliminating most of them, as in no-load mutual funds, makes for higher profits.  
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living makes for a simpler life.</h3> 
<p>
Accountants aren't needed to sort through all those important papers you stuffed in the shoe box. All you have to know is a buy and sell price, and the inherent profit or loss. If you invest within an RRSP, you only have to pay income tax on the amount you withdraw. 
<p>
But trading is virtually hassle free. You don't need protection against malpractice or liability suits. There is never a reason for litigation. Can you imagine hiring a lawyer to litigate yourself? As well, hiring and firing employees isn't required. Nor is all of the racing around to find good material, suppliers and customers, just so you can race around and fill and ship orders, just so you can race around and do the whole thing all over again. 
<p>
<b>That's exhausting!</b>
<p> 
Trading doesn't produce account receivable problems, bounced cheques, machinery breakdowns, environmental disasters or fire and safety concerns. You never have any down time due to supplier shortages. You never have to deal with people who drive you up a wall. And best of all, you never have to cold call for new clients.  
<p>
<h3>Investing for a living is recession proof.</h3>
<p>
There are always moves that can make you money. There are many "YO-YOs" fluctuating at different times. If Canada is bearish, you can switch to a foreign country. If you don't like stocks, you can switch to bonds. If bonds look scary, you can feast on Treasury bills. Sometimes rising gold prices can line the pocket book. Sometimes currency gyrations can make the wage. There's always a winning hand to play. And you can play the game forever. Old knees aren't a problem. This is a sport of the brain, not the body. Do you like playing chess?     
<p>
So, what about the other side of the coin? What's the one main negative to running an "investment business?" For many, it's the stress that comes with uncertainty. Just the thought of taking a non-guaranteed position and losing money in the markets causes panic in some quarters. Yet, at the same time, the pressure associated with taking a non-guaranteed position and losing money running a business seems totally natural. Huh? Surely, those who have the stamina, motivation and skill to run a company should do well trading, with far less worry. Less can be best.  
<p>
Imagine how much you would learn, and how quickly it would happen, if you spent as much time on the markets as you did at your job. Investing can be a profitable, enjoyable, part-time hobby or career. The research required is substantially less than what it takes to properly review and understand all of the ins and outs of running a company. With experience, you soon discover that the markets are not all random and that patterns do exist. You soon learn how to take only high-probability, low-risk trades. And you soon understand that the actual risk involved can be much less than you first thought. 
<p>
Without question, investing for a living gives you ultimate control, freedom and independence. You don't have government policies and taxes weighing you down. You swim when you want and your abilities rule the day. While no particular occupation is for everybody, there is one consistent theme with any business plan: Determine what it is you like to do and then figure out a way to make money at it. When you're "on vacation" 52 weeks a year, you never need to go on vacation.

<h2>Different Paths to Diversification</h2>
<p>
<h3>Leonard Goodall - "Canadian MoneySaver", April 1996</h3>
<p>
Diversification is one of the buzz words of the investment world. Everyone talks about it, but virtually everyone defines the term a bit differently. There are also a variety of approaches to implementing a diversification strategy.
<p>
We generally think of a plan for diversifying among the five major types of investment vehicles - (1) equities (stocks); (2) bonds; (3) cash and cash equivalents; (4) real estate, and (5) precious metals. There are more complicated types of investments, such as commodities, futures or foreign currencies, but most of us do nearly all of our investing in these five categories. The great majority of investors, in fact, use just the first three - equities, bonds and cash or cash equivalents.
<p>
If you like, you can do all of your investing in these categories through the use of mutual funds. There are funds which specialize in each of these types of investments. There are also "balanced funds," which would combine investments in stocks, bonds and cash. This latter type of fund attempts to make the diversification decisions for you by deciding how much of its portfolio to have in each of the three categories.
<p>
There are many strategies for developing a diversified portfolio. We will look at just a few of them here.
<p>
<h3>Equal Allocation</h3>
<p>
Harry Browne, in his very fine book, Why the Best Laid Investment Plans Usually Go Wrong, suggests a simple strategy of investing an equal amount (25%) in each of four types of investments, common stocks, long-term government bonds, gold and cash. He then suggests a once-a-year reallocation to bring each category back to the 25% level. 
<p>
The theory underlying this strategy is that you regularly (annually) readjust your investments by taking profits in whichever categories have done well in the last year, and investing in those investments which have lagged. There is sometimes a psychological barrier to this because it means we are being called on to sell our "popular" investments and invest in the "unpopular" ones. Browne's assumption is that different investments will do well at different times, and this balanced approach will enable you to take advantage of these fluctuations.
<p>
This plan could easily be implemented by using the funds of a mutual fund family such as Vanguard (800 662-7447 or 610 648-6000). You could use Vanguard Index Trust - 500, an index fund that seeks to achieve results parallel to the Standard and Poor's 500, for the stock portion of the portfolio. Then you could add Vanguard Long-Term U.S. Treasury Fund for the bonds and Vanguard  Specialty Portfolio - Gold Fund for the gold. Finally, you could use any of Vanguard's several money market funds for the cash. The advantage of keeping all four choices within one fund family is that the annual adjustments can be made with a single phone call. There are many fund families which have enough different funds to allow you to implement this approach.
<p>
<h3>Age-Related Strategies</h3>
<p>
Many diversification strategies are related to age, the assumption being that portfolios should get more conservative as the investor gets older. One "rule of thumb" is to subtract your age from 100 (or 110 for more aggressive investors) and put that percentage of one's funds into stock. The rest should then be put into bonds, with some portion in cash for liquidity purposes. For example, a 40-year-old might put 60% of his or her funds into a stock mutual fund, 30% into a bond fund and 10% into a money market fund. An investor willing to take more risk could put 70% (110 minus 40) in stocks and somewhat less into the other categories.
<p>
In the February issue of our newsletter, No-Load Portfolios, we reported on the recommended diversification strategy of the Dreyfus Corporation. In a recent publication they recommend a series of age-related diversification strategies beginning with a recommendation that a 30-year-old should have 70% in stocks, 30% in bonds, and continuing to a recommendation that a 70-year-old have 30% in stocks, 55% in bonds and 15% in cash.
<p>
<h3>General Rules</h3>
<p>
While no one else can decide the right diversification strategy for you, there are some general rules to keep in mind when deciding how you want to diversify your holdings. We will review some of them here.
<p>
(1)Emphasize equities. Any study of investing will show that over the long term, equity investments, primarily common stocks, provide the best return. Stocks are volatile, and there will be periods of decline, but the patient investor will profit by having a major portion of a portfolio in stocks.
<p>
Advisors used to suggest that investors move out of stocks as they near retirement age. Today most people will live for twenty years or more after retirement, so some continuing investment in stocks can be important in helping provide increasing income and protecting against inflation. 
<p>
(2)  Invest globally. In 1980 about 70% of the value of all stocks trading on stock exchanges was traded in the U.S. Today that number is about 30%. There is no one country that dominates global investing today, and it is important that a portfolio have some overseas exposure. U.S. mutual funds like Vanguard International Growth (610 648-6000) or Twentieth Century International Equity (800 345-2021 or 816 531-5575) provide an easy approach to building global diversification into a portfolio. I would suggest anywhere from 10%-20% of your holdings be in international investments. An aggressive investor might want to go even higher.
<p>
(3) Diversify level of risk. A strong portfolio should include investments  with varying levels of risk. A conservative investor, for example, might want to own two or three low-risk funds, but it would be advisable to include a somewhat higher-risk fund as well. Most large mutual fund families will offer funds that have differing levels of risk. The T. Rowe Price family (800 638-5660 or 410 547-2308), offers lower-risk funds such as its Equity Income and Dividend Growth funds, but it also has higher risk funds such as the New Horizons and Over-the-Counter funds. In most cases global funds should also be thought of as carrying higher than average risk. 
<p>
It is important to look at each fund's Prospectus and find the section which defines the fund's objectives to help determine the risk level of the fund. Income funds, including bond funds, usually are lower risk. Funds which seek growth or aggressive growth will have a higher level of risk.
<p>
(4)  Use fund families. Using only one or a few fund families makes it simpler to monitor and manage your investments. There are many large families - Fidelity, Invesco, T. Rowe Price, Scudder, Twentieth Century and Vanguard, to name just a few - which offer a wide variety of stock and bond funds. I prefer the families which offer no-load funds (Fidelity has both load and no-load) because they perform just as well as other funds and save money for the investor.
<p>
There is no formula that can tell you how to diversify. Like other aspects of investing, that decision involves reading, asking questions and generally doing your homework. The investment of time you make in deciding on the right diversification strategy for you will be one investment that should provide you with a very good return.

<h2>"If you don't use their products, then don't buy their stock."</h2>
<p>
<h3>Jon Kanitz - "Canadian MoneySaver", April 1996</h3>
<p>
The reason I don't have a phone in my car is that I do some of my best thinking while I'm driving. And since it only takes me ten minutes to get to the office each day, I don't want this valuable time to be interrupted with calls. I'm a simple guy.
<p>
On the way to work recently, I came up with the possible investment maxim that appears above as my headline:  "If you don't use their products, then don't buy their stock."  Now, I'd be the first to concede that following this investment rule would be mighty restrictive.
<p>
But then, as I drove a little further down University Avenue in Toronto, I got to pondering the idea in more depth. It's a very restrictive rule alright, and probably one that nobody - certainly not me - has ever consistently applied. On the other hand, it doesn't necessarily follow that the rule isn't a practical one. (In fact, it's quite "Peter Lynch-ish.")
<p>
Let me expand on this hypothesis. What could be meant by "practical" here?  I can think of one construal that, perhaps, would render this possible investment rule as very practical. For example, suppose that practical means, in this instance, that following the rule tends to produce capital gains rather than capital losses.
<p>
After all, to say that something is practical is to say that it works. It's pragmatic. It's effective in a general sense. Assuming that this is what is meant, and assuming that the objective of buying stocks is to generate profits as opposed to losses, how would following the rule have worked out?
<p>
At this point, my thought experiment entered the realm of the subjective and the world of the anecdotal. But let me tell you what crossed my mind as a I passed the U.S. Consulate near Dundas Street.
<p>
I got to thinking about such companies as Coca-Cola and McDonald's. I also thought about Ford and American Express. Since I watch a lot of CNN, Turner Broadcasting entered my consciousness as well. As you can readily imagine, the rule of only buying shares in companies whose products one uses began to look rather practical. Each of these companies has done very well in the stock market, and I own most of them.
<p>
Then, as I made my customary right turn on Richmond Street, I began to think of some of the mistakes that I've made in the stock market. I considered whether following my possible rule would have prevented them. 
<p>
What I came up with was more confirmation that the rule would have been practical. Did I ever personally and directly use the products sold by Lanpar Technologies?  Nope. Did I ever personally and directly use the products sold by Bramalea?  Again, no. But I lost a fair bit of money in these stocks because both companies went bankrupt.
<p>
Now, then, what about some other cases like Canadian Pacific and Nova?  In case you are wondering, I have nice gains in these companies, although they are nowhere near the profits I have in Coca-Cola and American Express. But I have used what Canadian Pacific and Nova offer to the marketplace in only an indirect way.
<p>
For instance, I'm sure that Canadian Pacific has shipped some products that I have used. I'm also confident that some of the products I've bought contained polyethylene, which is one of the compounds manufactured by Nova Corp. On the other hand, I have never picked up the phone and asked the nearest office of Canadian Pacific how late they were open. And I have never been contacted by anyone at Nova trying to sell me a ton of polyethylene.
<p>
Anyway, as I said earlier, my drive to the office each day lasts only ten minutes. But since this is an interesting subject to ponder, I have little doubt that it will come up again for me as I wonder whether I should buy more shares of Petro-Canada, Thomson, or Four Seasons Hotels. The theory will be considered whenever I think about whether I should get out of Archer Daniels Midland, US Surgical, Kmart or Salomon, each of which I own in various amounts. (In all, I own shares in over 50 different companies.)
<p>
What I have called a possible investment rule is quite simplistic - perhaps too simplistic. After all, I've made lots of money in stocks of companies whose products I don't use. And I've lost some money in stocks of companies whose products I do use.	
<p>
But I can tell you this much:  Had I been following that rule, it would have worked most of the time. As a result, I'll continue to think about it. After all, I'm a simple guy.

<h2>The Tax Efficiency of Mutual Funds   May 1996</h2>

<h3>Jack Lumsden - "Canadian MoneySaver",  May 1996</h3><br>

<p>Many investors who buy mutual funds outside of their RRSP tend to overlook one of the key criteria when selecting their funds, namely, the after-tax returns. It is important to look at the after-tax return because that figure is the amount you actually get to keep in your pockets from the investment after the tax has been deducted from the income generated by the fund.

<p>The taxable income generated by a fund is detailed for unitholders in a T3 or T5 slip sent annually to investors by the mutual fund companies. This taxable income can be in the form of cash distributions from the fund, or reinvestment in the fund which purchases additional units.

<p>Since most people want to minimize the amount of tax they pay Revenue Canada, it makes sense to look at the "tax efficiency" of a mutual fund as one of the key selection criteria when choosing your investments. To determine the tax efficiency of a mutual fund, it's necessary to know the after-tax returns for your income bracket as well as the annual return of a particular fund over a designated period of time, so the following formula can be applied:
<br><br><br>
<table  border=0 width=80% align=center>
<tr><th>Your After-Tax Returns</th><th></th><th>Tax Efficiency of the Fund</th>	 
</tr>
<tr><td align=center>---------------------------------</td><td>=</td><th>in your Portfolio</th>
</tr>
<tr><th>The Fund's Annual Returns</th><th></th><th></th>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br><br>
<p>The tax efficiency of a mutual fund will ultimately depend on two factors--the type of fund, and the management style of the fund manager. Both factors should be considered when selecting your investment funds.

<p>The type of fund--bond, balanced or equity--determines the type of income generated. For example, bond funds usually generate interest income, while equity funds generate capital gains, with balanced funds a combination of both.

<p>The capital gains associated with mutual funds come either when a fund is sold for an amount greater than the cost base, or from distributions throughout the year as the fund itself buys and sells securities. Unitholders pay taxes on these capital gains. In addition, unitholders are taxed annually on the interest and dividend income earned by the securities (cash, bonds and stocks) owned within the fund.

<p>The second factor which determines a fund's tax efficiency is the style of the fund manager. A money manager who does a lot of trading will usually generate larger capital gains throughout the year as he/she buys and sells individual securities. The amount of trading can also be described as the turnover of the portfolio, and, for example, a fund with a 100% turnover will have sold on average all of its securities in a given year. This is important to know because, if two managers have the same annual returns, the one with the higher portfolio turnover will generally have a more highly taxable fund than a manager who has a buy-and-hold strategy.

<p>There are different rates of tax payable for different types of income generated by mutual fund investments held outside of your RRSP. The rates for a taxpayer in the top income tax bracket in Ontario ($ 66,653 plus annually) are as follows:

<ul><li>Dividend Income	35.92%
<li>Capital Gains	39.89%
<li>Interest Income	53.19%
</ul>

<p>Using these rates to determine the after-tax returns, let's compare the tax efficiency of a sample of international and Canadian mutual funds for a taxpayer at the top tax rates (see the table below).

<table width=95% border=2>
<caption><strong>Five (5) Year Returns to 01/96</strong></caption><br><br>
<tr>
<th>Category/Mutual Funds</th><th>Compounded Returns</th><th>After-Tax Returns</th><th>Tax Efficiency</th>
</tr>
<tr><td><u>INTERNATIONAL EQUITY</u></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trimark Fund</td><td align=center>22.23%</td><td align=center>20.33%</td><td align=center>91%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Templeton Growth</td><td align=center>18.86%</td><td align=center>16.65%</td><td align=center>89%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Sceptre International</td><td align=center>18.04%</td><td align=center>16.08%</td><td align=center>89%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><u>CANADIAN EQUITY</u></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Altamira Equity</td><td align=center>26.37%</td><td align=center>21.63%</td><td align=center>82%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>AGF Growth Equity</td><td align=center>19.07%</td><td align=center>19.07%</td><td align=center>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Industrial Future</td><td align=center>13.79%</td><td align=center>13.35%</td><td align=center>97%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><u>CANADIAN BALANCED</u></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>ABC Fully Managed</td><td align=center>18.29%</td><td align=center>13.69%</td><td align=center>75%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Dynamic Partners</td><td align=center>16.28%</td><td align=center>13.55%</td><td align=center>83%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Trimark Income & Growth</td><td align=center>14.50%</td><td align=center>11.35%</td><td align=center>78%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br><br>

<P>It's clear from this sample that the most tax-efficient funds are equity funds, followed by balanced funds and finally bond funds. While this may not be a surprise to most people, it underscores the wisdom of considering the after-tax returns when selecting mutual fund investments outside of your RRSP.

<p>For example, an investor who examines only annual returns would think there's a negligible difference between:

<table border=0 width=50%><br><br>
<tr><th align=left>Fund</th><th align=left>Annual Returns</th></tr>
<tr><td>Industrial Future</td><td>13.79% over 5 yrs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Altamira Income</td><td>13.49% over 5 yrs</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<p>The investor might choose the Altamira Income Fund because, as a bond fund, it is likely to be less volatile while delivering an annual return comparable to the Industrial Future Fund, which is an equity fund.

<p>However, an examination of the after-tax returns of these funds reveals the following:

<table border=0 width=50%><br><br>
<tr><th align=left>Fund</th><th align=left>After-Tax Returns</th></tr>
<tr><td>Industrial Future</td><td>13.35% over 5 yrs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Altamira Income</td><td>8.62% over 5 yrs</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<p>This is a difference of 4.73% annually, which represents a considerable amount of money in an investor's pocket. By examining the tax efficiency of various mutual funds, an investor can make an informed decision on which funds suit his individual requirements in terms of returns desired as well as risk. 

<p>The tax efficiency of mutual funds should also be considered when deciding where to place various investments in your overall portfolio. It makes sense to hold the funds which are most tax efficient outside your RRSP, while placing less tax-effective investments inside your RRSP, as the growth within your RRSP is sheltered from taxes. In the above example, the investor would be better off holding the Altamira Income Fund in their RRSP, and the Industrial Future Fund outside of their RRSP. An investor could increase his overall portfolio returns by examining the funds that they hold in and outside of their RRSP, and if required  "swap" the tax-efficient funds inside their RRSP for the highly taxed funds outside of their RRSP.  

<p>Without looking at the tax efficiency of your mutual funds, you may be giving away an extra 1-4% annually to the government in the form of taxes. It may take some work to calculate the tax efficiency of your funds, but a 1% difference in total portfolio returns over a 10-15 year time period can add up to thousands of dollars of increased savings due to lower taxes paid. 
Another important reason to examine the tax efficiency of mutual funds, is that if you are trying to decide between two funds from the same category for investment (ie. bond funds), and both funds have approximately the same long-term annual performance and risk characteristics,  the key selection criteria would then be the tax efficiency of each fund. If Fund A has a tax efficiency of 90% and Fund B 85%, over the long term, Fund A would generate higher after-tax returns.

<p>The tax efficiency calculations can be customized using your individual tax rates, either by doing the calculations manually, or by using one of the various software programs available. For example, I used the Globe HySales program for the above calculations. 

<p>The tax efficiency of a mutual fund is an important feature to know, and should not be ignored.  So the next time you are considering a mutual fund investment outside of your RRSP, be sure to add the tax efficiency of the fund to your list of key selection criteria.

<h2>The New Seniors Benefit</h2>

<h3>Rick Robertson - "Canadian MoneySaver"  May 1996</h3><br>

<p>The Seniors Benefit, proposed in the March 1996, Federal Budget,  is part of the Federal Government's commitment "to ensure [seniors] have a secure and sustainable pension system now and in the future."  

<p>Table 1 provides the Government's 1996 projected expenditures for old age pension benefits. At a total of $21.7 billion, it represents almost 20% of the Federal Government's program spending of $109 billion. Given Canada's aging population, it is likely that without some curtailment of benefits, an even greater strain would be put on the Government's resources in the future. The resulting budget proposal is a more specifically targeted income maintenance program for Canada's senior citizens.

<p><small>Source:  The Seniors Benefit, March 1996</small>

<p>The Seniors Benefit programme will become effective in 2001. Individuals who were 60 years of age or older on December 31, 1995 will have the option of receiving benefits under the current system or electing to receive benefits under the proposed Seniors Benefit. 
Individuals who were not yet 60 at the end of 1995 will automatically fall under the new proposals. There is no need for an individual to make any decision regarding which system they wish to receive benefits under until just prior to the introduction of the new system.

<h4><u>Current System</u></h4>

<p>Prior to analyzing the proposals, it is worthwhile to consider the current system of benefits and tax credits available to seniors. After all, this is the system seniors will benefit from until 2001.
<dl>
<dt><strong>OAS:</strong></dt><dd>Taxable payment of $4,760 per year. The payment is clawed back at a rate of 15% when a senior's income exceeds $53,215. Therefore, a senior with income in excess of $85,000 loses all of their OAS benefit. Because the clawback is applied on an individual basis, both spouses can earn up to $53,215 before having any of the OAS clawed back.</dd>

<dt><strong>GIS:</strong></dt><dd>An additional payment to seniors with very low income. The maximum GIS payment for a single senior is $5,660 and is reduced by 50 cents for every dollar of income from sources other than OAS. An individual receiving no income other than the maximum CPP benefit of $8,725 would receive less than $1,300 of GIS. A couple, in which both spouses receive OAS, will be entitled to a maximum GIS payment of approximately $7,400. This benefit is reduced by 50% for each dollar of other income received by the couple.</dd>

<dt><strong>SA:</strong></dt><dd>A payment to individuals age 60 - 64 who are widowed or spouses of OAS recipients. The payment is equal to what would be received under the OAS and GIS.</dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>Age Credit:</strong></dt><dd>An income tax credit with a base of $3,482. The base is reduced at a rate of 15% of an individual's income in excess of $25,921. As a result, the tax credit is completely lost when income exceeds $49,134. The after-tax value of the credit is approximately $940 [$3,482 x 27%] for an individual who is able to take full advantage of it.</dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>Pension Credit:</strong></dt><dd>An income tax credit equal to the lesser of $1,000 and the amount of pension income (excludes CPP). The after-tax value of the credit is approximately $270.</dd>
</dl><br><br>

<h4><u>Proposed System</u></h4>
<p>The proposed system for providing benefits to seniors will result in the elimination of both the age credit and the pension credit beginning in 2001. The OAS, GIS and SA will be combined into one benefit that is to be known as the Seniors Benefit. The Seniors Benefit will not be included in an individual's income for tax purposes and is being described as a tax-free benefit. Despite the tax-free nature of the benefit, a senior's entitlement to it will decrease as his/her income increases. It is expected that in 2001, a single senior will be entitled to a maximum benefit of $11,420. The benefit will be reduced by 50 cents for each dollar of income until the senior's income reaches $12,520. At this point, the senior will be receiving a benefit of $5,160 which is the estimated value of the OAS payment in 2001, when adjusted for inflation. When income is between $12,520 and $25,921, the single senior will continue to receive $5,160. When income exceeds $25,921, the benefit is reduced by 20 cents for each additional dollar of income. A single senior whose income exceeds $52,000 will receive nothing under the proposals. Column 2 of Table 2 provides an indication of the projected amount of the Seniors Benefit for a single senior at varying levels of other income.

<tr><td colspan=5><small>* Assumes that an individual begins to pay tax on OAS when other income exceeds $10,000</small></td></tr>
</table>


<p>In the case of senior couples, the maximum benefit will be $18,440. The payment of any benefit will be split equally between spouses. Again, the benefit will be reduced by 50 cents of  the couple's income until the benefit is reduced to $10,320, an amount equal to OAS payments for two individuals.  With combined income in the range of $16,160 to  $25,921 the couple will receive a combined Seniors Benefit of $10,320. Once the couple's income exceeds $25,921, the Seniors Benefit is reduced by 20 cents for every additional dollar of income. When the couple's combined income exceeds $77,500, they will have lost all entitlements under the Seniors Benefit. The fourth column of Table 2 provides an estimate of payments for a couple under the Seniors Program.

<h4><u>Winners and Losers</u></h4>
<p>Columns 3 and 5 of Table 2 provide an estimate of the after-tax benefit a single senior and a senior couple would receive in 2001 under our current OAS/GIS system. The numbers are approximate because of the need to estimate marginal income tax rates. A comparison between the benefits under the current and the proposed system indicates that seniors with low or modest incomes will receive a small benefit under the proposals. Upper income seniors will lose entitlements, particularly upper income senior couples who have similar incomes. This outcome is the result of the clawback of the Seniors Benefit beginning at a much lower income level than the OAS clawback. Currently, an individual does not start to have their OAS payment clawed back until income reaches $53,215. In the case of a couple, each can have income of up to $53,215 before they encounter the clawback. By beginning to clawback the portion of the Seniors Benefit that is equivalent to the OAS when the couples combined income reaches $25,921, the government has removed one of the advantages of income splitting for senior couples.

<h4><u>Reminder</u></h4>
<p>It is important to remember that the Seniors Benefit is not to begin until 2001, the beginning of the next millennium. Anyone 60 or over on December 31, 1995 will have a choice of whether they receive benefits under the new system or elect to receive benefits under the current OAS/GIS system for the remainder of their life. Clearly high income seniors, who were at least 60 on December 31, 1995, will elect to continue to receive benefits under the current OAS/GIS system. There is no need to make a choice until the later half of the year 2000.

<h2>Court Decisions Benefit Taxpayers!</h2>

<h3>Jeff Meyers - "Canadian MoneySaver"  June 1996</h3><br>


<p>Two recent court decisions may benefit many taxpayers who are currently battling Revenue Canada over interest expense deductions on investments that declined in value or losses incurred on rental properties.

<h4><u>I.  THE TENNANT DECISION</u></h4>
<p>In Tennant, the taxpayer obtained a bank loan for $1 million to buy shares of ACo. Four years later, the shares were essentially worthless. The taxpayer sold these shares to BCo, taking back as consideration treasury shares of BCo with a fair value of $1,000. The taxpayer continued to deduct interest expense on his $1 million loan. Revenue Canada reassessed him, allowing an interest deduction on $1,000, or .1%, of the original loan.

<p>In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of the taxpayer.

<p>The Court stated, "As long as the taxpayer established a link between the current shares, the proceeds of disposition of the original shares, and the money that was borrowed to acquire the original eligible use property (the taxpayer can) continue to deduct the interest payment for the full amount of the original loan, regardless of the value or cost of the newly acquired shares."

<h4><u>What It Means</u></h4>
<p>It is important to note that the Court is not saying you must buy shares and continue to hold shares in order to deduct interest on the original loan. It is saying that if you borrow to buy an income-producing property that declines in value, and that property is exchanged in full for another income-producing property or properties, then interest can continue to be deducted on the original loan.

<p>For example, say you borrow $10,000 to buy shares of TaxCo. The value of TaxCo shares declines to $8,000. You instruct your broker to sell and immediately move the entire proceeds into Government of Canada bonds. Based on the Court's decision, you can still deduct interest on the original $10,000 loan. Furthermore, if the value of the bonds declines, to say $7,500, you can sell out, move the entire proceeds back into shares, and still deduct interest on the original $10,000 loan!  However, if you were to take $5,000 of the $7,500 and keep it for personal use, you would lose most of your interest deduction.

<h4><u>Views of the Court</u></h4>
<p>Among the reasons the Court gave in arriving at its decision was the effect Revenue Canada's position could have on the investment climate in this country. The Court saw Revenue's approach as potentially scaring off many people from making certain investments. Under Revenue's approach, if the investments went down in value, one would still be liable for the original loan while only obtaining a partial interest deduction. This was unacceptable to the Court.

<p>The Court also raised a "what if" scenario, that being, what if the original investment increased in value and the proceeds were reinvested in another income-producing property?  Would a taxpayer be able to claim an interest expense deduction for more than he was actually paying?  Of course not.

<h4><u>II.  THE TONN DECISION</u></h4>
<p>In Tonn, the taxpayers purchased a residential rental property. The purchase was almost entirely financed through a mortgage. The taxpayers reported significant rental losses in the first three years subsequent to the purchase. Revenue Canada denied the taxpayers' losses on the basis that they had no reasonable expectation of profit from the rental property.

<p>The taxpayers lost their case in the Tax Court of Canada. They then went to the Federal Court of Appeal requesting a judicial review of the Tax Court's decision. The taxpayers were successful.

<h4><u>Views of the Court</u></h4>
<p>The Federal Court of Appeal, in reaching its decision, stated that, "The tax system . . . should not discourage, or penalize, honest but erroneous business decisions. The tax system does not tax on the basis of a taxpayer's business acumen, with deductions extended to the wise and withheld from the foolish."  The Court also commented that, "It is not for the Department (or the Court) to penalize them for this, using the reasonable expectation of profit test, without giving the enterprise a reasonable length of time to prove itself capable of yielding profits."

<h4><u>Can it Work for You?</u></h4>
<p>There were a couple of other important factors considered by the Court in reaching its decision. One was that there was no personal use of the property by the taxpayers. It was clearly an investment property. Furthermore, the taxpayers took steps to reduce their debt on the property that would eventually reduce the related interest costs that would be deducted for tax purposes.

<h4><u>Conclusion</u></h4>
<p>Taxpayers who find themselves in the same situation as either Tennant or Tonn now have a strong weapon in these court decisions to keep their tax deductions. If you're in one of these situations, you should contact your professional advisor immediately to determine how they can work for you.

<H2>Estate Preservation: Disinheriting Revenue Canada
The Ins, Outs and Whys of Estate Planning</H2>

<h3>Brian Quinlan - "Canadian MoneySaver" June 1996</h3>
<br>
<h4><u>What is estate planning and why should it be carried out?</u></h4>
<p>Estate planning is a component of financial planning. It focuses on minimizing the work and difficulties faced by executors while maximizing wealth passed to heirs.

<h4><u>Wealth maximization/tax minimization</u></h4>
<p>The first step of an estate plan requires you to decide on the estate's purpose. Who are the beneficiaries--what family and non-family members, what charities? Should your estate be dispersed to beneficiaries on death or should it carry on?  Are funds to be kept aside for a specific purpose, eg. a grandchild's education? Are there assets you wish to be shared after death such as the family cottage?

<p>Once the estate's objectives are determined, a plan is designed and enacted to ensure the objectives are reached. Here, it is vital to assess the income tax consequences. For income tax purposes, you are considered to have sold all your property at the time of your death. An exception is available when property is willed to a spouse. However, the issue will arise on the death of the second spouse.

<p>The "sale" proceeds are deemed equal in value to the respective property at your death. The excess of proceeds over the cost is a capital gain of which 75% is taxed. If part of your property includes rental properties there may also be "recapture" of prior year tax depreciation claims. This is fully taxed at death.

<p>Remember, this tax must be funded from other sources. As a "sale" occurred for tax purposes, only you do not receive any cash to pay the tax. In the worse case the estate is forced to sell a property to pay its tax. This may work against your wishes if you want to keep the cottage in the family.

<p>The value of your RRSPs and RRIFs at the time of death are subject to tax too!  While here you can have access to cash by having the estate liquidate the holdings, the estate value to be passed on to your heirs may be dramatically reduced. 

<p>Without planning, you can have a significant tax liability on death. As death and death taxes occur at the same time you can easily find yourself being taxed in the top tax bracket. Here, about 50% of your estate can go to Revenue Canada.

<p>An effective estate plan will work to eliminate, defer and/or minimize taxes to the extent possible. This plan will involve a lawyer, accountant and a financial planner experienced in both the insurance and investment fields.

<h4><u>Live rich, die poor</u></h4>
<p>One way to avoid any taxes on death would be to rid yourself of all assets (including RRSPs and RRIFs) before you die. However, your estate plan must permit you to live comfortably until your death and have access to the assets you enjoy--again I mention, the family cottage. You want to ensure that you have sufficient funds to permit you to enjoy life to the extent you desire. You don't want to get involved with the children's squabbles over your property and you do not want to face a significant tax liability now. What to do?

<h4><u>Estate planning tools<br>
Early inheritances to children/grandchildren</u></h4>

<p>If an objective of your estate is to pass property to children, why not do it now?  The kids may prefer the money now rather than later--especially if they have a mortgage. Where cash is given to an adult child there are no income tax implications to you--regardless of how the money is used. If you liquidate a portfolio of securities you may incur capital gains which are taxed in the year of liquidation. However, this tax may be less than it will be on your death, plus you have the cash to pay the tax. Moreover, your current tax rate may be substantially lower than your tax rate in the year of death.

<p>Consider opening an investment account in trust for your grandchild. Any interest or dividends continue to be taxed in your hands but any capital gains are taxed in the grandchild's hands. A great way to provide for a grandchild's education plus reduce your current tax load.

<h4><u>Family trusts</u></h4>
<p>A family trust is used where a parent (or grandparent) desires to avoid family squabbles or is not at ease with providing children with money now for fear it will be not be used in an appropriate manner or fear the wrath of provincial family law acts.

<p>A cottage can be transferred to a family trust. The parents become trustees of the trust and, therefore, control the use of the property on behalf of the beneficiaries (the kids). The trust permits the parents to continue the use of the cottage until their deaths. The win? The cottage is no longer owned by the parents. On death, it does not form part of their estate. The cost? The transfer of the cottage to a trust could trigger an income tax liability. 
<p>This liability may not be too significant compared to the future tax liability and tax rate at death. Furthermore, the principal residence exemption coupled with the 1994 $100,000 capital gains exemption election (file late if you missed it) may cut this tax dramatically.

<p>Rather than giving funds to children, make a loan!  The loan can be forgivable on your death. During your lifetime this offers you some control as you can "call" the loan. The loan can be interest free if used by your children to pay down a mortgage. (The income tax attribution rules may come into play if your child uses an interest-free or low-interest loan for investment purposes.)  If you want to be really careful, you can register the loan as a mortgage against the child's home.

<h4><u>RRSP/RRIF meltdown</u></h4>
<p>This idea comes from Ian Jarvis of Investors Group in Scarborough. Ian comments that a prime candidate is an individual with a large RRSP or RRIF who is concerned with a significant tax liability to be faced on death. Ian is quick to comment that the plan is not for everyone as there is investment risk involved.

<p>Say the individual has a $200,000 RRSP/RRIF and a ten-year time horizon. For simplicity let's assume a constant interest rate of 10%. Ian recommends the following:
<ul>
<li>Borrow $200,000 and invest it. As the purpose of the loan was investment, the interest on the loan is tax deductible.
<li>Withdraw $20,000 from your RRSP each year. (Some tax will be withheld on the withdrawal. This will be refunded when your return is filed.)
<li>Use the $20,000 from the RRSP withdrawal to pay the interest cost on the loan.  
</ul>
<p>The result: the yearly RRSP/RRIF withdrawals are tax free as they are offset by the interest expense deduction. It may appear that at the end of the ten years the RRSP/RRIF has been removed completely tax free. However, this assumes no growth in the RRSP/RRIF during the meltdown period - quite unrealistic. To counter this, the RRSP withdrawals are increased, which means your loan interest must be higher to offset the increased RRSP/RRIF withdrawal. In a recent situation Ian was involved in, the loan was 2 1/2 times the RRSP.

<p>Investing outside an RRSP removes the constraints of investing inside your RRSP. Full international investing is available. As well, you can take advantage of capital gains being taxed on only 75% of the gain and as well, when applicable, the dividend tax credit.

<p>In the end, you have a $200,000 (or greater) loan outstanding that can be paid off by liquidating the portfolio built up on the borrowed funds. What you have left is the after-tax growth of the portfolio from the original $200,000 (or greater) invested.

<p>Ian points out the risk--the portfolio funded by the loan must "really work for you". The return must be great enough to ensure the after-tax return on the portfolio is greater than the tax that would have been paid on the RRSP/RRIF on death.

<p>Ian also points out that tax-free RRSP/RRIF withdrawals are available to individuals who have significant tax write-offs in excess of their income. For example, an investor in a real estate project may already be incurring significant interest expense in excess of pension and investment income. Here an RRSP / RRIF withdrawal can be made to offset this deduction. In effect, the tax deduction is not being "wasted".

<p>In the December 1995 edition of "MoneySaver", Angelo Vicere provides other ideas in his article, "Tax-Effective Withdrawal Strategies for Your RRSP or RRIF". 

<h4><u>Estate "freeze"</u></h4>
<p>As your estate grows so does the tax liability. An estate plan must encompass a way to stop this growth accruing in your hands. This is accomplished by exchanging a "growth asset" for a "non-growth" asset. This will "freeze" the growth in your hands and the tax liability. The growth after the time of the freeze accrues to someone else--your heir(s). As the growth is frozen so is the tax liability. This liability can then be estimated and steps taken to plan for it. Often life insurance will be purchased. On death the insurance proceeds are used to pay the tax liability--the estate remains intact.

<p>A portfolio of growth investments can be transferred to a corporation on a tax-free basis. In return you receive preferred shares of the corporation. The preferred shares are non-growth and can provide you with the flexibility to receive periodic dividends, to have the shares redeemed and for you to continue to control the investment decisions. Your heirs, perhaps your children, would subscribe for the common shares (or the "growth shares") for a nominal amount, say $100. The future growth of the investment portfolio will accrue to the common shares and will be taxed in your heir's hands when they sell or are deemed to sell the shares on their death.

<p>An estate freeze is a common technique used by family businesses. It is often coupled with passing the business to a second generation. The common shares, again the growth asset, owned by the parents, are exchanged on a tax-free basis for preferred shares. New common shares are purchased by the sons and daughters of the second generation. The parents' tax liability is frozen and steps are undertaken to provide the funds to pay this liability at death. The preferred shares are inherited by the children who become the sole owners of the business. The procedure repeats itself when time comes to pass the business to a third generation.

<h4><u>Charitable bequests</u></h4>
<p>There are a number of ways one can leave funds to a charity. Many of these ideas provide a tax break during your lifetime as well as at death. Contact the "planned giving" department of your favourite charity.

<h4><u>U.S. Assets</u></h4>

<p>In designing an estate plan, U.S. assets cannot be forgotten. Many are under the impression that recent changes to the US/Canada Tax Treaty have made U.S. estate taxes a moot point. While the changes to U.S. estate taxes are welcome to all Canadians, the taxes cannot be ignored. The changes are favourable and will never result in a taxpayer being in a worse tax position than previously. The new rules have different impacts on different taxpayers. For example, U.S. estates of less than US$1,200,000 will not have a U.S. estate tax if the estate is made up of U.S. securities. However, ownership of U.S. real estate remains subject to tax. Taxpayers with U.S. non-real estate greater than US$1,200,000 and owners of U.S. real estate must still consider the alternatives to reduce their US estate tax exposure.

<h4><u>Your will</u></h4>
<p>This is one of the last steps in an estate plan. After you have decided on your estate's objectives and design and have begun to enact a plan, your will needs to be prepared (or amended). Like all financial planning estate planning is continuous and needs periodic revisions and changes, as does your will.
